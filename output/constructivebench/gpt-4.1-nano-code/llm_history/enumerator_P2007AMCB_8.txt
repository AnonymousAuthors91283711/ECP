This problem appears to involve finding an exact rational value related to parameters \(T, N, c_1, c_2, c_3\) with certain constraints, likely aiming to prove or compute an expression involving these variables. Since the problem is to enumerate possible answers to assist with a conjecture and the statement has symmetry among \(c_1, c_2, c_3\), the key is to parametrize small feasible ranges for these variables, especially focusing on the constraints:

- \(0 < N < T\)
- \(c_1 + c_2 + c_3 = T\)
- \(T - N = 2 \times\) sum of the differences \((c_i - N)\)

Given the constraints, the core relation simplifies to:

\[
T - N = 2 \left[(c_1 - N) + (c_2 - N) + (c_3 - N)\right]
\]

which expands to:

\[
T - N = 2(c_1 + c_2 + c_3 - 3N) = 2(T - 3N)
\]

Rearranged, this becomes:

\[
T - N = 2(T - 3N)
\]

leading to:

\[
T - N = 2T - 6N
\]
\[
0 = T - 5N
\]

or equivalently,

\[
T = 5N
\]

Thus, the relation reduces to \(T = 5N\). Because \(N < T = 5N\), the inequalities reduce to \(N > 0\), which is fine, and \(T = 5N\). For the sum \(c_1 + c_2 + c_3 = T = 5N\). To enumerate feasible solutions, pick small integers for \(N\), then all triplets \(c_1, c_2, c_3\) summing to \(5N\), with \(c_i \ge 0\).

The key is to generate all \(c_1, c_2, c_3\) with sum \(5N\), and verify the original conditions, then compute the ratio \(\frac{T}{N} = 5\),

which is constant. Still, to help conjecture, I'll enumerate sample solutions for small \(N\), demonstrating possible \(c_i\):

- For \(N=1\), \(T=5\), triplets summing to 5
- For \(N=2\), \(T=10\), triplets summing to 10
- For \(N=3\), \(T=15\), triplets summing to 15

Output possible solutions for small \(N\), with the ratio always 5, and print the ratio for each.

```python
# Enumerate small N, compute T=5N, then generate all c1, c2, c3 with sum T
# Verify constraints and print solutions with the ratio T/N = 5

from itertools import combinations_with_replacement

for N in range(1, 4):  # small sample N
    T = 5 * N
    print(f"Sample N={N}, T={T}")
    solutions = []
    # Generate all non-negative integer triplets summing to T
    for c1 in range(T + 1):
        for c2 in range(T - c1 + 1):
            c3 = T - c1 - c2
            if c3 >= 0:
                # Check original constraints:
                # N > 0 (true), T > N (true), c_i >= 0 (true)
                # and T - N = 2 * sum(c_i - N)
                sum_c_minus_N = (c1 - N) + (c2 - N) + (c3 - N)
                # The relation T - N == 2 * sum_c_minus_N is already confirmed since T=5N
                # Confirm:
                if T - N == 2 * sum_c_minus_N:
                    print(f"c1={c1}, c2={c2}, c3={c3}, ratio={T/N}")
```
