The problem involves computing the probability that for outcomes (s, t) where s ∈ ΩS = {1,2,3,4} and t ∈ ΩT = {1,2,3,4,5,6}, s > t. The goal is to enumerate all such pairs, count how many satisfy s > t, and then find the probability.

We'll construct all pairs, filter those where s > t, count them, and divide by total pairs to get the probability.

Because the exact answer is not given, we will print all candidate counts and the resulting probability explicitly, for small sets.

```python
# Enumerate all outcomes
Omega_S = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Omega_T = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

total_pairs = len(Omega_S) * len(Omega_T)
count_s_gt_t = 0

for s in Omega_S:
    for t in Omega_T:
        if s > t:
            print(f"Outcome where s={s}, t={t} satisfies s > t")
            count_s_gt_t += 1

probability = count_s_gt_t / total_pairs
print(f"Total outcomes: {total_pairs}")
print(f"Number where s > t: {count_s_gt_t}")
print(f"Probability s > t: {probability}")
```
