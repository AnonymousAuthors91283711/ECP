  IsLeast {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ (2 : ℝ) / 2^n < (0.1 : ℝ)} olympiadbench2925_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 5. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the enumeration with the answer 5, and the inequality \(\frac{2}{2^n} < 0.1\), the minimal \(n\) satisfying the inequality is \(n=5\). The inequality simplifies as \(2 / 2^n < 0.1\) ⇒ \(2^{1-n} < 0.1\). The smallest \(n\) for which this holds is \(n=5\).
