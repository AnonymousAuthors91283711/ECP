Proposed Answer: {x : ℝ | (Real.exp (x * log 2) = Real.exp (x^2 * log 2) ∧ Real.exp (x^2 * log 2) = Real.exp (x^3 * log 2))}
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem is asking for the set of real numbers x that satisfy:
1. exp(x*log2) + exp(x³*log2) = 2*exp(x²*log2)
2. AND either exp(x*log2) ≠ exp(x²*log2) OR exp(x²*log2) ≠ exp(x³*log2)

The ground truth answer is the empty set ∅, meaning no real x satisfies both conditions.

The proposed answer is the set where:
exp(x*log2) = exp(x²*log2) AND exp(x²*log2) = exp(x³*log2)

But this is exactly the negation of the second condition in the original problem (which requires at least one of these equalities to fail). 

Moreover, if x satisfies the proposed answer's condition, then the first condition becomes:
exp(x*log2) + exp(x*log2) = 2*exp(x*log2) ⇒ 2*exp(x*log2) = 2*exp(x*log2)
which is always true, but this would contradict the second condition of the original problem.

Therefore, the proposed answer describes a set that cannot satisfy the original conditions, and the ground truth answer correctly states that no such x exists. The answers are not equivalent.
