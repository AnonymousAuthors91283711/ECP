The problem appears to involve defining a function `omnimath3401_answer` that maps a real number \( p \) within the interval \([0, 100]\) to some corresponding value \( q \), such that the set \(\{q | q = 100 - p \land 0 \leq q \land q \leq 100\}\) matches \(\{omnimath3401_answer p\}\). This suggests that the answer is likely the simple transformation \( q = 100 - p \), which always satisfies the bounds when \( p \in [0, 100] \).

My approach is to create a Python script that demonstrates the explicit enumeration of \( p \) and corresponding \( q \) values for sample points, verifying the logical relationship. The script will output the results immediately upon computation to assist in formulating the proof.

```python
# Enumerate sample values of p in [0, 100] to verify the relationship q = 100 - p
# For each p, compute q, verify q in [0, 100], and print

def enumerate_values():
    for p in range(0, 101, 10):  # sample p from 0 to 100 in steps of 10
        q = 100 - p
        # verify q is within bounds
        if 0 <= q <= 100:
            print(f'p = {p}, q = {q}')
        else:
            print(f'p = {p}, q = {q} (out of bounds)')

enumerate_values()
```
