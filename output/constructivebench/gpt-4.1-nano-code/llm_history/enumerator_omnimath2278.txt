[write_program]
This appears to be a formal theorem statement in Lean, involving natural numbers and specific set equalities. The problem relates to finding quadruples (a, b, c, d) satisfying certain sums that produce the set {40, 70, 100} after certain combinations. The sequence appears to involve inequalities and set equalities.

To assist with conjecturing and proving the set of solutions, I'll write a Python program that enumerates candidate (a, b, c, d) tuples with small values, respecting the inequalities: a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d, and checks whether the set of sums {a*b + c*d, a*c + b*d, a*d + b*c} equals {40, 70, 100}.

The enumeration will:
- Loop over small ranges for a, b, c, d.
- Check the inequalities.
- Calculate the three sums.
- Verify if they match the target set.
- Print each valid quadruple when found.

This approach maximizes efficiency by pruning and limiting search space, and it streams answers to assist with modeling the problem.

```python
# Enumerate small candidate quadruples that satisfy inequalities and match the target set
target_set = {40, 70, 100}
max_value = 20  # limiting search for practicality

for a in range(1, max_value + 1):
    for b in range(a, max_value + 1):
        for c in range(b, max_value + 1):
            for d in range(c, max_value + 1):
                sums = {
                    a * b + c * d,
                    a * c + b * d,
                    a * d + b * c
                }
                if sums == target_set:
                    print(f"Found quadruple: (a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d})")
```
