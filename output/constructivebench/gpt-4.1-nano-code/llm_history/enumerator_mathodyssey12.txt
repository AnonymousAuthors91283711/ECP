The problem appears to involve perfect numbers and their properties. Specifically, the definition involves the sum over divisors, which relates to perfect numbers where the sum of proper divisors equals the number itself.

The theorem states that for positive integers `n`, the natural numbers `n-1` and `n(n+1)/2` are both perfect if and only if `n` equals some value, which we need to approximate or find.

To assist in conjecturing, we will enumerate small positive integers `n`, check whether `n-1` and `n(n+1)/2` are perfect, and output the candidates that satisfy the conditions. Since perfect numbers are very rare, this enumeration will likely find minimal cases quickly. 

In our code, we will:
- Use a simple helper to check if a number is perfect  with a known divisor sum.
- Enumerate small `n` up to a small threshold.
- For each `n`, check whether both `n-1` and `n(n+1)/2` are perfect.
- Print candidates that satisfy the property.

This will help in deducing the value of `mathodyssey12_answer`, identified as the `n` that makes both numbers perfect.

```python
def is_perfect(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    divisor_sum = 1  # 1 is always a divisor
    for d in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % d == 0:
            divisor_sum += d
            other = n // d
            if other != d:
                divisor_sum += other
    return divisor_sum == n

# Enumerate small n to search for the satisfying condition
max_n = 30
for n in range(2, max_n + 1):
    candidate1 = n - 1
    candidate2 = n * (n + 1) // 2
    if is_perfect(candidate1) and is_perfect(candidate2):
        print(f"n={n}: {candidate1} and {candidate2} are perfect")
```
