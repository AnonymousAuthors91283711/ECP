This problem asks to find the greatest natural number n > 0 such that n^200 < 3^500. To approach this, we'll estimate n by solving n^200 < 3^500 ⇒ n < (3^500)^(1/200) = 3^{500/200} = 3^{2.5} = 3^{5/2}. Since 3^{5/2} = 3^{2 + 1/2} = 3^2 * 3^{1/2} = 9 * sqrt(3) ≈ 9 * 1.732 = 15.588...

Thus, the greatest integer n satisfying n^200 < 3^500 should be at most 15. We will check integers around this value to find the maximum n satisfying the inequality. We will verify n=15 and n=16 to see which satisfies the inequality:

- For n=15:
  15^200 < 3^500?
- For n=16:
  16^200 < 3^500?

We will perform these checks directly using Python integer arithmetic for exact comparison.

```python
# Since the upper estimate is approximately 15.588, check n=15 and n=16
# Find the largest n where n^200 < 3^500

import math

def check(n):
    return n ** 200 < 3 ** 500

# Check n=15
result_15 = check(15)
print(15 if result_15 else "15: does not satisfy")

# Check n=16
result_16 = check(16)
print(16 if result_16 else "16: does not satisfy")
```

This code directly tests the candidate values. The maximum n satisfying the inequality is the highest one for which `check(n)` is True.
