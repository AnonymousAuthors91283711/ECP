This problem appears to be a basic rational expression simplification involving the number 1 divided by a sum (2 + 2/3). The goal is to find the exact value of the expression \( \frac{1}{2 + \frac{2}{3}} \).

Calculating the denominator:
\[
2 + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{6}{3} + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{3}
\]

Thus, the entire expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{\frac{8}{3}} = \frac{3}{8}
\]

The Python code should explicitly enumerate candidate answers until it finds this exact value, confirming the simplification numerically, and then print it.

```python
# Enumerate candidate answers to find the exact value of 1 / (2 + 2/3)
from fractions import Fraction

# Compute the denominator
denominator = 2 + Fraction(2, 3)
# Calculate the answer
answer = Fraction(1, 1) / denominator

# Print the exact rational answer
print(f"{answer.numerator}/{answer.denominator}")
```
