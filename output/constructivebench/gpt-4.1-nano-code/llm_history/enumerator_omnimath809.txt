This problem appears to involve a function \(f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}\) with a particular additive property for positive integers \(a, b, n\), where \(a + b = 2^n\). Specifically, the property states: if \(a, b, n > 0\) and \(a + b = 2^n\), then \(f(a) + f(b) = n^2\).

Our goal is to conjecture the value of \(f(2002)\) based on this property. Since the problem looks like an additive functional equation with exponential constraints, we can explore small values for \(a, b, n\) where the sum of \(a + b\) is a power of two, and examine the results to find a pattern or potential formula.

Let's consider small cases:
- For \(a, b\) such that \(a + b = 2^n\):
  
  For example:
  - \(a = 1, b = 1, n=1\): \(a + b = 2\), so \(f(1) + f(1) = 1^2 = 1\). Thus, \(2f(1) = 1 \Rightarrow f(1) = 0.5\).
  
  - \(a=1, b=3, n=2\): \(a + b=4\), so \(f(1) + f(3)= 2^2=4\). Since \(f(1)=0.5\), then \(f(3)=3.5\).
  
  - \(a=2, b=2, n=2\): \(a+b=4\), so \(f(2)+f(2)=4\Rightarrow 2f(2)=4\Rightarrow f(2)=2\).

Testing some values:
- \(f(1)=0.5\)
- \(f(2)=2\)
- \(f(3)=3.5\)

Let's check if \(f(n)\) might be linear in \(n\) or related to powers of 2.

In these small samples:
- \(f(1)=0.5= \frac{1}{2}\)
- \(f(2)=2=2\)
- \(f(3)=3.5= \frac{7}{2}\)

Try to see if \(f(n)\) correlates with something like \(f(n)=\frac{n^2}{2^{n-1}}\) or similar.

Alternatively, from the original functional equation, perhaps \(f(a)=a \cdot c\) for some constant \(c\). Let's test if that fits.

Suppose \(f(a)=k a\), then for \(a, b\) with \(a + b=2^n\):

\[
f(a)+f(b)=k a + k b = k (a + b) = k 2^n
\]
But the property says:

\[
f(a)+f(b)= n^2
\]
So,

\[
k 2^n = n^2 \Rightarrow k = \frac{n^2}{2^n}
\]

But this depends on \(n\), not just \(a\). So assuming linearity in \(a\) is incompatible unless \(f(a)\) depends on \(a\) explicitly.

Alternatively, observe the pattern in the small data:
- For \(a=1, b=1, n=1\): \(f(1)+f(1)=1\). With \(f(1)=0.5\).
- For \(a=2, b=2, n=2\): sum=4, \(f(2)+f(2)=4\), so \(f(2)=2\).
- For \(a=1, b=3, n=2\): sum=4, \(f(1)+f(3)=4\) with \(f(1)=0.5\), so \(f(3)=3.5\).
  
Check if \(f\) resembles \(f(a)=a/2\) for small \(a\)?

- \(f(1)=0.5 = 1/2\)
- \(f(2)=2\) (then \(2 \ne 2/2=1\)), no.
- \(f(3)=3.5\) (which does not match \(3/2=1.5\))
  
Suppose \(f(n) = \frac{(n)^2}{2^{n-1}}\). Check:
- \(n=1\): \(1^2/2^{0}=1/1=1\) but we have \(f(1)=0.5\). So no.
  
Alternatively, try \(f(n)=\frac{n}{2}\):

- \(f(1)=0.5\), matches.
- \(f(2)=1\neq 2\), no.
- \(f(3)=1.5\neq 3.5\).

Between these attempts, observe that the initial data suggests a pattern similar to a quadratic divided by a power of 2:

Try \(f(n)=\frac{n^2}{2^{n-1}}\):

- \(n=1\): \(1/1=1\), but observed is 0.5, so no.
- \(n=2\): \(4/2=2\), matches.

Close; maybe the pattern is:

\[
f(n)=\frac{n^2}{2^{n-1}} \times \frac{1}{2}
= \frac{n^2}{2^n}
\]

Check for \(n=1\):

\[
f(1)=1^2/2^1=1/2=0.5
\]
which matches observed \(f(1)=0.5\).

For \(n=2\):

\[
f(2)=4/4=1 \neq 2
\]

No, but earlier, we had \(f(2)=2\). Contradicts.

Given the data, suffices to approximate \(f(n)\) for small \(n\):

- \(f(1)=0.5\)
- \(f(2)=2\)
- \(f(3)=3.5\)

Between these, roughly \(f(n)\) exceeds \(n/2\), roughly increases faster.

To proceed, we can test the problem with the known data and attempt to find \(f(2002)\) by assuming it follows a pattern inspired by these might be \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\):

Suppose the pattern is \(f(n) = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}\), similar to triangular numbers, but the small data doesnâ€™t match this directly.

Another approach is to look for a constant "rule".

Alternatively, since the property links \(a + b=2^n\), and \(f(a)+f(b)=n^2\), perhaps the key is to think in terms of small data:

- For \(a=b=2^{n-1}\): sum is \(2^n\), \(f(2^{n-1})+f(2^{n-1})= n^2 \Rightarrow 2f(2^{n-1})=n^2 \Rightarrow f(2^{n-1})= \frac{n^2}{2}\).

For \(n=1\), \(a=b=1\): \(f(1)=1^2/2=0.5\), consistent.

For \(n=2\), \(a=b=2\):

\[
f(2)=\frac{4}{2}=2
\]
which matches earlier.

Similarly, for \(n=3\):

\[
a=b=4, \quad f(4)=\frac{9}{2}=4.5
\]

Test for \(a=1, b=3\), sum=4, \(n=2\), so:

\[
f(1)+f(3)=4
\]

Suppose \(f(3)=a\), \(f(1)=0.5\):

\[
0.5 + a=4 \Rightarrow a=3.5
\]

Not matching \(f(3)\) from previous hypotheses.

Assuming that \(f\left(2^{n-1}\right)= \frac{n^2}{2}\), for other \(a,b\) with sum \(2^{n}\), they are not necessarily powers of two, making the pattern complex.

Enough conjecture: we'll pick small \(a\) near \(2002\), and search for various pairs satisfying \(a+b=2^{n}\). To get \(a \approx 2002\), try \(a=2002\), then \(b=2^{n}-2002\).

We can compute \(f(a) + f(b)=n^2\) for various \(n\)'s to see if \(f(2002)\) can be found.

Suppose for some \(n\):

\[
b=2^{n}-2002
\]

and

\[
f(2002)+f(b)=n^2
\]

If we can approximate \(f(b)\) for small \(b\)'s, or estimate that \(f(b) \approx \frac{b^2}{2^{b}}\) for small \(b\), we could solve for \(f(2002)\).

Given the ambiguity, we choose small concrete values of \(n\) to attempt to estimate \(f(2002)\).

Alternatively, for computational enumeration, pick some \(n\):

- For \(n=11\):

  \(2^{11}=2048\)

  \(a=2002\), \(b=2048 - 2002=46\)

  Then,

  \[
  f(2002)+f(46)=11^2=121
  \]

Estimate \(f(46)\), possibly close to \(\frac{46 \times 47}{2}= NFT_N/A because we have no concrete formula.

Alternatively, just formulate the program: enumerate all \(n\) with \(2^n\) near 2002, then compute \(b=2^n - 2002\). For each feasible \(n\), then:

\[
f(2002) = n^2 - f(b)
\]

As \(f(b)\) is unknown, we can attempt to evaluate plausible \(f(b)\) values for small \(b\), maybe assuming linearity \(f(b)=k \times b\).

Let's choose \(f(b) \approx b\), as a simple guess for small \(b\), then:

\[
f(2002) \approx n^2 - b
\]

Examples:

- \(n=11\), \(b=46\), estimate \(f(46)=46\), then \(f(2002) \approx 121 - 46=75\).

Similarly, for other \(n\):

- \(n=10\), \(2^{10}=1024\), \(b=1024-2002=-978\) (invalid).

Thus, only relevant \(n\) with \(2^n >2002\):

- \(2^{11}=2048\), \(b=46\), estimate \(f(2002) \approx 121 - 46=75\).

Alternatively, if assuming \(f(n)=n^2/2\) (based on previous guesses), then:

\[
f(2002) = \frac{2002^2}{2} \approx \frac{4,008,004}{2}=2,004,002
\]

which seems plausible.

But to conclude the code, we can search over small \(n\) such that \(2^n\) surpasses 2002:

- \(n=11\), \(2^{11}=2048\). Difference: \(46\).

Compute:

- \(f(2002)=121 - f(46)\)

If prior similar \(f\) grows roughly quadratically, then \(f(46)=\frac{46^2}{2^{something}}\), unlikely; also, the initial data is sparse.

Given the constraints, here's a conservative estimate: we will enumerate \(n=11\) and calculate candidate \(f(2002) = 121 - f(46)\), where \(f(46)\) can be anything plausible; pick small candidates: 0, 23, 46, 50, etc., to produce candidate answers.

Below, I will write code to iterate over feasible \(n\), compute corresponding \(b\), then produce candidate \(f(2002)\).

This overall heuristic suggests the answer could be around 75, 2000000, or other, but the main focus is enumeration.

```python
# Enumerate possible answers for f(2002) based on the given property
# considering candidate pairs (a, b) with a + b = 2^n and a=2002.
# For each n with 2^n > 2002, compute b=2^n - 2002,
# then estimate f(2002) = n^2 - f(b). Without knowing f(b), 
# assume plausible values (like 0, b, b/2, etc.) to generate candidates.

# We will assume f(b) can be any non-negative real number for small b's.
# For illustration, pick f(b) as 0, b/2, b, or b*1.5 etc., to generate candidates.

# Note: Since the problem is mostly conjectural, this enumeration suggests
# possible solutions for f(2002) based on plausible f(b).

for n in range(11, 15):  # n=11 gives 2^11=2048, close to 2002
    two_pow = 2 ** n
    b = two_pow - 2002
    # Generate plausible values for f(b)
    candidates_f_b = [0, b/2, b, b*1.5]
    for f_b in candidates_f_b:
        candidate = n*n - f_b
        print(candidate)
```
