The problem appears to involve finding the least value of a sum of digits (base 10) of a certain quadratic expression involving n: \(3n^2 + n + 1\). The goal is to identify this minimal sum for some n â‰¥ 0, and to output all candidate sums that could possibly be minimal, so we can conjecture which is the least.

Approach:
- Fix small n (e.g., from 0 up to a certain threshold, such as 50) to generate multiple candidate sums.
- For each n, compute the value of \(3n^2 + n + 1\), convert it into digits, and sum the digits.
- Print each sum immediately.
- After enumerating, identify the minimal sum among these candidates.

This approach maximizes efficiency by limiting to a small search space, ensuring no unnecessary computations, and meets the problem constraints.

```python
def main():
    max_n = 50  # small sample range for n
    candidates = []
    for n in range(max_n + 1):
        val = 3 * n**2 + n + 1
        digit_sum = sum(int(d) for d in str(val))
        print(digit_sum)  # stream candidate sums
        candidates.append(digit_sum)
    # Optional: print the minimal candidate to help conjecture
    print("Minimum sum:", min(candidates))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
