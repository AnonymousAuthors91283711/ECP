The problem appears to involve finding the value of a polynomial \( P \) with certain properties related to its degree and its evaluations at specific points. Our goal is to determine \( P.eval(n + 1) \) given the degree and evaluation conditions, but without hardcoding the answer.

Since the polynomial \( P \) satisfies:
\[
P(k) = \frac{k}{k+1} \quad \text{for } k=0,1,\ldots,n,
\]
we can approach this by constructing all polynomials of degree \( n \) matching these points and then evaluating at \( n+1 \).

Key observations:
- The points define a polynomial of degree at most \( n \).
- The evaluations are close to 1, but with a specific pattern.
- Using polynomial interpolation (Lagrange form) on these points, the polynomial is uniquely determined.

Given the sample points \( (k, \frac{k}{k+1}) \), we can directly compute the interpolation polynomial at \( n+1 \).

Because the problem asks for an enumeration approach, we can:
- Generate small values of \( n \),
- Use Lagrange interpolation to find \( P \),
- Evaluate at \( n+1 \),
- Stream results as we go along.

Here's a program that does this efficiently and streams the output:

```python
# The program computes the value of P(n+1) for small n using Lagrange interpolation
from fractions import Fraction

def lagrange_interpolation(x_points, y_points, eval_point):
    """Compute interpolated value at eval_point given points."""
    total = Fraction(0, 1)
    n = len(x_points)
    for i in range(n):
        xi, yi = x_points[i], y_points[i]
        term = yi
        for j in range(n):
            if i != j:
                xj = x_points[j]
                numerator = Fraction(eval_point - xj)
                denominator = Fraction(xi - xj)
                term *= numerator / denominator
        total += term
    return total

print("Enumerating results for small n:")
for n in range(4):  # small sample n
    # points: (k, k/(k+1))
    x_points = list(range(n+1))
    y_points = [Fraction(k, k+1) for k in x_points]
    eval_point = n + 1
    value = lagrange_interpolation(x_points, y_points, eval_point)
    print(f"n={n}, P({n+1}) â‰ˆ {float(value)} (exact: {value})")
```

This code:
- Uses fractional arithmetic for exactness.
- Computes the polynomial value at \( n+1 \) for small degrees.
- Streams the output immediately upon calculation.
- Avoids hardcoding, uses small parameters for efficiency, and adheres to the length constraint.

**Note:** This approach provides a conjecture based on small \( n \), which can be refined or proved with further symbolic analysis.
