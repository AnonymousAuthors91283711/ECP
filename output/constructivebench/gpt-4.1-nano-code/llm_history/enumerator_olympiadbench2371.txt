This problem involves functional equalities and a specific structure, suggesting that `g` might be expressed directly in terms of `f`. Given the conditions:
- `f(x) = 2x + 1`
- `g(f(x)) = 4x² + 1`

Our goal is to find `g` in terms of `x`. Since `g(f(x))` is provided in terms of `x`, and `f(x)` as well, we can try to express `g` as a function in terms of its argument, say `y`, where `y = f(x)`.

From `f(x) = 2x + 1`, we can invert it: `x = (y - 1) / 2`. Substituting into `g(f(x)) = 4x² + 1` gives:
`g(y) = 4 * ((y - 1)/2)² + 1 = 4 * ((y - 1)² / 4) + 1 = (y - 1)² + 1`

Thus, `g(y) = (y - 1)² + 1`.

Now, to enumerate possible `g` functions correctly, we will implement the derivation and provide the explicit `g`, as well as sample inputs to verify the function, ensuring the answer was obtained systematically.

```python
# We derive g(y) = (y - 1)^2 + 1 based on the given conditions.

def g(y):
    return (y - 1)**2 + 1

# Verify for some sample points
for x in [-10, -1, 0, 1, 10]:
    y = 2 * x + 1
    value_g = g(y)
    expected_value = 4 * x ** 2 + 1
    print(f"x={x}, f(x)={y}, g(f(x))={value_g}, expected={expected_value}")
```
