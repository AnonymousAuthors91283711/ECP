The problem asks to count the number of pairs (a, b) with 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 57 such that (a^2) % 57 < (b^2) % 57. Here, we enumerate all valid pairs and count them.

We'll generate all pairs with the specified constraints, compute the squares modulo 57, and check the condition. Since the total is not specified explicitly, we will print each qualifying pair, and count the total number at the end to determine `omnimath2504_answer`.

Note: We strive for efficiency by only iterating through small ranges and directly evaluating conditions, printing each qualifying pair immediately.

```python
# Enumerate pairs (a, b) with 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 57 and (a^2 % 57) < (b^2 % 57)
# Count how many such pairs there are.

count = 0
for a in range(1, 58):
    a_sq_mod = (a * a) % 57
    for b in range(a + 1, 58):
        b_sq_mod = (b * b) % 57
        if a_sq_mod < b_sq_mod:
            print(f"Pair: (a={a}, b={b}), ({a}^2 % 57)={a_sq_mod} < ({b}^2 % 57)={b_sq_mod}")
            count += 1

print(f"Total pairs count: {count}")
```
