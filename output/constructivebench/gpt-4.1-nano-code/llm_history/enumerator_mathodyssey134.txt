The problem appears to be about finding the maximum number of student groups (subsets) of a set of 10 students, such that:

- Each group has a certain size \(k\).
- No two groups are disjoint ("pairwise non-disjoint" could be implied, but the problem states \(\neg \text{Disjoint}\)), so they must share at least one student.
- Every student not in 'students' must be disjoint from some group in 'students' (covering the entire set with intersections).

Given the structure, it resembles a combinatorial design/covering problem: how large can \(k\) be such that these properties hold?

Since the constraints are abstract, and the problem asks for the greatest \(k\), we can test small values of \(k\) and enumerate possible collections of groups.

The key points:
- Set of students: 10 students (totally small).
- For each \(k\), find all collections of subsets of size \(k\), where:
  - All subsets are pairwise not disjoint (intersect).
  - The union of these subsets cover all students (every student outside a subset intersects with it), or equivalently, no student outside the collection is disjoint from all.

We'll generate candidate collections for each \(k\), check the properties, and find the largest such \(k\).

Considering efficiency:
- Limit to small \(k\) (from 1 to 5).
- For each \(k\), generate candidate collections with small size (up to a few sets), since total set elements are only 10 (manageable).

```python
from itertools import combinations, chain

# Generate all subsets of size k from 10 students labeled 0..9
students = range(10)

def all_subsets(k):
    return combinations(students, k)

max_k_found = 0
max_collection = []

# Check for each k from larger to smaller to find the maximum
for k in range(5, 0, -1):
    candidate_collections = []
    # Generate all k-subsets
    subsets = list(all_subsets(k))
    # Generate all possible collections of these subsets (up to size 5 for tractability)
    for size in range(1, 6):
        for collection in combinations(subsets, size):
            # Convert to set form for easy intersection checks
            sets = [set(s) for s in collection]
            # Condition 1: All pairs intersect
            if all(s1 & s2 for i, s1 in enumerate(sets) for s2 in sets[i+1:]):
                # Union of all sets
                union_sets = set().union(*sets)
                # Condition 2: For every student not in union, that student is disjoint from some set
                outside_students = set(students) - union_sets
                if all(any(s & {st} for s in sets) for st in outside_students):
                    # Valid collection found
                    print(f"Found collection for k={k}: {collection}")
                    max_k_found = k
                    max_collection = collection
    if max_k_found:
        # We found the maximum for this k, do not continue to smaller k
        break

print(f"Maximum k satisfying conditions: {max_k_found}")
```
