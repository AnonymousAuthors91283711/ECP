This problem involves a sequence \(a: \text{Fin } 2023 \to \mathbb{Z}\), with all entries positive, satisfying a recurrence involving sums of absolute differences, and summing to a specific value \(s\). We want to find the minimal such sum \(s\).

Given the complexity, I'll focus on a manageable approach: enumerate candidate sequences where all initial \(a_i\) are positive integers within a small range (say 1 to 10). For each candidate, verify if the recurrence holds, and track the minimal \(s\).

The code will:
- Fix small initial values for \(a\).
- Compute subsequent terms using the recurrence.
- Check whether all \(a_i\) remain positive integers.
- Sum and track minimal \(s\).
- Print candidates only if they satisfy the recurrence.

This approach focuses on small sample values to explore feasible sequences.

```python
# Enumerate initial values of a_i from 1 to 10
# For each initial sequence, compute subsequent a_i via the recurrence
# Check positivity at each step
# Track minimal sum s
# Print each valid sequence with its sum s

def main():
    from itertools import product
    min_s = None
    best_sequence = None
    # Limit initial a_i to small positive integers for feasibility
    for init in product(range(1, 11), repeat=2023):
        a = list(init)
        # Track sequence to see if it satisfies the recurrence
        valid = True
        for k in range(2022):
            # Compute sum of absolute differences for a[k+1]
            diff_sum = sum(abs(a[k+1] - a[i]) for i in range(2023))
            # Check if a[k+1] equals this sum
            if a[k+1] != diff_sum:
                valid = False
                break
            # If sum exceeds reasonable bounds, break
            if diff_sum < 1:
                valid = False
                break
        if valid:
            s = sum(a)
            print(f"Valid sequence with sum s={s}")
            if min_s is None or s < min_s:
                min_s = s
                best_sequence = a
    print(f"Minimum s found: {min_s}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
