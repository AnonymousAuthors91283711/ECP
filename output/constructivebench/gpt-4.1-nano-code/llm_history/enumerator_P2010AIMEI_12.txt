This problem resembles a classical combinatorial and number-theoretic minimality problem. We are to find the least integer \( m \ge 3 \) such that for any partition of the set \( \{ n : 3 \le n \le m \} \), either set \(A\) or \(B\) contains a multiplicative triple \(a, b, c\) with \(a \times b = c\).

Here's the reasoning process:
- For small \(m\), possible partitions can be checked manually or via enumeration.
- The minimal \(m\) is the threshold where no partition avoids having such a multiplicative triple in either \(A\) or \(B\).
- This resembles the construction of multiplicative Schur numbers, which are quite known for small bounds.

To write an efficient enumeration, we will:
- Test candidate \(m\), starting from 3 upwards.
- For each \(m\), generate all possible partitions of \(\{3,4,\ldots,m\}\) (which are \(2^{m-2}\) partitions).
- For each partition, check if either \(A\) or \(B\) is free of the triple \(a, b, c\) with \(a \times b = c\).
- The moment we find an \(m\) where all partitions contain such a triple in at least one part, this \(m\) is our result.

Due to combinatorial explosion, we choose a small upper bound for brute-force checking, for example, up to \(m=20\).

Let's implement this:

```python
from itertools import combinations, chain, product

def has_multiplicative_triple(s):
    # Check if set s contains a, b, c with a * b = c
    s_list = sorted(s)
    s_set = set(s_list)
    for a in s_list:
        for b in s_list:
            c = a * b
            if c in s_set:
                return True
    return False

def check_partition(partition):
    A, B = partition
    return has_multiplicative_triple(A) or has_multiplicative_triple(B)

def enumerate_partitions(n):
    # Generate all ways to partition {3,4,...,n}
    elements = list(range(3, n+1))
    for mask in range(1, 1 << (n-2)):
        A = set()
        B = set()
        for i, x in enumerate(elements):
            if (mask >> i) & 1:
                A.add(x)
            else:
                B.add(x)
        yield A, B

def find_min_m(limit=20):
    for m in range(3, limit+1):
        all_partitions_failed = True
        for partition in enumerate_partitions(m):
            if not check_partition(partition):
                # Found a partition without a multiplicative triple
                all_partitions_failed = False
                break
        if all_partitions_failed:
            print(m)
            return m
    print("No such minimal m found up to limit.")
    return None

# Run the enumeration
find_min_m()
```

This code:
- Checks each \(m\) starting from 3.
- Enumerates all partitions efficiently via bitmasks.
- Checks if either subset lacks the multiplicative triple.
- When it finds an \(m\) where none of the partitions are free of such triples, it prints \(m\).

This approach aligns with the problem's intent: **streaming answers when found, with an efficient brute-force method for small bounds**.
