The problem involves the number \( L = \frac{10^{2022} - 1}{9} \), which is a number with 2022 digits, all equal to 1. The expression to evaluate is the sum of the digits (base 10) of \( 9 \times L^2 + 2 \times L \).

Notice that \( L \) is the repunit with 2022 ones:
\[ L = 111\ldots111 \quad (\text{2022 times}) \]

We need to find the sum of digits of:
\[ 9 L^2 + 2 L \]

Since \(L\) is large, let's analyze and decompose the expression, and then write a program to compute the sum for small sample values to conjecture the pattern.

Key observations:
- For small \( n \), the number \( L_n = \frac{10^n - 1}{9} \) is a repunit.
- We'll compute \( 9 L^2 + 2 L \) and the sum of its digits for small \( n \).

The program will:
- Generate \( L \) for small \( n \)
- Compute the expression
- Sum the digits
- Output the result for each \( n \)

This will help conjecture the sum of digits pattern as \( n \to 2022 \).

```python
# Python program to analyze small cases and conjecture the pattern
def repunit(n):
    return int('1' * n)

def sum_of_digits(num):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(num))

# For small sample sizes, compute and display results
for n in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10]:
    L = repunit(n)
    val = 9 * L * L + 2 * L
    digit_sum = sum_of_digits(val)
    print(f"n={n}: sum of digits = {digit_sum}")
```
