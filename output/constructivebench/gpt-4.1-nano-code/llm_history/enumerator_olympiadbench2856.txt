This problem involves finding the greatest value of \( x \) such that the expression \((\log x)^2 - \log (\sqrt{x}) = T\) holds, given \( T = 10 \).

Step-by-step:
- Rewrite the equation in terms of \(\log x\).
- Since \(\log (\sqrt{x}) = \frac{1}{2} \log x\), the equation becomes:
  \[
  (\log x)^2 - \frac{1}{2} \log x = T
  \]
- Let \( y = \log x \). The equation is:
  \[
  y^2 - \frac{1}{2} y = T
  \]
- Solve for \( y \):
  \[
  y^2 - \frac{1}{2} y - T = 0
  \]
- Use quadratic formula:
  \[
  y = \frac{\frac{1}{2} \pm \sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + 4 T}}{2}
  \]
- Recall \( x = e^{y} \), and we want the greatest \( x \), which corresponds to the larger \( y \).

To assist in conjecturing, we'll enumerate solutions for \( y \), then convert to \( x \), and print all solutions.

```python
import math

T = 10  # Given parameter
discriminant = (0.5)**2 + 4 * T
sqrt_discriminant = math.sqrt(discriminant)

# Compute the two roots for y
y1 = (0.5 + sqrt_discriminant) / 2
y2 = (0.5 - sqrt_discriminant) / 2

# Convert y to x
x1 = math.exp(y1)
x2 = math.exp(y2)

# Print solutions
print(f"Candidate solutions for y: y1 = {y1}, y2 = {y2}")
print(f"Corresponding x: x1 = {x1}, x2 = {x2}")

# The greatest x
max_x = max(x1, x2)
print(f"The greatest solution for x is: {max_x}")
```
