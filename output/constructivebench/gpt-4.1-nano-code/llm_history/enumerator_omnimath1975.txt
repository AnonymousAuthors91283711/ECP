This problem involves a recurrence relation for a sequence \(x_k\) with initial conditions and a recursive formula for \(k > 2\). We are asked to find the value \(x_{2013}\), but the problem is incomplete since it uses placeholders ("sorry") and involves some concepts from Lean's Mathlib. 

The recursive relation is:
\[
x_k = \frac{x_{k-1} + x_{k-2} + 1}{x_{k-3}} \quad \text{for } k > 2,
\]
with initial conditions:
\[
x_0=1,\quad x_1=1,\quad x_2=1.
\]

We can implement this in Python, looping from \(k=3\) up to 2013, computing each term based on the previous three. Since the sequence depends on division, we should be careful to handle potential zero denominators. Given the initial values, it's unlikely that denominators will be zero, but we should check.

Furthermore, since the problem asks for computing \(x_{2013}\), we will print each intermediate value as it's computed, to stream partial results.

```python
# Sequence computation based on recurrence:
# x_k = (x_{k-1} + x_{k-2} + 1) / x_{k-3}
# Initial conditions: x_0=1, x_1=1, x_2=1

# Initialize sequence list
x = [1, 1, 1]

# Compute from k=3 to 2013
for k in range(3, 2014):
    numerator = x[k-1] + x[k-2] + 1
    denominator = x[k-3]
    # Prevent division by zero, just in case
    if denominator == 0:
        print(f"Zero denominator at k={k}, sequence cannot proceed.")
        break
    value = numerator / denominator
    x.append(value)
    print(f"x_{k} = {value}")
# Print final value
print(f"x_2013 = {x[-1]}")
```
