The problem asks to find the number of positive integer solutions \((a, b, c)\) to the equation \(a + b + c = 66\) with the constraints \(a < b < c\). To do this, we can iterate over possible values of \(a\) and \(b\), compute \(c = 66 - a - b\), and check if the ordering \(a < b < c\) holds. Since all variables are positive, \(a, b \ge 1\), and with \(a < b < c\), we can limit our loops efficiently.

Here's the Python code to enumerate solutions and count them:

```python
# Count solutions to a + b + c = 66 with a < b < c and all positive
count = 0
for a in range(1, 64):  # a < b < c and a + b + c=66
    for b in range(a + 1, 66 - a):  # b > a, and c = 66 - a - b > b
        c = 66 - a - b
        if b < c:
            print(f"Solution: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}")
            count += 1
print("Total solutions:", count)
```

This script efficiently enumerates all solutions, printing each solution as itâ€™s found and finally displaying the total count. It operates entirely within the constraints, avoids hardcoding, and can be run independently.
