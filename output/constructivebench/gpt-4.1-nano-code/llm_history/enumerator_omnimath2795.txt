[write_program]
This is a logical equivalence theorem about powers of 10 and 1000, with a variable n. To find n satisfying 10^n = 1000^20, we can note that 1000 = 10^3, so 1000^20 = (10^3)^20 = 10^{60}. Therefore, 10^n = 10^{60} implies n = 60.

Since the problem wants a program to enumerate possible answers to help conjecture and prove, but we are certain n=60 is the only answer, and the code should find it through enumeration.

We'll write code to:
- Iterate over a small range of n's (say, 0 to 100), 
- Check if 10^n = 1000^20,
- Print the answer whenever the equality holds.

```python
# Enumerate candidate n for the equation 10^n = 1000^20
# 1000^20 = (10^3)^20 = 10^{60}
# Search over a reasonable range to confirm n=60 is the only solution

for n in range(0, 100):
    lhs = 10 ** n
    rhs = 1000 ** 20
    if lhs == rhs:
        print(f"n = {n}")
```
