Ground Truth Answer: 217 / 900
Proposed Answer: 1 / 3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is calculating the average probability that a randomly selected number from 1 to 100 is divisible by one of its divisors.

2. The ground truth answer is 217/900 ≈ 0.2411

3. The proposed answer is 1/3 ≈ 0.3333

The calculation:
- The sum ∑ d in D, ∑ z in Z, if d ∣ z then 1 else 0 counts for each divisor d of 100 how many numbers in 1..100 it divides
- 100 has 9 divisors: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100
- The counts are: 100, 50, 25, 20, 10, 5, 4, 2, 1 respectively
- Total sum = 100+50+25+20+10+5+4+2+1 = 217
- Denominator = 9 (divisors) * 100 (numbers) = 900
- Thus the correct answer is 217/900

The proposed answer 1/3 is significantly different from 217/900 and incorrect.
