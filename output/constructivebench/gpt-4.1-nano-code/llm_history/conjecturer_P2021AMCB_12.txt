Since averages suggest an arithmetic progression and the difference maxS = minS + 72, the total sum S.sum = (minS + maxS) * n / 2, with n = S.card. With the given averages, the total sum simplifies to minS * n + 36 * n. Combining average equations yields minS = 60, maxS = 132, and total sum = 192 * n. Thus, the mean = total sum / n = 192, which is constant regardless of n.
