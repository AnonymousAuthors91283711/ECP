The problem involves finding integer values \( m \) such that \( x = omnimath4406\_answer(m) \) satisfies the given trigonometric equation:
\[ \sin x^3 \left(1 + \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\right) + \cos x^3 \left(1 + \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\right) = \cos 2x. \]
Given the structure, the key is to explore common or notable angles where sine and cosine take on simple values, such as multiples of \(\pi/2\) or \(\pi/4\). I'll choose small parameter values (say, integers \( m \) from -10 to 10), assume \( omnimath4406\_answer(m) \) maps integers to these angles, and test the equality. When the lengths are finite and patterns emerge, it helps conjecture the solutions.

```python
import math

# Function to simulate the answer: assume a linear mapping for testing, e.g., x = m * pi/4
def omnimath4406_answer(m):
    return m * math.pi / 4

# Set the range of integer parameters to test
min_m, max_m = -10, 10

for m in range(min_m, max_m + 1):
    x = omnimath4406_answer(m)
    # Compute components to avoid repeated calculations
    sin_x = math.sin(x)
    cos_x = math.cos(x)
    # To avoid division by zero, check sin_x and cos_x
    if abs(sin_x) < 1e-12 or abs(cos_x) < 1e-12:
        continue
    # Calculate the left side
    left = (sin_x ** 3) * (1 + cos_x / sin_x) + (cos_x ** 3) * (1 + sin_x / cos_x)
    # Calculate the right side
    right = math.cos(2 * x)
    # Compare with a tolerance
    if abs(left - right) < 1e-9:
        print(f"m = {m}, x â‰ˆ {x:.4f} radians")
```
