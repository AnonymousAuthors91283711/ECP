The problem seems to involve computing an expected value based on harmonic series segments, specifically for `n=21` and `alice=11`. The expression adds two sums: from 0 to `alice - 2`, and from 0 to `n - alice - 1`. The sum appears to be a sum of reciprocals, which resembles harmonic numbers.

To produce possible answers, I'll:
- Compute the harmonic sums explicitly for these ranges.
- Sum the harmonic numbers.
- Enumerate several possible rational approximations if needed.
- Print the result exactly (as a rational).

Let's implement that in Python:

```python
# Computes the harmonic number H_k as a rational
from fractions import Fraction

def harmonic(n):
    total = Fraction(0, 1)
    for k in range(1, n + 1):
        total += Fraction(1, k)
    return total

# Given parameters
n = 21
alice = 11

# Sum from k=0 to alice-2 (since range is exclusive at end)
sum1 = harmonic(alice - 1)  # harmonic(alice - 1)
# Sum from k=0 to n - alice - 1
sum2 = harmonic(n - alice)

expected_games = sum1 + sum2

# Print the rational exact answer
print(expected_games)
```
