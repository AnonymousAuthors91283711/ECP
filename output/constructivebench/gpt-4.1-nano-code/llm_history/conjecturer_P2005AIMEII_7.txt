abbrev P2005AIMEII_7_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2005AIMEII_7 : 
  (fun x => (x + 1)^48) (4 / ((sqrt 5 + 1) * (5^(1/4) + 1) * (5^(1/8) + 1) * (5^(1/16) + 1))) = P2005AIMEII_7_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Approximate value of the expression: 125.00000000000014
Closest integer approximation: 125
. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The expression simplifies to 125 by recognizing the pattern of nested radicals and algebraic identities involving powers of 5 and related conjugates, resulting in a clean integer.
