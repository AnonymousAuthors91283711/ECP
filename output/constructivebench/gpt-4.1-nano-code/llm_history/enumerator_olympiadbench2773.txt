This problem involves algebraic manipulations with specific parameters, requiring us to compute certain values for T=2069, then analyze the roots of a quadratic, and determine the absolute difference between those roots.

To assist in conjecturing the true answer, we'll:
- Calculate the parameters based on T.
- Compute the discriminant D.
- Find the roots r and s.
- Determine the absolute difference |r - s|.
- Output candidate answers found during the computation.

Since the problem involves roots with square roots, we'll approximate sqrt(D). We will focus on printing exact algebraic forms and approximations for clarity and possible pattern recognition.

```python
import math

# Given parameters
T = 2069
K = sum(int(d) for d in str(T))
D = 18**2 - 4 * K  # Discriminant

# Print parameters
print(f"T = {T}")
print(f"K = {K}")
print(f"D = {D}")

# Compute the square root of D
sqrt_D = math.sqrt(D)
print(f"sqrt(D) ≈ {sqrt_D}")

# Calculate roots r and s
r = (18 + sqrt_D) / 2
s = (18 - sqrt_D) / 2

# Compute and output the absolute difference
abs_diff = abs(r - s)
print(f"|r - s| = {abs_diff}")

# Since roots are (18 ± sqrt_D)/2, their difference is sqrt_D
print(f"Exact difference |r - s| = {sqrt_D}")
```
