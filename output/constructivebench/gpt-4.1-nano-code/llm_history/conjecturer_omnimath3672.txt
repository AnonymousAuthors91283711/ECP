. Enumerated answers: Constant functions satisfying the equation:

Linear functions satisfying the equation:. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ → ℝ)
The functions satisfying the given functional equation are constant functions and linear functions with specific coefficients that satisfy the functional identity. The constant solutions are all functions \(f(x) = c\) with \(c\) satisfying the equation; linear solutions are of the form \(f(x) = a x\) with \(a\) chosen to satisfy the identity, which simplifies to \(a = -1\) or \(a=0\). 

The closed forms of these solutions are: the constant functions \(f(x) = c\), and the linear functions \(f(x) = -x\). 

Answer: 
<<<{f : ℝ → ℝ | ∀ x y, (f x = c) ∧ (c ∈ ℝ) ∨ (∃ a : ℝ, f x = a * x ∧ (a = 0 ∨ a = -1))}>>>[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

. Enumerated Answers: Constant functions satisfying the equation:

Linear functions satisfying the equation:. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ → ℝ)
The main issue in your proposed answer is the use of 'c' without defining it or quantifying over it. In logic, to specify a constant function, you need to explicitly state that 'f x = c' for all x, with a fixed 'c'.

The enumeration indicates two types of functions: constant functions and specific linear functions. The constant functions are characterized by a single real number c, with f x = c for all x; linear functions are of the form f x = a * x, with a = 0 or a = -1.

Therefore, the set can be defined as a union of two subsets:

1) Constant functions: functions with a fixed c ∈ ℝ such that ∀ x, f x = c.

2) Linear functions with a specific slope a ∈ {0, -1}.

In Lean, we can formalize these as:

- Constant functions: {f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ c : ℝ, ∀ x, f x = c}

- Specific linear functions: {f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ a ∈ {0, -1}, ∀ x, f x = a * x}, which is equivalent to the set of functions f x = 0 or f x = -x.

Combining these, the entire answer set is the union of these two.

Final code:

<<<
{f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ c : ℝ, ∀ x, f x = c} ∪ {f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ a ∈ {0, -1}, ∀ x, f x = a * x}
>>>

This definition captures all constant and specific linear solutions consistent with the enumerated solutions, and it is well-formed in Lean syntax.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Linear functions satisfying the equation:. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ → ℝ)
The current proposed answer defines a union of two sets: constant functions and linear functions with slopes 0 or -1. 

The Lean error arises because the notation '{f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ a ∈ {0, -1}, ∀ x, f x = a * x}' is not valid Lean syntax; it does not recognize '∈' inside the subset notation directly. Instead, it requires explicit logical conjunctions to specify the properties of the functions. 

To fix this, I will express the set as `{f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ c, ∀ x, f x = c}` for constant functions, and `{f : ℝ → ℝ | (∃ a ∈ {0, -1}), ∀ x, f x = a * x}` should be written explicitly as `{f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ a ∈ {0, -1}, ∀ x, f x = a * x}`, which is not valid syntax.

Instead, to stay within Lean proper syntax, it is better to write these as set comprehensions with explicit quantifiers and equalities, perhaps as:

{f | ∃ c, ∀ x, f x = c} ∪ {f | ∃ a, (a = 0 ∨ a = -1) ∧ ∀ x, f x = a * x}

which in Lean syntax would be:

{f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ c : ℝ, ∀ x, f x = c} ∪ {f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ a : ℝ, (a = 0 ∨ a = -1) ∧ ∀ x, f x = a * x}

Given that, the fixed answer should be:

<<<{f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ c : ℝ, ∀ x, f x = c} ∪ {f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ a : ℝ, (a = 0 ∨ a = -1) ∧ ∀ x, f x = a * x}>>>
