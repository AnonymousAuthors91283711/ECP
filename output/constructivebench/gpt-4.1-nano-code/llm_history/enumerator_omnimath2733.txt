This problem involves exploring the values of θ in the given conditions related to cosine functions, specifically within the range [0, 90] degrees (or radians). The key is to find all θ satisfying:

\[ \cos 60^\circ = \cos 45^\circ \times \cos \theta \]

We'll convert degrees to radians for computation: 60° = π/3, 45° = π/4.

Using Python with `math.cos` (which takes radians), we'll find all θ in [0, π/2] that satisfy the equation approximately. We'll check for possible solutions by enumerating θ from 0 to 90 degrees (π/2 radians), in small steps (e.g., 1° or 0.5°), and test whether the relation holds within a small tolerance. Since we are only asked to facilitate conjecturing, approximate solutions are acceptable as long as they are precise enough.

```python
import math

# Define the constants in radians
deg_60 = math.pi / 3
deg_45 = math.pi / 4
target = math.cos(deg_60)  # cos 60°
expected_factor = math.cos(deg_45)  # cos 45°

solutions = []

# Enumerate θ from 0 to 90 degrees with 0.5 degree steps (~π/360 radians)
for degree in range(0, 91):  # 0° to 90°
    theta = math.radians(degree)
    lhs = math.cos(deg_60)
    rhs = math.cos(deg_45) * math.cos(theta)
    if math.isclose(lhs, rhs, rel_tol=1e-7, abs_tol=1e-7):
        print(f"θ ≈ {degree} degrees, π/{int(180/degree) if degree !=0 else '∞'} radians")
        solutions.append(theta)

# Output all found solutions
# For a typical problem, θ ≈ 45°, θ ≈ 60° are exact (since cos 60° = 0.5, cos 45° ≈ 0.7071), check approximate matches at those points
