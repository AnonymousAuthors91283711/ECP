The problem appears to involve finding the supremum (`sSup`) of the set of integers `x` such that `|x * Z| ≤ 5` with the given `Z = 2`. We want to determine the value of `X` which equals `sSup` of this set, and ultimately deduce `omnimath877_answer`.

Since `Z = 2`, the set becomes all integers `x` such that `|2 * x| ≤ 5`. This simplifies to `|x| ≤ 5/2`, meaning `x` must be integers satisfying `|x| ≤ 2` because `x` is integer.

The set is `{x | |x| ≤ 2}` → integers `x` in `{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}`.

The supremum (least upper bound) of this set in ℤ is `2`.

The answer is therefore 2.

I will implement a program that enumerates all candidates for `x` in an obvious range and identifies the maximum.

```python
# Enumerate all integers x where |x * Z| ≤ 5 for Z=2
# Since |2 * x| ≤ 5 => |x| ≤ 2.5, so x ∈ {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}
# The supremum in ℤ is the maximum of these x-values, which is 2

def main():
    answer_candidates = []
    Z = 2
    limit = 5
    # Explore x within bounds based on |x * Z| ≤ 5
    bound = limit // abs(Z) + 1  # Plus one to include boundary
    for x in range(-bound, bound + 1):
        if abs(x * Z) <= limit:
            print(f"Candidate x: {x}")  # Stream partial results
            answer_candidates.append(x)
    # Find the supremum (max in this context)
    print(f"Supremum (answer): {max(answer_candidates)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
