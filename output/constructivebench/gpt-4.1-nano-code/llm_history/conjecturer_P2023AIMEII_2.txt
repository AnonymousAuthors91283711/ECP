585
Maximum: 585. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The problem asks for the greatest number less than 1000 that reads the same forward and backward in both base 10 and base 8. The enumeration hints that candidates are palindromic in both bases, with the maximum being 585. Checking the list and the pattern suggests that 585 is the maximum number satisfying these conditions.
