The problem provides two conditions involving production rates \(w_1\) and \(w_2\):

1. \(100 \times w_1 = 300\) and \(100 \times w_2 = 200\),
2. \(2 \times 60 \times w_1 = 240\) and \(2 \times 60 \times w_2 = 300\),
and asks for the value of \(3 \times 50 \times w_2\).

We will verify whether the given equations are consistent and compute the value directly, then check if multiple solutions exist.

```python
# Verification of the conditions
# From condition 1:
w1_condition1 = 300 / 100  # =3
w2_condition1 = 200 / 100  # =2

# From condition 2:
w1_condition2 = 240 / (2 * 60)  # = 240 / 120 = 2
w2_condition2 = 300 / (2 * 60)  # = 300 / 120 = 2.5

# Check for consistency:
# w1 from condition 1 is 3, from condition 2 is 2 => conflict
# w2 from condition 1 is 2, from condition 2 is 2.5 => conflict

# Since the system is inconsistent, no exact common (w1, w2) satisfies both.
# But for the purpose of enumeration, let's consider possible solutions under each set.

solutions = []

# Solutions to condition 1:
w1_c1 = 300 / 100
w2_c1 = 200 / 100
solutions.append(('condition 1', w1_c1, w2_c1))

# Solutions to condition 2:
w1_c2 = 240 / (2 * 60)
w2_c2 = 300 / (2 * 60)
solutions.append(('condition 2', w1_c2, w2_c2))

# Compute 3 * 50 * w2 for each solution
for label, w1, w2 in solutions:
    answer = 3 * 50 * w2
    print(f"Solution from {label}: w1={w1}, w2={w2}, answer={answer}")
```
