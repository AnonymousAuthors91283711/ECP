The problem appears to be about finding the minimal and maximal size (cardinality) of a subset of ℕ×ℕ with certain properties related to an injective, monotone function `f` satisfying particular order-preserving conditions. Since the actual details are abstracted via a `sorry`, and the problem involves finite sets with constraints, a good approach is to generate all small candidate pairs (x, y) within a 100×100 grid, evaluate these under a possible `f`, and check the conditions.

Given the problem's constraints:
- `f` is bijective from ℕ×ℕ to ℕ,
- Monotonicity conditions on `f` in `x` and `y` directions,
- Considering finite subsets where `f(p)` is odd,
- Finding minimal and maximal cardinality of such subsets.

Since `f` is arbitrary but bijective and monotonic in a certain sense, a typical candidate is the function `f(x, y) = some ordering that respects the conditions`, for simplicity, we can assume `f(x, y) = some minimal code (such as lexicographical order)` to simulate the behavior.

The code will:
- Generate all points `(x, y)` with `x, y < 100`.
- Simulate an `f` that respects the monotonicity.
- Find all subsets with all `f(p)` odd (since the actual `f` is unknown, approximate by considering only points where `f(p)` could be odd, e.g., via parity of `(x + y)`).
- Determine the minimal and maximal sizes of such subsets.

Here is the code:

```python
# Generate all points in the 100x100 grid
points = [(x, y) for x in range(100) for y in range(100)]

# Simulate a bijective, monotonic-in-x and y function.
# For simplicity, define f as lex order + some parity pattern:
# f(x, y) = 100*y + x (lex order)
# Then, f(x, y) is odd iff (x + y) is odd.
# This respects the monotonicity in each coordinate.
def f(p):
    x, y = p
    return 100 * y + x

# Find all points where f(p) is odd: i.e., (x + y) is odd
candidate_points = [p for p in points if (p[0] + p[1]) % 2 == 1]

# Now, our subsets are any subsets of candidate_points
# to find the min/max possible sizes: min/N and max/N.

# Min subset size with all f(p) odd is obviously 1 (singleton if exists),
# Max is all such points.

# Enumerate all singleton subsets for minimal size
minimal_size_candidates = [1] if candidate_points else []

# Maximal size: size of all candidate points
max_size = len(candidate_points)

# Output the results
print("Approximate minimal size:", min(minimal_size_candidates) if minimal_size_candidates else 0)
print("Approximate maximal size:", max_size)

# For explicit enumeration: list some points for verification
print("Sample points with odd f(p):", candidate_points[:10])
```

This code explores the assumptions, simulates the problem constraints, and outputs possible minimal and maximal subset sizes along with sample points.  
It helps in forming conjectures about the original problem's answer.
