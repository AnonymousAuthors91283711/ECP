The problem asks to find the unique pair of natural numbers \( p = (p_1, p_2) \) with conditions: \( p_1 > 0 \), \( p_1 \le p_2 \), \( p_1 p_2=24 \), \( p_1 + p_2=11 \), and to assign the value \( p_2 - p_1 \) in a variable.

Given the constraints, we can enumerate possible pairs (p_1, p_2) that satisfy \( p_1 p_2=24 \), then filter those that meet the sum condition \( p_1 + p_2=11 \). Since the product is fixed at 24, possible natural number factors of 24 (with \( p_1 \le p_2 \)) are:

(1,24), (2,12), (3,8), (4,6)

Among these, only the pair (3,8) sums to 11, which satisfies the sum condition, and also maintains \( p_1 > 0 \) and \( p_1 \le p_2 \).

The difference \( p_2 - p_1 \) for this pair is \( 8 - 3 = 5 \).

Here's a program that computes and asserts this, see the comments for explanation.

```python
# Enumerate possible pairs (p1, p2) with p1 * p2 == 24 and p1 <= p2
# Then check for sum == 11 and p1 > 0
# Output each valid pair as soon as found
# The difference p2 - p1 is the answer we are looking for

possible_pairs = []
for p1 in range(1, 25):
    if 24 % p1 == 0:
        p2 = 24 // p1
        if p1 <= p2:
            if p1 + p2 == 11:
                print((p1, p2))
                difference = p2 - p1
print("Answer (p2 - p1):", difference)
```
