20071. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
Given the pattern of enumerated answers, the sequence appears to be integers close to multiples of 2007, with differences of either 0, 1, or 2. Noticing that all values are either `2007 * k`, `2007 * k + 1`, or `2007 * k + 2` for some `k`. The pattern suggests that for each integer `k ≥ 0`, the elements are `2007 * k`, `2007 * k + 1`, and `2007 * k + 2`.  
Hence, the general form can be expressed as the union over all `k ≥ 0` of these three values. But to create a closed form and avoid quantifiers, the set can be described as all numbers congruent to 0, 1, or 2 mod 2007.  
Therefore, the answer set comprises all natural numbers congruent to 0, 1, or 2 modulo 2007.

20071. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The main issue is the improper use of '<<<' and '>>>' delimiters outside of their context. These delimiters are meant to denote the expected answer content, not to be directly placed in the code. Additionally, the problem suggests that the set of all possible y satisfying the property should be a congruence class modulo 2007 with at most 2 as the residue; thus, the candidate answer `fun y : ℕ => y % 2007 ≤ 2` correctly captures this set: all natural numbers y such that y mod 2007 is in {0, 1, 2}.

Given the enumerated answers and the logical structure of the problem, the set of such y corresponds exactly to those y with y mod 2007 in {0, 1, 2}. The initial error is just about the syntax. To fix that, remove the delimiters and define the set as a function or predicate accordingly.

Final answer:
```lean
fun y : ℕ => y % 2007 ≤ 2
```
