This problem appears to involve polynomial identities and the roots of a cubic polynomial related to parameters \(a, b, c\). The polynomial equality suggests that \(a, b, c\) are roots shifted by some parameter \(T\), with the polynomial being monic of degree 3.

Given the polynomial:
\[
(X - C a)(X - C b)(X - C c) = X^3 - 20X^2 + 19X + C T
\]
and the roots are \(a, b, c\) scaled by some constant \(C\). We need to find an expression for \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\) in terms of \(T\).

**Approach:**
- Expand the LHS: \((X - C a)(X - C b)(X - C c)\).
- Match coefficients with the RHS.
- Express sums and symmetric sums of roots.
- The constant term gives \(a b c = -T / C^3\).
- The quadratic coefficient gives \(a + b + c = 20 / C\).
- The linear coefficient yields \(a b + b c + c a\).

Since \(a, b, c\) are roots scaled by \(C\), we can choose convenient small \(C\) to find relations. For simplicity, pick \(C=1\). Then the polynomial simplifies:
\[
(X - a)(X - b)(X - c) = X^3 - 20X^2 + 19X + T
\]
and root sums:
\[
a + b + c = 20
\]
\[
a b + b c + c a = 19
\]
\[
a b c = -T
\]

Now, for each \(T\), the roots \((a, b, c)\) satisfy these symmetric relations. To find possible sums \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\), note:
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(a b + b c + c a) = 20^2 - 2 \times 19 = 400 - 38 = 362
\]
which is independent of \(T\). But this is under the assumption with \(C=1\) and roots satisfying the given polynomial.

To verify and explore for other \(T\), we can try candidate roots or parametrize roots via the roots of the cubic. Since specific roots are complex to compute algebraically, an enumeration over possible \(T\) values and roots approximations can assist.

Below code enumerates sample \(T\) over a reasonable small range, solving for roots, and computes \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\).

```python
import math
import itertools

# Enumerate T over a small range, for example from -50 to 50
for T in range(-50, 51):
    # Coefficients of the cubic: x^3 - 20x^2 + 19x + T = 0
    a_coef = 1
    b_coef = -20
    c_coef = 19
    d_coef = T

    # Compute discriminant to check roots
    # Cubic roots formula: we can attempt to find roots numerically
    # Use Cardano's method for depressed cubic y^3 + p y + q = 0
    p = (3*a_coef*c_coef - b_coef**2)/(3 * a_coef**2)
    q = (2*b_coef**3 - 9*a_coef*b_coef*c_coef + 27*a_coef**2 * d_coef)/(27 * a_coef**3)

    discriminant = (q**2) / 4 + (p**3) / 27

    # If roots are real, proceed
    if discriminant >= 0:
        # compute three roots
        sqrt_disc = math.sqrt(discriminant)
        u = (-q/2 + sqrt_disc) ** (1/3)
        v = (-q/2 - sqrt_disc) ** (1/3)
        y1 = u + v
        y2 = -(u + v)/2 + (math.sqrt(3)/2)*(u - v)  # complex roots if discriminant<0, skip
        y3 = -(u + v)/2 - (math.sqrt(3)/2)*(u - v)
        roots = [y1]
        # For simplicity, ignore complex roots if discriminant>0, but in case of multiple roots
        # or consider approximate roots
        # Alternatively, use numpy's roots for robust solution
    else:
        # For complex roots, fallback: approximate roots numerically
        continue

    # For simplicity, use numpy's roots
import numpy as np

for T in range(-50, 51):
    coef = [1, -20, 19, T]
    roots = np.roots(coef)
    # Filter real roots
    real_roots = [r.real for r in roots if abs(r.imag) < 1e-6]
    if len(real_roots) == 3:
        a, b, c = real_roots
        sum_squares = a**2 + b**2 + c**2
        print(f"T={T}, roots={a:.2f},{b:.2f},{c:.2f}, sum of squares={sum_squares:.2f}")
```

**The code** enumerates Ts from -50 to 50, solves for roots of the polynomial, and computes \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\).

*Note:* Since roots are symmetric, for each T, the possible sums are consistent with symmetric sums derived earlier \(=362\).

This code helps verify the relation and supports conjecture about the answer being constantly \(362\) for all T, assuming roots are real and the polynomial factors accordingly.
