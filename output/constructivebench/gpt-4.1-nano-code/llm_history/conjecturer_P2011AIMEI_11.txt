Answer = 6. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the pattern of powers of 2 modulo 1000, the sequence repeats every 20 terms, with 2^20 ≡ 1 mod 1000. Summing 2^n over a full period yields 20 mod 1000 (since 2^n cycles through 20 residues). The total sum over all n ≥ 0 for the sequence modulo 1000 converges to (20 × number of periods) plus the initial sum pattern. 

Since the sum over one period is 20, and the total sum counts infinitely many periods, the sum modulo 1000 is 6 after summation.
