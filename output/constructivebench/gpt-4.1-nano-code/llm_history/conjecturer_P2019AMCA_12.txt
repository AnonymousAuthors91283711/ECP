. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
# Given the conditions, we can derive that:
# log_b 2 (x/y)^2 = (log_b 2 x - log_b 2 y)^2
# Since log_b 2 x = log_b y 16, we relate logs to find explicit x and y.
# Using the relation y * x = 64, express both in terms of logs and substitute back.
# The pattern indicates the squared value simplifies to 20.
# Hence, the answer is a constant 20.
