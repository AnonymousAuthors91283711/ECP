The problem states a system of equations involving real numbers g and p:

1. \( g = p + 1 \)
2. \( 14 \times (g + p) = 546 \)

Our goal is to find the exact value of g satisfying these equations and then print all possible solutions by enumerating potential candidates.

From the first equation: \( g = p + 1 \).

Substitute into the second:

\[
14 \times (g + p) = 546 \Rightarrow 14 \times (p + 1 + p) = 546
\]
\[
14 \times (2p + 1) = 546
\]
\[
2p + 1 = \frac{546}{14} = 39
\]
\[
2p = 38
\]
\[
p = 19
\]

Thus, \( g = p + 1 = 20 \).

Hence, the unique solution is \( g = 20 \).

Below is a Python script that verifies this solution and enumerates candidates around the feasible range:

```python
# Enumerate candidates for p near the found solution
for p in range(10, 30):
    g = p + 1
    if 14 * (g + p) == 546:
        print(g)
```
