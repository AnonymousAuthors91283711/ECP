abbrev P2012AMCA_25_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem P2012AMCA_25 : 
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ 2012 ≤ Nat.card {x : ℝ | abs (2 * Int.fract x - 1) = Int.fract (n * x)}} P2012AMCA_25_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n = 1, solutions ≈ 0
n = 2, solutions ≈ 5001
Found n = 2 with solutions ≥ 2012. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<2>>>
