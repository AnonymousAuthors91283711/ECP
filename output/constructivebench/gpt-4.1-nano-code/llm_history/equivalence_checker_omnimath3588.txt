Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: ∃ p : ℕ, p.Prime ∧ ∃ k ≥ 1, p = 3 * 10^(k+2) + 8 * 10^(k+1) + (10^k - 1) / 9

The proposed answer is mostly correct but has a minor issue with the summation expression. The ground truth uses a summation over a range, while the proposed answer uses `(10^k - 1)/9` which is equivalent to the sum of a geometric series `∑ 10^i` for `i` from `0` to `k-1`. However, the proposed answer should specify that this division must result in an integer (which it always does for integer k ≥ 1), making it technically correct but less precise than the ground truth formulation. The expressions are mathematically equivalent for k ≥ 1, but the proposed answer's formulation could raise questions about integer division.
