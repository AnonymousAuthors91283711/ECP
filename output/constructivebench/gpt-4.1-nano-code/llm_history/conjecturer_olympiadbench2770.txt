: z = (a + b * Real.sqrt 5 * Complex.I) * (c + d * Real.sqrt 5 * Complex.I) → min (a + b) (c + d) = olympiadbench2770_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found match: a=11, b=6, c=28, d=15
Found match: a=28, b=15, c=11, d=6
Minimal (a + b) or (c + d): 17. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the enumeration results and pattern, the minimal sum among a + b and c + d is 17, which occurs when (a=11, b=6) or (a=28, b=15) and similarly for c,d. The minimal sum is 17. Thus, the answer is 17.
