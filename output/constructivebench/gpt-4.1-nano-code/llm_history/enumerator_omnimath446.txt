This problem asks us to find the smallest positive integer n such that the sum of squares from 1 to n, when taken modulo 100, equals zero. In other words, find the least n > 0 with:

(âˆ‘_{i=1}^{n} i^2) % 100 = 0

We will generate values of n and their corresponding sums of squares, check the modulo condition, and print each candidate result immediately. To keep the output manageable, we'll limit to a reasonable range of n, say up to 500, which should suffice given the nature of the problem.

```python
# Enumerate n from 1 to 500 to find the minimal n where the sum of squares % 100 == 0
total = 0
for n in range(1, 501):
    total += n**2
    if total % 100 == 0:
        print(f"n = {n}, sum of squares = {total}")
        # Since we seek the minimal n, we can stop once found
        break
```
