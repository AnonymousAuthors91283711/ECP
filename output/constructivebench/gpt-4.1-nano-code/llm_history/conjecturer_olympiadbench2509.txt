Since equations involve logs with different arguments and bases, and the base \( a \neq 1 \), the pattern suggests the solution revolves around different specific bases: 2 and 3. Solving the system indicates the solution corresponds to the point where logs' values align with the given sum conditions, leading to the explicit triple: \( (a, b, c) = (2, -1, 3) \) which satisfies all equations and the conditions on \( a \). 

Hence, the singleton set is this triplet.
