r = 0.0, s = 0.0 -> coeffs: -0.0 (a), 0.0 (b) -> roots: {0.0}
r = 1.0, s = -2.0 -> coeffs: 1.0 (a), -2.0 (b) -> roots: {1.0, -2.0}. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the enumerated roots and coefficients, the entry with roots {−2, 1} corresponds to polynomial with coeffs {1, -2, 0} and degree 2, as {coeffs 0, 1, 2} = {0, -2, 1}. The total of the coefficients a + b + c = 0 + (-2) + 1 = -1, which matches a constant derived from roots. The relation between roots and coefficients for degree 2 polynomial p(x) = x^2 + bx + c is that sum of roots r + s = −b, and product rs = c. Here, sum is −1. Let's represent the roots as e.g., r = 1, s = -2, answer generalizes to sum of roots = −(b) corresponding to the polynomial's coefficient.

Thus, the total sum of the roots sum is −b. Based on the pattern and the roots {r, s}, and known relations, the total coefficient sum appears to be R + S, which in the particular case ansatz corresponds to the sum of roots.
