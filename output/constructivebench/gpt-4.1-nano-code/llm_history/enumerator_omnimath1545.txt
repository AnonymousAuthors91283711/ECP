This problem appears quite complex, involving a set of functions with certain injectivity and ordering properties, and the goal is to find the greatest such `m` (or related value). Given its high level of complexity, a practical approach is to explore small values of `m` for fixed small `n`, checking whether the conditions hold, and identifying the maximum `m` satisfying the constraints.

Our plan:
- For a fixed small `n` (say 3 or 4), iterate over increasing candidate `m` values.
- For each `m`, generate possible injections `P` from `Fin(m+2)` to `ℕ × ℕ` with the constraints:
  - No duplicates (injectivity).
  - Monotonicity in both coordinates.
  - No equal first coordinates among different points, no equal second coordinates among different points.
- Check whether such an injective, monotonic, and distinct-coordinate function exists.
- Record and print each `m` where the conditions can be satisfied.
- For a set threshold (say up to 10), print all candidate `m`.

Since the problem is highly combinatorial, the code emphasizes small-scale enumeration for clarity and efficiency.

```python
# Python code to enumerate feasible `m` based on constraints for small parameters
def test_m_for_n(n, max_m=10):
    # Check for each candidate m whether a valid P can exist
    for m in range(0, max_m + 1):
        # Define the domain size
        size = m + 2
        # Generate all possible injective mappings P from Fin(size) to ℕ×ℕ
        # with monotonicity and distinct coordinates constraints.
        # For small m, we can try simple increasing sequences
        found = False
        for p1 in range(50):  # small bounds to keep enumeration feasible
            for p2 in range(50):
                # Generate P i as a simple increasing sequence, for example:
                P = [(p1 + i, p2 + i) for i in range(size)]
                # Check injectivity
                if len(set(P)) != size:
                    continue
                # Check monotonicity
                if not all(P[i][0] <= P[i+1][0] and P[i][1] <= P[i+1][1] for i in range(size - 1)):
                    continue
                # Check that first and second coordinates are all distinct
                firsts = [p[0] for p in P]
                seconds = [p[1] for p in P]
                if len(set(firsts)) != size or len(set(seconds)) != size:
                    continue
                # All constraints satisfied for this P
                print(f"n={n}, m={m}: Found P = {P}")
                found = True
                break
            if found:
                break
        if not found:
            print(f"n={n}, m={m}: No valid P")
# Example usage:
test_m_for_n(3)
