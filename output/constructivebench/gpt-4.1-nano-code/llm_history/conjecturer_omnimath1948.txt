Given the problem constraints, the minimal such S satisfying all conditions, with the coin set including 100 and distinct positive coins covering all amounts from 1 to S, is S = 199. This is because coins of denominations 1 and 99 can cover all amounts up to 100+99=199, and adding coin 100 extends coverage appropriately.

<<<199>>>
