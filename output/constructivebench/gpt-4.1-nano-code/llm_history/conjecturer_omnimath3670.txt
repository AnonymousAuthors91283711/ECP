abbrev omnimath3670_answer : ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3670 (f : ℝ → ℝ) (hf : ∀ x, x > 0 → f x > 0) :
  (∀ x y, x > 0 → y > 0 → f (x * y + f x) = x * f y + 2) ↔ f = omnimath3670_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Linear function candidate: f(x) = 1*x + 1. Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
Based on pattern recognition, the function appears to satisfy a linear form with constant terms, fitting the candidate f(x) = x + 1. This matches the behavior of the functional equation under the positivity condition.
