The problem computes the average fuel consumption rates for a car and SUV over 2 distances, with total gallons combining both. The total gallons are \( \frac{d}{30} + \frac{d}{20} = d \left( \frac{1}{30} + \frac{1}{20} \right) = d \times \frac{1}{12} \). The total distance is 2d, so the average MPG is \( \frac{2d}{d \times \frac{1}{12}} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \).

Current Proposed Answer: The problem computes the average fuel consumption rates for a car and SUV over 2 distances, with total gallons combining both. The total gallons are \( \frac{d}{30} + \frac{d}{20} = d \left( \frac{1}{30} + \frac{1}{20} \right) = d \times \frac{1}{12} \). The total distance is 2d, so the average MPG is \( \frac{2d}{d \times \frac{1}{12}} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \).

. Enumerated Answers: 24.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The key issue is that the current proposed answer is a string (description) rather than a Lean expression of type ℝ. The line `abbrev P2007AMCB_2_answer : ℝ :=` expects an ℝ value, but the answer is provided as a comment or string, causing the syntax error. 

From the problem's mathematical derivation, the average MPG over both trips combined simplifies to 24.0, a real number. So, the correct Lean answer should be simply the ℝ literal `24.0`.

Given the derivation, the answer is a constant real number, and we can directly assign:

```lean
24.0
```

This satisfies the type ℝ and compiles without error.
