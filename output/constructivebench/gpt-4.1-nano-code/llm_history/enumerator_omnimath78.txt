This problem appears to involve primes \(p\) and \(q\), and the condition \(pq \mid 5^p + 5^q\). We want to identify pairs \((p, q)\) of primes satisfying this divisibility, then potentially define a set of such pairs.

To assist with heuristic exploration, I'll:
- Enumerate small prime pairs \((p, q)\).
- Check if \(pq \mid 5^p + 5^q\).
- Output the pairs that satisfy the condition immediately.

This will help conjecture the nature of such pairs without hardcoding solutions.

```python
# Enumerate small prime pairs and check divisibility
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

primes = [p for p in range(2, 50) if is_prime(p)]  # small sample of primes

for p in primes:
    for q in primes:
        pq = p * q
        sum_exp = 5**p + 5**q
        if sum_exp % pq == 0:
            print((p, q))
```
