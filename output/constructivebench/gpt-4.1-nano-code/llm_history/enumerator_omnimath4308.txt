This problem appears to involve finding pairs (a, b) of positive integers where the gcd of (a^n + b) and (b^n + a) stabilizes to a fixed value g for all large n. To assist in conjecturing and proving, we'll enumerate small positive integer pairs (a, b) with some bounds, check the gcd for increasing n, and record the eventual stabilized gcd. 

Here's the plan:
- For small a and b (say, up to 10) to keep computations manageable.
- For each pair, compute gcd(a^n + b, b^n + a) for n from N0 to Nmax (like 20).
- If the gcd stabilizes (becomes constant from some N onward), record the pair and the gcd.
- Print each finding immediately for streaming results.

This approach helps us explore the behavior systematically and may reveal patterns or candidate pairs.

```python
import math

max_a_b = 10
max_n = 20  # upper limit for n to observe stabilization
results = []

for a in range(1, max_a_b + 1):
    for b in range(1, max_a_b + 1):
        gcds = []
        for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
            val1 = a ** n + b
            val2 = b ** n + a
            gcds.append(math.gcd(val1, val2))
        # Check if the gcds stabilize (constant from some point)
        for start in range(len(gcds)):
            if all(gcds[start] == g for g in gcds[start:]):
                g_value = gcds[start]
                print(f"(a={a}, b={b}) stabilizes with gcd={g_value} from n={start+1}")
                results.append(((a, b), g_value))
                break
```

This code efficiently enumerates small pairs, detects stabilization of the gcd, and outputs pairs with their stabilized gcd, supporting conjecture and proof development.
