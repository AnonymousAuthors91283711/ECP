This appears to be a formal proof snippet in Lean involving real numbers and basic algebra. The theorem states an expression equal to some answer. The expression calculates \(2 \times 2^2 + 3 \times 2^2\), which can be computed straightforwardly.

Here's how to write a Python program that enumerates potential values for this expression, particularly confirming its exact value:

```python
# Compute the value of the expression: 2 * 2^2 + 3 * 2^2
# Since 2^2 = 4, the expression is 2 * 4 + 3 * 4 = 8 + 12 = 20
# The program prints the computed answer immediately.

answer = 2 * (2 ** 2) + 3 * (2 ** 2)
print(answer)
```

This program computes and prints the exact result, which is 20.
