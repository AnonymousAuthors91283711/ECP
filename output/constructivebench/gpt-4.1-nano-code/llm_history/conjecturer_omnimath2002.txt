. Enumerated answers: 8117. Expected Answer Type: ℤ
The functional equation resembles a form involving symmetry or averaging. Given the value at 2016 and 6102, and noticing the pattern that suggests a linear form, the final consistent answer, matching the pattern and known numerical relations, is 8117. 

<<<6102 + 2016 - 1>>>
