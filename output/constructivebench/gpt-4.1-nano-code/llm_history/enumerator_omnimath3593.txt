The problem involves a combinatorial argument with finite sets, edges, and constraints relating to degrees and the absence of certain triangle configurations, reminiscent of properties in graph theory and Ramsey theory. The goal is to find the largest possible integer \( n \) (the maximum cardinality of a set \( V \)) such that the specified conditions hold.

Given the constraints:
- Each vertex \( v \) in \( V \) has an incident edge coloring \( E v u \) with 3 colors (from \( Fin 3 \)).
- Every vertex \( v \) is *not* incident with all 3 colors simultaneously, i.e., for each \( v \), at least one color does not appear as an incident edge.
- No triangle \( u, v, w \) exists such that all three edges among them share the same color, i.e., no monochromatic triangles.

We can interpret this as a problem of finding a maximum size of a vertex set \( V \) in a 3-colored complete graph with no monochromatic triangle, and each vertex missing at least one color in its incident edges.

In classical Ramsey theory, the maximum size of a 3-coloring of a complete graph avoiding monochromatic triangles is related to the Ramsey number \( R(3,3) = 6 \). Since each vertex must miss at least one color in its incident edges, this further constrains the design.

Let's attempt to approximate the largest such \( n \), considering known small cases and the classic Ramsey bound:

- The standard Ramsey number \( R(3,3,3) \) (three-color case) is known to be 17, but this is about monochromatic triangles.
- For graphs with missing colors at each vertex, the maximum likely is smaller.

We'll directly test \( n \) from small values upward, and verify whether such configurations are possible under the constraints.

Below, the code enumerates candidate \( n \) from 1 up to a cutoff (say, 10) for feasibility, checking for the existence of such configurations (via combinative reasoning, assuming small \( n \)).

```python
# Program to estimate the maximum size n of a vertex set V with 3-color edges,
# no monochromatic triangle, and each vertex missing at least one color.

from itertools import combinations, product

# Check if a coloring with n vertices is possible under constraints
def can_construct(n):
    # Generate all possible edge colorings:
    # Represent edges as a dict with (u,v): color
    vertices = range(n)
    edges = list(combinations(vertices, 2))
    total_edges = len(edges)

    # For each vertex, define the incidents
    # We try to assign colors to edges such that:
    # 1. For each vertex v, it doesn't have all 3 colors incident
    # 2. No monochromatic triangle exists

    # We attempt one possible assignment per small n:
    # For large n, this is computationally heavy, so we limit to small n.
    # For demonstration, try a greedy/heuristic approach:
    import random

    # Generate a random coloring satisfying conditions
    # Retry multiple times
    for _ in range(100):
        color_map = {}
        # Assign random colors to edges
        for e in edges:

        def get_edge(u, v):
            return color_map[(min(u, v), max(u, v))]

                    c = get_edge(v, u)
                    incident_colors.add(c)
            # Vertex misses at least one color
            if len(incident_colors) == 3:
                valid = False
                break
        if not valid:
            continue

        # Check for monochromatic triangles
        has_mono_triangle = False
        for u, v, w in combinations(vertices, 3):
            edges_colors = [get_edge(u, v), get_edge(v, w), get_edge(w, u)]
            if len(set(edges_colors)) == 1:
                has_mono_triangle = True
                break
        if has_mono_triangle:
            continue
        return True  # Found a coloring meeting constraints
    return False  # No coloring found in attempts

max_n_found = 0
for n in range(1, 11):
    if can_construct(n):
        print(f"Possible for n = {n}")
        max_n_found = n
    else:
        print(f"Impossible for n = {n}")
