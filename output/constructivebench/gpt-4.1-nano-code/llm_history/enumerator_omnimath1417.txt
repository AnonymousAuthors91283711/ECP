This problem involves finding complex numbers \(k\) that satisfy two polynomial equations simultaneously, involving parameters \(a, b, c, d\), each nonzero. It appears to be a problem of solving a system of polynomial equations with constraints.

Given the symmetry, the key idea is to analyze the two equations:

\[
a k^3 + b k^2 + c k + d = 0
\]
\[
b k^3 + c k^2 + d k + a = 0
\]

and find all possible complex \(k\) satisfying at least one such set of parameters with the nonzero condition.

Because the problem is highly symmetric, a reasonable approach is to:
- Fix small sample values for parameters \(a, b, c, d\), all nonzero,
- For each such sample, compute the roots of the corresponding polynomial,
- Do this exhaustively over small integers (e.g., \(\pm 1, \pm 2\)) for parameters,
- Collect all \(k\) that are solutions, and stream outputs as soon as they are found.

No specific ground-truth answer is hardcoded, and the algorithm avoids unnecessary computations by limiting the parameter ranges.

Below is a Python program implementing this enumeration:

```python
import numpy as np

# Set small sample parameter values for a, b, c, d
param_values = [-2, -1, 1, 2]
# To avoid duplicates, store solutions in a set
solutions = set()

for a in param_values:
    for b in param_values:
        for c in param_values:
            for d in param_values:
                if a != 0 and b != 0 and c != 0 and d != 0:
                    # Polynomial equations can be represented as:
                    # Eq1: a*k^3 + b*k^2 + c*k + d = 0
                    # Eq2: b*k^3 + c*k^2 + d*k + a = 0
                    # Note: Given the symmetry, we find common roots of these two polynomials.
                    # One approach: solve Eq1 and check if the root satisfies Eq2.
                    # We'll find roots of Eq1 for current parameters.
                    coeffs_eq1 = [a, b, c, d]
                    roots_eq1 = np.roots(coeffs_eq1)
                    for k in roots_eq1:
                        # Verify if root satisfies Eq2
                        val2 = b * k**3 + c * k**2 + d * k + a
                        # Use a numerical tolerance for complex roots
                        if np.isclose(val2, 0, atol=1e-8):
                            k_real = complex(k)
                            if k_real not in solutions:
                                solutions.add(k_real)
                                print(k_real)

# Note: This code attempts to find roots for small parameter ranges.
# It prints each solution as soon as it is verified, streaming partial results.
```
