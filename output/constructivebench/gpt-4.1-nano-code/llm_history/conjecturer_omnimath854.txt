  Finset.card (Finset.filter (fun n => padicValNat 7 (n !) = padicValNat 8 (n !)) (Finset.Icc 1 2004)) = omnimath854_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 1

Total count: 4. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests that the count is based on a specific combinatorial property, likely related to the distribution of factorial prime valuations. Observing the enumerated answers 1, 2, 3, 7, the common pattern indicates powers of 7, and the pattern suggests growth by powers of 7, consistent with factorial valuations involving prime 7. The maximum boundary is 2004, and valuation equality occurs at predictable factorial steps. The resulting count aligns with powers of 7 up to 2004, giving 7^0=1, 7^1=7, and so on 2 and 3 in lower levels. The count is exactly 7, matching the largest or a recursive subset. 

Thus, the answer simplifies, stating the count as 7.

<<<7>>>
