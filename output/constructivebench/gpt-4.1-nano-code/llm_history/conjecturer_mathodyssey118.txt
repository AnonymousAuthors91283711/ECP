  mathodyssey118_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing n = 1
Testing n = 2
Testing n = 3
Testing n = 4
Testing n = 5
Testing n = 6
Testing n = 7
Testing n = 8
Testing n = 9
Testing n = 10
Testing n = 11
Testing n = 12
Testing n = 13
Testing n = 14
Testing n = 15. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the pattern, minimal n suffices for the covering and injectivity conditions; likely n=3 handles all cases, as the enumeration suggests increasing complexity. The solution is a minimal set capturing any positive function values on {0..99} with sums. The likely minimal n is 3.
