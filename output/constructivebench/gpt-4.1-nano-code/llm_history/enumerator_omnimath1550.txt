This problem asks about the cardinality of the set of all natural numbers \( n \) such that there exists an \( m \) with \( m^2 = n \), and additionally, \( m^2 \) divides \( 2^3 \times 3^5 \times 5^7 \times 7^9 \).

In simpler terms:
- \( n \) is a perfect square: \( n = m^2 \).
- \( m^2 \) divides the number \( 2^3 \times 3^5 \times 5^7 \times 7^9 \).

First, note the divisibility condition:
\( m^2 \mid 2^3 \times 3^5 \times 5^7 \times 7^9 \).

Since \( m^2 \) divides the number, the exponents of the prime factorization of \( m \) must be at most half the exponents in \( 2^3, 3^5, 5^7, 7^9 \) respectivelyâ€”because:

\[ m^2 = 2^{2a} \times 3^{2b} \times 5^{2c} \times 7^{2d} \]

and these exponents must satisfy:

\[
\begin{cases}
2a \le 3 \Rightarrow a \le 1 \\
2b \le 5 \Rightarrow b \le 2 \\
2c \le 7 \Rightarrow c \le 3 \\
2d \le 9 \Rightarrow d \le 4
\end{cases}
\]

But since \( m^2 \) divides the number, exponents \( 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d \) must be **even** and less than or equal to the respective exponents.

So the exponents for \( m \) in prime factorization are:

- For 2: \( 2a \le 3 \Rightarrow a \le 1.5 \), so \( a = 0 \text{ or } 1 \). But \( a \) must be an integer, and because it's in the exponent of \( m \):  
  \( 2a \le 3 \), so \( 2a \) is even \( \le 2 \), so \( 2a \in \{0, 2\} \Rightarrow a \in \{0, 1\} \).

Similarly for other primes:
- For 3: \( 2b \le 5 \Rightarrow 2b \in \{0, 2, 4\} \Rightarrow b \in \{0,1,2\} \).
- For 5: \( 2c \le 7 \Rightarrow 2c \in \{0,2,4,6\} \Rightarrow c \in \{0,1,2,3\} \).
- For 7: \( 2d \le 9 \Rightarrow 2d \in \{0,2,4,6,8\} \Rightarrow d \in \{0,1,2,3,4\} \).

Thus, all possible \( m \) are formed by:

\[
m = 2^{a} \times 3^{b} \times 5^{c} \times 7^{d}
\]
with:
- \( a \in \{0,1\} \)
- \( b \in \{0,1,2\} \)
- \( c \in \{0,1,2,3\} \)
- \( d \in \{0,1,2,3,4\} \)

Total number of such \( m \):

\[
2 \times 3 \times 4 \times 5 = 120
\]

Number of possible \( n = m^2 \):

for each \( m \), \( n = m^2 \)

Thus, the set of \( n \) is as many as these 120 \( m^2 \) values. These are distinct because different \( m \) give different \( n \).

Let's enumerate all such \( n \) values by iterating over all possible combinations of \( a, b, c, d \) and computing \( n = m^2 \).

---

```python
# Enumerate all combinations of exponents for m
# and output the corresponding n = m^2

# Prime exponents bounds
a_options = [0, 1]
b_options = [0, 1, 2]
c_options = [0, 1, 2, 3]
d_options = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

for a in a_options:
    for b in b_options:
        for c in c_options:
            for d in d_options:
                m = (2 ** a) * (3 ** b) * (5 ** c) * (7 ** d)
                n = m ** 2
                print(n)
```

This code outputs all possible \( n \) values satisfying the conditions, streamed directly when run.
