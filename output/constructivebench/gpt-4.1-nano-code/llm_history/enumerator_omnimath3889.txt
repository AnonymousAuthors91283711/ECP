The problem asks us to analyze certain 4-element subsets of positive integers that maximize a particular property related to their sum and pairs, involving divisibility conditions. To assist in conjecturing and possibly proving the theorem, we should generate all such 4-element subsets with positive integers, analyze the structure defined, and determine the set of maximal subsets according to that property.

Given the complexity, a practical approach is:
- Generate small 4-element sets of positive integers.
- For each, compute the sum, pairs, and the number of pairs whose sum divides the total.
- Find the maximum such pairs count.
- Collect all 4-element sets that attain this maximum.

This enumeration helps in understanding the potential greatest sets, which are candidates for the "greatest" set in the theorem.

```python
import itertools

# Generate candidate 4-element sets of positive integers up to a certain maximum
max_element = 20
max_cardinality = 4

# Store all sets that maximize the property
max_pairs_count = -1
max_sets = []

for A in itertools.combinations(range(1, max_element + 1), max_cardinality):
    s = sum(A)
    pairs = [(x, y) for i, x in enumerate(A) for y in A[i+1:]]
    # Count pairs where sum divides total sum
    count_divisible_pairs = sum(1 for x, y in pairs if (x + y) != 0 and s % (x + y) == 0)
    
    # Check if current count exceeds current maximum
    if count_divisible_pairs > max_pairs_count:
        max_pairs_count = count_divisible_pairs
        max_sets = [set(A)]
    elif count_divisible_pairs == max_pairs_count:
        max_sets.append(set(A))

# Immediately print all sets that attain the maximum property
for s in max_sets:
    print(f"Set: {sorted(s)}, pairs divisible count: {max_pairs_count}")
```
