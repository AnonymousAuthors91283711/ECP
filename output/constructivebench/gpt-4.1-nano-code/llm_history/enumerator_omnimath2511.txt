This problem appears to involve finding the size of a set \( S \subseteq \text{Fin } 16 \) that is characterized by a specific property: for every \( x \in S \), the element obtained by \( 2 \times x \mod 16 \) is also in \( S \). The property \( P \) defines a set \( S \) closed under the operation \( x \mapsto 2x \mod 16 \).

I'll analyze the structure of such sets and determine all possible \( S \) satisfying \( P \). These are invariant under doubling modulo 16, which means \( S \) is a union of orbits of this doubling map.

Let's compute the orbits of the elements of \( \text{Fin } 16 \):
- Starting with 0: orbit is {0} since \( 2 \times 0 \equiv 0 \).
- Starting with 1: \( 1 \to 2 \to 4 \to 8 \to 0 \), so orbit is {1, 2, 4, 8, 0}.
- Starting with 3: \( 3 \to 6 \to 12 \to 8 \),
but 8 is already in previous orbit, so orbit is {3, 6, 12, 8}.
- Starting with 5: \( 5 \to 10 \to 4 \), which is in an existing orbit, so orbit is {5, 10, 4}.
- Starting with 7: \( 7 \to 14 \to 12 \to 8 \),
already covered, so orbit is {7, 14, 12, 8}.
- Starting with 9: \( 9 \to 2 \to 4 \), already in the 1's orbit.
- Starting with 11: \( 11 \to 6 \to 12 \), in previous orbit.
- Starting with 13: \( 13 \to 26 \equiv 10 \), in previous orbit.
- Starting with 15: \( 15 \to 14 \to 12 \to 8 \), known orbit.

Distinct orbits are:
- O0: {0}
- O1: {1, 2, 4, 8}
- O3: {3, 6, 12, 14}
- O5: {5, 10, 13}
- O7: {7, 14, 12, 8} (overlaps with others)
- O9: {9} (since 9 leads to 2, which is in O1)
- O11: {11} (leads to 6/O3)
- O15: {15} (leads to 14/O3)

Actually, some orbits are overlapping; the key is that the orbits under the doubling operation partition the set. The minimal orbits are:
- {0}
- {1, 2, 4, 8}
- {3, 6, 12, 14}
- {5, 10, 13}
- {7, 14, 12, 8} overlaps, so the orbit is {7, 14, 12, 8}
- {9}
- {11}
- {15}

But because the map is quadratic, and these are closure orbits, the only possible \( S \) are unions of these orbits.

Now, the problem asks for the size of \( S \). For each orbit, either include all elements or none, to maintain the invariance property.

Let's generate all possible combinations and number the sizes.

Here's the plan:

- Enumerate all subsets of the set of orbits,
- Sum their sizes,
- Print the sizes as answers immediately.

This approach will give all possible sizes of \( S \), which satisfies \( P \). We can then identify the maximum and minimum sizes if needed. This enumeration is efficient as there are few orbits.

```python
# Enumerate all unions of the orbits under doubling modulo 16
# Since P defines S as closed under x -> 2x mod 16, S must be a union of these orbits

# Define the orbits
orbits = [
    {0},
    {1, 2, 4, 8},
    {3, 6, 12, 14},
    {5, 10, 13},
    {7, 14, 12, 8},  # overlaps with previous, so actually same orbit as {7,14,12,8}
    {9},
    {11},
    {15}
]

# Note: After analysis, the orbits are distinct sets:
orbits = [
    {0},
    {1, 2, 4, 8},
    {3, 6, 12, 14},
    {5, 10, 13},
    {7, 14, 12, 8},  # overlapping with previous; unique orbit: {7,14,12,8}
    {9},
    {11},
    {15}
]

# But to be precise, the orbits are disjoint subsets
# Let's recompute orbits with correct partition:
# Build a set of all elements and their orbits to avoid overlap
import itertools

elements = set(range(16))
visited = set()
disjoint_orbits = []

def orbit(start):
    result = set()
    to_visit = [start]
    while to_visit:
        x = to_visit.pop()
        if x not in result:
            result.add(x)
            y = (2 * x) % 16
            if y not in result:
                to_visit.append(y)
    return result

for x in range(16):
    if x not in visited:
        o = orbit(x)
        visited |= o
        disjoint_orbits.append(o)

# Now, enumerate all subsets of these orbits
# For each subset, sum sizes and print
for mask in range(1 << len(disjoint_orbits)):
    s_size = sum(len(disjoint_orbits[i]) for i in range(len(disjoint_orbits)) if (mask & (1 << i)))
    print(s_size)
```
