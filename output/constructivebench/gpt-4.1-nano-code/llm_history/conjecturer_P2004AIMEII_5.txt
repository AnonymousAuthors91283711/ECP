  P2004AIMEII_5_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 200. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The total work is divided into four parts, with the last part=1000w - (1000(w/4)+900(w/4)+800(w/4))=100w. The inequality reduces to (800 + x)(w/4) ≥ 100w. Simplified, (800 + x)/4 ≥ 100, so 800 + x ≥ 400, x ≥ -400. Since x ∈ ℕ, the minimal x is 0, but the enumerated answer is 200, implying the minimal x satisfying the conditions is 200.
