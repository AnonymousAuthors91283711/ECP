This problem involves finding quadratic polynomials \( P \) and \( Q \) with specific monic properties and root sets such that the roots of their compositions match given sets. 

We need to generate candidate quadratic polynomials with roots and then check the roots of their compositions, focusing on the roots automatically computed from polynomial roots. We also need to evaluate the sums \( p_{\min} + q_{\min} \), where \( p_{\min} = P(-\frac{P_1}{2}) \) and \( q_{\min} = Q(-\frac{Q_1}{2}) \).

Given the constraints, we'll:
- Enumerate monic quadratics \( P \) with roots from \(\{-23, -21, -17, -15\}\)
- Enumerate monic quadratics \( Q \) with roots from \(\{-59, -57, -51, -49\}\)
- Check the composition roots against the specified sets
- Compute \( p_{\min} + q_{\min} \) for each matched pair

The approach is to brute-force over possible root combinations, evaluate the compositions, and verify the sets of roots.

```python
import numpy as np
from sympy import symbols, Poly, roots, degree

X = symbols('X')

# Candidate roots for P and Q
roots_P_candidates = [-23, -21, -17, -15]
roots_Q_candidates = [-59, -57, -51, -49]

# Generate monic quadratics from roots
def monic_quadratic(r1, r2):
    a = 1
    b = -(r1 + r2)
    c = r1 * r2
    return Poly(a*X**2 + b*X + c, X)

# Helper to find roots of a polynomial
def poly_roots(poly):
    return set(roots(poly, X).keys())

# Enumerate all P, Q pairs
for rP1 in roots_P_candidates:
    for rP2 in roots_P_candidates:
        if rP1 == rP2:
            continue
        P = monic_quadratic(rP1, rP2)
        P_roots = poly_roots(P)

        # Compose P with Q: (P ◦ Q)(X) = P(Q(X))
        for rQ1 in roots_Q_candidates:
            for rQ2 in roots_Q_candidates:
                if rQ1 == rQ2:
                    continue
                Q = monic_quadratic(rQ1, rQ2)
                Q_roots = poly_roots(Q)

                # Compute P(Q(X))
                PQ = Poly(P.subs(X, Q.as_expr()), X).as_poly()
                roots_PQ = poly_roots(PQ)

                # Check root conditions for (P ◦ Q)
                if roots_PQ == { -23, -21, -17, -15 }:
                    # Compute Q(P(X))
                    QP = Poly(Q.subs(X, P.as_expr()), X).as_poly()
                    roots_QP = poly_roots(QP)

                    # Check root conditions for (Q ◦ P)
                    if roots_QP == { -59, -57, -51, -49 }:
                        # Compute p_min and q_min
                        p_min = P.eval(-P.coeff(X, 1)/2)
                        q_min = Q.eval(-Q.coeff(X, 1)/2)
                        answer = p_min + q_min
                        print('Found pair:')
                        print(f'P roots: {rP1}, {rP2}')
                        print(f'Q roots: {rQ1}, {rQ2}')
                        print(f'p_min + q_min = {answer}')

Let's analyze the problem and the code:

**Problem Summary:**
- Find monic quadratics \(P\) and \(Q\) with specified roots.
- Conditions on roots of compositions \(P \circ Q\) and \(Q \circ P\).
- Compute \(p_{\min} + q_{\min}\) where \(p_{\min} = P(-P_1/2)\) and similarly for \(Q\).

**Key Observations:**
- The code enumerates all root pairs for \(P\) and \(Q\), skipping identical roots to ensure quadratic polynomials.
- It computes compositions \(P(Q(X))\) and \(Q(P(X))\), then compares their roots with the target sets.
- It prints when such pairs are found; otherwise, no output.

**Issue:**
- The compositions \(P(Q(X))\) and \(Q(P(X))\) are higher degree polynomials (degree 4).
- The code computes roots of these compositions, but `poly_roots` relies on symbolic roots, which can easily fail or give zero roots for badly chosen polynomials or complex roots.
- The code is trying to find specific root sets, but root comparisons are delicate: floating-point inaccuracies or symbolic root-finding failures can cause the code to miss solutions.

**Why is the output empty?**
- The searches are exhaustive but may fail due to:
  - Parentheses and expressions evaluation in `Poly(P.subs(X, Q.as_expr()), X)` may not be symbolic enough.
  - Roots method may return complex or symbolic roots, and comparing sets of roots as integers may not be reliable.
- Notably, the code skips pairs where roots are equal, but the problem states monic quadratics, so roots may be repeated — but the problem likely expects distinct roots.

**Approach to fix:**
- Use `expand` before creating the polynomial to ensure the polynomial is fully expanded.
- Use numerical evaluation for roots, which can be more reliable.
- For composition, explicitly substitute \(X\) in the polynomial expressions to get a polynomial in \(X\), then find roots numerically.
- When comparing roots, check if the roots match within some tolerance due to numerical approximation.

**Decision:**
- Since the original code produces no output and does not find any solutions, it does not satisfy the problem's requirement to find the solutions. It should be rejected.
- The code can be fixed to
[refine_program]
The given problem involves polynomials with roots and compositions, and asks for a specific sum involving evaluations of the polynomials at a particular point. The code provides no implementation—it's just a theorem statement with a placeholder `sorry`. Since the code does not generate any answers, the enumerator outputs an error and does not produce any candidate solutions.

**Judgement:**
- The program does not produce any answers.
- The problem is algebraic and involves specific polynomial properties.
- For a math competition problem like this, enumeration with parameters or sampling small degrees is feasible; however, the current code essentially does nothing.
- To evaluate candidate solutions, the program should generate candidate polynomials, test their properties, and output the specific value `pmin + qmin` when conditions are met.
- The code should produce the answer immediately upon finding a valid polynomial pair.

**Therefore:**
- The original program is rejected: it produces no answers and does not fulfill the requirement to stream solutions.

**Corrected Program:**
Below is a simple enumerator that attempts to generate some candidate monic quadratics, checks their roots and compositions, and upon satisfying the roots criteria, evaluates `pmin + qmin`. Since the actual algebraic relationships are complex, a small discrete search over coefficient values is used to simulate candidate polynomials.

This is a simplified but illustrative approach for such a problem:

```python
import itertools

def generate_monic_quad(coeff_range):
    # Generate monic quadratics: x^2 + a x + b
    for a, b in itertools.product(coeff_range, repeat=2):
        yield [1, a, b]

def roots_of_quadratic(a, b, c):
    # Compute roots of a*x^2 + b*x + c = 0
    discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c
    if discriminant < 0:
        return None
    sqrt_d = discriminant**0.5
    root1 = (-b + sqrt_d) / (2*a)
    root2 = (-b - sqrt_d) / (2*a)
    return {root1, root2}

def evaluate_poly(coeffs, x):
    # evaluate polynomial at x
    return sum(c * x**i for i, c in enumerate(reversed(coeffs)))

answers = []

# choose small coefficient ranges for enumeration
coeff_range = range(-10, 11)
