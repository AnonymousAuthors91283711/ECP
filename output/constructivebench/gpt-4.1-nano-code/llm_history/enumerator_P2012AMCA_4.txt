This problem appears to involve manipulating variables representing counts of marbles, with a focus on proportional relationships, ultimately leading to a quotient involving an unknown answer. Since it's a high-school level problem, it likely involves simple algebraic relationships and ratios.

Given the assumptions:
- `b + r > 0` (positive total)
- `b = 3/5 * (b + r)` (blue marbles)
- `r = (b + r) - b` (red marbles)

From `hblue`, we see `b = 3/5 * (b + r)` => `b = (3/5) * (b + r)`.

Let `total = b + r`.

Since `b = (3/5) * total`, then:

```plaintext
b = (3/5) * total
```

and

```plaintext
r = total - b = total - (3/5)*total = (2/5)*total
```

We then consider new variables:

```plaintext
newb = b
newr = 2 * r
newtotal = newb + newr = b + 2*r
```

Expressed in terms of total:

```plaintext
newb = (3/5)*total
newr = 2*(2/5)*total = (4/5)*total
newtotal = (3/5)*total + (4/5)*total = (7/5)*total
```

The ratio `newr / newtotal = (4/5) * total / (7/5) * total = (4/5) / (7/5) = 4/7`.

Thus, the answer is `4/7`.

But per the instruction, I should programmatically verify and enumerate possible answers, especially if parameters or ratios can vary.

Therefore, I will select small sample values for `b` and `r` consistent with given relationships, compute the ratio, and print results. Since the exact solution appears to be always `4/7`, an enumeration over discrete small values should confirm this.

```python
# High-school algebra with small sample values to confirm the ratio
# b = (3/5)*(b + r), r = (b + r) - b
# Generate small total values and compute the ratio to verify the answer

def enumerate_ratios(limit=20):
    for total in range(1, limit + 1):
        # Find possible b that satisfies b = (3/5)*total
        if total * 3 % 5 == 0:
            b = (3 * total) // 5
            r = total - b
            # Compute new r / new total
            newb = b
            newr = 2 * r
            newtotal = newb + newr
            ratio = newr / newtotal
            print(f"total={total}, b={b}, r={r} => ratio={ratio}")

enumerate_ratios()
```
