abbrev omnimath3391_answer : â„• := sorry
theorem omnimath3391 : 9^4 = omnimath3391_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 3^8
Proposed Answer: 9^4
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is \(9^4\) and the ground truth answer is \(3^8\). These are equivalent because \(9 = 3^2\), so \(9^4 = (3^2)^4 = 3^{2 \times 4} = 3^8\). Therefore, the answers are mathematically identical.
