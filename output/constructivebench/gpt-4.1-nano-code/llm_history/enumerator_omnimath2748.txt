The provided code seems to be in Lean (a formal proof language), not Python, and appears incomplete with `sorry` placeholders. Since your request is for a Python program to explore possible answers to a problem, I'll interpret the core question as: "Find the value of `2 * 0 + 2 * 4` and verify it."

Given the expression `2 * 0 + 2 * 4`, the straightforward calculation is:
- `2 * 0 = 0`
- `2 * 4 = 8`
- sum = `0 + 8 = 8`

To assist in conjecturing and verifying, I will write a Python enumeration that confirms this and could be adapted to similar problems, showing that the answer is 8.

```python
# Enumerate possible sums of the form 2*a + 2*b for small non-negative integers a, b
# and find the specific value when a=0, b=4 as in the problem.

max_value = 10  # limit for enumeration
answers = set()

for a in range(max_value):
    for b in range(max_value):
        result = 2 * a + 2 * b
        print(f"2*{a} + 2*{b} = {result}")  # stream partial answers
        if a == 0 and b == 4:
            specific_answer = result

print(f"\nAnswer for a=0, b=4: {specific_answer}")
```
