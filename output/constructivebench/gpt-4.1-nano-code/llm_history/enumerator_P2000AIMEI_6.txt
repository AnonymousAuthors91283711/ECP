This problem involves analyzing integer pairs \((x, y)\) such that:
- \(0 < x < y < 10^6\),
- \(\frac{x + y}{2} = 2 + \sqrt{x y}\).

The key is to rearrange this algebraic equation to find all solutions.

Rearranged:
\[
\frac{x + y}{2} = 2 + \sqrt{x y}
\]
Multiply both sides by 2:
\[
x + y = 4 + 2 \sqrt{x y}
\]

Let \(s = x + y\) and \(p = x y\). Then:
\[
s = 4 + 2 \sqrt{p}
\]

Express \(\sqrt{p}\) as \(t\):

\[
s = 4 + 2 t \quad \text{where} \quad t = \sqrt{p}
\]

Since \(p = x y\),
\[
t^2 = p
\]

Now, note \(x\) and \(y\) are roots of the quadratic:

\[
z^2 - s z + p = 0
\]

with roots \(x, y\). Both \(x, y\) are integers, so the quadratic's discriminant must be a perfect square:

\[
D = s^2 - 4 p
\]

but 

\[
p = t^2
\]

and \(s = 4 + 2 t\):

\[
D = (4 + 2 t)^2 - 4 t^2 = 16 + 16 t + 4 t^2 - 4 t^2 = 16 + 16 t
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
D = 16(1 + t)
\]

Since the roots are integers, \(D\) must be a perfect square. Set:

\[
D = k^2
\]
then

\[
k^2 = 16(1 + t) \implies k^2 = 16 (1 + t)
\]

Let \(k = 4 m\), since \(k\) is divisible by 4:

\[
(4 m)^2 = 16 (1 + t) \implies 16 m^2 = 16 (1 + t) \implies m^2 = 1 + t
\]

Thus:

\[
t = m^2 - 1
\]

Recall \(t = \sqrt{p}\), and \(p = t^2\), so:

\[
p = (m^2 - 1)^2 = m^4 - 2 m^2 + 1
\]

Now, \(s = 4 + 2 t = 4 + 2 (m^2 - 1) = 4 + 2 m^2 - 2 = 2 + 2 m^2\).

So:

\[
s = 2 + 2 m^2
\]

Back to the quadratic:

\[
z^2 - s z + p = 0
\]

with:

\[
s = 2 + 2 m^2
\]
\[
p = m^4 - 2 m^2 + 1
\]

The roots:

\[
x, y = \frac{s \pm \sqrt{D}}{2}
\]

Recall \(D = 16 (1 + t) = 16 m^2\), so:

\[
\sqrt{D} = 4 m
\]

Thus:

\[
x, y = \frac{2 + 2 m^2 \pm 4 m}{2} = 1 + m^2 \pm 2 m
\]

which gives:

\[
x = 1 + m^2 - 2 m
\]
\[
y = 1 + m^2 + 2 m
\]

or vice versa.

Note \(x < y\):

\[
x = (m - 1)^2, \quad y = (m + 1)^2
\]

Because:

\[
x = (m - 1)^2,\quad y = (m + 1)^2
\]

These are integers for all integer \(m\).

Now, the constraints:

- \(0 < x < y < 10^6\)

Since:

\[
x = (m-1)^2, \quad y = (m+1)^2
\]

we need:

\[
0 < (m-1)^2 < (m+1)^2 < 10^6
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
(m-1)^2 > 0 \Rightarrow m \neq 1
\]
and

\[
(m+1)^2 < 10^6
\]

Find the maximum \(m\):

\[
(m+1)^2 < 10^6 \Rightarrow m + 1 < 1000 \Rightarrow m \leq 998
\]

At the lower end, for \(x > 0\), \(m \geq 2\) (since for \(m=1\), \(x=0\), invalid). For \(m=2\):

\[
x = 1^2=1,\quad y=3^2=9
\]

for \(m=998\):

\[
x= (998-1)^2=997^2=994,009
\]
\[
y= (998+1)^2=999^2=998,001
\]

which is less than \(10^6\), satisfying the conditions.

**Summary:**

- Valid solutions are for \(m=2, 3, \dots, 998\).
- Corresponding pairs:

\[
(x, y) = ((m-1)^2, (m+1)^2)
\]

**Number of solutions:**

\[
998 - 2 + 1 = 997
\]

**Python code: to generate all pairs efficiently**
```python
# Enumerate m from 2 to 998 and print the pairs (x, y)
for m in range(2, 999):
    x = (m - 1) ** 2
    y = (m + 1) ** 2
    if y < 10**6:
        print((x, y))
# Number of solutions:
print("Total solutions:", 998 - 2 + 1)
```
