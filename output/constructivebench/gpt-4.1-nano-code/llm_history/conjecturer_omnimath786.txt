open Set Real

abbrev omnimath786_answer : Set ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath786 (x : ℝ) : 
  (Real.exp (x * log 2) + Real.exp (x^3 * log 2) = 2 * Real.exp (x^2 * log 2) ∧ 
  (Real.exp (x * log 2) ≠ Real.exp (x^2 * log 2) ∨ Real.exp (x^2 * log 2) ≠ Real.exp (x^3 * log 2))) ↔ 
  x ∈ omnimath786_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Candidate solution x=0.00
2^0.00 = 1.0000
2^0.00 = 1.0000
2^0.00 = 1.0000
All exponential terms are equal.
Candidate solution x=1.00
2^1.00 = 2.0000
2^1.00 = 2.0000
2^1.00 = 2.0000
All exponential terms are equal.
. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
<<<{x : ℝ | (Real.exp (x * log 2) = Real.exp (x^2 * log 2) ∧ Real.exp (x^2 * log 2) = Real.exp (x^3 * log 2))}>>>

This set includes all x where the three exponentials are equal; simplifying shows this reduces to x=0 or x=1.
