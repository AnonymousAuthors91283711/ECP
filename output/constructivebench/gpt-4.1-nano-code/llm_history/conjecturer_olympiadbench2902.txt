Based on the pattern, the answer involves a rational number derived from dividing an integer by 12, specifically a linear expression. Given T=19, the number appears to be (T × 14 - 1) / 12, which simplifies the constructed pattern matching problem constraints.  
Hence, the closed-form expression generalizes to (T * 14 - 1) / 12.
