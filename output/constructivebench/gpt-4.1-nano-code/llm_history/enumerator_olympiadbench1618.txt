The problem resembles an equation involving cubes and a prime p:
\[ x^3 + y^3 = p(x y + p) \]
with conditions \( p \) prime, \( x, y > 0 \). The goal seems to find all triples \( (x, y, p) \) satisfying the equation, possibly for some fixed \( p \).

To approach this, I will:
- pick small prime values for \( p \),
- iterate over small \( x \) and \( y \),
- check if the equation holds,
- immediately print each solution found.

This helps in conjecturing the pattern of solutions, especially for small cases, which often clarify the general case or form a basis for proof.

```python
# Enumerate small primes and positive x, y
import math

primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]  # small primes for testing
max_xy = 20  # search up to 20 for x and y

for p in primes:
    for x in range(1, max_xy+1):
        for y in range(1, max_xy+1):
            lhs = x**3 + y**3
            rhs = p * (x * y + p)
            if lhs == rhs:
                print((x, y, p))
```
