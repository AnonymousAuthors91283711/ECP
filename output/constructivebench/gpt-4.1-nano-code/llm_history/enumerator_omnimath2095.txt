This problem asks us to find the greatest value of the expression \( p = 2 (f_0 f_5 + f_1 f_4 + f_2 f_3) \), given constraints: each \( f_i \geq 0 \), sum of all \( f_i \) is 1, with specific fixed squares \( f_0^2 = 0.04 \) and \( f_5^2 = 0.01 \). The variables \( f_1, f_2, f_3, f_4 \) are free (non-negative, sum to \( 1 - f_0 - f_5 \)).

To find the maximum, we test small sample configurations by fixing \( f_0 \) and \( f_5 \), then exploring possible \( f_1, f_2, f_3, f_4 \).

- \( f_0 = 0.2 \) (since \( 0.2^2=0.04 \))
- \( f_5 = 0.1 \) (\( 0.1^2=0.01 \))
- remaining sum for \( f_1, \ldots, f_4 \) is \( 1 - 0.2 - 0.1 = 0.7 \)

The goal: maximize \( 2 (f_0 f_5 + f_1 f_4 + f_2 f_3) \).

Since \(f_1, f_4, f_2, f_3 \geq 0\), to maximize \(f_1f_4 + f_2f_3\), we assign larger values to pairs.

For simplicity, fix \( f_1 = f_4 = t_1 \), \(f_2 = f_3 = t_2\) with constraints:

\( 2 t_1 + 2 t_2 = 0.7 \Rightarrow t_1 + t_2 = 0.35 \).

The product sum becomes:

\[
f_1 f_4 + f_2 f_3 = t_1^2 + t_2^2
\]

Maximize \( t_1^2 + t_2^2 \) with \( t_1 + t_2 = 0.35 \), \( t_1, t_2 \ge 0 \).

The maximum of \( t_1^2 + t_2^2 \) occurs at extremality: when one is as large as possible:

- \( t_1 = 0.35 \), \( t_2=0 \):

\[
t_1^2 + t_2^2 = (0.35)^2 + 0 = 0.1225
\]

Similarly, the value of \( p \):

\[
p = 2 (f_0 f_5 + f_1 f_4 + f_2 f_3) = 2 (0.2\, \times 0.1 + 0.125 + 0) = 2 (0.02 + 0.1225) = 2 \times 0.1425 = 0.285
\]

Alternative allocation strategies for varying \(f_0, f_5\) will produce similar calculations, but the key is to explore and find the maximal value across parameter choices.

Here's a Python code that enumerates feasible distributions, computes \( p \), and outputs possible maxima found:

```python
# Enumerate small sample values for f0 and f5
# f0^2 = 0.04 => f0 = 0.2
# f5^2 = 0.01 => f5 = 0.1
# Remaining sum for f1, f2, f3, f4: 0.7

# We'll test different splits of the remaining 0.7 among pairs (f1,f4) and (f2,f3).
# For simplicity, assume symmetric pairs: f1=f4=t1, f2=f3=t2
# with t1 + t2 = 0.35

# Generate candidate t1, t2 and compute p
max_p = -float('inf')
best_distribution = None

for t1 in [i/100 for i in range(0,36)]:  # 0 to 0.35
    t2 = 0.35 - t1
    if t2 < 0:
        continue
    f0 = 0.2
    f5 = 0.1
    f1 = f4 = t1
    f2 = f3 = t2
    p_val = 2 * (f0*f5 + f1*f4 + f2*f3)
    print(f"f0={f0}, f5={f5}, f1={f1}, f4={f4}, f2={f2}, f3={f3} => p={p_val}")
    if p_val > max_p:
        max_p = p_val
        best_distribution = (f0, f5, f1, f4, f2, f3)

print("Maximum p found:", max_p)
```

This code explores the configuration that yields the largest sum, highlighting potential maxima without exhaustive search, supporting conjectures about the best arrangement and approximate supremum.
