Expected Answer Type: List ℝ
The pattern in the sorted list suggests the values are ordered by magnitude related to their exponents, with the largest being 5^56, then 10^51, then 17^35, and finally 31^28. Considering the rapid growth of powers, the correct sorted list in increasing order is likely: [31^28, 17^35, 10^51, 5^56].

In Lean, this is expressed as:

  omnimath3332_answer = List.insertionSort (· ≤ ·) [5^56, 10^51, 17^35, 31^28] := by sorry. Current Proposed Answer: The pattern in the sorted list suggests the values are ordered by magnitude related to their exponents, with the largest being 5^56, then 10^51, then 17^35, and finally 31^28.

The main issue stems from using "abbrev" to define "omnimath3332_answer" directly as a list of real numbers, and then attempting to set a value with the "by sorry" proof, which is not valid syntax. Instead, the proper approach is to declare "abbrev" without immediate assignment, or define a constant with "def" and assign a list. 

Considering the pattern of enumeration, and the rapid growth corresponding to their exponents, the sorted list in increasing order (as indicated by the enumeration) is:

[1387778780781445675529539585113525390625, 572964121067545096123347421337293637543041, 11633549665058175578832094238737833478284593, 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000].

Expressed in Lean in a closed form, these are the original large constants seen in the enumerated answers, ordered from smallest to largest. To write this as a list in Lean, enclosing it with triple angle brackets per instruction:
