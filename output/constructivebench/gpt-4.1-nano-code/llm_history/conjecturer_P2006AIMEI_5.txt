. Enumerated answers: a=13, b=4, c=18 -> a*b*c=936. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests the product of the coefficients a, b, c, corresponding to the coefficients of the radicals, yields 936 based on the enumeration. Since the problem asks for the product `a * b * c`, and the only example corresponds to this product, the answer in closed form is 936.

<<<13 * 4 * 18>>>
