The problem involves a sequence of polynomials {a_n} satisfying a recurrence relation, with initial conditions a_1 and a_2, and examining the behavior of the sum of their roots as n approaches infinity. 

Since the sequence is defined with a linear recurrence, the roots' sums are related to the coefficients and the roots of the characteristic equation. For a second-order linear recurrence, the sum of roots (roots of a polynomial) often stabilizes or follows a predictable pattern.

Let's enumerate polynomial roots for small n to observe potential patterns. Here, the initial polynomials are provided, and the recurrence relation can be used to generate subsequent polynomials.

**Step-by-step plan:**
- Implement the initial polynomials a_1 and a_2.
- Use the recurrence to generate subsequent polynomials.
- For each polynomial, compute the roots and sum them.
- Since the roots are in ℝ, and polynomials are quadratic, roots can be computed explicitly.
- Print each sum as it is calculated.

This allows us to observe the behavior and guess the limit of the sum of roots.

```python
import numpy as np

# Initial polynomials coefficients
# a_1 = 3*X^2 - X
# a_2 = 3*X^2 - 7*X + 3

# Recurrence: a_{n+2} = (5/2) * a_{n+1} - a_n
# Implemented via coefficient vectors, starting from degree 2 polynomials

def generate_polynomial_coeffs(a1_coeffs, a2_coeffs, n):
    # Generate sequence of coefficients up to index n
    polys = [a1_coeffs, a2_coeffs]
    for _ in range(2, n):
        # Polynomial coefficients for next term
        # Need to perform: a_{n+2} = (5/2)*a_{n+1} - a_n
        # We use convolution coefficients if needed
        a_next = np.polynomial.polynomial.Polynomial(
            (5/2) * np.array(polys[-1]) - np.array(polys[-2])
        ).coef
        # Ensure coefficients are stored up to degree 2 for quadratic
        # Pad with zeros if necessary
        a_next = np.pad(a_next, (0, max(0, 2 - len(a_next)+1)), 'constant')
        polys.append(a_next)
    return polys

# Initial polynomials coefficients (constant term first)
a1_coeffs = np.array([-1, -1, 3])  # 3X^2 - X
a2_coeffs = np.array([3, -7, 3])   # 3X^2 - 7X + 3

# Generate up to, say, n=10
polynomials = generate_polynomial_coeffs(a1_coeffs, a2_coeffs, 10)

# For each polynomial, compute roots and their sum
for idx, coeffs in enumerate(polynomials[1:], start=1):
    # Polynomial coefficients in ascending order
    p = np.polynomial.Polynomial(coeffs)
    roots = p.roots()
    # Filter roots in ℝ
    real_roots = roots[np.isreal(roots)].real
    sum_roots = sum(real_roots)
    print(f"n={idx+1}, roots={list(real_roots)}, sum={sum_roots}")
