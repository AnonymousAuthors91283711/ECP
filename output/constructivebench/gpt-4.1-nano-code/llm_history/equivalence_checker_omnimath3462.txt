Ground Truth Answer: 14
Proposed Answer: 17
Let's analyze the proposed answer (17) against the ground truth answer (14) and the problem's conditions:

1. Divisibility by 3:
   - 17 % 3 = 2 ≠ 0 (satisfies first condition)
   - 14 % 3 = 2 ≠ 0 (also satisfies)

2. IsSquare condition:
   - 17 is not a perfect square (satisfies)
   - 14 is not a perfect square (satisfies)

3. Prime sum of digits:
   - digits of 17: 1+7 = 8 (not prime)
   - digits of 14: 1+4 = 5 (prime)

The proposed answer (17) fails the third condition while the ground truth (14) satisfies all conditions. Therefore, they are not equivalent answers to the problem.
