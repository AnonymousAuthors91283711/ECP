The problem involves accurately computing the sum of the decimal expansion: 4 + 3/10 + 9/1000. Since the goal is to enumerate potential answers and find an exact value, the program should perform the precise addition step-by-step and output intermediate exact rational representations before converting to decimal or float. 

We'll use Python's `fractions.Fraction` for exact rational calculation, which will help us avoid floating-point inaccuracies and provide precise numerator/denominator form.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Define components as exact fractions
whole_part = Fraction(4, 1)
part1 = Fraction(3, 10)
part2 = Fraction(9, 1000)

# Sum the parts step-by-step
sum_result = whole_part + part1 + part2
# Print the exact rational form
print(f"Exact sum as fraction: {sum_result}")

# Convert to decimal form with sufficient precision
decimal_value = float(sum_result)
print(f"Approximate decimal value: {decimal_value}")

# Additionally, print the decimal expansion to match the form 4 + 0.3 + 0.009
# Create detailed decimal expansion
print(f"Decimal expansion: {4} + {0.3} + {0.009}")
```
