The problem appears to involve finding integers \( H, M, T \) such that \( H \times M^2 \times T = H + 2M + T \), and then defining \( x \) as \( H \times M^2 \times T \), which should be the greatest such value. To assist in conjecturing the exact greatest value, I will generate possible solutions with small integer values for \( H, M, T \). I'll enumerate all options where these parameters are small (say from -10 to 10), check the equation, and output the solutions immediately when valid.

```python
# Enumerate small integer values for H, M, T to find solutions to H * M^2 * T = H + 2M + T
# Printing each found solution immediately to assist in conjecture.

max_param = 10  # limit for small enumeration
solutions = []

for H in range(-max_param, max_param + 1):
    for M in range(-max_param, max_param + 1):
        for T in range(-max_param, max_param + 1):
            # Avoid trivial case where M=0 could lead to division by zero if needed
            if M == 0:
                continue
            left = H * M * M * T
            right = H + 2 * M + T
            if left == right:
                x = left
                print(f"H={H}, M={M}, T={T}, x={x}")
                solutions.append(x)
```
