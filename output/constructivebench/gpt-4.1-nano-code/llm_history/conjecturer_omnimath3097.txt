abbrev omnimath3097_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3097 (a : ℝ) : 
    (3 * a - 7) / (a - 2) = 2 ↔ a = omnimath3097_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Trying candidate: a = 3
Test a=3: (3*3 - 7)/(3 - 2) = 2.0
Candidate solution: a = 3. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The solution reduces to solving (3a - 7)/(a - 2) = 2, which yields a = 3 after algebraic simplification. The expression is straightforward and does not depend on other conditions.
