The problem involves calculating the third distance traveled based on total distance and the two known distances traveled in given times. We want to find the value of `P2018AMCB_2_answer`, which equals the third distance divided by 0.5 (since 30/60 = 0.5). This is a straightforward calculation once the distances are known.

Let's first compute the first and second distances:
- first_distance = 60 km/h * 0.5 hour = 30 km
- second_distance = 65 km/h * 0.5 hour = 32.5 km

Total distance traveled in all three parts is 96 km. The third distance is:

third_distance = 96 - 30 - 32.5 = 33.5 km

Dividing by 0.5 hours:

third_distance / 0.5 = 33.5 / 0.5 = 67

Therefore, the answer is 67. For the code, we'll enumerate and print this value directly.

```python
# Calculate the distances traveled in the first two segments
first_distance = 60 * (30 / 60)
second_distance = 65 * (30 / 60)
total_distance = 96

# Compute the third distance
third_distance = total_distance - first_distance - second_distance

# Compute the answer: third distance divided by time (0.5 hours)
answer = third_distance / (30 / 60)

# Print the answer immediately
print(answer)
```
