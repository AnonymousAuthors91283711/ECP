This problem involves two equations with real variables p and q:
1. q = (2/5) * p
2. p * q = 90

From the first equation, substitute q into the second:
p * (2/5) * p = 90
which simplifies to:
(2/5) * p^2 = 90

To find p, solve:
p^2 = 90 * (5/2) = 90 * 2.5 = 225

Thus, p could be ±15. Correspondingly, q = (2/5) * p, giving q = ±(2/5)*15 = ±6.

The program will verify these solutions and print them.

```python
# Define candidate solutions for p based on the quadratic solution
p_candidates = [15, -15]

results = []
for p in p_candidates:
    q = (2/5) * p
    # Check if p * q equals 90 exactly
    if abs(p * q - 90) < 1e-9:
        print(p)  # Print all valid solutions for p
        results.append(p)

# Optional: if only one solution is needed (e.g. the positive one), could filter here.
```
