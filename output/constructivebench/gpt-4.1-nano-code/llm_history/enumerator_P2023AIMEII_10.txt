Let's analyze the problem: 

- We are considering injective functions `f` from a grid (2 rows × 6 columns = 12 points) to `Fin 12` (numbers 0 to 11). 
- The functions prevent adjacent points (in a grid sense) from mapping to numbers differing by a multiple of 3.
- We want to count how many such functions exist (`|S|`).
- The ultimate goal: compute `P2023AIMEII_10_answer` as the number of such functions.

Key observations:
- The grid has adjacency edges (vertical and horizontal).
- The `Adjacent` relation makes a grid graph.
- The functions assign numbers to points with the constraints: distinct, injective, and non-divisible differences of 3 for adjacent points.

Approach:
- Since the grid is small, enumerate all possible labelings considering the constraints.
- Use parameters: e.g., assign labels row-wise and check constraints.
- To avoid an explosion, consider fixed assignments for small parts (like fixing one point's label) and propagate constraints.

Due to complexity, we implement a backtracking enumeration:
- Fix a starting point's label.
- For each remaining point, choose labels consistent with the previous choices (injective and respecting adjacency constraints).
- Print each valid assignment immediately as being found.

Here's the code:

```python
# Enumerate all valid functions f: grid points -> {0,...,11}
# with injectivity and adjacency constraint: differences not divisible by 3.

from itertools import permutations

def main():
    points = [(0,i) for i in range(6)] + [(1,i) for i in range(6)]
    total_points = len(points)
    labels = range(12)
    adjacency = {}
    for i, p1 in enumerate(points):
        adjacency[p1] = []
        for j, p2 in enumerate(points):
            if p1 != p2 and (
                (p1[0] == p2[0] and abs(p1[1]-p2[1]) == 1) or
                (p1[1] == p2[1] and abs(p1[0]-p2[0]) == 1)
            ):
                adjacency[p1].append(p2)
    count = 0  # to track total count
    for perm in permutations(labels, total_points):
        f = {p: lbl for p, lbl in zip(points, perm)}
        # Check injectivity (permutations guarantee)
        # Check adjacency difference mod 3 ≠ 0
        valid = True
        for p in points:
            for nb in adjacency[p]:
                if (abs(f[p] - f[nb]) % 3) == 0:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if not valid:
                break
        if valid:
            count += 1
            print(f"Valid assignment: {f}")
    print(f"Total valid functions: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
