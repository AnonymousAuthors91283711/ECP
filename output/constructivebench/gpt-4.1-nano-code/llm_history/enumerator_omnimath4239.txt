The problem involves positive integers \(a, b, c, d, m, n\) with certain conditions:
- all of \(a, b, c, d\) are positive,
- their sum \(a + b + c + d = m^2\),
- sum of squares \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 1989\),
- the maximum among \(a, b, c, d\) equals \(n^2\).

We need to find the possible values of \((m, n)\) satisfying these constraints, specifically by enumerating feasible candidates since the problem refers to a proof involving parameters.

### Approach:
- Consider \(a, b, c, d\) positive and small enough so their sum is a perfect square \(m^2\),
- Since the sum of squares is fixed at 1989, find candidate maximums \(n\) such that \(\max(a, b, c, d) = n^2\),
- For each candidate maximum \(n^2\), generate all quadruples respecting the other conditions,
- Print candidates as they appear,
- Avoid hardcoding answers.

### Implementation:
- We'll fix small candidate values for \(n\) and \(m\),
- For each, generate possible quadruples respecting the constraints,
- Compute the sum and sum of squares,
- Check the maximum criterion,
- Output feasible \((m, n)\) pairs.

### Code:

```python
# Enumerate candidate (m, n) based on sums and maximums
import math

def main():
    max_output_tokens = 400
    printed_answers = set()
    # Iterate over small candidates for m (since sum a+b+c+d = m^2 and a,b,c,d > 0)
    for m in range(1, 50):  # limit to reasonable range
        m_sq = m * m
        # We know total sum of a,b,c,d is m^2
        # Iterate over possible maximums for a,b,c,d
        for n in range(1, int(math.sqrt(1989)) + 2):
            max_val = n * n
            # a, b, c, d are positive integers <= max_val
            # Generate candidates where max(a,b,c,d) = max_val
            # Iterate over possible quadruples with max value = max_val
            for a in range(1, max_val + 1):
                for b in range(1, max_val + 1):
                    for c in range(1, max_val + 1):
                        for d in range(1, max_val + 1):
                            if max(a, b, c, d) != max_val:
                                continue
                            s = a + b + c + d
                            s_sq = a*a + b*b + c*c + d*d
                            if s == m_sq and s_sq == 1989:
                                candidate = (m, n)
                                if candidate not in printed_answers:
                                    print(f"Candidate found: (m, n) = ({m}, {n}) with max={max_val}")
                                    printed_answers.add(candidate)

main()
```

This code systematically searches small ranges for \((m, n)\) and quadruples \((a, b, c, d)\) that satisfy the constraints. It outputs candidates as soon as it finds any matching quadruples.
