  ∃ m n : ℕ, 0 < m ∧ 0 < n ∧ Coprime m n ∧ m/n = 2/5 + 8/25 ∧ m + n = P2000AIMEII_1_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 43. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The sum 2/5 + 8/25 simplifies to 14/25. To find coprime integers m and n with m/n = 14/25, choose m=14, n=25, which are coprime, and m + n = 39. This pattern suggests the answer is 39.

<<<37 + 2>>>
