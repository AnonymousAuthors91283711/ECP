[write_program]
The given code defines several concepts related to a grid and a special kind of square with conditions on a function `f`, along with an abstract statement about the minimal number of uphill paths over such functions. The problem appears to involve enumerating all possible uphill paths and evaluating the minimal number of such paths for varying `f`. To assist conjecturing, I will implement a simplified enumeration focusing on small `n` (like 2 or 3), generate candidate functions `f`, check the conditions, and count the number of uphill paths. The code will print each candidate as it evaluates, prioritizing answers, and avoid hardcoding.

```python
# Python program to enumerate candidate functions for small n (e.g., n=2),
# verify their properties, count uphill paths, and print intermediate answers.

def enumerate_candidates(n):
    from itertools import product, permutations
    # Create all possible functions: assign each (i,j) a value in [0, n^2-1].
    # For small n, this is feasible.
    max_value = n * n
    coords = list(product(range(n), repeat=2))
    total_functions = list(product(range(max_value), repeat=len(coords)))
    for idx, values in enumerate(total_functions):
        f = dict(zip(coords, values))
        # Check if f forms a Nordic square: all values distinct.
        vals = set(values)
        if len(vals) != len(values) or len(values) != n * n:
            continue
        # Build the matrix form for easier checking
        matrix = [[f[(i, j)] for j in range(n)] for i in range(n)]
        # Check if values cover all [0, n^2-1]
        if set(values) != set(range(max_value)):
            continue
        # For simplicity, consider as Nordic square candidate.
        # Count uphill paths: paths with strictly increasing values at adjacent cells.
        paths_count = 0
        visited_paths = set()

        def dfs(path, i, j):
            nonlocal paths_count
            for di, dj in [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)]:
                ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
                if 0 <= ni < n and 0 <= nj < n:
                    if (i,j,ni,nj) not in visited_paths:
                        if matrix[ni][nj] > matrix[i][j]:
                            visited_paths.add((i,j,ni,nj))
                            paths_count +=1
                            dfs(path+[(ni,nj)], ni, nj)
        # Initiate path search from each cell
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                dfs([(i,j)], i, j)
        # Print candidate and uphill path count
        print(f"Candidate {idx+1}: {f}, uphill paths: {paths_count}")

# Main execution: for n=2 small enough
if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = 2
    enumerate_candidates(n)
