This problem involves exploring the existence of a polynomial P over â„š with specific properties: for all natural numbers x with digits in non-decreasing order, P(x) evaluates to an integer, but for some integer x, P(x) never hits any integer value. Given the complexity, I will attempt small polynomials and small x values to see if such polynomials can be constructed or disproved.

The approach:
- Fix small polynomial degrees (0, 1, 2).
- For small sample x values (say from 0 to 20).
- Check if there's a polynomial fitting these conditions, especially focusing on the pattern of digits and the evaluation to integers.
- As the problem involves an existential quantifier over polynomials, we mostly test candidate polynomials.

Below is a Python program that enumerates simple polynomial candidates (constant, linear, quadratic) and evaluates their behavior on small sample x-values with non-decreasing digit sequences, printing promising cases for further analysis.

```python
import itertools

# Generate x with non-decreasing digits in base 10, for small numbers
def generate_non_decreasing_digit_numbers(max_digits=3):
    results = []
    for length in range(1, max_digits + 1):
        for digits in itertools.product(range(10), repeat=length):
            if all(digits[i] <= digits[i+1] for i in range(length - 1)):
                num = 0
                for d in digits:
                    num = num * 10 + d
                results.append(num)
    return results

# Evaluate candidate polynomial at x
def evaluate_poly(coeffs, x):
    return sum(c * (x ** i) for i, c in enumerate(coeffs))

# Check if polynomial outputs integers for these xs
def check_poly_for_integers(coeffs, xs):
    for x in xs:
        val = evaluate_poly(coeffs, x)
        if abs(val - round(val)) > 1e-8:
            return False
    return True

def main():
    xs = generate_non_decreasing_digit_numbers()
    print("Sample x values with non-decreasing digits:", xs)
    max_deg = 2
    # Enumerate constant polynomials
    for c in range(-5, 6):
        coeffs = [c]
        if check_poly_for_integers(coeffs, xs):

    for a in range(-2, 3):

            coeffs = [b, a]
            if check_poly_for_integers(coeffs, xs):
                print(f"Linear polynomial: P(x) = {a}*x + {b}")
                for x in xs:

                if check_poly_for_integers(coeffs, xs):
                    print(f"Quadratic polynomial: P(x) = {a}*x^2 + {b}*x + {c}")
                    for x in xs:
                        print(f"P({x}) = {evaluate_poly(coeffs, x)}")
