This problem appears to involve complex algebraic and set-theoretic constructions, possibly related to polynomial roots over integers and iterative set closures. Since the original code references Lean and Mathlib, but asks for a Python enumeration, I will focus on simulating the set iteration process with small parameters to hypothesize the possible size of the closure.

Given the initial set S0 = {0, 10}, S_step generates new elements that are roots of non-zero integer-coefficient polynomials with all coefficients in the current set. Because polynomial roots over integers are generally algebraic integers, with simple cases like linear or constant polynomials, the most direct candidates for roots are the elements of the current set or their simple algebraic combinations.

To approximate the reachable set and its cardinality, I'll consider linear polynomials with coefficients in S, which can yield simple linear equations x * a + b = 0, leading to x = -b / a, provided that a ≠ 0 and the result is an integer. We'll iterate this process for small sets and record the unique elements.

Here's the plan:
- Initialize S0
- Generate S1 considering polynomials with coefficients in S0
- Generate S2 considering polynomials with coefficients in S0 ∪ S1
- Count the unique elements in the accumulated set
- Since the problem involves unknown parameters, I will just output the size of the set after these steps as a conjecture.

```python
# Enumerate elements in the closure starting from initial set S0
S0 = {0, 10}
S1 = set()
# Generate roots of linear polynomials with coefficients in S0
for a in S0:
    for b in S0:
        if a != 0:
            root = -b / a
            if root.is_integer():
                S1.add(int(root))
# Generate next step with larger set
S2 = set()
s_all = S0.union(S1)
for a in s_all:
    for b in s_all:
        if a != 0:
            root = -b / a
            if root.is_integer():
                S2.add(int(root))
# Combine all
S_closure = S0.union(S1).union(S2)
print(f"Size of S_closure after 2 steps: {len(S_closure)}")
# Output elements for conjecture
print(f"Elements in S_closure: {sorted(S_closure)}")
```
