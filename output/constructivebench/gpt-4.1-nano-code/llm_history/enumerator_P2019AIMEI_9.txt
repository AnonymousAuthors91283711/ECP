Let's analyze the problem. The goal is to find a list of six natural numbers `ns` such that:

- `ns.length = 6`
- `ns` is sorted in non-decreasing order
- For each `n` in `ns`, `(number_of_divisors(n) + number_of_divisors(n+1)) = 7`
- `s = sum of the elements in ns`
- The overall parameter `s` is the least such sum

Given the divisor sum condition, for a number `n`, `(divisors.count + (n+1).divisors.count) = 7`. Since common divisor counts are small integers for small `n`, and the divisor function is multiplicative.

We can enumerate all `n` with low divisor counts and see what pairs `(divisors.count, (n+1).divisors.count)` sum to 7:

Possible pairs:
- (1, 6)
- (6, 1)
- (2, 5)
- (5, 2)
- (3, 4)
- (4, 3)

Numbers with divisor counts:
- 1: 1 (divisors: 1)
- 2: divisors: 1,2 (2)
- 3: divisors: 1,3 (2)
- 4: divisors: 1,2,4 (3)
- 5: divisors: 1,5 (2)
- 6: divisors: 1,2,3,6 (4)
- 8: divisors: 1,2,4,8 (4)
- 9: divisors: 1,3,9 (3)
- 10: divisors: 1,2,5,10 (4)

We see that numbers with divisor counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 are manageable.

Let's find candidates matching the divisor count patterns:

Pairs:
- For divisor count of n being 1 (n=1), then `(n+1)` must have divisor count 6 → no number with count 6 less than or equal to 10. No such `(n, n+1)` pair.

Similarly, for divisor count 2, `(n+1)` requires divisor count 5 → no small candidates for count 5 with n+1 <= 10.

The feasible pairs with small n are:
- (2, 5): for n with divisors=2 and n+1 with divisors=5
- (3,4): for n with divisors=3 and n+1 with divisors=4

Check:
- divisor count 2: n = 2, 3, 5, 10
- divisor count 3: n=4, 9
- divisor count 4: n=6, 8, 10
- divisor count 5: n=16, 31, 60, etc.

Within small numbers, candidates are:

`n` with 2 divisors: 2,3,5,10.

`n+1` with 5 divisors: 16, 31, 60, ... (but these are large).

Check for the (3,4) pair:
- n=4 (divisors=3), n+1=5 (divisors=2) ? no, sum=3+2=5 ≠7
- n=9 (divisors=3), n+1=10 (divisors=4) sum=3+4=7 **OK**

Similarly, for pair (2,5):
- n=2 (divisors=2), n+1=3 (divisors=2) sum=4
- n=3 (divisors=2), n+1=4 (divisors=3): sum= 2+3=5

No.

So only `n=9`, `n+1=10` works for the pair (3,4), sum=7.

Now, to minimize the total sum over 6 such numbers, we **prefer the smallest** eligible candidates.

From above, `n=9`, `n+1=10`.

Check for others:

- For divisor count 1: only n=1 (divisors=1), then (n+1) must have 6 divisors, which are 1,2,3,4,6,8,10,... no.

- For divisor count 4: n=6,8,10. But `6+1=7`, divisors=2, sum=4+2=6 not 7; `8+1=9`, divisors=3, sum=4+3=7 OK; similarly for 10+1=11, divisors=2 → sum 4+2=6 not good.

So only `n=8` with `divisors=4` and `n+1=9` with divisors=3` works.

Total sum candidates:

- 8 and 9 are both small. Let's find other such pairs with minimal values.

So constructed candidate numbers:

- From earlier analysis, promising candidates are:

`(8, 9)`

Now, to form six numbers satisfying the divisor count conditions - the main challenge is to find 6 numbers satisfying `(n's divisor count + (n+1)'s divisor count) = 7`.

Given the small explorations, perhaps the simplest set with minimal total sum is repeating small such pairs.

Suppose we try to include:

- 8 (divisors=4), 9 (div=3)
- For pairing, we need zeros, but only 6 total numbers, and with more combinations.

Alternatively, considering that the problem probably aims at the minimal sum, using multiple 8 or 9 or similar small candidates.

Possible candidate list:

- 8 (div=4), next 9 (div=3), total sum=17

Repeat 8 and 9 multiple times:

- Since the pairs are independent, picking several 8's and 9's in the list.

To minimize total sum, prefer smaller numbers with counts 2 or 3; so 8 and 9.

Hence, an example of 6 numbers: [8,8,8,8,8,8], all have divisor counts=4, n+1 also 8+1=9 (div=3), sum=4+3=7 satisfied.

Check each:

- For each 8, n=8 divisor count=4.

- For n+1=9, divisor count=3, sum=4+3=7.

In list, all 8's, sum = 8*6=48.

But if we include the mixture:

- 8s and 9s in the list.

So, perhaps:

List: [8,8,8,9,9,9]

Sum: 8*3 + 9*3 = 24 + 27 = 51.

Is sum smaller? Well, 48 with all 8's.

Since the goal is minimal total sum, the minimal solution is with all small numbers satisfying the divisor conditions.

The minimal such sets are:

- All 8's (sum=48), because 8 has divisors=4, and 9 has divisors=3, the pairs satisfy the sum condition.

Thus, the minimal sum s=48 achieved by ns = [8,8,8,8,8,8].

**In code,** we can generate:

- All numbers n where `(divisors.count(n) + divisors.count(n+1)) = 7`.

- For small n, check the divisor counts.

- Pick the six smallest such `n`.

Let's write the code accordingly.

```python
# Enumerate small integers with specific divisor counts and find the minimal sum
import math

def divisors_count(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1 if i * i == n else 2
    return count

# Collect candidates for n where (divisors_count(n) + divisors_count(n+1))=7
candidates = []
for n in range(1, 100):
    dc = divisors_count(n)
    dc_next = divisors_count(n + 1)
    if dc + dc_next == 7:
        candidates.append(n)

# Sort candidates to find smallest
candidates = sorted(set(candidates))
# We want to select six such numbers to minimize sum
# Choose the six smallest
ns = candidates[:6]

# Print each number immediately
for n in ns:
    print(n)

# Compute and print sum
print("Total sum:", sum(ns))
```
