theorem P2013AIMEII_3 :
  let totalTime := ∑ k in Finset.range 119, 10 * (k + 1)
  let halfTime := totalTime / 2
  let heightAtHalfTime := 119 - (Finset.card {k ∈ Finset.range 119 | ∑ i in Finset.range k, 10 * (i + 1) ≤ halfTime})
  10 * heightAtHalfTime = P2013AIMEII_3_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 35
Proposed Answer: 360
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves calculating a height at half the total time of a process where each step takes 10*(k+1) seconds for k from 0 to 118 (119 steps total).

2. The ground truth answer is 35, which would correspond to a height of 3.5 (since the answer is 10 * heightAtHalfTime).

3. The proposed answer is 360, which would correspond to a height of 36.

4. The correct calculation should show that at half time, the process has completed up to some point where the cumulative time reaches half of the total time, and the remaining height would indeed correspond to a value that when multiplied by 10 gives 35.

The proposed answer of 360 is significantly different from the correct answer of 35, and there's no reasonable interpretation where these could be equivalent.
