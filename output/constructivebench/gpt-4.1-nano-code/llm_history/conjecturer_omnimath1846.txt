Total monotone functions: 20. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests counting monotone (non-decreasing) functions from a domain of size 3 to range of size 2. The total number of such functions is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{3 + 2 - 1}{2 - 1} = \binom{4}{1} = 4\). (Number of weakly increasing functions corresponds to placing 3 items into 2 bins.) 

Thus, the answer is 4.

Total monotone functions: 20. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The current proposed answer `fun _ => 4` defines an anonymous function, which does not have type ℕ, but rather a function type. The variable `abbrev omnimath1846_answer : ℕ := sorry` expects a value of type ℕ, not a function. 

Given that the enumerated answers are integers from 1 to 20, and the problem asks for the total count of certain monotone functions, the logical approach is to produce a constant ℕ value reflecting the total count. The enumerated answers range from 1 to 20, and the correct answer in context appears to be 20, matching the total number of such functions.

Therefore, the correction involves replacing the function with the explicit numeral 20, which has type ℕ, satisfying the expected type.
