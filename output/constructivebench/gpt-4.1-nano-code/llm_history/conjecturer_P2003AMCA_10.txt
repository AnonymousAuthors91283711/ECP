abbrev P2003AMCA_10_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem P2003AMCA_10 :
  let total := 3 + 2 + 1
  let first_take := 3 / total
  let remaining_after_first := 1 - first_take
  let second_take := 2 / total * remaining_after_first
  let remaining_after_second := remaining_after_first - second_take
  let third_take := 1 / total * remaining_after_second
  let unclaimed := 1 - (first_take + second_take + third_take)
  unclaimed = P2003AMCA_10_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Total: 6
First take: 1/2
Remaining after first: 1/2
Second take: 1/6
Remaining after second: 1/3
Third take: 1/18
Unclaimed: 5/18. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
<<<(5 : ℚ) / 18>>>

The unclaimed portion is consistently 5/18 from the calculations, regardless of total adjustments, indicating the answer is a fixed rational value.
