120. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Because the sequence involves factorial sums with constraints, the pattern suggests specific values related to factorials and their sums. The set of n satisfying P(n) includes these particular numbers, which are divisors and related to factorial arrangements. Observing the pattern and enumerated answers, the maximum value within 1 to 240 aligned with factorial sums is 153, and the sequence appears based on factorial-like structures. Therefore, the answer, capturing the maxima in the sequence, is 153.
