The problem appears to be about finding the least rational number \(k\) of the form \(k = 3 - \frac{m}{n}\), where \(m,n\) are natural numbers satisfying certain inequalities, specifically with \(0 < m \leq 2000\), \(0 < n\), and \(k > 0\). 

We're to find the minimal such \(k\). Since \(k = 3 - \frac{m}{n}\), minimizing \(k\) is equivalent to maximizing \(\frac{m}{n}\) subject to the constraints, because \(k\) decreases as \(\frac{m}{n}\) increases.

Given:
- \(m \leq 2000\),
- \(m > 0\),
- \(n > 0\),
- \(k=3 - \frac{m}{n} > 0 \Rightarrow \frac{m}{n} < 3\).

Thus, \(\frac{m}{n}\) must be less than but as close to 3 as possible, with \(m \leq 2000\). To find the minimal \(k\), we should choose \(m\) as large as possible (\(m=2000\)), and for that \(m\), pick \(n\) as small as possible (which is 1) to maximize \(\frac{m}{n}\).

So the candidate for minimal \(k\):

\[
k = 3 - \frac{2000}{1} = 3 - 2000 = -1997
\]

But note that \(k > 0\), so we need to consider the largest \(\frac{m}{n}\) less than 3 with these constraints, which essentially is just less than 3, with \(m/n\) approaching 3 from below.

- Best choice for maximum \(m/n\) less than 3:

\[
m = 2000, n = 1
\]
which yields \(m/n=2000\).

But since \(2000/1=2000\) is way more than 3, and that would give \(k=-1997\), not greater than zero, violating the \(k > 0\) constraint.

So, the actual maximum \(\frac{m}{n}\) less than 3 with \(m \leq 2000\), \(n \ge 1\), is just less than 3.

Specifically, for the minimal \(k > 0\), we want \(\frac{m}{n}\) as close to 3 as possible, less than 3. The supremum is 3, but it's not attained. The minimal \(k\) approaches \(3-3=0\) but must be greater than zero, so the infimum is 0.

Therefore, the minimal \(k\) is just above 0, achieved for \(m/n \to 3^-\).

To numerically approximate the smallest positive \(k\), we can choose \(m=2000\), \(n=670\), since \(2000/670 \approx 2.98507\), very close to 3, but less than 3:

\[
k \approx 3 - \frac{2000}{670} \approx 3 - 2.98507 \approx 0.01493
\]

This suggests the minimal \(k\) is just above zero, but to formalize, let me generate candidate answers for \(m/n\) slightly less than 3, like \(m=2000\), \(n=670\).

Here's a simple enumeration: We'll pick \(m=2000\), for \(n\) from 1 to 670, and find the resulting \(k\). The smallest positive \(k\) would correspond to the largest \(\frac{m}{n}\) just below 3.

Below is a Python program that enumerates representative candidates with \(m=2000\), varying \(n\), to find those approaching \(k\to 0^+\):

```python
# Search for rational numbers m/n close to 3 from below with constraints m <= 2000, n > 0
# We pick m=2000 for maximum m, and vary n to find fractions less than 3
max_m = 2000
min_k = float('inf')
best_candidates = []

for n in range(1, 2001):  # n up to 2000
    m = int((3 - 1e-8) * n)  # m just under 3*n
    if m <= 0 or m > max_m:
        continue
    k = 3 - (m / n)
    if k > 0 and k < min_k:
        min_k = k
        best_candidates = [(m, n, k)]
    elif k > 0 and abs(k - min_k) < 1e-8:
        best_candidates.append((m, n, k))

for m, n, k in best_candidates:
    print(f"m = {m}, n = {n}, k = {k}")
```

This script logs candidates where \(\frac{m}{n}\) is just under 3, yielding minimal positive \(k\). The literals can be adjusted for higher precision. The minimal positive \(k\) approaches zero as \(m/n \to 3^-\). The exact minimal \(k\) is 0 in the limit, but since \(k > 0\), the answer is arbitrarily close to zero.

```python
# Final output: the infimum of such k is 0, approached by sequences with m/n -> 3 from below
# Since the problem asks for the least k > 0 satisfying the constraints, it's asymptotically 0.

```
This demonstrates the minimal \(k\) obtainable is arbitrarily close to zero but greater than zero, so in exact terms, the minimal is 0.
