The problem suggests the minimal N satisfying the wrapping and equality conditions on x and y. Observing the constraints, the minimal N is when these cyclical and index-dependent conditions are satisfied with the smallest positive N, which is N=6, based on the pattern in the index relations and the modulo behavior.
