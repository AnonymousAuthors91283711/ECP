The problem appears to be about finding all degree-5 polynomials with real coefficients of a specific form, where the roots satisfy a certain symmetry property involving multiplication by a complex number \(\frac{-1 + i \sqrt{3}}{2}\). 

The goal is to enumerate all such polynomials, show that the set \(S\) is finite, and determine its cardinality. Since the details are about polynomials with roots related by multiplication by a fixed complex number, it suggests roots form orbits under multiplication by a primitive 3rd root of unity, which indicates some symmetry leading to polynomial factorization.

To assist in discovering solutions, I will:
- Fix small sample values for the parameters \(a, b, c, d\).
- Enumerate polynomials of the form \(X^5 + aX^4 + bX^3 + cX^2 + dX + 2020\).
- For each polynomial, verify whether all roots satisfy the symmetry condition.
- Efficiently stop exploration at a small bound, outputting each polynomial's parameters when they satisfy the condition.
- Count the solutions to get the cardinality.

Here's the code implementing this:

```python
import numpy as np
from itertools import product

# Fixed parameters: degrees for enumeration
max_coeff = 3  # small sample space for coefficients, for efficiency
target_constant = 2020

# Complex root of unity we'll consider
omega = (-1 + 1j * np.sqrt(3)) / 2

# Generate candidate polynomials
solutions = []

for a, b, c, d in product(range(-max_coeff, max_coeff+1), repeat=4):
    # Construct polynomial coefficients
    coeffs = [1, a, b, c, d, target_constant]
    # Find roots
    roots = np.roots(coeffs)
    
    # Check the symmetry condition for all roots
    if all(np.any(np.isclose(roots, r * omega, atol=1e-8)) for r in roots):
        # If condition holds, add to solutions
        solutions.append((a, b, c, d))
        print(f"Found polynomial: X^5 + ({a})X^4 + ({b})X^3 + ({c})X^2 + ({d})X + 2020")

# Output total count
print(f"Total solutions: {len(solutions)}")
```

This script searches over small coefficient ranges, prints each polynomial satisfying the symmetry condition, and finally outputs the count of solutions.
