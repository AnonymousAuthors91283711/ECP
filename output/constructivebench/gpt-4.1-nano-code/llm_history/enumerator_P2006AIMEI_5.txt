The problem involves expressing a nested radical sum as a linear combination of radicals and then finding the product \(a \times b \times c\). To assist with this, I will assume small positive integer parameters \(a, b, c\) and check whether their combination yields the given value under the radical expression. 

Since the expression involves \(\sqrt{2}\), \(\sqrt{3}\), and \(\sqrt{5}\), and the total is approximately known from the radical sum, I will iterate over small positive integers \(a, b, c\) up to a reasonable limit (say 20). For each triplet, I will compute the right side and compare with the approximate value of the radical sum. When they match within a small tolerance, I will output the product \(a \times b \times c\).

This approach will help in discovering the triplet values without hardcoding the answer.

```python
import math

# Known constants
sqrt_vals = [math.sqrt(2), math.sqrt(3), math.sqrt(5)]
# Approximate value of the radical sum
target = math.sqrt(104 * math.sqrt(6) + 468 * math.sqrt(10) + 144 * math.sqrt(15) + 2006)

# Search bounds for small positive integers
limit = 20

for a in range(1, limit + 1):
    for b in range(1, limit + 1):
        for c in range(1, limit + 1):
            # Calculate the approximate sum
            approx_value = a * sqrt_vals[0] + b * sqrt_vals[1] + c * sqrt_vals[2]
            # Check if the difference is within a small tolerance
            if abs(approx_value - target) < 1e-5:
                product = a * b * c
                print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c} -> a*b*c={product}")
```
This program enumerates small positive integers \(a, b, c\), compares the linear combination to the given radical sum, and outputs matching products.
