  let T := 7/8
  let m := 7

Ground Truth Answer: -8
Proposed Answer: -7
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a quadratic equation: x² + (7+8)x + 7*8 = 0 → x² + 15x + 56 = 0
2. The roots of this equation are x = [-15 ± √(225-224)]/2 = [-15 ± 1]/2 → -7 and -8
3. The problem asks for the least element in the roots set excluding {-8}, which would be {-7}
4. The ground truth answer is -8, but this contradicts the problem statement since -8 is explicitly excluded
5. The proposed answer is -7, which is correct as it's the remaining root after excluding -8

The ground truth answer appears to be incorrect (it gives the excluded value), while the proposed answer correctly identifies the remaining root. Therefore:

<<<False>>>
