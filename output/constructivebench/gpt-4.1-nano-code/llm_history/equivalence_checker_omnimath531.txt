Ground Truth Answer: 5 / 21
Proposed Answer: (6 : ℚ) / 7
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step.

1. The problem is about calculating a probability where:
   - There are 7 doors
   - 2 doors have prizes
   - You pick 1 door initially
   - The host opens 2 other doors (with no prizes)
   - We want the probability that your initial choice didn't have a prize

2. The ground truth answer is 5/21, which is correct because:
   - Total cases: 7 (initial choices) × C(5,2) (ways host can open 2 doors from remaining 5) = 7 × 10 = 70
   - Favorable cases (initial choice has no prize): 5 (initial non-prize doors) × C(4,2) (host opens 2 from remaining 4 non-prize doors) = 5 × 6 = 30
   - Probability = 30/70 = 3/7 (which simplifies to the same as 5/21? Wait no, this seems inconsistent)

Wait, there seems to be a miscalculation here. Let me re-examine:

Actually, the favorable cases should be when initial choice has no prize (5 doors) × C(4,2) (host opens 2 from remaining 4 non-prize doors, since 1 other prize remains) = 5 × 6 = 30
Total cases: 7 × C(5,2) = 70
Probability = 30/70 = 3/7

But the ground truth says 5/21, which doesn't match. Maybe the problem definition is different?

Looking back at the problem statement, it seems the ground truth answer might be incorrect, as 30/70 simplifies to 3/7, not 5/21.

The proposed answer is 6/7, which is clearly different from both 3/7 and 5/21.

Therefore, the proposed answer (6/7) is not equivalent to the ground truth answer (5/21), and neither matches the correct calculation (3/7).
