This appears to be a Lean theorem involving some real analysis and infinite sums. The key part is the infinite series:

\[
\sum_{n=0}^\infty \left(\frac{9}{10}\right)^n \times \frac{1}{10}
\]

which looks like a geometric series with ratio \( r = \frac{9}{10} \). The sum of an infinite geometric series with ratio \( |r| < 1 \) is:

\[
\frac{a}{1 - r}
\]

where \( a = \frac{1}{10} \) (the first term when \( n=0 \)).

Calculating:

\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{\frac{1}{10}}{1 - \frac{9}{10}} = \frac{\frac{1}{10}}{\frac{1}{10}} = 1
\]

Since the sum equals 1, the answer in the set \( \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}^\infty \) (the extended non-negative reals) is simply 1.

Below is a Python program that enumerates candidate answers for this sum, prioritizing 1, verifying the sum via partial sums up to a large \( N \), and confirming the limit approaches 1.

```python
# Program to verify the sum of the geometric series and approximate to 1

# Parameters of the series
ratio = 9/10
first_term = 1/10

# Exact sum calculation
exact_sum = first_term / (1 - ratio)

# Since the series is geometric, the sum should be 1
print(f"Exact sum calculated analytically: {exact_sum}")

# Enumerate partial sums for increasing N to verify convergence
N = 1000
partial_sum = 0.0
for n in range(N + 1):
    term = (ratio ** n) * first_term
    partial_sum += term
    # Streaming result: check and print when close to 1
    if abs(partial_sum - 1) < 1e-4:
        print(f"Partial sum at N={n}: {partial_sum} (approaching 1)")
        break

# Also, check with a high N for approximation
high_N = 10000
approx_sum = sum((ratio ** n) * first_term for n in range(high_N +1))
print(f"Approximate sum at N={high_N}: {approx_sum}")
```
