theorem P2010AMCB_21 : 
  IsLeast {a : ℕ | a > 0 ∧ ∃ (P : ℤ[X]), 
    (P.eval 1 = a ∧ P.eval 3 = a ∧ P.eval 5 = a ∧ P.eval 7 = a) ∧ 
    (P.eval 2 = -a ∧ P.eval 4 = -a ∧ P.eval 6 = -a ∧ P.eval 8 = -a)} 
  P2010AMCB_21_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: No suitable a found up to max_a. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests no positive integer satisfies all even evaluations as negatives and odd evaluations as positives simultaneously. Thus, the minimal such a is 1, but since no such a exists, the answer is 0.
