  P2004AMCB_11_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Possible n=13: total sum=988, remaining sum=488, remaining count=8
Score configuration example: [100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 61, 61, 61, 61, 61, 61, 61, 61]. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on given enumerations and constraints, the minimal n satisfying the sum conditions with per-score ≥ 60, 5 students scoring 100, and total sum 76*n, is n=13.  

The pattern suggests the total sum is 76 * n, with 5 scores at 100 each, totaling 500, plus remaining n-5 scores ≥ 60, summing to 76 * n - 500, which is 76n - 500. Given the minimal total sum is 988 for n=13, and total sum = 76 * n, the general minimal n satisfying constraints is 13.
