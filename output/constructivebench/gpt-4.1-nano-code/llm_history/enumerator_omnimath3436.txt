This problem involves analyzing four positive, distinct real numbers \( l_1, l_2, l_3, l_4 \) summing to \( L \) with the relations \( l_1 = 2l_2 \), \( l_2 = 2l_3 \), and \( l_3 = 2l_4 \). We want to find their ratios as a fraction of \( L \).

Since the problem specifies the chain of relations:

\[
l_1 = 2 l_2, \quad l_2 = 2 l_3, \quad l_3 = 2 l_4,
\]

we get:
\[
l_1 = 2 l_2 = 2 \times 2 l_3 = 4 l_3,
\]
\[
l_2 = 2 l_3,
\]
\[
l_3 = 2 l_4,
\]
\[
l_4 = l_4,
\]
and the sum:
\[
l_1 + l_2 + l_3 + l_4 = L.
\]

Express all in terms of \( l_4 \):
\[
l_1 = 4 l_3 = 4 \times 2 l_4 = 8 l_4,
\]
\[
l_2 = 2 l_3 = 2 \times 2 l_4 = 4 l_4,
\]
\[
l_3 = 2 l_4,
\]
\[
l_4 = l_4.
\]

Sum:
\[
L = l_1 + l_2 + l_3 + l_4 = 8 l_4 + 4 l_4 + 2 l_4 + l_4 = (8 + 4 + 2 + 1) l_4 = 15 l_4,
\]
which yields
\[
l_4 = \frac{L}{15},
\]
and consequently,
\[
l_1 = 8 l_4 = \frac{8L}{15},
\]
\[
l_2 = 4 l_4 = \frac{4L}{15},
\]
\[
l_3 = 2 l_4 = \frac{2L}{15},
\]
\[
l_4 = \frac{L}{15}.
\]

The ratios of each to \( L \):
\[
\frac{l_1}{L} = \frac{8}{15}, \quad \frac{l_2}{L} = \frac{4}{15}, \quad \frac{l_3}{L} = \frac{2}{15}, \quad \frac{l_4}{L} = \frac{1}{15}.
\]

Let's write a Python program that enumerates similar relations for small integer ratios (e.g., where \( l_1 = k_1 l_4 \), etc., that satisfy the sum and positivity. But since the relations explicitly define a unique solution, the enumeration is trivial.

I'll create a small enumeration over possible \( k \)-values satisfying the proportional relations, verify if they sum to \( L \), and print the ratios.

```python
# Enumerate possible proportional relationships to find the ratios
# with small integer factors and verify the sum.

for k1 in range(1, 20):
    for k2 in range(1, 20):
        for k3 in range(1, 20):
            # Relations: l1 = k1 * l4, l2 = k2 * l4, l3 = k3 * l4
            total = k1 + k2 + k3 + 1
            if total != 15:
                continue  # target sum is 15 in the specific case
            # For sum to be L, choose l4 = L / total
            print(f"l4 = L/{total} => l1 = {k1}*l4 = {k1}*L/{total}")
            print(f"l2 = {k2}*L/{total}")
            print(f"l3 = {k3}*L/{total}")
            print(f"l4 = {L}/{total}")
            print(f"Ratios: l1/L = {k1}/{total}, l2/L = {k2}/{total}, l3/L = {k3}/{total}, l4/L = 1/{total}\n")
```
