The problem appears to be about counting the number of "orderly" colorings (matrices of Booleans) up to row and column permutations, for an n×n matrix, with the condition n ≥ 3. To approximate or find the exact count, we consider symmetries under row and column permutations, where "orderly" colorings are those for which the set of permutations of rows and columns preserve the coloring pattern.

Since the problem can't be hardcoded with the count, and we want an enumerator to help conjecture the answer, we'll:
- Choose small values of n (e.g., n=3 and n=4) to generate small cases.
- For each coloring, check the "orderly" condition by verifying invariance under permutations.
- Count and output the number of such colorings.

We can observe that for each smaller n, enumerating all colorings (2^(n²)) and checking the symmetry conditions is feasible, given the constraints.

Below is a Python script that approximates the count for small n. It enumerates all colorings, checks the "orderly" property, and immediately prints each valid coloring's count. It uses itertools permutations and bit manipulations for efficiency.

```python
import itertools

def count_orderly_colorings(n):
    total_valid = 0
    total_colorings = 2 ** (n * n)
    # Generate all colorings as binary masks
    for mask in range(total_colorings):
        c = [[(mask >> (i * n + j)) & 1 for j in range(n)] for i in range(n)]
        # Check the "orderly" property
        is_orderly = True
        row_permutations = list(itertools.permutations(range(n)))
        col_permutations = list(itertools.permutations(range(n)))
        for sigma in row_permutations:
            for tau in col_permutations:
                invariant = True
                for i in range(n):
                    for j in range(n):
                        if c[sigma[i]][tau[j]] != c[i][j]:
                            invariant = False
                            break
                    if not invariant:
                        break
                if not invariant:
                    continue
        # For "orderly", the coloring must be invariant under all permutations
        # If any permutation pair breaks invariance, coloring is not orderly
        # But the above nested loop checks all pairs; if all passed, coloring is orderly
        # Since the loop is dense, we need an early exit if non-invariant found
        # (Already checked above: continue if not invariant)
        # So if we reach here, coloring is invariant
        total_valid += 1
        print(f"Valid coloring (mask={mask}):")
        for row in c:
            print(''.join(str(bit) for bit in row))
        print('-' * 20)
    print(f"For n={n}, total orderly colorings: {total_valid}")

# Example usage for small n, e.g., n=3
if __name__ == "__main__":
    for n in [3]:
        print(f"Enumerating orderly colorings for n={n}")
        count_orderly_colorings(n)
```
