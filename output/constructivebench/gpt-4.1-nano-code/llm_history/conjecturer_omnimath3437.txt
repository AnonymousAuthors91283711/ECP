The enumerated pairs generate p = 2(a + b) for positive integer pairs (a, b) with a * b = 24, resulting in the set {20, 22, 28, 50}. The key is that the value p generated for (a, b) = (4, 6) or (6, 4) is 20, which is the minimal among these, and the problem indicates the unique element not in S (which is expressed as a set of such p) must be the minimal value (according to the pattern). Given that the set S contains all such p values arising from positive factors of 24, the missing element is the minimal p, which is 20.

I observe that the final answer should be the minimal p value. The set of all p's is known: {20, 22, 28, 50}. The minimal number in this set is 20. This aligns with the enumerated pairs and the conditions in the problem, indicating that the answer is 20.

Thus, in Lean, the expression would be simply 20 — the minimal p value obtained from the pairs.
