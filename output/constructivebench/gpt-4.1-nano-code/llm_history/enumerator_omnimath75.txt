This problem involves exploring whether there exists a prime p such that p does not divide n^m - m for every n, and determining for which m such primes exist. To assist in conjecturing and proving the answer, we will enumerate over small m and check for the existence of such primes p.

Approach:
- Fix small m values.
- For each m, attempt to find a prime p with the property.
- For computational feasibility, restrict p to small primes and check the condition for a range of n.

Below is the Python code implementing this approach with sample small m values, small prime p candidates, and a bounded search for n.

```python
# Enumerate small m, small primes, and small n to find primes p such that:
# p does not divide n^m - m for all tested n.

import sympy

# Parameters
max_m = 10  # maximum m to explore
max_p = 50  # maximum prime candidate
max_n = 20  # maximum n to test

def is_prime(p):
    return sympy.isprime(p)

# For each m, find primes p with the property
for m in range(1, max_m + 1):
    print(f"Testing m={m}")
    found = False
    for p in range(2, max_p):
        if not is_prime(p):
            continue
        # Check if for all n in range, p does not divide n^m - m
        valid = True
        for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
            val = pow(n, m, p) - (m % p)
            if val % p == 0:
                valid = False
                break
        if valid:
            print(f"  Possible prime p={p} for m={m}")
            found = True
    if not found:
        print(f"  No such prime p found for m={m}")
```
