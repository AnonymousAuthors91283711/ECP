The problem involves analyzing the set of real numbers \( x \) such that the expression \(\frac{x^2 - 11}{x + 1}\) satisfies \(0 < \frac{x^2 - 11}{x + 1} < 7\), with the restriction \(x \neq -1\) to avoid division by zero.

To approach this, I will:
- Sample values of \(x\) around significant points (e.g., roots of numerator and denominator).
- Compute \(\frac{x^2 - 11}{x + 1}\) for these sample points.
- Determine which \(x\) satisfy the inequalities.
- Output those \(x\) that meet all conditions.

Since the goal is to produce multiple candidate answers, I will consider \(x\) in ranges where the inequality holds and handle boundary points, then print all satisfying solutions.

```python
# Enumerate values of x in relevant ranges, compute the expression, and check inequalities
import math

# Small step size for sampling
step = 0.1
solutions = set()

# Divide the real line into regions based on critical points:
# - x = -1 (disallowed)
# - Solutions to x^2 - 11 = 0 -> x = ±√11 (~ ±3.3166)
# These points influence the sign of numerator
critical_points = [-math.sqrt(11), -1, math.sqrt(11)]

# Generate sample points around critical points
samples = []
for c in critical_points:
    for offset in [-1.0, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1.0]:
        x_val = c + offset
        if x_val != -1:  # exclude x = -1
            samples.append(x_val)

# Remove duplicates
samples = list(set(samples))

# Check each sample point
for x in samples:
    if x == -1:
        continue
    numerator = x**2 - 11
    denominator = x + 1
    # Avoid division by zero
    if denominator == 0:
        continue
    val = numerator / denominator
    if 0 < val < 7:
        # Record x in solution set
        solutions.add(x)
        print(f"x = {x:.2f} => ({x:.2f}^2 - 11)/({x:.2f} + 1) = {val:.2f} in (0,7)")

# For completeness, sample more densely in key regions
for x in [i * 0.1 for i in range(-50, 51)]:
    if x == -1:
        continue
    numerator = x**2 - 11
    denominator = x + 1
    if denominator == 0:
        continue
    val = numerator / denominator
    if 0 < val < 7:
        solutions.add(x)
        print(f"x = {x:.2f} => {val:.2f} in (0,7)")
```
