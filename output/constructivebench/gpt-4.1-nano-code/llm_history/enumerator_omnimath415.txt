This problem appears to be involving a game where two players (Alex and Bob) choose moves within the interval [1, 6], with a total sum condition related to a value n. The goal is to find the greatest value of n (within the interval [1,6]) that satisfies the described condition — specifically, the existence of moves leading to a total sum of 30, with some subsequent move.

Given the constraints:
- n ∈ [1,6]
- Bob's moves are within [1,6]
- Alex's moves are within [1,6]
- We look for an m and move sequences so that the sum of the combined moves plus n equals 30, with some additional sum involving Alex's move matching 30.

We will implement a brute-force search over n in [1,6], over possible m, and over move sequences, checking whether the sum conditions hold.

Here's the code:

```python
# Enumerate possible values of n in [1,6], seeking the maximum n satisfying the conditions.
# For each n, try different values of m and move sequences (within small bounds for efficiency),
# checking the sum conditions.

def main():
    max_n = None
    for n in range(6, 0, -1):  # Check from 6 down to 1 for the greatest n
        found = False
        for m in range(1, 11):  # Limit m to small number for efficiency
            # Generate all possible move sequences for bob and alex within [1,6]
            # Since 6^m is large, limit to small m, e.g., m <= 3
            if m > 3:
                continue
            # Generate all sequences for Bob
            for bob_moves in generate_moves(m, 1, 6):
                sum_bob = sum(bob_moves)
                target_sum = 30 - n - sum_bob
                if target_sum < m * 1 or target_sum > m * 6:
                    continue
                # Try all alex_moves sequences with sum = target_sum
                for alex_moves in generate_moves_with_sum(m, 1, 6, target_sum):
                    total = sum(a + b for a, b in zip(alex_moves, bob_moves))
                    if total == 30:
                        # Check the condition with alex_moves m: move indices 0 to m-1
                        sum_alex_moves = sum(alex_moves)
                        if sum_alex_moves + total == 30:
                            print(f"n = {n}")
                            found = True
                            break
                if found:
                    break
            if found:
                break
        if found:
            max_n = n
            break
    print(f"Maximum n satisfying conditions: {max_n}")

def generate_moves(length, low, high):
    # Generate all move sequences of given length within [low, high]
    if length == 0:
        yield []
    else:
        for move in range(low, high + 1):
            for sub_moves in generate_moves(length - 1, low, high):
                yield [move] + sub_moves

def generate_moves_with_sum(length, low, high, total):
    # Generate move sequences with sum = total
    if length == 1:
        if low <= total <= high:
            yield [total]
    else:
        for first_move in range(low, high + 1):
            for rest in generate_moves_with_sum(length - 1, low, high, total - first_move):
                yield [first_move] + rest

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code:
- Checks n from 6 down to 1 for the greatest satisfying value.
- Limits the move sequence length to small values for efficiency.
- Generates all move sequences within the bounds.
- Verifies the sum conditions corresponding to the problem statement.
