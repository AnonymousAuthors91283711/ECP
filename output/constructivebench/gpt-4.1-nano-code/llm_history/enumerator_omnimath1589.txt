This problem involves analyzing the sum of sines and cosines of three angles with the constraints:

\[
\cos \alpha + \cos \beta + \cos \gamma = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad \sin \alpha + \sin \beta + \sin \gamma = 1
\]

We want to find the minimal value of \( x \) for which there exist angles \(\beta, \gamma\) such that \( P(x, \beta, \gamma) \) holds, meaning the above constraints are satisfied.

A promising approach is to consider symmetric solutions where \(\alpha = \beta = \gamma\). Setting \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = t \):

\[
3 \cos t = 1 \Rightarrow \cos t = \frac{1}{3} \\
3 \sin t = 1 \Rightarrow \sin t = \frac{1}{3}
\]

But these can't be both satisfied simultaneously unless \(\sin^2 t + \cos^2 t = 1 \).

Check if the chosen \(\cos t = 1/3\) and \(\sin t = 1/3\) satisfy this:

\[
(1/3)^2 + (1/3)^2 = 2/9 \neq 1
\]

So symmetric angles don't satisfy both equations exactly.

Alternatively, to get an approximate minimal \( x \), letâ€™s iterate over plausible \(\alpha\) values, then for each, find corresponding \(\beta, \gamma\) satisfying the constraints.

Given the complexity, let's proceed with a grid search over \(\alpha\), and for each, solve for \(\beta, \gamma\). We will fix \(\alpha\) at small sample points, test whether feasible \(\beta, \gamma\) exist satisfying the constraints, and track minimal \( x = \alpha \).

```python
import math

# Enumerate possible alpha values from -pi to pi
step = 0.1  # step size for sampling
min_x = None

for i in range(int(-math.pi / step), int(math.pi / step) + 1):
    alpha = i * step
    
    # Compute sums needed for constraints
    # For simplicity, set beta = gamma and try to satisfy constraints
    def constraints(beta):
        cos_sum = math.cos(alpha) + 2 * math.cos(beta)
        sin_sum = math.sin(alpha) + 2 * math.sin(beta)
        return abs(cos_sum - 1) < 1e-6 and abs(sin_sum - 1) < 1e-6

    # Search for beta in [-pi, pi]
    for j in range(int(-math.pi / step), int(math.pi / step) + 1):
        beta = j * step
        if constraints(beta):
            # Found a feasible alpha, beta, gamma with gamma = beta
            x = alpha
            print(f"Found feasible solution at alpha={alpha:.2f}, beta={beta:.2f}, gamma={beta:.2f}, x={x:.2f}")
            if min_x is None or x < min_x:
                min_x = x
            break  # No need to check further beta values

# Output the minimal x found
if min_x is not None:
    print(f"Minimal x approximately: {min_x:.2f}")
else:
    print("No feasible solution found in the sample range.")
```
