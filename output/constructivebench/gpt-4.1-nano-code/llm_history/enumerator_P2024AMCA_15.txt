The problem involves finding the value of \((p^2 + 4)(q^2 + 4)(r^2 + 4)\) where \(p, q, r\) are distinct roots of the cubic \(x^3 + 2x^2 - x + 3 = 0\). To assist, I will:
- Find all roots of the cubic.
- Ensure roots are distinct.
- Compute the required product.
- Enumerate roots and compute directly to avoid symbolic complexity.
- Since the roots are solutions to the cubic, they are algebraic, but numerically approximate to verify and get exact values.

**Approach:**
- Solve the cubic equation numerically for roots.
- For each root, compute \(p_i^2 + 4\).
- Compute the product of these values.
- Output the exact roots and the product, streaming the results immediately.

This approach adheres to the constraints: no hardcoded answer, attempts to approximate, and listing roots explicitly.

```python
import numpy as np

# Define the cubic coefficients
coeffs = [1, 2, -1, 3]

# Find roots numerically
roots = np.roots(coeffs)

# Filter roots to avoid duplicated roots within a tolerance
tolerance = 1e-8
distinct_roots = []
for r in roots:
    if all(abs(r - dr) > tolerance for dr in distinct_roots):
        distinct_roots.append(r)

# Compute the desired product
product = 1
for p in distinct_roots:
    val = p**2 + 4
    print(f"Root: {p}, p^2 + 4 = {val}")
    product *= val

print(f"Product (p^2 + 4)(q^2 + 4)(r^2 + 4) = {product}")
```
