Ground Truth Answer: {1, 2}
Proposed Answer: {2}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer {2} is mostly correct but incomplete. The ground truth {1, 2} correctly includes both cases:
1. For n=1: The condition becomes (digits 10 k).count 1 = 0 and (digits 10 k).count 7 = 1, meaning numbers with exactly one '7' and no '1's in their digits. The smallest such prime is 7.
2. For n=2: Similar logic applies but with (digits 10 k).count 1 = 1. The smallest such prime is 17.

The proposed answer misses the n=1 case, making it partially correct but not fully equivalent to the ground truth.
