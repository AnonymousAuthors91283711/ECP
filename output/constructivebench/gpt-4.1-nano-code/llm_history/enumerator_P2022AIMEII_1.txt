This problem involves finding the minimal natural number \( n \) (represented as \( k + 50 \)) satisfying certain parametric conditions involving \( k \) and \( m \).

The key equations are:
1. \( 5m = 12k \) (relates \( m \) and \( k \))
2. \( 11(m + 50) = 25(k + 50) \) (another relation involving \( m \) and \( k \))
3. \( n = k + 50 \) (target value)

We can derive \( m \) from the first equation:
\[ m = \frac{12k}{5} \]
Since \( m \) is an integer, \( 12k \) must be divisible by 5.

From the second equation:
\[ 11(m + 50) = 25(k + 50) \]
Expanding:
\[ 11m + 550 = 25k + 1250 \]
Rearranged:
\[ 11m = 25k + 700 \]

Replacing \( m \) with \( \frac{12k}{5} \):
\[ 11 \times \frac{12k}{5} = 25k + 700 \]
\[ \frac{132k}{5} = 25k + 700 \]

Multiply through by 5:
\[ 132k = 125k + 3500 \]
\[ 7k = 3500 \]
\[ k = 500 \]

Check that with \( k = 500 \):
\[ m = \frac{12 \times 500}{5} = \frac{6000}{5} = 1200 \]
which is integer.

Verify the second equation:
\[ 11(1200 + 50) = 25(500 + 50) \]
\[ 11 \times 1250 = 25 \times 550 \]
\[ 13750 = 13750 \]

Confirmed.

Then:
\[ n = k + 50 = 500 + 50 = 550 \]

Given the unique solution, the minimal \( n \) satisfying conditions is 550.

Below, we write a Python script to systematically verify and find this minimal value, and print the answer.

```python
# Program to find the minimal n = k + 50 satisfying the given system
# Based on the derived solution, k = 500, n = 550

# Since equations lead to a unique k, directly verify and output
k = 500
m = (12 * k) // 5
n = k + 50

print("k:", k)
print("m:", m)
print("n:", n)

# Verify equations
assert 5 * m == 12 * k, "Equation 1 not satisfied"
assert 11 * (m + 50) == 25 * (k + 50), "Equation 2 not satisfied"
```
