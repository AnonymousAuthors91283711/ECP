The problem involves finding the number of integer lattice points `(p.1, p.2)` within `[-100, 100]` for the equation \( 12x^2 - xy - 6 y^2 = 0 \).

To assist in conjecturing the exact answer, I'll enumerate all integer solutions within the domain and count them. Since the equation is quadratic in `x` and `y`, I can treat it as a quadratic in `x` for each fixed `y` (or vice versa) and check for integer solutions. The domain is small, so direct enumeration is feasible.

```python
# Enumerate integer solutions to 12x^2 - xy - 6 y^2 = 0 for x,y in [-100,100]

solutions = []

for y in range(-100, 101):
    for x in range(-100, 101):
        if 12 * x**2 - x * y - 6 * y**2 == 0:
            solutions.append((x, y))
            print((x, y))  # Stream each solution

print(f"Total solutions: {len(solutions)}")
```
