Estimated measure for the set.. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The set describes a portion of the unit square with constraints involving inequalities on \( a, b \). Notably, the complex conditions pinpoint a region formed by the parts of the square outside the circle \( a^2 + b^2 = 1 \), intersected with additional inequalities. Due to the approximate area of 0.284287, a reasonable closed-form estimate is the difference between the square’s area (1) minus a quarter-circle area (\( \pi/4 \)) plus a correction term.  
The approximate measure suggests \( \frac{2 - \pi/2}{2} \), simplified as \( 1 - \pi/4 \).  

Thus, the explicit closed-form answer is:  

<<<(1 - Real.pi / 4)>>>
