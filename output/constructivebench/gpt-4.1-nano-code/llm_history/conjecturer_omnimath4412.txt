  IsLeast {n : ℝ | 0 < n ∧ n + ⌊sqrt n⌋ + ⌊n^(1/3)⌋ = 2014} omnimath4412_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 1958

Minimum n: 1958. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The minimal n where 0 < n and n + ⌊√n⌋ + ⌊n^(1/3)⌋ = 2014 occurs at n=1958, since ⌊√1958⌋=44 and ⌊1958^(1/3)⌋=12, and sum to 1958+44+12=2014. Confirming minimality at this point.
