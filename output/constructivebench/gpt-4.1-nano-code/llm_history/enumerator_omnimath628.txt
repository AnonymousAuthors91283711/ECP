This problem asks for the number of integers \( n \) between \( 10^6 \) and \( 10^9 \), inclusive, such that \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \) and there exists a natural number \( m \) with \( m^2 = n \). In other words, count perfect squares in \([10^6, 10^9]\) divisible by 7.

Since \( n = m^2 \), the problem reduces to counting perfect squares divisible by 7 within the range. 
- For a perfect square \( m^2 \) to be divisible by 7, \( m \) must be divisible by 7.
- Set \( m = 7k \). Then \( n = (7k)^2 = 49k^2 \).
- The range condition:
  \[
  10^6 \leq 49k^2 \leq 10^9
  \]
- Dividing through by 49:
  \[
  \frac{10^6}{49} \leq k^2 \leq \frac{10^9}{49}
  \]
  \[
  \approx 20408.16 \leq k^2 \leq \approx 20408163.27
  \]
- Take square roots:
  \[
  \sqrt{20408.16} \leq k \leq \sqrt{20408163.27}
  \]
  \[
  \approx 142.87 \leq k \leq 4516.56
  \]

Since \( k \) is an integer:
\[
k \in \{143, 144, \ldots, 4516\}
\]

Number of such \( k \):
\[
4516 - 143 + 1 = 4374
\]

Produce all \( n = 49k^2 \) for \( k \in [143, 4516] \). Given the problem constraints, just output the count.

```python
# Count of perfect squares divisible by 7 in [10^6, 10^9]
start_k = 143
end_k = 4516
count = end_k - start_k + 1
print(count)
```
