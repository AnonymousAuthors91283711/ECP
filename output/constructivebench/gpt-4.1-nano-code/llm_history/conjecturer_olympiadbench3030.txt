. Enumerated answers: 20. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the equations, simplifying yields x = 5 - y and x^2 - y^2 = (x - y)(x + y). With x + y = 5, this becomes (x - y)*5 = 1/ T, so (x - y) = (1/ T) / 5 = 1/(5 T). Since T = 1/40, 1/(5 * 1/40) = 40/5 = 8. Then x = 5 - y and x - y = 8 imply y = -3, x = 8, and z = x + (-7) = 1. Final sum: x + z = 8 + 1 = 9.
