The problem asks to find the number of integers `a` in the closed interval [1, 10] such that 5 divides `a^2014 + a^2015`. We want to enumerate all such `a` values, verifying the divisibility condition, and count them.

Since `a` takes integer values from 1 to 10, we can explicitly check each value. The key mathematical insight is to analyze the divisibility condition:

`5 | a^2014 + a^2015`  
which simplifies to  
`a^2014 (1 + a) ≡ 0 (mod 5)`

For divisibility by 5, either:

- `a^2014 ≡ 0 (mod 5)`  
- or `(1 + a) ≡ 0 (mod 5)`

The first case (`a` divisible by 5) occurs when `a ≡ 0 (mod 5)`. The second when `a ≡ -1 ≡ 4 (mod 5)`. Since `a` is from 1 to 10, the possible `a` satisfying these are:

- `a ≡ 0 (mod 5)`: a = 5, 10  
- `a ≡ 4 (mod 5)`: a = 4, 9

All these satisfy the original divisibility condition.

The interval is [1, 10], so listed `a` are 4, 5, 9, 10.

Here is the Python program to verify and output the possible `a` values:

```python
# Enumerate values from 1 to 10
answers = []
for a in range(1, 11):
    if (a % 5 == 0) or ((a + 1) % 5 == 0):
        print(a)
        answers.append(a)

# Count the answers (set cardinality)
print("Total count:", len(answers))
```
