Approximate 100 * E: 134
. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the pattern, the sum of k * p(k) approximates to 1.34, which when multiplied by 100 gives approximately 134. Rounding suggests the answer is close to 134.

Approximate 100 * E: 134
. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The main problem in your current Lean code is the usage of "<<134" which is not valid syntax. In Lean, numeric literals should be written directly without extra angle brackets. Additionally, the notation for the product over a range should follow Lean's syntax, i.e., use `∏ i ∈ Finset.range k, ...`.

I notice that your enumerated answers suggest that the approximate value for \(100 \times E\) is close to 134, which indicates \(E \approx 1.34\). Since the problem asks for an answer in natural numbers, and the approximation points to about 134, it is fitting to set the answer as 134.

Hence, the corrected lean answer is simply:

```lean
abbrev omnimath1735_answer : ℕ := 134
```

This adheres to Lean syntax and provides the intended integer answer in a straightforward, closed form, consistent with the enumerated approximate value.
