. Enumerated answers: a(0) = 1.4 (7/5). Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Given the recurrence a(n+1) = 1 + 1 / (1 + a(n)) with initial condition a(2)=41/29, the pattern suggests that a(0) = 7/5. This is consistent with the iteration pattern leading to a rational value. So, the generalized closed form is 7/5.
