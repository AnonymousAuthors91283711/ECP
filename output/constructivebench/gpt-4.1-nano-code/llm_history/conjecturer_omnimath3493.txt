theorem omnimath3493 (x : ℝ) (hx : x < -2) :
  IsLeast {y : ℝ | y = x ∨ y = x + 2 ∨ y = (1/2) * x ∨ y = x - 2 ∨ y = 2 * x} (omnimath3493_answer x) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: x = -3.5: candidates = [-3.5, -1.5, -1.75, -5.5, -7.0], minimal = -7.0
x = -4: candidates = [-4, -2, -2.0, -6, -8], minimal = -8
x = -5.5: candidates = [-5.5, -3.5, -2.75, -7.5, -11.0], minimal = -11.0
x = -6: candidates = [-6, -4, -3.0, -8, -12], minimal = -12
x = -7: candidates = [-7, -5, -3.5, -9, -14], minimal = -14. Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
