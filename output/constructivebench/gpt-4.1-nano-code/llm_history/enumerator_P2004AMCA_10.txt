The problem appears to involve finding an integer \( k \) such that the sum of a range of integers starting from \( k \) and ending at \( k + 48 \) equals \( 7^5 \). Additionally, we want to determine the value of \( k + 24 \), which likely corresponds to the middle term of that sum, since the sum is symmetric around the midpoint.

Given:
\[
\sum_{i=0}^{48} (k + i) = 7^5
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
\sum_{i=0}^{48} (k + i) = ( \text{number of terms} \times \text{average of terms} ) = 49 \times \left(k + \frac{48}{2}\right) = 49 \times (k + 24)
\]
Thus:
\[
49 \times (k + 24) = 7^5
\]
and
\[
k + 24 = \frac{7^5}{49} = \frac{7^5}{7^2} = 7^{3} = 343
\]
which leads to:
\[
k = 343 - 24 = 319
\]
and the value of \( k + 24 \) is 343.

Now, creating a Python script to verify and enumerate solutions:

```python
# Since the sum simplifies to 49 * (k + 24) = 7^5,
# we can directly compute the value of k + 24 and then k.
# We will check all possible divisors and verify integer solutions.

import math

# Target sum
sum_target = 7**5  # 16807

# Initialize list for found solutions
solutions = []

# Since 49 * (k + 24) = 16807,
# k + 24 must be a divisor of 16807 divided by 49
divisor_candidate = sum_target // 49

# Check if divisor_candidate is integer and can produce integer k
if sum_target % 49 == 0:
    k_plus_24 = divisor_candidate
    k = k_plus_24 - 24
    # Output the found solution immediately
    print(f"Solution: k = {k}, k + 24 = {k_plus_24}")

# For completeness, we can check other divisors of 16807 * aside from 49
# But since the sum simplifies neatly, the direct calculation suffices.
```

This code directly computes the unique solution based on the algebraic simplification. It prints the result immediately upon calculation.
