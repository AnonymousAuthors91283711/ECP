The problem involves identifying all pairs `(a, b)` of real numbers satisfying the system:
- \(\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b} = 8\)
- \(\log_b 10 \, a + \log_b 10 \, b = 2\)

To assist with conjecturing solutions, we'll:
- Choose small, manageable sample values for `a` and `b`.
- Express the second equation in terms of `a` and `b`.
- Enumerate candidate pairs that satisfy the first equation, then check the second.
- Print each candidate pair immediately upon discovery.

Let's proceed with small sample values for \(\sqrt{a}\) and \(\sqrt{b}\), say from 0.1 to 8 in steps, to find candidates fulfilling the first equation and check the second.

```python
# Enumerate candidate pairs for (a, b) where sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) = 8
# Use small steps for sqrt(a) and sqrt(b) from 0.1 to 8
import math

def check_pair(sqrt_a, sqrt_b):
    a = sqrt_a ** 2
    b = sqrt_b ** 2
    if a > 0 and b > 0:
        # Calculate logs base b of 10 of a and b
        log_b_10_a = math.log(10, b) * math.log(a, 10)
        log_b_10_b = math.log(10, b) * math.log(b, 10)
        if abs(log_b_10_a + log_b_10_b - 2) < 1e-6:
            print(f"Candidate pair: a={a}, b={b}")

# Loop over possible sqrt(a) and sqrt(b)
step = 0.5
max_val = 8
for sqrt_a in [i * step for i in range(1, int(max_val / step) + 1)]:
    sqrt_b = 8 - sqrt_a
    check_pair(sqrt_a, sqrt_b)
```
