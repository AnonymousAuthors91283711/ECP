The problem asks for the value of `n` such that \( 4^n = 64^2 \). To find `n`, we need to understand the relationship between these powers of 2:

- \( 4 = 2^2 \)
- \( 64 = 2^6 \)

Thus, \( 4^n = (2^2)^n = 2^{2n} \).

Similarly, \( 64^2 = (2^6)^2 = 2^{12} \).

We set: \( 2^{2n} = 2^{12} \). Since the bases are equal, the exponents are equal:

\( 2n = 12 \Rightarrow n = 6 \).

We can write a simple enumeration to confirm this holds, although it's straightforward algebra. However, since the prompt is about enumerating answers, let's do a quick brute-force check:

```python
# Enumerate n in a reasonable range and check equality
for n in range(0, 20):
    if 4 ** n == 64 ** 2:
        print(n)  # Should print 6
```

This minimal enumeration finds `n=6`. Now, integrate into the Lean proof gateway with the answer.

```python
# Explanation:
# Solving 4^n = 64^2
# 4 = 2^2, 64 = 2^6
# So 2^{2n} = 2^{12} => 2n = 12 => n = 6
