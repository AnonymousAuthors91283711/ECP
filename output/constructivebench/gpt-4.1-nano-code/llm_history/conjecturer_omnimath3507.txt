abbrev omnimath3507_answer : String := sorry
theorem omnimath3507 (graph : String) : 
  (∃ (f : ℝ → ℝ), (∀ x y, f x = f y) ∧ graph = omnimath3507_answer) ↔ graph = omnimath3507_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: f(x) = 0 for all x
f(x) = 1 for all x
f(x) = 2 for all x
f(x) = 3 for all x
f(x) = 4 for all x
f(x) = 5 for all x
. Expected Answer Type: String
<<<"f(x) = 0" >>>
