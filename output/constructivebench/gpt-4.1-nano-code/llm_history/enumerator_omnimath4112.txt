The problem appears to involve a functional equation involving functions \(f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) and a property \(P\) characterized by a particular relation. To help conjecture the set of solutions \(f\), I will generate candidate functions satisfying the functional equation parametrically, focusing primarily on polynomial-like or constant solutions, which are most common in such problems.

I'll examine simple candidate functions such as constant functions and affine functions, testing the relation for various inputs, and collecting those candidates that satisfy the property for multiple parameter choices. This enumeration can help in conjecturing the exact set of solutions.

The code:
- Defines a small set of candidate functions, such as constant functions and simple polynomials.
- Checks the functional relation for a representative set of inputs \(x, y\).
- If the relation holds, outputs the function; otherwise, skips.
- The enumeration prioritizes obviously "nice" functions, as common in such functional equations.
- The code is designed to run efficiently without brute forcing all possibilities, focusing instead on promising candidate forms.
- This mechanism supports discovering the structure of solutions based on tested candidates.

```python
# Enumerate candidate functions to satisfy the functional equation
def test_function(f):
    test_points = [(0, 0), (1, 1), (-1, 2), (2, -2)]
    for x, y in test_points:
        lhs = f(x ** 2) + f(2 * y ** 2)
        rhs = (f(x + y) + f(y)) * (f(x - y) + f(y))
        if abs(lhs - rhs) > 1e-8:
            return False
    return True

# Candidate functions: constant and linear functions
candidate_functions = [
    lambda x: 0,
    lambda x: 1,
    lambda x: -1,
    lambda x: x,
    lambda x: -x,
    lambda x: 2*x,
    lambda x: -2*x,
    lambda x: 0.5 * x,
    lambda x: -0.5 * x
]

# We discover solutions by testing candidates
for f in candidate_functions:
    if test_function(f):
        # Attempt to print the function as a string expression
        # Since anonymous lambdas are not straightforward, we test what they are
        # For this simplified case, print a description
        print("Candidate function with form:", f.__name__ if hasattr(f, '__name__') else 'linear or constant')
        # Alternatively, since lambdas have no __name__, check their output on some points
        test_vals = [f(0), f(1), f(-1)]
        print("Sample outputs:", test_vals)
        print("This function satisfies the relation.")
```
