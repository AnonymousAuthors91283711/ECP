This problem involves analyzing a sequence composed of characters 'X' and 'Y', and finding specific positions where the counts of 'X' and 'Y' satisfy a relation (either one is twice the other). The sequence is constructed explicitly, and we need to evaluate the sum of particular positions (9, 18, 36, 72) where the count conditions hold. To assist with conjecture and proof, we'll enumerate these positions and verify the conditions.

The key steps:
- Generate the sequence.
- For each position, compute the counts of 'X' and 'Y'.
- Check if counts satisfy either `x = 2 * y` or `y = 2 * x`.
- Sum the positions where the condition holds.
- Output each valid position and the cumulative sum.

This approach allows us to verify directly which of the specified positions meet the criteria.

```python
# Generate the sequence
seq = ['X'] * 6 + ['Y'] * 24 + ['X'] * 96

# Function to get count of 'X' and 'Y' up to position n
def count_chars_upto(n):
    x_count = 0
    y_count = 0
    for c in seq[:n]:
        if c == 'X':
            x_count += 1
        elif c == 'Y':
            y_count += 1
    return x_count, y_count

# Positions to check
positions = [9, 18, 36, 72]
valid_positions = []

total_sum = 0
for n in positions:
    x, y = count_chars_upto(n)
    # Check the conditions
    if x == 2 * y or y == 2 * x:
        print(f"Position {n}: X={x}, Y={y} -> valid")
        valid_positions.append(n)
        total_sum += n
    else:
        print(f"Position {n}: X={x}, Y={y} -> not valid")

print(f"Sum of valid positions: {total_sum}")
```
