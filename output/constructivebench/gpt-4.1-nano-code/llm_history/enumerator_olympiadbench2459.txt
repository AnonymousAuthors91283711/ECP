The given formal statement seems to be a Lean proof involving a problem about linear functions \(f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}\) with a particular property related to the inverse function. The key conditions are:

- \(f(x) = a x + b\) with \(a \neq 0\),
- and for all \(x\), \(f(x) - f^{-1}(x) = 44\).

We need to find the explicit form of such a function \(f\). To assist in conjecturing the answer, we will:

1. Choose small sample values for parameters \(a\) and \(b\) satisfying the conditions.
2. Derive \(f^{-1}\) for each candidate \(f\).
3. Check whether \(f(x) - f^{-1}(x) = 44\) holds, and if yes, print \(f\).

Note: The functional equation resembles a linear equation whose solution can be found analytically, but here we generate candidates to observe the pattern.

```python
import numpy as np

# We know for a linear function f(x) = a*x + b with a != 0,
# its inverse is f_inv(y) = (y - b)/a.

# For arbitrary candidate values of a and b, check the property:
# f(x) - f_inv(x) = 44 for all x.
# Since both are linear, this should produce an identity in x.

# To find candidate (a, b), analyze the condition:
# f(x) - f_inv(x) = (a*x + b) - ((x - b)/a) = 44
# Rearranged: a*x + b - (x - b)/a = 44

# Let's pick small a values and solve for b.

# We will try a few sample a's and compute corresponding b's.

for a in np.linspace(0.1, 5, 50):  # sample a in (0.1, 5)
    # For the identity to hold for all x, the coefficient of x must match,
    # so coefficient of x on LHS: a - 1/a, and the constant term: b + b/a.
    # From the equation, let's derive b in terms of a:
    # Since (a*x + b) - ((x - b)/a) = 44,
    # for this to hold for all x, coefficients must match:

    # Coefficient of x:
    # a - (1/a) = 0  -> a^2 = 1 -> a = ±1
    # We only consider positive a for simplicity and because a != 0.

    if abs(a**2 - 1) < 1e-6:
        # Then, the linear parts cancel out the x term, and the difference is constant:
        # Compute b:
        # f(x) - f_inv(x) = 44
        # For any x:
        # (a*x + b) - ((x - b)/a) = 44
        # Write as:
        # a*x + b - (x/a) + (b/a) = 44
        # group x terms:
        # (a - 1/a) * x + b + b/a = 44
        # Since a^2=1, a=1 or -1.

        for a_val in [1.0, -1.0]:
            # a^2=1
            b = (44 - (a_val + 1/a_val) * 0) / 1  # because coefficient of x vanishes
            # But the coefficient of x:
            # (a - 1/a) * x = 0 -> True because a=±1.
            # So constant term:
            # b + b/a = 44
            # Solve for b:
            # b*(1 + 1/a) = 44
            b = 44 / (1 + 1/a_val)
            # For a=1: b=44/2=22
            # For a=-1: b=44/(1 -1)= division by zero, discard
            if a_val == 1:
                print(f"Candidate function: f(x) = {a_val} * x + {b}")
            # For a=-1, skip due to division by zero.
```

**Summary:** This code explores parameter values \(a\) and deduces corresponding \(b\) satisfying the given functional difference condition, providing explicit candidates for the function \(f\). When run, it will print candidate functions that satisfy the problem's constraints.
