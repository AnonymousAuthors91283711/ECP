The problem seems to be asking for the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that \( n \) is divisible by three increasing positive integers \( a < b < c \) with \( a + b + c = 2022 \). To find the minimal such \( n \), we can generate candidate triples \((a, b, c)\) under the constraints and check their divisibility.

We will:
- Enumerate triples \((a, b, c)\) with \( a < b < c \),
- where \( a, b, c \in \mathbb{N} \),
- with \( a + b + c = 2022 \).

Given the large sum, we choose small \( a \), then deduce bounds for \( b \), ensuring \( a < b < c \). For each valid triple, compute \( n = \operatorname{lcm}(a, b, c) \), and output the minimal such \( n \).

The code:
- Enumerates all candidates with \( a \) from 1 up to an approximate bound,
- Checks the divisibility conditions,
- Tracks minimal \( n \),
- Prints each candidate's computed \( n \).

```python
import math

min_n = None  # To track the minimal n found
# For small a, b, c with a + b + c = 2022, we limit a because a < b < c and sum fixed.
for a in range(1, 673):  # since 3 * 673 > 2022, limit a to 672
    for b in range(a+1, 2022 - a//2):  # ensure b > a and c > b
        c = 2022 - a - b
        if c <= b:  # maintain increasing order
            continue
        # Compute the least common multiple of a, b, c
        lcm_ab = math.lcm(a, b)
        n = math.lcm(lcm_ab, c)
        print(f"Triple: ({a}, {b}, {c}), lcm: {n}")
        if min_n is None or n < min_n:
            min_n = n
print(f"Minimal n with such a triple: {min_n}")
```
