This problem appears to involve a sequence `a(n)` defined recursively, with a sum of that sequence, and a question about the greatest `k` such that its sum is less than or equal to a given value. The sequence has `a(1) = 2` and `a(n) = a(n-1) + 1/n` for `n ≥ 2`. Recognizing this recursive relation, `a(n)` is:

```
a(n) = 2 + ∑_{k=2}^{n} 1/k
```

which simplifies to:

```
a(n) = 2 + (H_n - 1) = 1 + H_n
```

where `H_n` is the nth harmonic number.

The sum of the `a(n)` sequence up to infinity is:

```
∑_{n=1}^{∞} a(n) = ∑_{n=1}^{∞} (1 + H_n)
```

This diverges as harmonic numbers grow unbounded. However, the problem states a sum `∑' n, a n` converges to `338551 + 1/2`, which suggests the partial sum stops at some finite `k`.

Our goal is to find the greatest `k` such that:

```
∑_{n=1}^{k} a(n) ≤ 338551 + 1/2
```

Approach:
- Use approximate harmonic number values for large `n`.
- Sum `a(n)` = `1 + H_n`.
- Sum of `a(n)` up to `k`:

```
S(k) = ∑_{n=1}^{k} (1 + H_n) = ∑_{n=1}^{k} 1 + ∑_{n=1}^{k} H_n = k + ∑_{n=1}^{k} H_n
```

- The sum of harmonic numbers, `∑_{n=1}^{k} H_n`, can be approximated:

```
∑_{n=1}^{k} H_n ≈ (k+1) H_k - k
```

which is an asymptotic approximation but suitable for large `k`.

I'll implement an enumeration to find the largest `k` for which `S(k) ≤ 338551.5`.

```python
import math

def harmonic(n):
    # Approximate harmonic number
    if n < 1:
        return 0
    return math.log(n) + 0.5772156649 + 1/(2*n) - 1/(12*n**2)

target = 338551 + 0.5

# Initialize
k = 1
current_sum = 0

# Enumerate until exceeding target
while True:
    H_k = harmonic(k)
    sum_H = (k + 1) * H_k - k  # approximation of ∑_{n=1}^k H_n
    total = k + sum_H
    print(f"k={k}, sum={total}")
    if total > target:
        break
    k += 1

# The previous k-1 is the greatest k satisfying the inequality
print(f"Greatest k with sum ≤ {target}: {k-1}")
```
