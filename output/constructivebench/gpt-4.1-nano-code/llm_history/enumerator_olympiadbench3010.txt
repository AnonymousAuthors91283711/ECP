The problem appears to involve finding the minimal natural number \( n \) such that there exists a family of subsets of a finite set with certain covering and intersection properties. 

From the description:
- For each \( i \), \( f(i) \subseteq \text{Fin } 8 \), with \( |f(i)| \in \{2,3\} \).
- For every distinct pair \( x, y \in \text{Fin } 8 \), there exists a unique \( i \) such that \( \{x, y\} \subseteq f(i) \).

This resembles a combinatorial design problem, specifically covering all pairs in a set of size 8 with subsets of size 2 or 3, where each pair appears exactly once in the family.

The minimal size of such a family corresponds to the minimum number of blocks needed to cover all pairs exactly once, with blocks of size 2 or 3.

Approach:
- Generate all possible pairs of \(\text{Fin } 8\) (i.e., all pairs of elements from 0..7).
- Systematically attempt to construct a family of subsets of size 2 or 3 covering all pairs exactly once.
- Try small values for \( n \), starting from the smallest plausible, and check if such a covering exists.

Since enumerating all possible covers can be complex, we'll implement a backtracking approach for a small \( n \):
- For simplicity, try \( n \) from 1 up to, say, 15.
- For each \( n \), attempt to assign subsets \( f(i) \) satisfying the conditions and covering all pairs exactly once.

Note: We won't attempt to optimize heavily; just systematically check feasibility.

The code:

```python
from itertools import combinations, permutations
import sys

# Sets of size 2 or 3 from 0..7
elements = range(8)
pairs = list(combinations(elements, 2))
subsets = [tuple(s) for size in (2,3) for s in combinations(elements, size)]

def can_cover(all_pairs, subsets, n):
    # Backtracking to assign subsets to cover all pairs exactly once
    used_pairs = set()
    chosen = []

    def backtrack(idx):
        if len(used_pairs) == len(all_pairs):
            return True
        if idx >= n:
            return False
        for s in subsets:
            s_pairs = list(combinations(s, 2))
            if all(p not in used_pairs for p in s_pairs):
                # Choose s
                for p in s_pairs:
                    used_pairs.add(p)
                chosen.append(s)
                if backtrack(idx + 1):
                    return True
                # Backtrack
                for p in s_pairs:
                    used_pairs.remove(p)
                chosen.pop()
        return False

    return backtrack(0)

# Search for minimal n
for n in range(1, 20):
    if can_cover(pairs, subsets, n):
        print(n)
        break
```

This approach attempts small values of \( n \), trying to find the minimal number such that all pairs are covered exactly once by subsets of size 2 or 3. It prints out the minimal such \( n \).
