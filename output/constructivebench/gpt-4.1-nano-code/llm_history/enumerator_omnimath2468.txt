This problem involves geometric measure theory and probability with measure-preserving transformations. The key idea is to analyze the set S, the transformation T, and compute the probability p that a randomly chosen point in S gets mapped back into S under T, then find coprime integers a/b approximating p and satisfy the linear relation 100 * a + b.

I'll use a simple discretization for S (unit square), apply T to points, and check how many map back into S scaled by μ(S) (area of S, which is 1). The probability simplifies to the ratio of points in S that remain in S after T.

Here's a step-by-step plan:
- Discretize the square [0,1]×[0,1].
- Count points within S that map under T back into S.
- Calculate the ratio as an approximation of p.
- Loop over candidate fractions a/b close to p to find those with 100 * a + b within a certain range.
- Print all candidates matching the approximate ratio.

Maximize efficiency by grid sampling with a moderate resolution (say 100x100). To keep output within tokens, I'll select a small sample resolution and limit candidate checks.

```python
# Enumerate possible p approximations from a grid sampling
resolution = 100
points_in_S = 0
points_in_T_inv_S = 0

# Loop over a grid in [0,1]x[0,1]
for i in range(resolution + 1):
    for j in range(resolution + 1):
        x = i / resolution
        y = j / resolution
        # Check if point is in S
        if 0 <= x <= 1 and 0 <= y <= 1:
            points_in_S += 1
            # Transform point
            x_t = 3*x + 2*y
            y_t = x + 4*y
            # Check if transformed point is in S
            if 0 <= x_t <= 1 and 0 <= y_t <= 1:
                points_in_T_inv_S += 1

# Compute approximate probability p
p = points_in_T_inv_S / points_in_S if points_in_S else 0

# Search for nearby rational approximations a/b
candidate_fractionals = []
max_b = 100  # limit denominator
for b in range(1, max_b + 1):
    a_float = p * b
    a = round(a_float)
    if 0 < a < b:  # ensures probability less than 1
        # Check if ratio close to p
        approx_p = a / b
        if abs(approx_p - p) < 0.01:
            candidate_fractionals.append((a, b, 100 * a + b))

# output results
print(f"Estimated p = {p}")
for a, b, val in candidate_fractionals:
    print(f"Candidate ratio: {a}/{b} = {approx_p}, sum = {val}")
```
