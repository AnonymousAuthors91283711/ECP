Maximum pair: (35, 90). Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ
The pattern suggests pairs where (p₁, p₂) satisfy (p₁ + p₂)(p₁ + p₂ + 1) = k * p₁ * p₂, with maximum at (35, 90). The maximum occurs at p₁=35, p₂=90, and k=5. Since we want the greatest p₁ and p₂ satisfying the conditions, and based on enumerations, the pair likely corresponds to (35, 90). To express the maximum in closed form, the pair with largest p₂ given constraints occurs at p₁=35, p₂=90. 

Answer: <<< (35, 90) >>>
