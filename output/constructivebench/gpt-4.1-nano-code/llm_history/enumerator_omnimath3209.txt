This problem involves a fraction equality involving positive integers \( m, n, p \), and a rational number \( 17/3 \). The key step is to analyze the given equation:

\[
m + \frac{1}{n + \frac{1}{p}} = \frac{17}{3}
\]

Since \( m > 0 \) and the sum equals a rational, the easiest approach is to consider possible integer values of \( m \), then solve for \( n \) and \( p \).

Assuming \( m \) is an integer close to \( 17/3 \), which is approximately 5.666..., the only integer \( m \) satisfying \( m \leq \frac{17}{3} \) but close to it is \( m = 5 \) or \( 6 \). Because the sum is exactly \( 17/3 \), and the left-hand side involves positive quantities, \( m \) should be \( 5 \) or \( 6 \).

Given the target is \( 17/3 \), and \( m \) contributes to the sum, I'll try \( m=5 \):

\[
5 + \frac{1}{n + \frac{1}{p}} = \frac{17}{3}
\]

\[
\Rightarrow \frac{1}{n + \frac{1}{p}} = \frac{17}{3} - 5 = \frac{17 - 15}{3} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

\[
\Rightarrow n + \frac{1}{p} = \frac{3}{2}
\]

Since \( n \) is a positive integer, the only way to write:

\[
n + \frac{1}{p} = \frac{3}{2}
\]

with \( n \geq 1 \), is to check \( n=1 \):

\[
1 + \frac{1}{p} = \frac{3}{2} \Rightarrow \frac{1}{p} = \frac{1}{2} \Rightarrow p=2
\]

which satisfies \( p > 0 \). For other \( n \), like \( n=2 \):

\[
2 + \frac{1}{p} = \frac{3}{2} \Rightarrow \frac{1}{p} = -\frac{1}{2}
\]

which is negative and invalid since \( p > 0 \). For \( n \geq 2 \), no solution.

Similarly, check \( m=6 \):

\[
6 + \frac{1}{n + \frac{1}{p}} = \frac{17}{3} \Rightarrow \frac{1}{n + \frac{1}{p}} = \frac{17}{3} - 6 = \frac{17 - 18}{3} = -\frac{1}{3}
\]

which is negative, invalid as the denominator is positive. So only \( m=5 \) works, and the consistent solution is:

\[
m=5, \quad n=1, \quad p=2
\]

and thus the answer for \( omnimath3209_answer \) is \( 2 \).

Now, to produce all candidate solutions systematically, I will implement enumeration over small \( m \), \( n \), and \( p \), checking if the sum equals \( 17/3 \).

```python
# Enumerate small positive integers for m, n, p within small bounds
# Check if m + 1/(n + 1/p) == 17/3
# Print solutions when found

target = 17/3
for m in range(1, 10):
    for n in range(1, 10):
        for p in range(1, 10):
            frac = m + 1/(n + 1/p)
            # Check exact rational equality
            if abs(frac - target) < 1e-10:
                print(f"m={m}, n={n}, p={p} => {frac}")
```
