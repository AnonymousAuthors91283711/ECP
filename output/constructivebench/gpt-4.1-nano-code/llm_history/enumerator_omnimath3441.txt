[write_program]
The problem appears to request finding all natural numbers n such that 10^n ≤ 2014 ≤ 10^(n+1). This corresponds to finding the value of n for which 2014 is between 10^n and 10^(n+1). Since 10^3 = 1000 and 10^4 = 10000, and 2014 lies between these two, the answer should be n = 3.

To help confirm this, the Python program iterates over small n values, checks the inequalities, and streams the candidates that satisfy them.

```python
# Enumerate n from 0 to 10 to find the n such that 10^n ≤ 2014 ≤ 10^(n+1)
# Since 2014 is between 10^3=1000 and 10^4=10000, expect n=3

answers = set()
for n in range(0, 10):
    lower = 10 ** n
    upper = 10 ** (n + 1)
    if lower <= 2014 <= upper:
        print(n)  # Stream the answer as soon as found
        answers.add(n)
```
