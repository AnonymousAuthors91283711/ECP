This problem appears to be about finding the least natural number \( n \) such that \( T \leq \binom{n}{2} \times \binom{n-2}{2} \), with an unknown parameter \( T \). To assist in conjecturing or proving the answer, I will write a Python script that, for a given \( T \), enumerates candidate \( n \) values starting from 2 upwards, computes \( \binom{n}{2} \times \binom{n-2}{2} \), and prints out all those that meet or exceed \( T \). The script will stop after reaching a reasonable upper bound or once it finds the minimal \( n \).

I'll choose some small sample \( T \) values because the problem involves combinatorial expressions that grow quickly. The script will output each candidate as soon as it's found, prioritizing exact values, and will explicitly identify the minimal \( n \) satisfying the condition.

```python
import math

# Function to compute n choose k
def comb(n, k):
    return math.comb(n, k)

# Example sample T values to explore
T_values = [10, 20, 30]

for T in T_values:
    print(f"Checking for T = {T}")
    found_n = None
    # Search from n=2 upward
    for n in range(2, 50):  # limit to prevent infinite loop
        value = comb(n, 2) * comb(n-2, 2)
        if value >= T:
            print(f"n = {n}, value = {value}")
            if found_n is None:
                found_n = n
            # Since we want the least n, break upon first success
            break
    if found_n:
        print(f"Least n satisfying T={T} is {found_n}\n")
    else:
        print(f"No n found up to 50 for T={T}\n")
```
