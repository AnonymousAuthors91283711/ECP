The problem appears to involve expressing a certain rational function involving c and then finding integer parameters that satisfy some relations. Since the problem resembles an algebraic manipulation and the goal is to find integer solutions for the relationships among these parameters, we can proceed by choosing small sample values of c (excluding c = 3/2), compute the corresponding values of `f(c)` and `finv(c)`, and then attempt to find integer solutions (k, l, m, n) satisfying the relations.

Here's the approach:
- Select a small sample `c` (e.g., c = 1, c = 0, c = -1) avoiding the excluded value 3/2.
- Compute `f(c)` and `finv(c)`.
- For various small integers k, l, m, n, check whether we can satisfy:
  - `finv c * c * f c = (k * c + l) / (m * c + n)`
  - and
  - `k * n^2 / (l * m) = P2004AMCB_13_answer`
- Since `P2004AMCB_13_answer` is unknown (`sorry`), we can just note possible candidate values for it based on computations, thus streamlining the enumeration.

This code streamlines the enumeration of candidates, searching for small integer solutions that satisfy the rational relations, and outputs each candidate immediately.

```python
# Enumerate small integer parameters to find possible solutions to the rational relations
# involving functions f(c) and finv(c) for selected sample c values.
# This helps in conjecturing the exact value (P2004AMCB_13_answer).

# Sample c values avoiding c = 3/2
sample_c_values = [1, 0, -1]

# Function definitions
def f(c):
    return 3 / (2 * c - 3)

def finv(c):
    return (3 + 3 * c) / (2 * c)

# Range of small integers to test
limit = 10

for c in sample_c_values:
    fc = f(c)
    finvc = finv(c)
    # Compute the target value `product` as per the relation
    product = finvc * c * fc
    for k in range(-limit, limit + 1):
        for l in range(-limit, limit + 1):
            for m in range(1, limit + 1):  # m != 0 to avoid division by zero
                for n in range(-limit, limit + 1):
                    denom = m * c + n
                    if abs(denom) < 1e-8:
                        continue
                    # Check if (k * c + l) / denom equals product (within tolerance)
                    lhs = (k * c + l) / denom
                    if abs(lhs - product) < 1e-6:
                        # Now check the second relation for candidate answer
                        # To avoid division by zero
                        if abs(l * m) < 1e-8:
                            continue
                        candidate_answer = k * n**2 / (l * m)
                        print(f"c={c:.2f}, k={k}, l={l}, m={m}, n={n}")
                        print(f"  f(c)={fc:.3f}, finv(c)={finvc:.3f}")
                        print(f"  lhs={(k*c+l)/(m*c+n):.6f} |\| product={product:.6f}")
                        print(f"  candidate answer={candidate_answer:.6f}")
```
