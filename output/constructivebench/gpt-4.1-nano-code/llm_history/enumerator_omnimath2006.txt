This problem appears to involve combinatorial enumeration over permutations and their properties related to divisibility, with a focus on maximizing a certain count based on permutations π. Given the high-level description, it appears to concern the maximum size of a set of permutations satisfying specific divisibility conditions on their images.

To assist in conjecturing and potentially proving the answer, we will:

- Define a small finite domain, e.g., n = 12, as indicated in the code.
- Enumerate all permutations π of {0, 1, ..., 11} (using `itertools.permutations`) for small sample sizes or specific π's.
- For each π, compute the set { n in [0..10] | π(n) divides π(n+1) }, count it, and track the maximum.

Since the problem is high-level and the full enumeration could be huge, we'll limit to a small subset of permutations (e.g., permutations with some fixed structure) and print candidate values.

This code:

- Sets small parameters.
- Enumerates permutations (sampled to keep runtime manageable).
- Calculates the size of the divisibility set.
- Prints each attempt's result.

```python
import itertools
import math

# Sample size
N = 12

max_count = 0
max_permutation = None

# Generate some permutations with structure to reduce total computations
# For example, the identity and a few variants
sample_permutations = [
    list(range(N)),  # identity
]
# Add permutations with a small swap to induce variety
sample_permutations.extend([
    list(range(1, N)) + [0],
    list(range(0, N, 2)) + list(range(1, N, 2)),
    list(reversed(range(N))),
])

# For each sample permutation
for perm in sample_permutations:
    # Count the number of n where π(n) divides π(n+1)
    count = 0
    for n in range(N - 1):
        a = perm[n]
        b = perm[n + 1]
        if a != 0 and b % a == 0:
            count += 1
    print(f"Permutation: {perm}, divisibility count: {count}")
    if count > max_count:
        max_count = count
        max_permutation = perm

print(f"Maximum divisibility set size observed: {max_count}")
```
