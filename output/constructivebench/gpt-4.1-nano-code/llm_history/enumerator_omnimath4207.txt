The problem involves defining a set `omnimath4207_answer` that, for a given natural number `n`, produces a finite subset of â„• with specific properties: size `n`, contained in the interval `[1, M]`, and with sums of pairs being unique (i.e., an *injective sumset*). We need to enumerate candidate sets that satisfy these properties for `n=100` and `M=25000`.

Since the code cannot hardcode the answer or rely on advanced set constructions, we focus on generating candidate *sum-free sets* of size `n=100` within `[1, M]`, aiming to avoid duplicate sums.

To streamline, we'll generate subsets that are sequences of increasing numbers starting from 1, skipping to ensure sum uniqueness, and up to size 100. For performance and clarity, we'll generate candidate sets incrementally, check the size and sum uniqueness, and print as soon as they meet criteria.

This approach prioritizes simplicity, correctness, and streaming output, without exceeding token limits.

```python
import itertools

def is_sum_unique(s):
    sums = set()
    for x, y in itertools.combinations(s, 2):
        s_sum = x + y
        if s_sum in sums:
            return False
        sums.add(s_sum)
    return True

def generate_candidate():
    # Generate a sequence within [1, 25000]
    s = []
    x = 1
    while len(s) < 100 and x <= 25000:
        # Check if adding x preserves sum uniqueness
        if is_sum_unique(s + [x]):
            s.append(x)
            print(f"Found candidate set of size {len(s)}: {s}")
        x += 1
    if len(s) == 100:
        print("Completed candidate set:", s)
        return s
    else:
        print("Failed to generate a full candidate within bounds.")
        return s

if __name__ == "__main__":
    candidate = generate_candidate()
```
