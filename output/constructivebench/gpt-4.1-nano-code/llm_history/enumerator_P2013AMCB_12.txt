The problem involves enumerating all trails (path sequences) on a specific small graph with 5 nodes and 7 edges, starting and ending at specified nodes, counting only trails that use each edge exactly once and satisfy certain start/end conditions. To assist with the enumeration, we will generate all permutations of edges, filter those that meet the conditions, and find the total count.

We'll:
- List all permutations of the 7 edges,
- Filter permutations that form valid trails (connected and no repeated edges),
- Check start/end constraints,
- Count these trails to get the total number.

This approach is feasible given the small size (7 edges) and small graph.

```python
import itertools

# Define the roads (edges) in the graph
roads = [
    (0, 1),
    (0, 3),
    (0, 4),
    (1, 2),
    (1, 3),
    (2, 3),
    (3, 4),
]

# Nodes: 0 to 4
A, B = 0, 1  # Starting and ending nodes

# Helper function to check if a sequence of edges forms a trail
def is_valid_trail(edge_sequence):
    visited_edges = set()
    current_node = edge_sequence[0][0]

    for u, v in edge_sequence:
        # Check edge used once
        if (u, v) in visited_edges or (v, u) in visited_edges:
            return False
        visited_edges.add((u, v))
        # Check connectivity
        if u != current_node:
            return False
        current_node = v

    # Check start node condition (A at start)
    start_edge = edge_sequence[0]
    start_node = start_edge[0] if start_edge[0] == A or start_edge[1] == A else None
    if start_node is None:
        start_node = start_edge[1] if start_edge[0] == A else start_edge[0]
    if start_node != A:
        return False

    # Check end node condition (B at end)
    end_edge = edge_sequence[-1]
    end_node = end_edge[1] if end_edge[0] == B else end_edge[0]
    if end_node != B:
        return False

    # Ensure all edges are used exactly once
    return len(visited_edges) == len(edge_sequence)

# Generate all permutations of the edges
total_trails = 0
for perm in itertools.permutations(roads):
    if is_valid_trail(perm):
        total_trails += 1
        print(perm)  # Stream the valid trail as a sequence of edges

print(f"Total number of valid trails: {total_trails}")
# Assign the total count to the answer variable
P2013AMCB_12_answer = total_trails
```
