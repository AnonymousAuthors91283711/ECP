theorem omnimath1433 : 
  Fintype.card {f : Fin 10 → Fin 3 // ∀ (a b : Fin 10), 
    Odd (a.val - b.val) → f a ≠ f b} = omnimath1433_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Function: [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
Function: [0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2]
Function: [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
Function: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]
Function: [2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0]
Function: [2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1]
Total functions: 6. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<6>>>
This counts the number of functions from a 10-element finite set to 3 elements, with no two elements of differing parity mapped to the same value; as per enumeration, the total count is 6.
