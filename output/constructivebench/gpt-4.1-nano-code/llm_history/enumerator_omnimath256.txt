The problem appears to ask for pairs \((a, b)\) of integers for which there exist functions \(f, g : \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}\) satisfying:
- \(f(g(x)) = x + a\),
- \(g(f(x)) = x + b\).

This resembles a problem about mutual conjugation or affine-like functions, possibly indicating a relationship involving linear or affine transformations.

Given the functions are from \(\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}\) and involve compositions with constant shifts, start by examining simple affine functions and their compositions, then approximate solutions.

For simplicity, limit the exploration to basic affine functions of the form \(f(x) = m x + c\), \(g(x) = n x + d\), and look for solutions where compositions produce shifts.

Here's an enumeration over small integer parameters to find such pairs \((a, b)\).

```python
# Enumerate small linear functions with parameters in range [-3, 3]
# and check if compositions satisfy the conditions for some a, b.
# The code searches for pairs (a, b) with corresponding functions f, g.

answers = set()

# Search over possible affine functions f, g
for m in range(-3, 4):
    for c in range(-3, 4):
        for n in range(-3, 4):
            for d in range(-3, 4):
                # For each candidate, try to find integers a, b satisfying the conditions for some x
                # For simplicity, test x in [-5,5] and see if relations hold consistently
                
                consistent = True
                a_values = set()
                b_values = set()
                for x in range(-5, 6):
                    # f(g(x))
                    fg_x = m * (n * x + d) + c
                    # g(f(x))
                    gf_x = n * (m * x + c) + d
                    # Differences
                    a_candidate = fg_x - x
                    b_candidate = gf_x - x
                    a_values.add(a_candidate)
                    b_values.add(b_candidate)
                    # Check if the differences are consistent over all x
                    if len(a_values) > 1 or len(b_values) > 1:
                        consistent = False
                        break
                if consistent:
                    a = a_values.pop()
                    b = b_values.pop()
                    # Store the pair
                    answers.add((a, b))
                    print((a, b))
# The set 'answers' now contains all found pairs with corresponding simple affine f, g.
```
