The problem describes finding the minimal value of \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \) under the condition \( a b c + a + b + c = a b + b c + c a + 5 \). To assist in conjecturing, I will concretely analyze the constraint for small real values and aim to find candidate solutions that satisfy it, then compute the sum of squares for those solutions. This approach involves enumerating numerical solutions, seeking the minimum.

The key steps:
- Fix small sample values for \( a, b, c \).
- Check if they satisfy the constraint.
- If they do, compute \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \).
- Keep track of minimal results found during enumeration.

Since the problem involves real numbers, I'll limit enumeration over a small grid (e.g., from -10 to 10 with step 1) for simplicity and efficiency, trying to locate candidate minima.

```python
# Enumerate small real solutions for (a, b, c) in range [-10, 10]
# Check the constraint and compute sum of squares
min_sum_squares = float('inf')
best_candidates = []

for a in range(-10, 11):
    for b in range(-10, 11):
        for c in range(-10, 11):
            # Convert to float for more generality
            a_f, b_f, c_f = float(a), float(b), float(c)
            # Check the constraint: a*b*c + a + b + c == a*b + b*c + c*a + 5
            lhs = a_f * b_f * c_f + a_f + b_f + c_f
            rhs = a_f * b_f + b_f * c_f + c_f * a_f + 5
            if abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-6:
                sum_squares = a_f**2 + b_f**2 + c_f**2
                print(f"Solution: a={a_f}, b={b_f}, c={c_f}, sum of squares={sum_squares}")
                if sum_squares < min_sum_squares:
                    min_sum_squares = sum_squares
                    best_candidates = [(a_f, b_f, c_f)]
                elif abs(sum_squares - min_sum_squares) < 1e-6:
                    best_candidates.append((a_f, b_f, c_f))

print(f"\nApproximate minimal sum of squares: {min_sum_squares}")
print("Candidate solutions achieving this minimum:")
for cand in best_candidates:
    print(cand)
```
