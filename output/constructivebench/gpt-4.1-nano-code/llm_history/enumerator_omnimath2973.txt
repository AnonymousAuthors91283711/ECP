[write_program]
Below is a Python program that enumerates all numbers from 0 to 99, checks if the digit 6 appears in their decimal representation, and counts how many satisfy this condition. The program immediately prints each qualifying number as it finds it. This will help in deducing the total count.

```python
# Enumerate numbers from 0 to 99, check if digit '6' appears
for n in range(100):
    s = str(n)
    if '6' in s:
        print(n)
```
