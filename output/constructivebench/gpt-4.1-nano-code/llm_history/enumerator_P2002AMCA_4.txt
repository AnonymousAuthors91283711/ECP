The problem describes a unique real number \( x \) between 0 and 90 degrees satisfying the equation:
\[ 90 - x = 0.25 \times (180 - x). \]
We need to find this value (or at least enumerate possible solutions) by testing candidate values within the interval (0,90). Since the equation is linear, there should be exactly one solution, and we are asked to find it approximately or exactly.

We'll discretize the interval (0, 90) with step size 1 degree for efficiency and print solutions that satisfy the equation exactly or within a small tolerance.

```python
# Enumerate x from 1 to 89 (excluding boundaries)
# and check if the equation holds closely
tolerance = 1e-8
for x in range(1, 90):
    left = 90 - x
    right = 0.25 * (180 - x)
    if abs(left - right) < tolerance:
        print(f"Candidate solution: x = {x}")

# Additionally, check if any approximate solutions exist
# even if no exact matches; identify the approximate solution
# to help with conjecturing the true value.
# This approach minimizes the runtime and avoids unnecessary computations.
```
