Ground Truth Answer: fun x y z => Real.sqrt 3
Proposed Answer: fun x y z => log 64 / (log x + log y + log z)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves logarithmic identities and exponents with variables x, y, z > 1.

2. The ground truth answer suggests that log y / log x = √3.

3. The proposed answer suggests a different expression involving log 64 divided by the sum of logs.

Key observations:
- From the given equations, we can derive relationships between the variables
- Taking logs of all three given equations and solving the system should lead to a consistent solution
- The ground truth answer √3 is correct (this can be verified by assuming x = y^a, z = y^b and solving the system)
- The proposed answer doesn't simplify to √3 and doesn't match the ground truth

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
1. It introduces log 64 which doesn't naturally appear in the solution
2. The denominator (sum of logs) isn't part of the correct solution
3. The expression doesn't simplify to √3
