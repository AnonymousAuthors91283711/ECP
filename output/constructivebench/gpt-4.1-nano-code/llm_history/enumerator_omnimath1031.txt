The problem involves summing the values of `phi_factorial n` for n from 2 to 50, where n and 50 are coprime, and then taking the sum modulo 50. We need to:
- Compute `phi_factorial n`: the product of all integers from 1 to n that are coprime with n.
- Sum these for n in the specified range, filtering by gcd condition.
- Output possible candidates for the answer, especially considering the modular arithmetic.

Strategy:
- Small sample parameters (n from 2 to 50).
- Efficiently compute gcd and the filter.
- Use Python's built-in functions to simulate the mathematical operations.
- Stream results as they are discovered, focusing on exact values.
- No hardcoded answer; just enumerate possibilities and discuss conjectures.

```python
import math

def phi_factorial(n):
    """Calculate the product of all positive integers <= n that are coprime with n."""
    product = 1
    for k in range(1, n + 1):
        if math.gcd(k, n) == 1:
            product *= k
    return product

# List to hold the filtered n values and their phi_factorial for analysis
results = []

# Enumerate n from 2 to 50, where gcd(n,50)==1
for n in range(2, 51):
    if math.gcd(n, 50) == 1:
        val = phi_factorial(n)
        results.append((n, val))
        # Print each computed value immediately
        print(f"n={n}, phi_factorial={val}")

# Sum all phi_factorial n values
total_sum = sum(val for _, val in results)
remainder = total_sum % 50
print(f"Sum modulo 50 is: {remainder}")

# The possible values for answer are 0..49; the actual value determined by sum % 50
# Streaming partial results helps in conjecturing the overall sum and its mod 50 behavior.
```
