This appears to be a problem involving the calculation of a large exponential expression modulo 10. To assist, I'll write a Python program that explores possible last digits (0-9) of the given expression, examining the pattern of powers of 23 modulo 10, and then evaluate the expression accordingly.

The problem asks for the last digit of `(23^2023 + 23^20 - 23^23)` modulo 10, which simplifies to considering the powers of 23 modulo 10, since the last digit of 23 raised to any power follows a pattern, and then summing those last digits.

Here's how I will approach it:
- Compute the last digit cycles of 23^n mod 10 (which simplifies to 3^n mod 10, since only the last digit matters).
- For each relevant exponent, find its last digit.
- Sum the last digits, adjust for subtraction, and find the final last digit.
- Output the step-by-step results for possible last digits.

```python
# Enumerate possible last digits of 23^n (which is equivalent to 3^n mod 10)
# since 23 ends with 3, and powers of numbers ending with 3 repeat every 4 steps modulo 10.
def last_digit_of_power(base_last_digit, exponent):
    cycle = {
        0: [0],
        1: [1],
        2: [2,4,8,6],
        3: [3,9,7,1],
        4: [4,6],
        5: [5],
        6: [6],
        7: [7,9,3,1],
        8: [8,4,2,6],
        9: [9,1],
    }
    pattern = cycle[base_last_digit]
    index = (exponent - 1) % len(pattern)  # zero-based indexing
    return pattern[index]

# Exponents to consider
exponents = [2023, 20, 23]
results = []

for exp in exponents:
    last_digit = last_digit_of_power(3, exp)
    results.append((exp, last_digit))
    print(f"23^{exp} last digit: {last_digit}")

# Compute the final last digit of the entire expression
sum_last_digits = results[0][1] + results[1][1] - results[2][1]
final_last_digit = sum_last_digits % 10
print(f"Final last digit of (23^2023 + 23^20 - 23^23): {final_last_digit}")

# This last digit is the answer for the modulo 10 problem.
# Since the original theorem involves the result modulo 10, the answer is the final_last_digit.
```
