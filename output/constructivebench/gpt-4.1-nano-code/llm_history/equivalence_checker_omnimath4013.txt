Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {(2, 2, 3)}
<<<None>>>
Since the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's not provided), we cannot determine whether the proposed answer {(2, 2, 3)} is equivalent to it. The proposed answer correctly identifies one solution (2^3 - 2^3 = 8 - 8 = 0 ≠ 1 is incorrect, but 2^3 - 3^2 = 8 - 9 = -1 ≠ 1 is also incorrect, suggesting there might be an error in the proposed answer), but without knowing the ground truth, we cannot verify equivalence. Additionally, the proposed solution appears incorrect for the given equation.
