The problem is about finding the greatest natural number n such that there exists a nonempty subset S of {0, 1, 2, ..., 42} with the properties:

- |S| = n,
- For every m in S, the number of elements in S less than m is less than m/2.

This is a combinatorial optimization problem. To approximate this, we can search over possible subset sizes n, construct subsets with elements satisfying the condition, and keep track of the maximum n.

Let's implement a practical enumeration with small sample choices, greedily constructing sets and testing the condition.

```python
# This code searches for the maximum size n of subsets S within {0,1,...,42}
# satisfying the condition that for each m in S, the count of smaller elements in S is less than m/2.
# It uses a greedy approach: starting from the largest candidate elements and moving down.
# For efficiency, it stops when no larger set can be found.

def check_property(S):
    S_list = sorted(S)
    for m in S_list:
        count_smaller = sum(1 for x in S_list if x < m)
        if count_smaller >= m / 2:
            return False
    return True

max_n = 0
best_set = set()

# Try all subset sizes from the largest down
for n in range(42, 0, -1):
    # Generate candidate subsets: pick the top n from range(43)
    candidate = set(range(43 - n, 43))
    if check_property(candidate):
        print(f"Found set of size {n}: {sorted(candidate)}")
        max_n = n
        best_set = candidate
        break  # no need to check smaller n

print("Maximum n:", max_n)
print("Corresponding set:", sorted(best_set))
```
