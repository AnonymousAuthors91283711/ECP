Let's analyze the problem: We need to count the number of integers \(k\) such that \(1 \leq k \leq 99\), \(k > 0\), and \(\gcd(k, 200) = 1\). 

Since 200 factors as \(2^3 \times 5^2\), any number coprime with 200 must not be divisible by 2 or 5. 

We only need to count integers from 1 to 99 that are not divisible by 2 or 5.

Approach:
- For each number from 1 to 99:
  - Check if it is coprime with 200 (i.e., not divisible by 2 or 5).
  - Count how many such numbers exist.

Because outputs should be streamed, the solution will print each qualifying \(k\) immediately, then give the total count at the end as the answer.

```python
# Enumerate numbers from 1 to 99, print those coprime with 200 (not divisible by 2 or 5)
# Count total such numbers for the answer.

count = 0
for k in range(1, 100):
    if k % 2 != 0 and k % 5 != 0:
        print(k)
        count += 1
print("Total coprime with 200 in [1, 99]:", count)
# This count is our answer for the card answer (encard).
# The answer (omnimath2290_answer) is the total count (for encoding).
```
