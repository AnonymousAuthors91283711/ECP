This problem involves finding the number of natural numbers \( x \) satisfying:

\[
x > 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \log (x - 40) + \log (60 - x) < 2.
\]

Simplify the inequality:

\[
\log[(x - 40)(60 - x)] < 2.
\]

Exponentiating both sides:

\[
(x - 40)(60 - x) < e^2.
\]

We need to find all integers \( x \) with \( 0 < x \leq 59 \) such that

\[
(x - 40)(60 - x) < e^2.
\]

Note that for the domain:

- \( x - 40 > 0 \Rightarrow x > 40 \),
- \( 60 - x > 0 \Rightarrow x < 60 \).

So \( x \in \{41, 42, 43, \dots, 59\} \).

Now, the expression:

\[
(x - 40)(60 - x).
\]

Let's evaluate for \( x \in 41..59 \) and count how many satisfy the inequality.

```python
import math

# Exact value of e^2
threshold = math.exp(2)  # approximately 7.389056 * 2 â‰ˆ 7.389056

count = 0
# Collect answers for verification
answers = []

for x in range(41, 60):
    value = (x - 40) * (60 - x)
    if value < threshold:
        answers.append(x)
        print(x)  # immediate output for each valid x
        count += 1

print("Total count:", count)
```
