This problem appears to involve an expected number of throws to land in a target area, given initial conditions. We need to compute an expected value based on probabilities and then find possible answers.

The key calculations:
- radius = 20
- target_radius = 10
- initial_darts = 2020
- Probability p = (target_radius^2)/(radius^2) = (10^2)/(20^2) = 100/400 = 1/4
- Expected number of throws = initial_darts * (1/p - 1) = 2020 * (4 - 1) = 2020 * 3 = 6060

A straightforward enumeration of possible answers around this expected value helps confirm the conjecture.

```python
# Compute probability p
radius = 20
target_radius = 10
initial_darts = 2020

p = (target_radius ** 2) / (radius ** 2)  # 1/4
# Calculate expected throws
expected_throws = initial_darts * (1 / p - 1)

# Since p = 1/4, expected_throws = 2020 * (4 - 1) = 6060

# Enumerate possible candidate answers around this value
for candidate in range(6000, 6121):
    print(candidate)
```
