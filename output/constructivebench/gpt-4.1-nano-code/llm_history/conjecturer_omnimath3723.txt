  Nat.Prime (a^4 + 4*b^4) ↔ (a, b) ∈ omnimath3723_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Pair (a=1, b=1) yields prime: 5. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ)
The pattern suggests the prime form is \(a^4 + 4b^4\). For \((a=1, b=1)\), the sum is 5, prime, aligning with known identities. Recognizing the structure parallels the sum of two squares: \(a^4 + 4b^4 = (a^2 + 2b^2)^2 - 4a^2b^2\), which factors when \(a=1, b=1\) as \(5\). But the condition for primality only holds when \(a=1, b=1\). Thus, the set contains only this pair.
