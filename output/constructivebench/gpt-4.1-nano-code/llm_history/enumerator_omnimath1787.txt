This appears to be a formal statement in a Lean-like theorem prover, involving summation over a range of binomial coefficients. Since the problem involves summing `1 / (choose n 2009)` for `n` from 2009 to âˆž, and given the typical behavior of binomial coefficients, the sum converges to a known value related to the binomial theorem.

In particular, note that:

\[
\sum_{n=k}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\binom{n}{k}} = \frac{k}{k-1}
\]

for \(k \geq 2\). When \(k = 2009\):

\[
\sum_{n=2009}^\infty \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2009}} = \frac{2009}{2008}
\]

which is an exact rational number.

The Python code can enumerate this sum by summing over finite terms up to some large N, approaching infinity.

```python
# Sum over n from 2009 to a large N to approximate the infinite sum
from math import comb

k = 2009
N = 2500  # Large enough to approximate the infinite sum

total = 0.0
for n in range(k, N + 1):
    total += 1 / comb(n, k)
    print(total)  # Stream partial sums

# Output the known exact value
print(f"The sum approaches approximately {k / (k - 1)}")
```
