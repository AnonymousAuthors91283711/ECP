13. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ → ℕ
The pattern suggests the answer is a simple linear combination involving a and b, specifically focusing on the median term of the combined series. Since b is the average of five consecutive numbers starting at a, the sum of the next five consecutive numbers starting at b appears to be the sum of these five numbers, which are from b to b + 4. Calculating the average of the next five terms starting from b: (b + (b + 1) + (b + 2) + (b + 3) + (b + 4)) / 5, which simplifies to b + 2. Substituting b's expression leads to an expression related to a. Final simplification yields a constant offset. The pattern in enumerated answer choices indicates the middle value, which, considering how b was defined, simplifies to a + 4. Thus, the answer is 4.
