abbrev P2002AIMEII_8_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem P2002AIMEII_8 : 
  IsLeast {k : ℕ | 0 < k ∧ ∀ n : ℕ, n ≠ 0 → ⌊(2002 : ℚ) / n⌋ ≠ k} P2002AIMEII_8_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 49
The least positive integer not achieved as floor(2002/n): 49. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Since the floor values of 2002/n for positive n cover all integers from 1 up to 48, and 49 is the first integer not achieved, the answer is 48. 

<<<48>>>
