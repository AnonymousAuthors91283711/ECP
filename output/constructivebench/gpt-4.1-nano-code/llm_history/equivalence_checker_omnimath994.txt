Ground Truth Answer: 1999008 / 1999012
Proposed Answer: (3998016 : ℚ) / (3998020 : ℚ)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves calculating a ratio of two quantities:
   - Numerator: sum of same-color pairs (n*(n-1) for each color)
   - Denominator: same numerator plus red-green pairs (2*2)

2. Calculating sameColorPairs:
   - For all colors with count=2: 8 colors × 2×(2-1) = 8×2 = 16
   - For copper (count=2000): 2000×1999 = 3,998,000
   - Total sameColorPairs = 16 + 3,998,000 = 3,998,016

3. redGreenPairs = 2×2 = 4

4. Denominator = 3,998,016 + 4 = 3,998,020

5. Ground truth gives 1,999,008 / 1,999,012
   - This is exactly half of the proposed answer (3,998,016/3,998,020)

The proposed answer is correct, while the ground truth appears to be a simplified version that's incorrect (it should be the full numerator/denominator, not halved).
