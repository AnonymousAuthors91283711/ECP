The code snippet appears to be a Lean theorem involving the `Mathlib` library and a placeholder `sorry`. To assist with enumerating possible answers for this high-school level math problem, I will assume it relates to an example such as finding all solutions to a basic Diophantine equation or similar. Since the specific problem isn't provided, I will demonstrate code that enumerates all pairs (x, y) within small bounds to find potential solutions to a typical problem like `x^2 + y^2 = 25`. Adjust the bounds and the equation as needed for your specific problem.

This approach will generate solutions, printing each found solution immediately, and demonstrate enumeration with small parameters.

```python
# Enumerate all integer solutions to x^2 + y^2 = 25 within small bounds (-10 to 10)
limit = 10
for x in range(-limit, limit + 1):
    for y in range(-limit, limit + 1):
        if x * x + y * y == 25:
            print(f"Solution: x={x}, y={y}")
```

This code:
- Enumerates all pairs (x, y) within a small range.
- Checks if they satisfy the equation.
- Prints each solution immediately when found.

Adjust the `limit` and the equation as needed for your specific test problem, and it will help in theorizing potential solutions or patterns.
