The problem involves finding the greatest natural number n such that there exists a k with certain properties related to prime sums and inequalities. Specifically, for all m < n, the inequality k + m + 1 > 25 holds, and for each such m, there are two distinct primes p and q with p + q = k + m + 1.

Key points:
- For each m < n, k + m + 1 > 25
- For each m < n, there are primes p, q with p + q = k + m + 1, p ≠ q
- We seek the greatest such n

Since the constraints involve prime sums greater than 25, and for all m < n, the inequality must hold, the smallest value of k can be derived as follows:
- The smallest sum p + q for two distinct primes cannot be less than 5 (since 2+3=5).
- The sum p + q must be greater than 25, meaning p + q ≥ 27 (since sums are integers).

Let's choose sample prime sums starting from 27 upwards, verify which can be written as sums of two distinct primes, and determine the maximum n satisfying the property.

To do this efficiently:
- Generate all prime sums ≥ 27.
- For each sum, check if it can be written as p + q with p ≠ q,
- For each such sum, determine the maximum number of m (below n) for which k + m + 1 matches these sums.

Here's a Python code that searches for the maximum n based on these conditions:

```python
import itertools

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5)+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Generate primes up to a certain limit for sums
primes = [p for p in range(2, 50) if is_prime(p)]

# Generate possible prime sums >= 27
prime_sums = set()
for p, q in itertools.combinations(primes, 2):
    s = p + q
    if s >= 27:
        prime_sums.add(s)

# For each k, check how many m can satisfy the conditions
max_n = 0
k_candidate = None

# Assume k >= 0, start from minimal possible to some limit
for k in range(0, 50):
    valid = True
    # We want the maximum n such that for all m < n:
    # k + m + 1 >= 27 and can be written as sum of two distinct primes
    # The minimal sum in the sequence is at m=0: k + 1
    # For the condition to hold at m=0: k + 1 >= 27 => k >= 26
    if k < 26:
        continue  # No need to check, since minimal sum doesn't fulfill >25

    # For m starting from 0 upwards, check if sum = k + m + 1
    # is in the prime_sums set
    n = 0
    while True:
        s = k + n + 1
        if s >= 27 and s in prime_sums:
            n += 1
        else:
            break
    # n is the maximum such that for all m < n, properties hold
    if n > max_n:
        max_n = n
        k_candidate = k

# The greatest n found
print(max_n)
```

This code enumerates possible values systematically, completes when sums no longer match the criteria, and prints the maximal n satisfying the constraints.
