The problem appears to be a mathematical equation involving rational numbers that needs to be solved exactly. Our goal is to find the unique rational number `w` satisfying the given equation, i.e., to find the value of `w` that makes the expression true. We will set up an enumeration over rational candidates to identify the exact solution. 

Since the problem involves rational numbers, we can consider a small enumeration of rational values within a reasonable range (e.g., fractions with small numerator and denominator). We will systematically check all candidates and print the exact one that satisfies the equation.

Here's the Python code that enumerates possible rational solutions (fractions with numerator and denominator within small bounds) and checks which satisfy the equation.

```python
# Enumerate rational numbers with small numerator and denominator within bounds
# Check which satisfy the equation: (1/3)*w + (7/2)*(1/4) == (3/4)*w + (1/2)*(1/4)

from fractions import Fraction

# Small bounds for numerator and denominator
max_num = 10
max_den = 10

# Store solutions found
solutions = []

for num in range(-max_num, max_num + 1):
    for den in range(1, max_den + 1):
        candidate = Fraction(num, den)
        # Compute both sides of the equation
        left = Fraction(1, 3)*candidate + Fraction(7, 2)*(Fraction(1,4))
        right = Fraction(3, 4)*candidate + Fraction(1, 2)*(Fraction(1,4))
        if left == right:
            print(candidate)  # Print solution immediately when found
            solutions.append(candidate)

# Output the first solution if exists; in this enumeration, there should be only one
if solutions:
    answer = solutions[0]
    print("Answer:", answer)
else:
    print("No solution found within bounds.")
```

This code searches over rational candidates with numerators and denominators between -10 and 10, checks the equation exactly, and prints each rational solution immediately, helping to identify the unique `w`.
