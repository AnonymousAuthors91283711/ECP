Based on patterns, the sum a*x^5 + b*y^5 remains constant for the pairs where the sum of fifth powers aligns with the pattern observed. The pairs (1,2) and (2,1) both yield 63, and the ratios suggest a symmetry with respect to x and y. Summarizing, the consistent value across symmetric solutions is 63.
