This problem involves calculating the average value of a double sum over pairs (x,y) where x,y are from 0 to 5, based on whether (x + 1 + y + 1) ≥ 10. We want to enumerate all possible (x,y) pairs, check the condition, sum, and then compute the average. The sum ranges over finite sets, so we can explicitly enumerate all pairs.

Here's our approach:
- Generate all pairs (x,y) with x,y in {0,...,5}.
- Count how many pairs satisfy (x + 1 + y + 1) ≥ 10.
- Since the total number of pairs is 36, the average is the count divided by 36.
- We'll print all counts after enumerating, then compute the average.

```python
# Enumerate all pairs (x, y) with x, y in {0,...,5}
count = 0
for x in range(6):
    for y in range(6):
        if (x + 1 + y + 1) >= 10:
            count += 1
            print(f"Pair (x={x}, y={y}) satisfies the condition.")
# Total pairs: 36
average = count / 36
print(f"Total pairs satisfying condition: {count}")
print(f"Average sum: {average}")
```
