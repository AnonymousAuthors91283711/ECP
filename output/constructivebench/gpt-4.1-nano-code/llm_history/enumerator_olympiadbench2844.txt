The problem asks to find the least natural number y greater than 2012 such that the total number of days from January 1, 2013 up to the start of year y (including leap days in the count) is divisible by 7. To do this, we need to iterate over candidate years starting from 2013, compute the total days for each, and check divisibility by 7. 

The total days from 2013 up to year y-1 can be computed by summing the days in each year, considering leap years. Since the total days from January 1, 2013, to January 1, y, is cumulative, the problem reduces to checking when this cumulative total becomes divisible by 7.

Here's my approach:
- Loop through years starting at 2013.
- For each year, calculate whether it's a leap year.
- Add 365 or 366 days accordingly.
- Check if total days since 2013 are divisible by 7.
- Output the first such year.

This ensures the smallest y > 2012 with days count divisible by 7.

```python
# Enumerate years starting from 2013 upwards, accumulating days, until divisibility by 7
def is_leap_year(year):
    return (year % 4 == 0) and (year % 100 != 0 or year % 400 == 0)

total_days = 0
year = 2013

while True:
    days_in_year = 366 if is_leap_year(year) else 365
    total_days += days_in_year
    if total_days % 7 == 0:
        print(year)
        break
    year += 1
```
