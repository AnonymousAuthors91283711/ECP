Ground Truth Answer: fun a b c => a * b^3 + b * c^3 + c * a^3
Proposed Answer: fun a b c => 3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find the minimum value (IsLeast) of some expression (omnimath480_answer) under given constraints. The ground truth answer provides the actual expression being minimized (a*b³ + b*c³ + c*a³), while the proposed answer claims the minimum value is always 3.

2. The ground truth answer gives the form of the expression whose minimum we're seeking, not the minimum value itself. The proposed answer gives a constant value, which would be the minimum if correct.

3. The constraints are symmetric in a,b,c, and when a=b=c=1, they satisfy all conditions:
   - a*b + b*c + c*a = 3
   - a³b + b³c + c³a + 2abc(a+b+c) = 1+1+1+6 = 9
   But the condition requires this to equal 9/2, so a=b=c=1 doesn't satisfy h_eq.

4. The proposed answer of 3 doesn't match the ground truth expression, and there's no evidence that the minimum value is always 3 under these constraints.
