The problem asks for the smallest positive integer \( n \) that is divisible by 60, 84, and 140 simultaneously, i.e., the least common multiple (LCM) of these three numbers.

To find this answer, we can enumerate possible multiples of each number and identify the smallest common multiple. Since the numbers are small, we can generate multiples enough to find their intersection efficiently.

Here's a Python program to compute and print the least common multiple by enumerating multiples:

```python
# Enumerate multiples of 60, 84, and 140 to find their least common multiple

# Generate multiples of a number up to a limit
def generate_multiples(n, limit):
    multiple = n
    while multiple <= limit:
        yield multiple
        multiple += n

# Set a reasonable limit for enumeration
limit = 20000

# Collect multiples in sets for fast intersection
multiples_60 = set(generate_multiples(60, limit))
multiples_84 = set(generate_multiples(84, limit))
multiples_140 = set(generate_multiples(140, limit))

# Find intersection to get common multiples
common_multiples = sorted(multiples_60 & multiples_84 & multiples_140)

# Output the smallest common multiple
if common_multiples:
    print(common_multiples[0])
```

This code enumerates multiples up to a limit, finds the intersection, and prints the smallest common multiple, which corresponds to the answer.
