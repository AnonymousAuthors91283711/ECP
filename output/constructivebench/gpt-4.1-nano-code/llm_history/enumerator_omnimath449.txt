The given formal statement appears to involve an infinite series with terms that depend on \( n \), specifically a sum over \( \mathbb{N} \). To assist with conjecture and proof, we can numerically approximate the sum by enumerating partial sums up to increasingly larger \( n \). Since the series converges (due to the nature of the terms), we prioritize understanding its behavior by testing a range of values and observing the partial sums.

This Python script:
- Computes partial sums up to a certain upper bound.
- Prints each partial sum immediately to stream intermediate results.
- Uses small sample limits for efficiency.
- Does not hardcode the final answer but helps estimate its value.

```python
# Enumerate partial sums of the series to conjecture its value
def partial_sum(N):
    total = 0.0
    for n in range(N):
        term_denom = (2 * n + 3)**2 - (2 * n + 1)**2
        term1 = 1 / (2 * n + 1)**2
        term2 = 1 / (2 * n + 3)**2
        # Compute the term of the series
        term = (1 / term_denom) * (term1 - term2)
        total += term
        print(f"Partial sum up to n={n+1}: {total}")
    return total

# Set a limit for enumeration
limit = 100
partial_sum(limit)
```
