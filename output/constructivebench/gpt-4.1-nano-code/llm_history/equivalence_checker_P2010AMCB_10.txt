Ground Truth Answer: 50 / 101
Proposed Answer: 4950/10099
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step.

1. The problem involves solving for x in the equation:
   (sum_{n=0}^{98} (n+1) + x)/101 = 100x

2. The sum sum_{n=0}^{98} (n+1) is the sum of the first 99 natural numbers (1 to 99), which equals 99*100/2 = 4950

3. So the equation becomes:
   (4950 + x)/101 = 100x

4. Solving this:
   4950 + x = 10100x
   4950 = 10099x
   x = 4950/10099

5. The ground truth answer is 50/101, while the proposed answer is 4950/10099

6. Let's check if they're equivalent:
   50/101 ≈ 0.4950495
   4950/10099 ≈ 0.4901475
   These are clearly different values

7. The proposed answer is actually correct based on the calculation, while the ground truth answer appears to be incorrect.
