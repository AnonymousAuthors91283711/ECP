. Enumerated answers: z=1, x=-10, (x - z)/(y - z) = 11.0
z=2, x=-20, (x - z)/(y - z) = 11.0
z=3, x=-30, (x - z)/(y - z) = 11.0
z=4, x=-40, (x - z)/(y - z) = 11.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the pattern in enumerated answers, where x = -10z and the resulting ratio is always 11, the general formula for x in terms of z is x = -10 * z.  
Therefore, (x - z) / (y - z) = 11.0 for all such points.  
Assuming the pattern holds universally and y is chosen accordingly, the answer is a constant 11.  
<<<11>>>

This matches the pattern from the enumerations and satisfies the relationship.
