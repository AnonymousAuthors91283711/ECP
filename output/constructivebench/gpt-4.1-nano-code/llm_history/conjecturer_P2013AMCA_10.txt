. Enumerated answers: Sum of all n in S: 0. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The set S consists of numbers n expressed as a decimal expansion with specific fractional parts involving a and b, and an infinite series. To find the sum of all such n, note that the infinite series sums to a finite value, and the total sum simplifies to a combination of a, b, and powers of 10. Based on the pattern, the sum over all n in S is 1, corresponding to the total fractional part sum of the series when a and b are summed over their possible values.
