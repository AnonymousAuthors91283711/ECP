[write_program]
The problem asks us to find all integer pairs (m, n) satisfying the equation m^5 - n^5 = 16 * m * n. To aid conjecturing and find solutions, we'll write a Python program that exhaustively checks small integer pairs for solutions and streams output. We'll select small ranges for m and n, check the equation, and print solutions immediately.

Since it's a high-school level problem, considering m, n in a limited range (e.g., -20 to 20) makes sense, and we prioritize solutions where the equation holds exactly.

```python
# Enumerate pairs (m, n) in a small range and print solutions satisfying m^5 - n^5 = 16 * m * n
for m in range(-20, 21):
    for n in range(-20, 21):
        if m == 0 and n == 0:
            continue  # avoid trivial zero division if needed
        lhs = m**5 - n**5
        rhs = 16 * m * n
        if lhs == rhs:
            print(f"Solution found: m={m}, n={n}")
```
