This problem involves counting configurations with certain color and pattern choices, computing ratios, and checking for coprimality. To enumerate possible ratios, we'll generate all numerator-denominator pairs up to some manageable limit, verify the ratios, and check for coprimality. Since the total number of configurations is small, we can do this efficiently.

Here's the approach:
- Compute totalConfigurations and independentConfigurations.
- For the ratio `independentConfigurations / totalConfigurations`, generate numerator and denominator pairs within a range.
- For each pair, reduce the fraction to simplest form and check if it matches the ratio.
- Output the ratio whenever found, streaming results.

```python
from math import gcd

# Parameters
n = 6
color_choices = 2
pattern_choices = 2
total_configurations = (color_choices * pattern_choices) ** n
independent_configurations = (color_choices * pattern_choices * (color_choices + pattern_choices - 1)) ** n

# To normalize, compute the ratio as a float for comparison
ratio_value = independent_configurations / total_configurations

max_trial = 20  # limit numerator and denominator to reduce computations
found = set()

print("Total configurations:", total_configurations)
print("Independent configurations:", independent_configurations)
print("Ratio:", ratio_value)

for denom in range(1, max_trial + 1):
    for num in range(1, max_trial + 1):
        # Reduce the fraction to lowest terms
        g = gcd(num, denom)
        num_red, denom_red = num // g, denom // g
        # Compare reduced ratio to the exact ratio within a small epsilon
        if abs((num/denom) - ratio_value) < 1e-9:
            if (num_red, denom_red) not in found:
                print(f"Found ratio: {num_red}/{denom_red}")
                # Check coprimality
                if gcd(num_red, denom_red) == 1:
                    print(f" coprime: {num_red} and {denom_red}")
                found.add((num_red, denom_red))
```
