Let's analyze the problem: Find the least integer \( x \) such that the average of five consecutive integers starting at \( x \) equals 9. That is:

\[
\frac{x + (x+1) + (x+2) + (x+3) + (x+4)}{5} = 9
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
\frac{5x + (1+2+3+4)}{5} = 9
\]
\[
\frac{5x + 10}{5} = 9
\]
\[
x + 2 = 9
\]
\[
x = 7
\]

The least such \( x \) is 7.

Let's write a small Python script that computes this explicitly by enumerating candidate \( x \), checks the condition, and prints solutions streamingly.

```python
# Enumerate x from a small range to find all solutions where the average of five consecutive integers is 9
for x in range(-100, 100):
    total = x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) + (x + 3) + (x + 4)
    avg = total / 5
    if avg == 9:
        print(x)
        break  # Since we want the least such x, once found, we stop
```
