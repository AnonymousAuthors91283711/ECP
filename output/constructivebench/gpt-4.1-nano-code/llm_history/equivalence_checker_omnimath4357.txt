Ground Truth Answer: fun n => Nat.floor ((-1 + Real.sqrt (1 + 8 * n)) / 2)
Proposed Answer: fun n => Nat.floor ((Real.sqrt (1 + 8 * n) - 1) / 2)
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is algebraically equivalent to the ground truth answer. The only difference is the rearrangement of terms in the numerator: `(-1 + Real.sqrt (1 + 8 * n))` versus `(Real.sqrt (1 + 8 * n) - 1)`. Since addition is commutative, these expressions are identical in value. The rest of the formula (division by 2 and taking the floor) remains unchanged. Therefore, the two answers are equivalent.
