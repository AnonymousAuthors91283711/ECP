Let's analyze the problem mathematically before coding:

Given the theorem:
- \( \log_2 \left( \log_2(2 \times \text{answer} - 2) \right) = 2 \)
- and \( 2 \times \text{answer} - 2 > 0 \),
- and \( \log_2 (2 \times \text{answer} - 2) > 0 \).

From the first equation:
\[
\log_2 \left( \log_2(2a - 2) \right) = 2
\]
which implies:
\[
\log_2(2a - 2) = 2^2 = 4
\]
Thus:
\[
2a - 2 = 2^4 = 16
\]
and:
\[
2a = 18
\]
\[
a = 9
\]

Check the inequalities:
- \( 2a - 2 = 16 > 0 \) — True
- \( \log_2(16) = 4 > 0 \) — True

The solution is \( a = 9 \).

Now, we'll write a Python program to verify this solution by enumerating candidate answers around this value (since it's a high-school level problem, small integers).

```python
# Enumerate candidate answers near the found solution and verify the conditions
for candidate in range(5, 15):
    val = 2 * candidate - 2
    # Check if val > 0 and log2(val) > 0
    if val > 0 and (val & (val - 1)) == 0:  # val is a power of 2
        import math
        log_val = math.log2(val)
        if log_val > 0:
            # Check if log2(log2(val)) == 2
            inner_log = math.log2(log_val)
            if abs(inner_log - 2) < 1e-9:
                print(candidate)
```
