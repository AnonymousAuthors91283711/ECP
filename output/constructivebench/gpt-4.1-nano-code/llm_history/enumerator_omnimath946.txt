This problem involves the sum of a series: \(\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{2^{2^n}}{4^{2^n} - 1}\). First, observe that \(4^{2^n} = (2^2)^{2^n} = 2^{2 \cdot 2^n} = 2^{2^{n+1}}\). So each term can be written as:

\[
\frac{2^{2^n}}{2^{2^{n+1}} - 1}
\]

Now, the sum is:

\[
\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{2^{2^n}}{2^{2^{n+1}} - 1}
\]

To approximate and guess the sum's limit, we can consider partial sums for the first few terms, then look for a pattern or a telescoping structure.

Let's write a Python script to compute partial sums up to a certain \(N\), and to examine the behavior. Since the terms are decreasing rapidly, summing the first few terms will give a good approximation.

```python
# Numerically approximate the series sum up to n=20
# and observe the partial sums to conjecture the sum's limiting value.

def term(n):
    numerator = 2 ** (2 ** n)
    denominator = 2 ** (2 ** (n + 1)) - 1
    return numerator / denominator

partial_sum = 0.0
for n in range(20):
    t = term(n)
    print(f"n={n}, term={t}")
    partial_sum += t
    print(f"Partial sum up to n={n}: {partial_sum}")

# After running, observe the convergence
```
