The problem is a formal proof statement involving functions, their inverses, and an unknown answer related to these functions. To explore the possible values of `f π`, we note that `g` is given explicitly, and `f` is linked through an equation involving `g` and its inverse. 

For a high-school level approximation and enumeration, I will:
- Select specific values for `x` to evaluate the given functional equation.
- Derive possible `f` values at `π` by choosing sample values within a simple domain.
- Since the problem involves functions and their inverses, I'll test some values around `π`.

Ignoring the complex formal aspects, the key equation:
`g(f(inverse_g(x))) = 2 x^2 + 16 x + 26`

Given that `g(x) = 2x - 4`, then its inverse:
`g⁻¹(y) = (y + 4) / 2`

We want to find `f(π)`. Let's choose `x` such that `g(f(inverse_g(x)))` matches some values to find possible `f(π)` candidates.

Here's the Python code that:
- Evaluates the function for sample `x` values near `π`
- Computes corresponding `f(inverse_g(x))`
- Derives possible `f(π)` candidates

```python
import math

# Define g and its inverse
def g(x):
    return 2 * x - 4

def g_inv(y):
    return (y + 4) / 2

# Function to compute the RHS of the given functional equation
def rhs(x):
    return 2 * x**2 + 16 * x + 26

# Sample x values around pi to evaluate possible f(pi)
sample_xs = [math.pi - 1, math.pi, math.pi + 1]

# For each x, compute corresponding y = g(f(inverse_g(x))) = rhs(x)
# So, f(inverse_g(x)) = g_inv(rhs(x))
for x in sample_xs:
    rhs_val = rhs(x)
    f_value = g_inv(rhs_val)
    print(f"At x = {x:.2f}, rhs = {rhs_val:.2f}, f(inverse_g({x:.2f})) = {f_value:.2f}")

# To find f(pi), we can attempt to invert the relation
# Since g(f(y)) = 2 y^2 + 16 y + 26, then f(y) = g_inv(2 y^2 + 16 y + 26)
# For y = inverse_g(pi), which is (pi + 4)/2
inverse_point = (math.pi + 4) / 2
candidate_f_pi = g_inv(rhs(inverse_point))
print(f"Candidate for f(pi): {candidate_f_pi:.2f}")
```
