The problem appears to involve two independent sets, Robbie and Francine, each covering numbers 1 through 6, and we're considering pairs (r, f) for which 8 + r > 10 + f. To find the probability (favorable pairs over total pairs), we enumerate pairs systematically, check the inequality, and compute the ratio. I'll write a Python script to do this efficiently, print each favorable pair immediately, and output the resulting probability as a rational number.

```python
# Enumerate all pairs (r, f) where r and f are from 1 to 6
# For each pair, check if 8 + r > 10 + f
# Collect favorable pairs, print them immediately
# Compute the ratio of favorable pairs to total pairs

from fractions import Fraction

favorable_pairs = []
total_pairs = 6 * 6

for r in range(1, 7):
    for f in range(1, 7):
        if 8 + r > 10 + f:
            print(f"Favorable pair: (r={r}, f={f})")
            favorable_pairs.append((r, f))

# Compute ratio as a Fraction for exact value
answer = Fraction(len(favorable_pairs), total_pairs)
print(f"Total favorable pairs: {len(favorable_pairs)}")
print(f"Total pairs: {total_pairs}")
print(f"Answer as a fraction: {answer}")
```
