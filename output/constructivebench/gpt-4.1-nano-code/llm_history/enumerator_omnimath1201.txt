This problem involves finding the maximum value of the function m(a, b, c) = min(a*b, b*c, c*a) for positive real numbers a, b, c satisfying the constraints a + b + c = 10 and a*b + b*c + c*a = 25. The key is to explore candidate triplets and evaluate m(a, b, c).

Because the constraints involve symmetry and symmetric conditions, a good approach is to sample feasible triplets with small integers or rational approximations that satisfy both equations or to examine when the minima are equal (since minimum is maximized when all three products are equal).

Here's a sketch to find candidate solutions with small integer or rational approximate values that satisfy the constraints:

- Fix certain variables and compute others.
- Check the constraints.
- Compute m and keep track of maximum.

Now, the code below performs a search over small candidate triplets (a, b, c), checking the constraints and determining the maximum min-product.

```python
import math

# Search over small rational candidates
max_y = -math.inf
answers = []

# Define small ranges for a, b, c
for a in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]:
    for b in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]:
        # c is determined approximately to satisfy the constraints
        # since a+b+c=10, c=10 - a - b
        c = 10 - a - b
        if c <= 0:
            continue
        # check sum of products
        sum_prod = a*b + b*c + c*a
        if abs(sum_prod - 25) > 1e-3:
            continue
        # Compute minimum product
        min_prod = min(a*b, b*c, c*a)
        print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, min_product={min_prod}")
        if min_prod > max_y:
            max_y = min_prod
            answers = [(a, b, c, min_prod)]

# Output the maximum found
print(f"Maximum min product: {max_y}")
for ans in answers:
    a, b, c, min_pt = ans
    print(f"Candidate: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, min product={min_pt}")
```
