Ground Truth Answer: 809
Proposed Answer: (2024 / 5) * 2 + 1
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem asks to count numbers from 0 to 2024 (Finset.range 2025) that are congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5.

2. The ground truth answer is 809.

3. The proposed answer is (2024 / 5) * 2 + 1.

Analysis of proposed answer:
- 2024/5 = 404.8, but integer division would give 404
- 404 * 2 = 808
- 808 + 1 = 809

This matches the ground truth answer of 809. The reasoning is correct because:
- There are 405 complete cycles of 5 in 2025 numbers (0-2024)
- Each cycle has 2 numbers ≡ 0 or 2 mod 5
- Plus one extra number (2020) that's ≡ 0 mod 5
