The problem appears to involve a functional condition and an enumeration of possible values of `f(2007)` based on a property `P` of functions `f: ℕ → ℕ`. The key is to analyze the functional inequality:

\[ \forall m, n \in \mathbb{N}, \quad f(m + n) \geq f(m) + f(n) - 1. \]

This resembles a near superadditivity condition with a small adjustment.

**Approach:**

1. **Simplify the problem:**

   - Because the condition involves all natural numbers, analyze the behavior for small inputs.
   - The goal is to find possible values of \( y = f(2007) \).

2. **Initial observations:**

   - Set \( m=0 \):
     \[
     f(n) \geq f(0) + f(n) - 1 \implies 0 \geq f(0) - 1 \implies f(0) \leq 1.
     \]
     Since \( f(0) \) is natural, \( f(0) \in \{0, 1\} \).

3. **Explore bounds:**

   - For \( m=1, n=1 \):
     \[
     f(2) \geq 2f(1) - 1.
     \]
   - For \( m=0, n=1 \):
     \[
     f(1) \geq f(0) + f(1) - 1 \implies 0 \geq f(0) - 1 \implies f(0) \leq 1,
     \]
     which we already have.

4. **Potential forms of \( f \):**
   
   - Linear functions like \( f(n) = c n \), with \( c \geq 0 \).
   - For \( f(n) = c n \):
     \[
     c(m + n) \geq c m + c n - 1 \implies c (m + n) \geq c m + c n - 1.
     \]
     Simplifies to:
     \[
     c (m + n) \geq c m + c n - 1,
     \]
     which is always true if \( c \geq 0 \), since the difference is at least \(-1\).

   So linear functions with \( c \geq 0 \) satisfy the inequality.

5. **Possible \( c \):**

   - For \( c=0 \), \( f(n)=0 \) satisfies the inequality.
   - For \( c=1 \), \( f(n)=n \), also satisfies because:
     \[
     n + m \geq n + m -1,
     \]
     always true.

   - For \( c>1 \), check:
     \[
     c(m + n) \geq c m + c n - 1
     \]
     is always true, because \( c(m + n) = c m + c n \), and the inequality reduces to:
     \[
     c m + c n \geq c m + c n - 1 \implies 0 \geq -1,
     \]
     always true.

   **But these are linear functions**, does the inequality restrict \( c \)?

   Since the difference is always at least \(-1\), any \( c \geq 0 \) seems possible.

6. **But \(f\) is from \(\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{N}\)**, so \( f(n)= c n + d \), with \( c,d \geq 0 \), and \( f(n) \in \mathbb{N} \). We need to ensure \( f(n) \in \mathbb{N} \).

   - \(f(n)= c n + d \),
   - \(f(0)=d \leq 1\), from the earlier deduction \(f(0) \leq 1\). Since \(f(0) \in \mathbb{N}\), only \( d=0 \) or \( 1 \).

7. **Check \(f(n) = c n + d \) with \( d \in \{0,1\} \), \( c \ge 0 \).**

   - Confirm inequality:
     \[
     f(m + n) = c(m + n) + d,
     \]
     \[
     f(m) + f(n) - 1 = c m + d + c n + d - 1 = c (m + n) + 2 d - 1.
     \]
     The inequality becomes:
     \[
     c(m + n) + d \geq c(m + n) + 2 d - 1 \implies d \geq 2 d - 1 \implies -d \geq -1 \implies d \leq 1.
     \]
     Always true for \( d \in \{0,1\} \).

   - For example:
     - \(f(n)= c n \), with \( c \geq 0 \),
     - \(f(n)= c n + 1 \), with \( c \geq 0 \).

   Since \( c \) is any non-negative real number (but in the case of functions from \(\mathbb{N)\to \mathbb{N}\), \(f\) must be integer-valued). Let's take:

- \(f(n) = c n \), for \( c \in \mathbb{N} \),
- \(f(n) = c n + 1\), for \( c \in \mathbb{N} \).

**Conclusion:**

- All functions of the form \(f(n)= c n\) or \(f(n) = c n + 1\), with \( c \in \mathbb{N}_0 \), satisfy the inequality.

- For \( f(2007) \):
  - \(f(2007)= c \times 2007 \),
  - or \( c \times 2007 + 1 \).

- Since \( c \geq 0 \),
  - possible values of \( y=f(2007) \) are:
    \[
    y = 2007 c \quad \text{or} \quad y=2007 c + 1,
    \]
     with \( c \in \mathbb{N}_0 \).

- For the enumeration, we will take \( c \) from 0 up to some threshold (e.g., \( c=10 \)), then list all corresponding values.

---

**Implementation plan:**

- For \( c \) from 0 to 10:
  - Compute \( y_1=2007 c \),
  - Compute \( y_2=2007 c + 1 \),
  - Print both.

---

```python
# Enumerate possible f(2007) values based on derived linear forms for c in [0, 10]
max_c = 10
for c in range(max_c + 1):
    y1 = 2007 * c
    y2 = 2007 * c + 1
    print(y1)
    print(y2)
```
