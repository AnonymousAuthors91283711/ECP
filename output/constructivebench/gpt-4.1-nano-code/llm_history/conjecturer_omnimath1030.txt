theorem omnimath1030
    (a : ℕ → ℤ)
    (ha1 : a 1 = 3)
    (ha : ∀ n ≥ 1, a (n + 1) = (n + 1) * a n - n) :
    IsLeast
      {m | m ≥ 2005 ∧ (a (m + 1) - 1) ∣ (a m) ^ 2 - 1}
      omnimath1030_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found for m=2005: (a(2005)^2 -1) divisible by 2006
Least m satisfying the condition is: 2005
. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<2005>>>
