theorem omnimath2708 :
  IsLeast {x : ℤ | (x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) + (x + 3) + (x + 4)) / 5 = 9} omnimath2708_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 7. Expected Answer Type: ℤ
Given the set condition, essentially finding the least integer x such that the average of five consecutive integers from x to x+4 equals 9. Solving (x + (x+1) + (x+2) + (x+3) + (x+4))/5 = 9 yields x = 7. 

Final answer: <<<7>>>
