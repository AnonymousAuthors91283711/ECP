This problem seems to involve analyzing the behavior of a product over an interval of integers, specifically the product of (i / (i + 1)) for i from 1 up to n-1, and its relation to 1/8. The goal is to determine the value of `omnimath3039_answer` that makes this equality hold, and then prove that any larger n also satisfies the same equality only at that specific answer.

The key insight is that:

\[
\prod_{i=1}^{n-1} \frac{i}{i+1} = \frac{1}{n}
\]

because the product telescopes:

\[
\prod_{i=1}^{n-1} \frac{i}{i+1} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{3}{4} \times \cdots \times \frac{n-1}{n} = \frac{1}{n}
\]

Thus,

\[
\sqrt{\prod_{i=1}^{n-1} \frac{i}{i+1}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}
\]

Given that:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} = \frac{1}{8}
\]

we get:

\[
\sqrt{n} = 8 \Rightarrow n = 64
\]

Therefore, `omnimath3039_answer = 64`.

Our program will verify that for n=64, the equality holds, and for other small values around it, it does not, confirming the uniqueness.

```python
# Program to verify the unique n where sqrt of product equals 1/8
import math

def check_n(n):
    prod = 1.0
    for i in range(1, n):
        prod *= i / (i + 1)
    sqrt_prod = math.sqrt(prod)
    return sqrt_prod

# Values to test around the conjectured answer
test_n_values = [60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67]

for n in test_n_values:
    result = check_n(n)
    print(f"n = {n}: sqrt of product = {result}")
    if math.isclose(result, 1/8, rel_tol=1e-9):
        print(f"Found answer candidate: {n}")
```
