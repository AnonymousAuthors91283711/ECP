This problem involves finding a real number \( d \) such that when we define \( t_1 = \frac{d/2}{17} \) and \( t_2 = \frac{d/2}{5} \), their sum is \( \frac{44}{60} \), and then determining the rounded value of \( \frac{d}{2} \times 10 \).

The key steps:
- Solve for \( d \) from the sum equation \( t_1 + t_2 = 44/60 \).
- Simplify and find the specific \( d \).
- Compute the rounded value of \( \frac{d}{2} \times 10 \).

The sum:
\[
\frac{d/2}{17} + \frac{d/2}{5} = \frac{44}{60}
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
\frac{d}{2} \left( \frac{1}{17} + \frac{1}{5} \right) = \frac{44}{60}
\]

Calculate the combined fraction:
\[
\frac{1}{17} + \frac{1}{5} = \frac{5 + 17}{17 \times 5} = \frac{22}{85}
\]

So:
\[
\frac{d}{2} \times \frac{22}{85} = \frac{44}{60}
\Rightarrow \frac{d}{2} = \frac{44}{60} \times \frac{85}{22}
\]

Compute numerator:
\[
44 \times 85 = 3740
\]
and denominator:
\[
60 \times 22 = 1320
\]

Thus:
\[
\frac{d}{2} = \frac{3740}{1320} = \frac{187}{66}
\]

Finally:
\[
d = 2 \times \frac{187}{66} = \frac{374}{66} = \frac{187}{33}
\]

Calculate \( \frac{d}{2} \times 10 \):
\[
\frac{187}{66} \times 10 = \frac{1870}{66} \approx 28.3333
\]

Round to one decimal place: approximately 28.3.

Let's implement a program to verify this algebraically and produce the rounded answer.

```python
# The program searches for d consistent with the problem statement, then computes the rounded value
d_value = (44/60) * (85/22) * 2  # Derived from the algebraic solution
rounded_value = round((d_value / 2) * 10, 1)
print(f"Answer: {rounded_value}")
```
