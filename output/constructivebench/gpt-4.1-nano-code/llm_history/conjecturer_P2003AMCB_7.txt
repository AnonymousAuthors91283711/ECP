theorem P2003AMCB_7 :
  let coins := {d : ℕ | ∃ n q : ℕ, n + d + q = 100 ∧ 5 * n + 10 * d + 25 * q = 835}
  let s := {d | d ∈ coins}
  s.Nonempty ∧ (sSup s - sInf s = P2003AMCB_7_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 64. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the set of coin counts satisfying total sum and total value constraints, the difference between supremum and infimum is 64, matching the enumerated solutions. 

Since the problem involves positive integer coins with constraints, and the set is non-empty, the difference will be 64.

<<<64>>>

This captures the specific difference without existential quantifiers and aligns with the enumerated answer.
