. Enumerated answers: 421. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the problem describes a 4-connected neighborhood expansion over 14 steps, starting from a singleton, the reachable set's size corresponds to a diamond pattern. The pattern suggests that after 14 steps, the number of points in the set is given by summing the binomial coefficients. Specifically, the count is 1 plus 14 times 14, like a binomial sum, resulting in 421.
