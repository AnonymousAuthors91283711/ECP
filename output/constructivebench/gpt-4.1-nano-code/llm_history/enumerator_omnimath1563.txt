This problem involves analyzing probabilities related to binary outcomes with questions and people, with conditions on the relationship between outcomes, their counts, and some algebraic identities. To help find solutions, I'll enumerate small candidate pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the key equations and conditions, especially focusing on the algebraic constraint `100 * a + b = 25517`.

Given the problem's structure, the best approach is:

- Search for integer pairs `(a, b)` where `a % 2 = 1` (a is odd) and `100 * a + b = 25517`.
- For each candidate, verify if it satisfies the probability relationship `p = a / 2^b`.

Since `b` appears inside the power of 2, and the total probability `p` is expressed with division, I'll focus on candidates `(a, b)` satisfying the linear relation, and then check the probability condition.

Here is the Python program that enumerates possible `(a, b)` pairs with `a` odd, `b >= 0`, and assesses the probability.

```python
# Enumerate pairs (a, b) satisfying the constraints:
# 1. a % 2 = 1 (a is odd)
# 2. 100 * a + b = 25517 => b = 25517 - 100 * a
# 3. b >= 0, thus a <= 25517 / 100 = 255.17, so a <= 255
# 4. a >= 1 (since a is positive)

max_a = 255
found_candidates = []

for a in range(1, max_a + 1, 2):  # step by 2 to ensure a is odd
    b = 25517 - 100 * a
    if b < 0:
        continue
    # Compute probability p = a / 2^b
    power = 2 ** b
    p = a / power
    print(f"Candidate: a={a}, b={b}, p={p}")
    found_candidates.append((a, b, p))
```
