The problem involves calculating the volume of pairs (p₁, p₂) in the unit square [0,1)×[0,1), where the integer parts of their base-2 logarithms are equal. 

Key points:
- `logb 2 p` is the base-2 logarithm, which partitions [0,1) into intervals [2^k, 2^(k+1)). For p in [2^k, 2^(k+1)), `⌊logb 2 p⌋ = k`.
- We need pairs where both p₁ and p₂ lie in the same dyadic interval [2^k, 2^(k+1)) within (0,1).

Since p ∈ (0,1), the relevant k are from -∞ up to 0. For each k:
- The interval of p in (0,1) where ⌊log₂ p⌋=k is [2^k, 2^{k+1})
- For k<0, 2^k ∈ (0,1), so these intervals are within (0,1).

Stream the measures for each interval:
- The measure for each pair (p₁,p₂) with both in that interval is the square of the interval's length: (2^{k+1} - 2^{k})² = (2^k)² = 2^{2k}.

Sum over all those:
- For k from negative integers down to -∞, the total volume contribution is infinite, but practically the sum converges for finite k, especially from some negative integer toward -∞.

In the context of the problem:
- Sum over k from -∞ to 0:
  volume = ∑_{k=-∞}^{0} (length of interval)²
         = ∑_{k=-∞}^{0} (2^{k})²
         = ∑_{k=-∞}^{0} 2^{2k}.

This is a geometric series with ratio r=4:
- sum = 2^{2*0} / (1 - 4) = 1 / (1 - 4), but as k→−∞, terms approach 0.

Numerically:
```python
# Sum 2^{2k} for k from -∞ to 0. For practical purposes, sum from a reasonable negative integer.
sum_terms = 0.0
for k in range(-20, 1):  # sum from a large negative number up to 0
    sum_terms += 2**(2*k)
print(sum_terms)
```
This sum approximates the total volume.

```python
# Final code to compute the approximate volume
sum_terms = 0.0
for k in range(-20, 1):  # choose -20 as an effective cutoff
    sum_terms += 2**(2*k)
print("Approximate volume:", sum_terms)
```
This computes the measure of all pairs in [0,1) where both share the same dyadic interval.

Answer: The sum converges to 1/3 as the geometric series, but we approximate numerically.
