The problem appears to involve finding the smallest positive integer \(n\) such that there exists a complex number \(z\) with positive real and imaginary parts, satisfying a certain equation involving conjugation and powers. To explore candidates, we'll fix small positive integers \(n\) and check whether such a \(z\) exists, then output any solutions found immediately.

Key observations:
- For each \(n\) starting from 1 upwards, attempt to find \(z\) with \(z.re > 0\), \(z.im > 0\) satisfying \(z^n = (\overline{z})^n\).
- Using the nature of complex conjugation, \(z^n = (\overline{z})^n\) implies that either \(z\) is real, or the magnitude and argument have specific relations.
- For initial checks, restrict \(z\) to some sample points or attempt a parametric approach.

Since the task is to enumerate small values \(n\), the program will:
- Loop over \(n\) starting from 1.
- For each \(n\), try a small set of \(z\) candidates with positive real and imaginary parts.
- Check if the condition holds.
- Print any solutions immediately.

```python
import cmath

# Starting from n=1 upwards, limit to n=20 for demonstration
for n in range(1, 21):
    found = False
    # Try some sample points for z with positive real and imaginary parts
    for re in [0.1, 1, 2]:
        for im in [0.1, 1, 2]:
            if re > 0 and im > 0:
                z = complex(re, im)
                # Check if z^n = (conjugate(z))^n
                lhs = z ** n
                rhs = (z.conjugate()) ** n
                if abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-10:
                    print(f"n={n}, z=({z.real},{z.imag}) satisfies z^n = (conj z)^n")
                    found = True
                    break
        if found:
            break
    # If not found, continue to next n
    if not found:
        continue
```
