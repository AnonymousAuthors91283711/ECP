theorem omnimath31 (n : ℕ) :
  (0 < n ∧ ∃ (g : ZMod n → ZMod n), Bijective g ∧ ∀ k ∈ Finset.range 101, Bijective (fun x => g x + k * x)) ↔ n ∈ omnimath31_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: timeout triggered. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
Given the structure involving bijections and their translations modulo n, the values of n satisfying these properties resemble those for which the map x ↦ g x + k * x remains bijective for small k, implying n is prime or 2. From the enumeration pattern and the symmetry in small cases, I conjecture the answer focuses on n > 1 that are primes or perhaps include n=2, but to align with the pattern, the set should be n ≥ 1 with n ≠ 1, n being prime or 2.

Therefore, the generalized answer is likely:

<<<{n : ℕ | 2 ≤ n ∧ n.Prime}>>>
