The values cluster around approximately ±1.308 and near zero. The analytical solution suggests symmetric solutions around these points, with the key solutions near ±1.3088 and close to zero. Based on the pattern and given solutions, the set appears to include these four points with the given bounds.  
Final answer:  
<<<({-1.3088, 0, 1.3088})>>>
This captures the approximate solutions in a closed form, emphasizing the symmetry and key roots.
