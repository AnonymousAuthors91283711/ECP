The problem involves counting the number of functions from a set of 5 elements to 4 elements, with the constraint that for the given "parent" set (0,1), their assigned value differs from all "children" (2,3,4). This reduces to counting the number of functions satisfying specific inequalities.

Approach:
- For each parent (0,1), assign a value in {0, 1, 2, 3}.
- For each child (2,3,4), assign a value in {0, 1, 2, 3} but not equal to its parent.

Since the problem constrains that parents’ and children’s assignments differ, we can count it by enumerating all valid combinations.

Let's explicitly enumerate and count valid functions via Python. The program outputs each valid assignment's total count, matching the problem's combinatorial nature.

```python
# Enumerate all functions from 5 elements to 4 elements
# with the condition that for parents (0,1), their values differ from children's (2,3,4)

import itertools

# Define sets
parents = [0, 1]
children = [2, 3, 4]
domain = range(5)
codomain = range(4)

valid_count = 0

# Generate all functions as tuples of length 5
for assignment in itertools.product(codomain, repeat=5):
    # Check the main condition:
    # For each parent p, ensure f(p) != f(c) for all children c
    valid = True
    for p in parents:
        for c in children:
            if assignment[p] == assignment[c]:
                valid = False
                break
        if not valid:
            break
    if valid:
        valid_count += 1
        # Immediately print the valid function
        print(f"Valid assignment: {assignment}")

# Output the total count
print(f"Total valid functions: {valid_count}")
```
