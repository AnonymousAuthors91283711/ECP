This problem involves finding integer triples (x, y, z) satisfying two equations:

1. \( x^2 - y^2 = z \)
2. \( 3xy + (x - y)z = z^2 \)

Our goal is to enumerate potential solutions within manageable bounds, verifying and collecting all solutions up to certain limits. We will:

- Generate all integer triples (x, y, z) within small ranges (e.g., from -10 to 10).
- Check the conditions exactly.
- Print each valid solution immediately.
- Since the problem is general, and no explicit target set or extremal is specified besides enumeration, we focus on correctness and efficiency.

```python
# Generate all integer triples (x, y, z) with small bounds
# and check the equations exactly, printing solutions as found.

limit = 10  # Small bounds for enumeration

for x in range(-limit, limit + 1):
    for y in range(-limit, limit + 1):
        z = x**2 - y**2  # Compute z from first equation
        if -limit <= z <= limit:  # Limit z for manageable enumeration
            # Check the second equation
            if 3 * x * y + (x - y) * z == z ** 2:
                print((x, y, z))
```
