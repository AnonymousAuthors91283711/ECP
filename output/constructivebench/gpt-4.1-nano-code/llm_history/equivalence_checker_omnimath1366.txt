Ground Truth Answer: (-1 + sqrt 5) / 2
Proposed Answer:  sqrt ((√5 - 1)/2)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a unique positive real x satisfying:
   - 0 < x
   - cos(arctan x) = x
   - x² = some constant (omnimath1366_answer)

2. Ground truth gives x = (-1 + √5)/2 ≈ 0.618 (golden ratio minus 1)
3. Proposed answer gives x = √((√5 - 1)/2) ≈ √0.618 ≈ 0.786

Let's verify:
- For ground truth: x ≈ 0.618
  cos(arctan(0.618)) ≈ cos(0.553) ≈ 0.618 ✔
  x² ≈ 0.382 ≈ (√5 - 1)/2

- For proposed answer: x ≈ 0.786
  cos(arctan(0.786)) ≈ cos(0.665) ≈ 0.786 ✔
  But x² ≈ 0.618 ≠ (√5 - 1)/2 ≈ 0.382

The proposed answer satisfies the cosine condition but not the squared condition. The answers are different.
