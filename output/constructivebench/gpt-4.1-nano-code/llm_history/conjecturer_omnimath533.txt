Total solutions: 5. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests symmetry between (a, b) with respect to 2^a + 2^b, and the factorial function for c. The solutions are specific small triples satisfying the equation, with two solutions at c=3 and two at c=4, plus one at c=2. From enumeration, total solutions are 5, aligning with the combined counts for fixed c. Therefore, the total count is 5.
