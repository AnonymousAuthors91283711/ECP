The problem involves a geometric/combinatorial setup on an nÃ—n grid with certain special points removed. The goal is to find a set of pairs of points ("edges") that satisfy adjacency conditions (squareAdjacent), are mutually disjoint, and effectively cover the remaining grid points in a perfect matching fashion. The key is to conjecture the nature of the set of such "answers" based on the value of n, especially when n is odd > 1.

To enumerate, let's choose small odd values of n (like n=3,5,7), construct possible sets of pairs satisfying the adjacency and disjointness constraints, and check whether they can cover the specified "board."

Since the problem is about existence, and we are asked to produce possible answers without hardcoding, we'll generate candidate sets for small odd n, and print them to assist in conjecture. The "answer" set is implicitly characterized by the small examples, which can likely be a matching or a specific pattern.

Here's the approach:
- Fix small odd n (>1).
- Generate pairs of points that are "squareAdjacent."
- Check mutual disjointness.
- Check whether they cover the specified "board" points, considering the missing points.
- Collect candidate answers in the form of sets of pairs.

Let's implement a small enumeration that provides candidate solutions for small n.

```python
# Python program to enumerate possible sets of pairs satisfying adjacency,
# disjointness, and coverage constraints for small odd n.

from itertools import combinations, product

# Function to check adjacency
def square_adjacent(p, q):
    return (abs(p[0] - q[0]) == 1 and p[1] == q[1]) or \
           (p[0] == q[0] and abs(p[1] - q[1]) == 1)

# Generate all possible pairs of points within an n x n grid
def generate_pairs(n):
    points = [(x, y) for x in range(1, n+1) for y in range(1, n+1)]
    pairs = []
    for p1 in points:
        for p2 in points:
            if p1 < p2 and square_adjacent(p1, p2):
                pairs.append((p1, p2))
    return pairs

# Verify disjointness
def are_disjoint(pairs_set):
    used_points = set()
    for p in pairs_set:
        for point in p:
            if point in used_points:
                return False
            used_points.add(point)
    return True

# For small n, attempt to find maximum matching covering board points
def enumerate_solutions(n):
    all_pairs = generate_pairs(n)
    # Define the board and removed points
    mid = n//2 + 1
    extra_pts = {(mid, mid), (1,1), (1,n), (n,1), (n,n)}
    points = set((x,y) for x in range(1,n+1) for y in range(1,n+1))
    board = points - extra_pts

    # For small n, try all subsets of pairs up to a limit
    results = []
    for r in range(1, min(20, len(all_pairs))+1):
        for candidate in combinations(all_pairs, r):
            candidate_set = set(candidate)
            # Check disjointness
            if not are_disjoint(candidate_set):
                continue
            # coverage: ensure all points in board are covered
            coverage_points = set()
            for p in candidate_set:
                coverage_points.update(p)
            if board.issubset(coverage_points):
                # Found a candidate answer
                print("Candidate answer with", r, "pairs:", candidate_set)
                results.append(candidate_set)
    return results

# Run enumeration for n=3 and n=5 to explore small odd n >1
for n in [3, 5]:
    print(f"Enumerating solutions for n={n}")
    enumerate_solutions(n)
```
