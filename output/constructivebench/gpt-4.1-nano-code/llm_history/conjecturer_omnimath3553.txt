abbrev omnimath3553_answer : Set (ℕ × ℕ) := sorry
theorem omnimath3553
: {(p, q) : ℕ × ℕ | Nat.Prime p ∧ Nat.Prime q ∧ 3 * p ^ (q - 1) + 1 ∣ 11 ^ p + 17 ^ p} = omnimath3553_answer ↔ True := by sorry. Enumerated answers: (3, 3)
Total solutions: 1. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ)
The pattern suggests the unique solution is where both primes are 3, since plug-in checks confirm divisibility.  
Answer: <<<{(3, 3)}>>>
