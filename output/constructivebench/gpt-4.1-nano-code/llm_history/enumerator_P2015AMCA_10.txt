This is a Lean theorem setup involving integers where you're asked to solve an equation `x + y + xy = 80` with the constraints `0 < y < x`. We need to find `x` (probably an integer) that satisfies these conditions. To assist in conjecturing the answer, we'll enumerate small integer pairs `(x, y)` that meet the conditions, check the equation, and find potential solutions.

Given the problem constraints: `0 < y < x` and `x + y + xy = 80`. Rearrange the equation:

`x + y + xy = 80`  
=> `xy + x + y = 80`  
=> `(x + 1)(y + 1) = 81` (by adding 1 to both sides, rearranged: `xy + x + y + 1 = 81`)

Thus, `(x + 1)(y + 1) = 81`. Both `x+1` and `y+1` are positive integers greater than 1 (since `x>0`, `y>0`).

We can iterate over divisors of 81 and test candidate pairs.

```python
# Enumerate divisors of 81 to find (x+1, y+1) pairs
# satisfying y > 0, x > 0, y < x

def main():
    target = 81
    for divisor in range(1, target + 1):
        if target % divisor == 0:
            x_plus_1 = divisor
            y_plus_1 = target // divisor
            x = x_plus_1 - 1
            y = y_plus_1 - 1
            # Check the constraints: 0 < y < x
            if y > 0 and x > y:
                print(f"x = {x}, y = {y}")

main()
```
