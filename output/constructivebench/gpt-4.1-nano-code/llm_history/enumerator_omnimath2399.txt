This problem involves counting certain functions from Fin 12 to Fin 2 with constraints: 
- The sum of function values is 4.
- No two consecutive indices both map to 1.

In other words:
- Exactly 4 positions are mapped to 1.
- The positions with 1 are separated by at least one 0.

We can model this as choosing 4 positions out of 12 with no two adjacent, which is a common combinatorial problem.

Approach:
- For choosing k non-adjacent positions out of n, number of ways = C(n - k + 1, k).

Here:
- n=12, k=4.
- Number of such functions = C(12 - 4 + 1, 4) = C(9,4).

Let's enumerate and compute C(9,4).

```python
from math import comb

# Parameters
n = 12
k = 4

# Compute the number of valid functions:
# Number of ways to choose positions for ones with no two adjacent
answer = comb(n - k + 1, k)
print(answer)
```
