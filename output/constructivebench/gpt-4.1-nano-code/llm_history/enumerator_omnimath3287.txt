The problem appears to involve analyzing a set of three digits and a set of 16 three-digit numbers, with constraints on their modular properties and digit composition. The question seems to be about whether there exists such a set satisfying the given conditions, especially the pairwise uniqueness modulo 16.

Given the problem's structure, I'll proceed with the following reasoning:
- We need to generate all 3-digit numbers (from 100 to 999).
- For a given set of 3 digits, we want to see if we can find 16 distinct 3-digit numbers that contain only those digits and are pairwise distinct in their residues modulo 16.
- The goal is to verify whether such a set exists.

Since exhaustive enumeration is manageable for small cases, I will:
- Select small sample sets of digits.
- Generate all 3-digit numbers using those digits.
- Filter for those with exactly 16 numbers.
- Check if they are pairwise distinct in modulo 16.

Here's the code to perform the enumeration:

```python
# Generate all 3-digit numbers with given digits
def generate_numbers(digits):
    return [n for n in range(100, 1000) if all(int(d) in digits for d in str(n))]

# Main enumeration
digits_candidates = [
    {1, 2, 3},
    {0, 1, 2},
    {1, 4, 7},
    {2, 4, 6}
]

for digit_set in digits_candidates:
    numbers = generate_numbers(digit_set)
    # Filter for exactly 16 numbers
    if len(numbers) >= 16:
        # Check if we can select 16 with pairwise distinct mod 16
        for subset in (numbers[i:i+16] for i in range(len(numbers)-15)):
            mods = [n % 16 for n in subset]
            if len(set(mods)) == 16:
                print(f"Digits set: {sorted(digit_set)}")
                print(f"Numbers with 16 elements and pairwise distinct mod 16: {sorted(subset)}")
                print(f"Mods: {sorted(mods)}\n")
```

This code deterministically enumerates candidate digit sets, then searches for 16 numbers within them that are pairwise residue-distinct modulo 16. It outputs findings immediately when such a set is found.

***Note:*** The code prioritizes small, manageable digit sets. The actual existence of such sets can be tested empirically with this enumeration.

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code.

The problem involves showing that there is **no** set of 3 digits with certain properties--specifically, a set of 16 numbers between 100 and 999 where each number has the same 3 digits, and all these numbers are pairwise distinct modulo 16. The theorem states its negation, essentially claiming such a configuration cannot exist.

The code attempts to generate all three-digit numbers formed solely from given digit sets, then tries to find a subset of 16 numbers with pairwise distinct residues mod 16.

**Judgement:**
- The approach is brute-force enumeration over small digit sets.
- The code filters for subsets of size 16 with pairwise distinct mod 16 residues.
- The enumerated digit sets are limited to four. For each, it generates all possible numbers and checks the condition.

**Issue:**
- The code simply looks for consecutive subsets of size 16 without guaranteeing the subset with pairwise distinct mod 16 residues. It randomly takes slices (`numbers[i:i+16]`) which is not exhaustive.
- It does not systematically check all subsets of size 16 for the condition.
- The problem's theoretical nature suggests that such a subset should not exist; hence, the code aims to confirm that no such subset exists.

The code currently produces no output—the enumeration finds nothing—meaning the condition isn't satisfied in the tested sets, supporting the claim. But to make it rigorous, we should exhaustively check all 16-element subsets or verify that no such subset exists for the given sets.

**Higher-level correction:**
- Remove slicing approach.
- Generate all combinations of size 16 from the generated numbers, and check for the pairwise distinct mod 16 condition.
- If any such subset is found, output it; otherwise, confirm none exists for that digit set.

Given these points, the original code does **not** necessarily find the answer efficiently or exhaustively, and the output is empty, which aligns with the "no such subset exists" conclusion. Therefore, as per the problem's setting, the code supports the theorem (no such configuration exists).

**Conclusion:**
- Since the code outputs no candidate solutions, the theorem's negation (that such a subset cannot exist) is supported.
- This is consistent with the mathematical claim being proven by contradiction: if no subset exists, the negation holds true, and the theorem is valid.

**Acceptance:**
- Since the enumeration
[refine_program]
The problem appears to be a theoretical math statement, likely involving the existence of certain 3-digit numbers with restrictions on their last digits, uniqueness mod 16, and specific digit constraints.

Given that the program is missing entirely (`None`) and the enumerated answers resulted in an "Error: Program is empty," I interpret the task as: There is no provided implementation to check or enumerate solutions.

**Judgment:** Since there is no code present to process or generate solutions, I cannot accept it in its current form.

**Therefore, the program should be rejected.**

**Corrected approach:**
- Implement a Python script that systematically searches for 3-digit numbers with certain digit properties.
- It seems the goal might be understanding whether such numbers exist with certain digit constraints and mutual mod 16 uniqueness.

**Assumptions based on typical interpretations:**
- The set of digits is size 3 (probably digits 0-9, with no specified restrictions except digit inclusion).
- Numbers are from 100 to 999.
- Each number's digits are in some specific set `digits`.
- The numbers are pairwise distinct mod 16 (so each one has a unique remainder modulo 16).

**Implementation plan:**
- Select a small sample set of 3 digits, e.g., `{1, 2, 3}`.
- Generate all 3-digit numbers with these digits.
- Check if there are 16 such numbers (since the property involves `numbers.card = 16`).
- Verify whether the numbers are pairwise distinct mod 16.
- Print solutions; if not, adjust.

Here's a corrected program that attempts a small sample and enumerates the candidates, consistent with the problem's requirements:

```python
# Python program to find 3-digit numbers with specific digit and mod 16 properties

# Sample digit set
digits = {1, 2, 3}
print(f"Using digit set: {digits}")

numbers = []

# Generate all 3-digit numbers using digits in the set
for d1 in digits:
    for d2 in digits:
        for d3 in digits:
            n = d1 * 100 + d2 * 10 + d3
            if 100 <= n <= 999:
                numbers.append(n)

# Remove duplicates if any (though unlikely here)
numbers = list(set(numbers))
print(f"Generated numbers: {numbers}")

# Check if we have exactly 16 such numbers
if
