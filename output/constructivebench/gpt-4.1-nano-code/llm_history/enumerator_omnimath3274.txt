This problem involves manipulating algebraic expressions with real numbers. Specifically, given the equation (x - y)/(z - y) = -10, we need to find the value of (x - z)/(y - z). To do this, I will parameterize variables and systematically evaluate for different values, watching for patterns. Since the problem is algebraic, a straightforward approach is to pick sample values satisfying the initial condition and compute the target expression, printing each candidate answer.

```python
# Enumerate sample values for y and z, then find corresponding x
# under the condition (x - y)/(z - y) = -10.
# For simplicity, fix y=0, pick z in a small range, compute x, then evaluate (x - z)/(y - z).
# Print results to observe the pattern.

for z in range(1, 5):  # choose small positive z to avoid division by zero and keep simple
    y = 0
    # from (x - y)/(z - y) = -10 => (x - 0)/(z - 0) = -10 => x = -10 * z
    x = -10 * z
    numerator = x - z
    denominator = y - z  # = 0 - z = -z
    answer = numerator / denominator
    print(f"z={z}, x={x}, (x - z)/(y - z) = {answer}")
```
