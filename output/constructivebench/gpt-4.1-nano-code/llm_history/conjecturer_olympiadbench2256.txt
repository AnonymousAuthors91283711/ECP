theorem olympiadbench2256 (x : ℝ) (hx : x > 0) :
    (2 : ℝ)^(log (x^2) / log 10) = 3 * (2 : ℝ)^(1 + log x / log 10) + 16 ↔ x = olympiadbench2256_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: x = 1000
Solution: x = 1000. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The expression 2^(log(x^2)/log 10) simplifies to 10^{log_{10}(x^2)} = x^2, and similarly 2^{(1 + log x / log 10)} simplifies to 2 * x. Setting these equal: x^2 = 3 * 2 * x + 16, leading to x^2 - 6x - 16 = 0, which factors to (x - 8)(x + 2) = 0. Since x > 0, x = 8. But the enumerated answer suggests x = 1000, which fits x = 10^3; check if substituting back makes sense: yes, since log_{10}(x) = 3, then log_{10}(x^2) = 6. 2^{6} = 64, and 3 * 2^{4} + 16 = 3 * 16 + 16 = 48 + 16 = 64, consistent with x=1000. Therefore the answer in closed form is 10^3.
