The problem appears to involve summing over six variables `a, b, c, d, e, f` each ranging over the integers from 1 to 100, computing a linear combination `M` with powers of 2, then taking a modular operation and summing the fractional parts normalized by `100^6`. To assist in conjecturing the value of the left expression, I will generate small sample calculations focusing on the possible remainders of `M` mod 64 for some small and representative tuples. 

Because the primary goal is to explore possible values of `M` modulo 64 and their distribution, I will enumerate tuples with small values and compute the modular, then observe the distribution of fractional sums to identify potential patterns or approximate limits. The enumeration will mainly target the smallest values for clarity, and I'll restrict to manageable subranges to avoid excessive computation. The structure is similar to verifying whether the sum averages out or exhibits symmetry.

```python
# Enumerate small tuples (a,b,c,d,e,f) with values from 1 to 3
# and compute the sum of M mod 64 for these small samples.
# The goal: observe the range of possible fractional sums
# to assist in conjecturing the exact value of the original sum.

max_value = 3
total_sum = 0.0
count = 0

for a in range(1, max_value + 1):
    for b in range(1, max_value + 1):
        for c in range(1, max_value + 1):
            for d in range(1, max_value + 1):
                for e in range(1, max_value + 1):
                    for f in range(1, max_value + 1):
                        M_value = a + 2*b + 4*c + 8*d + 16*e + 32*f
                        remainder = M_value % 64
                        # fractional part after dividing by 64
                        fractional_part = remainder / 64
                        total_sum += fractional_part
                        count += 1
                        # print each fractional part for verification
                        print(f"Tuple ({a},{b},{c},{d},{e},{f}): M mod 64 = {remainder}, fractional = {fractional_part}")

print(f"Average fractional sum over {count} tuples: {total_sum / count}")
```
