The problem involves exploring solutions (m, n) to the equation: m² + 2 * 3^n = m * (2^(n+1) - 1). To generate possible solutions, we'll test small values of n and compute corresponding m candidates, checking for integer solutions. We will print each found candidate immediately, and focus on small n to keep computations efficient.

```python
# Enumerate small values of n, compute possible m from the equation, and print solutions if m is integer
max_n = 20  # limit for n to keep search finite and manageable
for n in range(max_n + 1):
    base = 2 ** (n + 1) - 1
    # The equation is quadratic in m: m^2 - base * m + 2 * 3^n = 0
    # Discriminant D = base^2 - 4 * 2 * 3^n
    D = base ** 2 - 8 * 3 ** n
    if D < 0:
        continue
    sqrt_D = int(D ** 0.5)
    if sqrt_D * sqrt_D == D:
        # Possible m candidates: (base ± sqrt_D) / 2
        for sign in [1, -1]:
            numerator = base + sign * sqrt_D
            if numerator % 2 == 0:
                m = numerator // 2
                # Verify solution
                lhs = m * m + 2 * 3 ** n
                rhs = m * (base)
                if lhs == rhs:
                    print(f"n={n}, m={m}")
```
