The problem appears to be exploring a scenario involving quiz scores, where parameters are given and certain inequalities are satisfied. The goal is to find the greatest value for some expression `n`, based on the relationship between `remainingA`, the total quiz count, and the starting scores. 

Given the specific values:
- totalQuizzes = 50
- firstA = 22
- and the inequality `firstA + remainingA ≥ 4 * totalQuizzes / 5` 

which simplifies to:
- `22 + remainingA ≥ 4/5 * 50 = 40`

we aim to find the maximum possible `n = (totalQuizzes - 30) - remainingA`.

Since `totalQuizzes` is fixed at 50, and `firstA` is fixed at 22, the variable is `remainingA`, which must satisfy:
- `remainingA ≥ 40 - 22 = 18`
- and `remainingA ≥ 0` (naturally, scores can't be negative)

To maximize `n = (50 - 30) - remainingA = 20 - remainingA`, we want `remainingA` to be as small as possible, with the lower bound of 18.

Thus:
- Minimum remainingA = 18
- Corresponding n = 20 - 18 = 2

Since `remainingA` can be any value ≥ 18, and the goal is to find the greatest `n`, the answer is achieved at the minimal valid `remainingA`:

```python
# Enumerate remainingA from 18 upwards, but we want the minimal remainingA to maximize n
# since n = 20 - remainingA, the maximum n occurs at remainingA = 18
# n = 20 - 18 = 2

# To illustrate the process, we'll print candidate values of remainingA and n

for remainingA in range(18, 31):  # check some values above 18
    n = (50 - 30) - remainingA
    print(f"remainingA = {remainingA}, n = {n}")
    # The first (smallest) remainingA that satisfies the constraint returns the maximum n
# Since the minimal remainingA is 18, the maximum n is 2
print("Maximum n:", 20 - 18)
```

This code enumerates possible `remainingA` values starting from the minimal feasible (18) upwards, showing how `n` decreases as `remainingA` increases. It explicitly demonstrates that the maximum `n` is 2 at `remainingA = 18`.
