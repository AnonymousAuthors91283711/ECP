The problem appears to be about finding the possible values of a certain parameter \(k\), where \(k\) relates to the size of finite subsets \(T\) of a set \(S\subseteq \mathbb{N}\) with a particular property involving the sum of elements. Specifically, for some \(m \in \mathbb{N}\), for all \(n > m\), there exists a finite subset \(T\subseteq S\) with \(n\) elements, such that the sum of its elements is \(n\) and its cardinality is \(k\). The goal seems to find all such \(k > 0\).

Given the nature of the problem, an approach is to test small values of \(k\) by generating candidate subsets \(T\) of various sizes, ensuring the sum matches \(n\). The key insight is that for a fixed \(k\), one can often construct such sets when considering the initial segments of natural numbers.

The enumeration will:
- Try small \(k\) starting from 1 upwards.
- For each \(k\), check for large \(n\), whether such \(T\) exists.
- Stop at some reasonable \(k\) limit, say \(k \le 10\), to keep output within constraints.

```python
# Enumerate possible values of k for which the property holds.
# For each k, attempt to find large n > m with the required T and sum.
# Since the problem is combinatorial, test for small k and large n.

# We will assume S as the initial segment of natural numbers {1, 2, ..., N}
# and check whether for large n, a subset T of size k exists with sum n.

# Parameters for enumeration
max_k = 10
max_n = 100  # upper bound for n to limit computations
answer_k_values = []

for k in range(1, max_k + 1):
    # To satisfy the property for large n, the sum of n elements should be n.
    # For small k, try constructing T with consecutive numbers starting from 1.
    # Sum of first k integers: sum = k*(k+1)//2
    # To get sum n, T could be {1, 2, ..., k-1, n - sum_{first k-1}}
    # Only when n >= sum of first k-1 elements + 1, such T exists.

    # For simplicity, assume S = {1, 2, ..., N} with N large enough
    # Since we only need to check the existence, not the actual S, we generate candidate T.

    large_n_found = False
    for n in range(k, max_n + 1):
        # Construct T: pick the first (k-1) small numbers and compute the last element
        sum_first_k_minus_1 = (k - 1) * k // 2
        last_element = n - sum_first_k_minus_1
        if last_element >= k:
            # T = {1, 2, ..., k-1, last_element}
            # Check sum
            total_sum = sum_first_k_minus_1 + last_element
            if total_sum == n:
                # T of size k with sum n exists
                print(f"k={k} for n={n}: T = {[i for i in range(1, k)] + [last_element]}, sum={total_sum}")
                large_n_found = True
                # For the property to hold, it suffices that such T exists for infinitely many n > m
                # So once found for some large n, consider k valid.
