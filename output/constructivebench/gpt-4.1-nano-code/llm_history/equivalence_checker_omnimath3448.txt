sorry

Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: 91
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is correct. The expression `(Real.sqrt 100 + Real.sqrt 9) * (Real.sqrt 100 - Real.sqrt 9)` simplifies to `(10 + 3) * (10 - 3)` which equals `13 * 7 = 91`. This is a direct application of the difference of squares formula `(a + b)(a - b) = a² - b²`, where `a = √100 = 10` and `b = √9 = 3`. The calculation `10² - 3² = 100 - 9 = 91` confirms the proposed answer is correct.
