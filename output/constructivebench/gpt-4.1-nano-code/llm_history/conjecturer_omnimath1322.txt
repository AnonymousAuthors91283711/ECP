Root of unity order 6, quadratic coeffs a=-1, b=1: (0.5-0.8660254j). Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The roots are roots of unity of orders 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, with corresponding quadratic roots. The total count of such roots corresponds to the sum of roots of unity with these orders, considering multiplicities. The total number is 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 roots, matching the enumerated roots.

Answer: <<<5>>>
