theorem P2011AIMEI_12 :
  IsLeast {w : ℕ | 
    let n := 6 + w;
    let total := n.factorial;
    let valid := sorry /- number of permutations where every man is next to at least one other man -/;
    let success := sorry /- number of permutations with at least 4 men together among valid ones -/;
    valid ≠ 0 ∧ (success : ℚ) / (valid : ℚ) ≤ 1/100} 
  P2011AIMEI_12_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: w=0: total=720, valid=720, success=0, ratio=0.0000
Conjectured minimal w: 0. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The answer is the minimal w such that the ratio success/valid ≤ 1/100. From enumeration, success=0, ratio=0, which satisfies the condition for w=0. Hence, the minimal w is 0.
