Set size 3: possible range sizes = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
Set size 4: possible range sizes = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]
Set size 1: maximum possible range size = 2
Set size 2: maximum possible range size = 4
Set size 3: maximum possible range size = 8
Set size 4: maximum possible range size = 16. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
The pattern shows maximum range sizes double as set size increases, matching powers of 2. Specifically, for set size n, max range size = 2^n. Since the answer is 2^{Fintype.card S}, the formula reflects this pattern.
