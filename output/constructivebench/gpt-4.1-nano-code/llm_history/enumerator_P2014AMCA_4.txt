[write_program]
This code appears to be in Lean, and it describes a mathematical problem involving parameters a, b, c, d, e with some conditions. The goal is to define a function `P2014AMCA_4_answer` that computes \(\frac{b \times d \times e}{a \times c}\) with the given constraints \(a \neq 0, c \neq 0\). 

Since the user's request is to help conjecture and verify the formula via enumeration, and the core computation is \(\frac{b d e}{a c}\), I will instead generate a Python program that enumerates small integer values for parameters \(a, b, c, d, e\), respecting the constraints \(a \neq 0, c \neq 0\), and outputs possible answers of the formula. This will help in understanding the behavior of the formula for small integers.

```python
# Enumerate small values for a, b, c, d, e with constraints a != 0, c != 0
# Compute and print the formula (b * d * e) / (a * c) as a float
# to explore possible value ranges

max_value = 10  # limit to keep enumeration manageable

for a in range(1, max_value + 1):
    for c in range(1, max_value + 1):
        for b in range(0, max_value + 1):
            for d in range(0, max_value + 1):
                for e in range(0, max_value + 1):
                    numerator = b * d * e
                    denominator = a * c
                    result = numerator / denominator
                    print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}, e={e} -> answer={result}")
```
