This problem involves summing powers of 2, specifically \( \sum_{i=0}^{8640} 2^i \), then taking the base-4 logarithm of \( 1 + \) this sum, and finally taking the floor of that logarithm. To understand this problem, I will numerically evaluate the sum and then analyze the value inside the log.

The sum \( \sum_{i=0}^n 2^i = 2^{n+1} - 1 \). Therefore,
\[ 1 + \sum_{i=0}^n 2^i = 1 + (2^{n+1} - 1) = 2^{n+1}. \]
The logarithm base 4 becomes:
\[ \log_4 (2^{8641}) = \frac{\log_2 (2^{8641})}{\log_2 4} = \frac{8641}{2}. \]
Taking the floor gives \( \lfloor 4320.5 \rfloor = 4320 \).

Here's a Python script to verify this:

```python
# Sum of powers of 2 from i=0 to n: sum = 2^(n+1) -1
n = 8640
total = 2 ** (n + 1) - 1
# 1 + sum is 2^(n+1)
value_inside_log = 2 ** (n + 1)
import math
# log base 4 of 2^(n+1) = (n+1)/2
log_base4 = (n + 1) / 2
floor_log = math.floor(log_base4)
print(f"Sum of powers: {total}")
print(f"Value inside log: {value_inside_log}")
print(f"Floor of log base 4: {floor_log}")
```

The answer to the theorem is therefore 4320.
