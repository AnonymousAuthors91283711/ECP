This problem involves solving the equation \( 2 + \sqrt{x-2} = x-2 \) over real numbers, which requires finding all \(x\) satisfying that relation. Since the code is in Lean, and I need a Python script to help enumerate possible solutions, I'll interpret the problem as a math question: find all real solutions to the equation.

Let's analyze it:
\[ 2 + \sqrt{x - 2} = x - 2 \]
with the domain restriction \(x \ge 2\) (since square root requires non-negative argument).

Rearranged:
\[ \sqrt{x - 2} = x - 4 \]
Because \(\sqrt{x-2} \ge 0\), the right side \(x - 4\) must also be \(\ge 0\), giving \(x \ge 4\).

For \(x \ge 4\), square both sides:
\[ x - 2 = (x - 4)^2 = x^2 - 8x + 16 \]

Bring all to one side:
\[ 0 = x^2 - 8x + 16 - (x - 2) = x^2 - 8x + 16 - x + 2 = x^2 - 9x + 18 \]

Quadratic:
\[ x^2 - 9x + 18 = 0 \]

Discriminant:
\[ \Delta = 81 - 72 = 9 \]

Solutions:
\[ x = \frac{9 \pm 3}{2} \]
which are:
\[ x = \frac{9 + 3}{2} = 6 \]
\[ x = \frac{9 - 3}{2} = 3 \]

But recall \(x \ge 4\), so only \(x=6\) is valid.

Check \(x=6\):
\[ 2 + \sqrt{6-2} = 2 + \sqrt{4} = 2 + 2 = 4 \]
\[ x-2 = 6-2=4 \]
Matches.

Verify \(x=3\) does not satisfy the domain and original:

At \(x=3\):
\[ 2 + \sqrt{3-2} = 2 + 1=3 \]
but \(x-2=1\), not equal to 3, so discard.

Thus solution set:
\[ \boxed{\{6\}\} \]

Now, for the Python code: to search numerically for solutions near the interval, let's check a small range starting from 2 to, say, 10, in small steps, and print solutions exactly where the equation holds within a small tolerance.

```python
# Python script to numerically find solutions of 2 + sqrt(x-2) = x-2 for x >= 2
import math

tolerance = 1e-7
solutions = []

# Search in the interval from 2 to 10 with small steps
x_start, x_end, step = 2, 10, 0.001
x = x_start
while x <= x_end:
    left = 2 + math.sqrt(x - 2) if x >= 2 else None
    right = x - 2
    if left is not None and abs(left - right) < tolerance:
        # Round to significant digits to avoid duplicates
        solution = round(x, 8)
        if solution not in solutions:
            solutions.append(solution)
            print(solution)
    x += step

# Output the solutions found explicitly
```
