This Lean theorem appears to be exploring the greatest value of the product \(x \times y \times z\) given the constraints:

- \(x, y, z > 0\)
- \(x y + z = (x + z)(y + z)\)

The code seeks to find (or approximate) the maximum triplet product under these conditions.

Let's analyze the equation:
\[
x y + z = (x + z)(y + z) = xy + xz + yz + z^2
\]
Subtract \(xy\) from both sides:
\[
z = xz + yz + z^2
\]
or
\[
0 = xz + yz + z^2 - z = z(x + y + z - 1)
\]

Since \(z > 0\),
\[
x + y + z = 1
\]

Given this, the problem reduces to maximizing \(x y z\) subject to:
\[
x, y, z > 0, \quad x + y + z = 1
\]

Symmetry suggests the maximum product occurs when \(x\), \(y\), \(z\) are equal, due to the symmetry of the constraints.

Set:
\[
x = y = z = \frac{1}{3}
\]
then:
\[
x y z = \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{27}
\]

This candidate satisfies all constraints and likely maximizes \(x y z\). 

We'll generate candidate products approaching \(\frac{1}{27}\), verifying that for the symmetric point, the constraints hold, and test if any other configurations could yield a larger product (though symmetry suggests not).

Here's the code that explores these solutions:

```python
import numpy as np

# Parameters: small values around the symmetric solution
candidate_points = []

# Generate points with x + y + z close to 1
for x in np.linspace(0.01, 0.99, 50):
    for y in np.linspace(0.01, 0.99, 50):
        z = 1 - x - y
        # Only consider positive z
        if z > 0:
            product = x * y * z
            print(f"x={x:.4f}, y={y:.4f}, z={z:.4f}, product={product:.6f}")
            candidate_points.append((product, x, y, z))

# Find the maximum product candidate
max_candidate = max(candidate_points, key=lambda c: c[0])
max_product, max_x, max_y, max_z = max_candidate
print(f"Maximum product approximately: {max_product:.6f} "
      f"at x={max_x:.4f}, y={max_y:.4f}, z={max_z:.4f}")
```

This code:
- Tests various positive triplets with sum close to 1.
- Prints each candidate's product immediately.
- Finds and outputs the highest candidate, aligning with the symmetry and the derived maximum at \(x=y=z=1/3\).

This approach supports the conjecture and provides approximate maximal values for the problem.
