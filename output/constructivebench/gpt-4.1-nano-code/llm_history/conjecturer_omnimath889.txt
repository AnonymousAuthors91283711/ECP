. Enumerated answers: Theta: 0.0 (m=0)
Maximum θ less than π: 0 derived from m=0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the conjunction of conditions, the product involving cosines simplifies to 1 only when each factor 1 + (1 / cos(2^k * θ)) equals 1, which implies 1 / cos(2^k * θ) = 0, i.e. cos(2^k * θ) = ∞, which is impossible. The other product requires no zero cosine terms, and the maximum θ < π with cos(2^k * θ) ≠ 0 across all k ∈ [0,10] is θ = 0, as cos(0) = 1. Hence, the greatest such θ is 0.  
Final answer:
<<<0.0>>>
