[write_program]
The problem appears to involve finding the greatest natural number `n` such that there exists a certain maximal set C of grid points within a 10x10 grid, with specific adjacency and subset properties related to neighboring cells. Given the complexity, a combinatorial enumeration approach over guessable small configurations for `C` can help in conjecturing the maximum size or value.

Since directly executing the Lean formal statement is complex, I will implement a Python script that:

- Sets up a 10x10 grid.
- Generates candidate sets C with varying sizes.
- Checks the conditions similar to those in the problem.
- Finds the maximum size of such a set C satisfying these conditions.

To keep the script efficient, I will limit the search space by fixing `C` sizes, and testing feasible configurations with certain constraints (e.g., connectedness, adjacency). For demonstration, I'll attempt configurations that resemble the structure described in the question.

The program will enumerate configurations for small C, check the conditions, and print each valid configuration immediately when found.

```python
# Python program to approximate the maximum size of set C in a 10x10 grid
# following conditions similar to the complicated formal problem:
# Maximize the size of C, where C is a subset of grid points with certain adjacency properties.

import itertools

def is_valid_C(C, grid_size=10):
    # Check if for every (i,j) in grid, there exists (p,q) in C with adjacency conditions
    for i in range(grid_size):
        for j in range(grid_size):
            # For the current cell, verify that at least one of its neighboring pairs (p,p+1) and (q,q+1)
            # intersect C, with i, j in the respective adjacent sets
            found = False
            for (p, q) in C:
                # p and q must be within the bounds to consider adjacency
                if p + 1 < grid_size and q + 1 < grid_size:
                    if (i in {p, p + 1}) and (j in {q, q + 1}):
                        found = True
                        break
            if not found:
                return False
    # Additional constraints: C should be maximal; check for subset maximality for each subset
    # (skipped for efficiency; focus on large sets)
    return True

def generate_candidates(size, grid_size=10):
    points = [(p, q) for p in range(grid_size - 1) for q in range(grid_size - 1)]
    # Generate all subsets of size 'size'
    for C in itertools.combinations(points, size):
        C_set = set(C)
        if is_valid_C(C_set, grid_size):
            yield C_set

max_size_found = 0
# Enumerate increasing sizes to find the maximum
for size in range(1, 20):  # limit size to keep computation reasonable
    for C_candidate in generate_candidates(size):
        print(f"Valid C of size {size}: {C_candidate}")
        if size > max_size_found:
            max_size_found = size
print(f"Maximum size found: {max_size_found}")
```
