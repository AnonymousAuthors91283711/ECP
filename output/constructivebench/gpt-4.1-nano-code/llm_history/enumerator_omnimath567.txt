The problem appears to be about finding the greatest size (cardinality) of a special subset of pairs within an n×n grid, where the set of pairs has a unique injective function matching each i to j, and all pairs are within the bounds 0 ≤ i,j ≤ n. Essentially, this resembles the problem of finding the maximum size of a partial matching or an injective mapping in a limited grid, with the additional constraint that the matching is unique.

To assist in conjecturing the behavior, I'll write a Python script that systematically tests small values of n (say from 1 to 10), enumerates possible pair sets with properties similar to perfect matchings within the grid, and identifies the largest such set. Since the problem asks for the greatest k satisfying these conditions, I will focus on small n, generate candidate sets, and print when a larger set is found.

The enumerator will:
- For each n, generate all possible matchings (subsets of pairs) with size up to n.
- Check if there exists a unique injective matching covering those pairs.
- Record the largest such k.

Note:
- This is a simplified heuristic; it does not perfectly model the formal theorem but aims to find candidate maximum sizes for small n.

```python
import itertools

def find_max_unique_injective(n):
    max_size = 0
    # Generate all possible pairs within the grid
    pairs = [(i, j) for i in range(n+1) for j in range(n+1)]
    # Check subsets of pairs with size up to n
    for k in range(n, 0, -1):
        for subset in itertools.combinations(pairs, k):
            # Extract i's and j's
            ios = [i for i, j in subset]
            js = [j for i, j in subset]
            # Check injectivity: all i's are unique
            if len(set(ios)) != len(ios):
                continue
            # Check if there is a unique function matching i to j
            # In this case, since pairs are within the subset, the matching is unique
            # if the map i -> j is well-defined and injective
            if len(set(js)) == len(js):
                # Found a matching of size k
                if k > max_size:
                    max_size = k
                    print(f"n={n}, max matching size={k}, pairs={subset}")
                break  # No need to check smaller subsets for this size
    return max_size

# Explore small n
for n in range(1, 11):
    size = find_max_unique_injective(n)
    print(f"n={n}, computed max size={size}")
```
