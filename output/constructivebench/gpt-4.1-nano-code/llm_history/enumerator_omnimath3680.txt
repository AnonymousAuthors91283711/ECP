The problem appears to be a number theory question involving primes and an equation of the form p*q + q*r + r*p = 12*k + 1, with p, q, r primes, and k > 0. The task is to find all such quadruples (p, q, r, k). We'll approach this by fixing small primes for p, q, r, and solving for k, then filtering solutions to ensure the conditions are met.

Given the structure, the program will:
- Iterate over small prime values for p, q, r
- Check the equation p*q + q*r + r*p = 12*k + 1
- Calculate k and verify it is a positive integer
- Print all solutions found

This enumeration will help in conjecturing the pattern or possible solutions.

```python
# Import sympy for prime generation
from sympy import primerange

# Set small range of primes to consider
primes = list(primerange(2, 50))

# Iterate over all triplets of primes
for p in primes:
    for q in primes:
        for r in primes:
            s = p * q + q * r + r * p
            # Check if s - 1 is divisible by 12
            if (s - 1) % 12 == 0:
                k = (s - 1) // 12
                if k > 0:
                    print(f"p={p}, q={q}, r={r}, k={k}")
```
