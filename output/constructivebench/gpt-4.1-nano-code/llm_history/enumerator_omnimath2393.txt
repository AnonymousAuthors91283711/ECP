The problem involves defining two functions based on parameters \(a, b, c\), and finding the difference between the infimum of their ranges, with constraints on \(a, b, c\). We need to systematically explore values within the given set constraints (\(a, b, c\) are natural numbers, subsets of \([1, 11]\)), ensuring distinctness, and compute the difference between the infimums of the ranges of \(f\) and \(g\). We aim to find the greatest such difference. 

Plan:
- Enumerate all triplets \((a, b, c)\) with the specified constraints.
- For each triplet, define functions \(f\) and \(g\).
- Use analysis of quadratic functions to find their range infimums.
- Calculate the difference and track the maximum.

Since the quadratic quadratic forms are straightforward, their minima occur at \(x\) where the derivative is zero. For \(f(x) = a(x-b)(x-c)\), the vertex (minimum or maximum) is at \(x = \frac{b + c}{2}\). For \(g(x) = a(x-b)(x+c)\), the vertex is at \(x = \frac{b - c}{2}\).

We evaluate \(f\) and \(g\) at their vertices to find the infimums. Because \(a\) and the quadratic formula are simple, the calculations are quick.

```python
import math

max_diff = -math.inf
max_triplet = None

# Enumerate all triplets with a, b, c in 1..11, all distinct
for a in range(1, 12):
    for b in range(1, 12):
        for c in range(1, 12):
            if len({a, b, c}) != 3:
                continue

            # Compute f and g at their vertices
            # f(x) = a*(x - b)*(x - c), vertex at x=(b+c)/2
            x_f = (b + c) / 2
            f_value = a * (x_f - b) * (x_f - c)

            # g(x) = a*(x - b)*(x + c), vertex at x=(b - c)/2
            x_g = (b - c) / 2
            g_value = a * (x_g - b) * (x_g + c)

            # For quadratic open upwards if a > 0:
            # The infimum is at the vertex (minimum value)
            # Both are quadratic with positive leading coefficient (since a ∈ ℕ)
            # But if a<0, parabola opens down; still, since a∈ℕ≥1, quadratic opens up.
            diff = abs(f_value - g_value)
            # Update maximum
            if diff > max_diff:
                max_diff = diff
                max_triplet = (a, b, c)

    # Early break if maximum is very large
    if max_diff >= 1e6:
        break

print(f"Maximum difference: {max_diff}")
print(f"Achieved with a={max_triplet[0]}, b={max_triplet[1]}, c={max_triplet[2]}")
```
