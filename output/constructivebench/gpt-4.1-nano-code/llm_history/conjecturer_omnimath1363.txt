theorem omnimath1363 : 
  IsGreatest {k : ℕ | ∃ (p : Polynomial ℝ), 
    (∀ x : ℝ, eval x p ≠ 0) ∧ 
    (∀ i ∈ Finset.range 2011, coeff p i ∈ ({-1, 1} : Set ℝ)) ∧ 
    (coeff p 2010 = 1) ∧

  omnimath1363_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Maximum negatives encountered: -1. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests the maximum number of -1 coefficients is attained when all coefficients up to 2010 are -1, except the highest as 1, to satisfy all conditions and maximize the count of negatives. This yields a total of 2010 negatives.
