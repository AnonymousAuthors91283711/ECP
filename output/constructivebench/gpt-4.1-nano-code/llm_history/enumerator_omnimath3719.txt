The problem appears to involve finding the minimum value of the sum \[
\frac{a}{b^2+1} + \frac{b}{c^2+1} + \frac{c}{a^2+1}
\]
where \(a, b, c \geq 0\) and \(a + b + c = 3\). To conjecture this minimum, I will generate candidates for \((a, b, c)\) that satisfy the constraints, focusing on potential symmetrical or boundary cases which often yield extremal values.

I will:
- Test points where \(a, b, c\) are equal.
- Test boundary points where one or two variables are zero.
- Use small deviations around symmetric points.
- For each, compute the sum and print the result immediately.

This approach should reveal the minimal candidate(s), enabling us to conjecture the true minimum.

```python
# Generate possible candidate points for (a, b, c) with sum = 3 and non-negative
import itertools

# Known controlled samples
candidates = []

# Symmetric point: a = b = c = 1
a, b, c = 1, 1, 1
candidates.append((a, b, c))

# Boundary points: one variable zero, others sum to 3
for zero_var in [(0, 0, 3), (0, 3, 0), (3, 0, 0)]:
    a, b, c = zero_var
    candidates.append((a, b, c))

# Slight deviations around symmetric point
epsilon = 0.1
for delta in [-epsilon, epsilon]:
    # Variations keeping sum = 3
    # e.g., (1 + delta, 1 - delta, 1)
    a, b, c = 1 + delta, 1 - delta, 1
    if a >= 0 and b >= 0 and c >= 0:
        candidates.append((a, b, c))
    # Variations with other permutations
    a, b, c = 1, 1 + delta, 1 - delta
    if a >= 0 and b >= 0 and c >= 0:
        candidates.append((a, b, c))
    a, b, c = 1 - delta, 1, 1 + delta
    if a >= 0 and b >= 0 and c >= 0:
        candidates.append((a, b, c))

# Check all candidates
for (a, b, c) in candidates:
    val = a / (b ** 2 + 1) + b / (c ** 2 + 1) + c / (a ** 2 + 1)
    print(f"a={a:.2f}, b={b:.2f}, c={c:.2f} => sum={val:.4f}")
```
