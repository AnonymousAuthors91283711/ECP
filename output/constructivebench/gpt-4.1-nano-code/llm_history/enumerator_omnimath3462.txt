The problem requires finding a natural number `omnimath3462_answer` such that:
- It is not divisible by 3.
- It is not a perfect square.
- The sum of its decimal digits is prime.

To approach this systematically, I'll pick small candidate numbers, check these conditions, and print each candidate that satisfies them immediately. Given the constraints, I will iterate through numbers in increasing order, stopping once I find candidates. This way, I can explore potential answers efficiently without enumerating unnecessarily large values.

Here's the Python program:

```python
# This script searches for numbers that satisfy: 
# (not divisible by 3), (not a perfect square), (sum of digits is prime).
# It prints each candidate that satisfies the conditions.

import math

def is_perfect_square(n):
    root = int(math.isqrt(n))
    return root * root == n

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    if n in (2, 3):
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def digit_sum(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

# Search range (small for efficiency)
for candidate in range(1, 10000):
    if candidate % 3 == 0:
        continue
    if is_perfect_square(candidate):
        continue
    s = digit_sum(candidate)
    if is_prime(s):
        print(candidate)
```
