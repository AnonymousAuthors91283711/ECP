The problem involves simplifying the expression involving logs and exponents, likely related to the properties of logarithms and powers to find an exact answer. To assist, we'll generate candidates for the value inside the exponent, checking for simplified or notable values, and deducing the overall power. We will test small integers and fractions to identify potential closed-form results.

```python
import math

# Using small sample values to evaluate the expression
# Log base conversion: log_b(a) = log(a) / log(b)

# Precompute logs for referenced numbers
log2 = math.log(2)
log3 = math.log(3)
log6 = math.log(6)
log12 = math.log(12)
log24 = math.log(24)

# Rearrange the expression: log3 / log2, etc., are already computed
def evaluate_expression():
    term1 = (log3 / log2) ** 3
    term2 = (log6 / log2) ** 3
    term3 = (log12 / log2) ** 3
    term4 = (log24 / log2) ** 3
    value = 2 ** ((1/6) * (term1 - term2 - term3 + term4))
    print("Computed value:", value)
    # Check for notable constants
    for candidate in [0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3]:
        candidate_pow = 2 ** candidate
        if abs(candidate_pow - value) < 1e-6:
            print("Approximate match with candidate exponent:", candidate)

evaluate_expression()
