The problem appears to involve summing over all divisors `d'` within the interval [10, 99] such that `(2^32 - 1) % d' = 0`. Essentially, you're summing all divisors of `2^32 - 1` that lie between 10 and 99, inclusive.

To generate the answer:
- For each candidate `d` in [10..99], check if `d` divides `2^32 -1`.
- Sum those `d`.

I'll implement an enumeration of candidates and compute the divisors accordingly, printing each qualifying divisor.

```python
# Calculate 2^32 - 1
value = 2**32 - 1

# Initialize sum
total_sum = 0

# Enumerate potential divisors from 10 to 99
for d in range(10, 100):
    if value % d == 0:
        print(d)  # Output each divisor immediately
        total_sum += d

# Assign the total sum to the answer variable
olympiadbench2949_answer = total_sum
print('Answer:', olympiadbench2949_answer)
```

This code efficiently finds all divisors of `2^32 - 1` in the specified range, prints each divisor upon discovery, and keeps a running total to assign as the answer.
