The pattern suggests the solutions correspond to the real roots of the composition \(f^{(3)}(x) = 3\). Since \(f(x) = x^2 - 2x\), fixed points are \(0\) and \(2\), but iterating and solving yields roots like \(1\), \(-1\), and approximate solutions near \(\pm 0.4142\). The set of solutions includes \(-1\), \(1\), and \(\frac{1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}\). Therefore, the final set is \(\{-1, 1, \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}, \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\}\).
