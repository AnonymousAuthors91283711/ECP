This problem involves finding real numbers \(w, b, r\) satisfying a set of ratios and sum constraints, and expressing \(w\) as a rational value ("the answer"). To assist in conjecture and potential proof, I will programmatically generate all candidate solutions based on the given ratios, then verify the conditions.

Given the ratios:

- \(w / b = 16 / 3\), hence \(w = (16/3) b\).
- \(b / r = 3 / 1\), hence \(b = 3 r\).

Using these, we can express all variables in terms of \(r\):

- \(b = 3 r\),
- \(w = (16/3) b = (16/3) \times 3 r = 16 r\),
- \(w + b + r = 1 \implies 16 r + 3 r + r = 1 \implies 20 r = 1 \implies r = 1/20\).

Then:

- \(r = 1/20\),
- \(b = 3 \times 1/20 = 3/20\),
- \(w = 16 \times 1/20 = 16/20 = 4/5\).

The exact values are rational. To assist, I'll verify these calculations. I'll generate candidates around these values with small perturbations to consider approximate solutions, and explicitly print the determined rational values.

```python
# Program to find and verify variables w, b, r satisfying the constraints:
# w + b + r = 1
# w / b = 16 / 3
# b / r = 3 / 1

# Express all in terms of r:
# b = 3 * r
# w = (16/3) * b = (16/3) * 3 * r = 16 * r
# Sum: w + b + r = 16r + 3r + r = 20r = 1 => r = 1/20

# Generate candidate solutions based on this relation and small perturbations
import fractions

# Exact solution based on derivation
r_exact = fractions.Fraction(1,20)
b_exact = 3 * r_exact
w_exact = 16 * r_exact

print(f"Exact solution:\n w = {w_exact} \n b = {b_exact} \n r = {r_exact}")

# Generate nearby candidates by slight perturbations around the exact solution
perturbations = [0, fractions.Fraction(1, 1000), -fractions.Fraction(1, 1000)]
for dr in perturbations:
    r_candidate = r_exact + dr
    if r_candidate <= 0:
        continue
    b_candidate = 3 * r_candidate
    w_candidate = 16 * r_candidate
    sum_candidates = w_candidate + b_candidate + r_candidate
    print(f"Candidate: w = {float(w_candidate):.5f}, b = {float(b_candidate):.5f}, r = {float(r_candidate):.5f}")
    print(f"Sum: {sum_candidates}")
    if abs(float(sum_candidates) - 1) < 1e-10:
        print(f"Valid candidate with sum â‰ˆ 1")
```
