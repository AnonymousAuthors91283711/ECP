Ground Truth Answer: 1006
Proposed Answer: (2012 * (2012 + 1) / 2) % 2012
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive sequence where:
   - a(1) = 1
   - a(n+1) = (a(n) + (n+1)) mod 2012

2. The ground truth answer is 1006.

3. The proposed answer calculates (2012*2013/2) mod 2012.

Let's evaluate the proposed answer:
- 2012*2013/2 = 2012*1006.5 = 2012*1006 + 1006
- Taking mod 2012: (2012*1006 + 1006) mod 2012 = 1006 mod 2012 = 1006

The proposed answer simplifies to the same value as the ground truth answer (1006), though it arrives at it through a different approach. The equivalence holds because:
- The recursive definition effectively computes the sum 1+2+...+n mod 2012
- The closed form for this sum is n(n+1)/2 mod 2012
- For n=2012, this gives the same result as the ground truth
