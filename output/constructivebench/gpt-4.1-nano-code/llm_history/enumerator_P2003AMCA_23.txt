This problem appears to involve counting the number of perfect squares `d` that divide the product of factorials for `i` in [1, 9], and then matching this count to some answer. Based on the structure, the set involves divisors `d` of the product `‚àè_{i=1}^9 i!`, where `d` is a perfect square (`d = k^2`). We need to find how many such perfect squares divide this product.

To approach this problem:
- Factorize the combined factorial product.
- Count the number of perfect square divisors, which relates to exponents in the full factorization.
- Since the question asks for the *cardinality* of such divisors, a key step is computing the number of divisors of the product that are perfect squares.

Method:
- Compute exponents of primes in the factorial product.
- For each prime, the total exponent in the product is sum of exponents in each factorial from 1! to 9!.
- The number of perfect square divisors is the product over primes of (floor(exponent/2) + 1).

Implementing this efficiently in Python:

```python
import sympy

# Compute the exponents of a prime p in n!
def prime_exponent_in_factorial(n, p):
    count = 0
    power = p
    while power <= n:
        count += n // power
        power *= p
    return count

# compute total exponents of primes in the product of factorials from 1! to 9!
primes = list(sympy.primerange(2, 50))
exponent_sum = {}
for p in primes:
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, 10):
        total += prime_exponent_in_factorial(i, p)
    exponent_sum[p] = total

# Count perfect squares divisors:
# For each prime, the exponent in the divisor must be even.
# The count of options: floor(exponent/2) + 1
answer = 1
for p, total_exp in exponent_sum.items():
    answer *= (total_exp // 2) + 1

print(answer)
```
