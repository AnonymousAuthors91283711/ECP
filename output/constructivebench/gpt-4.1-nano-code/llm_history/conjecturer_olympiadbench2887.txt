theorem olympiadbench2887 :
  IsLeast {N : ℕ | N ∈ (List.permutations [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5]).map (fun l => l.foldl (fun acc d => acc * 10 + d) 0) ∧ N % 264 = 0} olympiadbench2887_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 135432. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests the answer is a divisible number formed by permutation leading to 135432, matching the requirement of being in the permutation set and divisible by 264. Since permutations and divisibility are considered, 135432 is the minimal number satisfying the conditions, and the problem demands the least such number.
