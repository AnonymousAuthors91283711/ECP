theorem P2011AMCA_18 (x y : ℝ) (h : |x + y| + |x - y| = 2) :
  IsGreatest {z : ℝ | ∃ x' y', |x' + y'| + |x' - y'| = 2 ∧ z = x'^2 - 6*x' + y'^2} (P2011AMCA_18_answer x y) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Point (1, 1) yields z = -4
Point (-1, -1) yields z = 8
Point (1, -1) yields z = -4
Point (-1, 1) yields z = 8
Maximum z = 8 occurs at points: [(-1, -1), (-1, 1)]. Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ → ℝ
The points where |x' + y'| + |x' - y'| = 2 include the pairs (1, -1) and (-1, 1), which give z = x'^2 - 6x' + y'^2 = 8. These are the maximum values, so the answer is 8.
