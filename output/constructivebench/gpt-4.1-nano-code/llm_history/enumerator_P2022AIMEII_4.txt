This problem appears to involve solving a logarithmic equation:  
log_b(20x) (22x) = log_b(10) (m/n) with some constraints on x, m, n, and their sum.  
Given the form, it suggests transforming the logs to a common base and possibly relating the original values to ratios involving m and n.  
To assist in conjecture, we'll choose sample small values of m and n, compute corresponding x, verify properties, and find candidates for the sum m + n.  
The goal is to generate pairs (m, n) with coprimality and check if the resulting x satisfies the conditions, then output candidate sums.

```python
import math

# Function to check if two numbers are coprime
def coprime(a, b):
    return math.gcd(a, b) == 1

# List to store candidate sums m + n
candidate_sums = set()

# Iterate over small positive integers m, n with m < n to find potential solutions
max_mn = 50  # limit for enumeration for efficiency
for m in range(1, max_mn):
    for n in range(m+1, max_mn):
        if not coprime(m, n):
            continue
        # Compute ratio m/n
        ratio = m / n
        # We want to set up an equation from the logs:
        # log_b(20x) (22x) = log_b(10) (m/n)
        # But need to define a common base. Let's pick b = 10 for simplicity.
        # For base 10 logs:
        # log_{10}(20x)/log_{10}(22x) = log_{10}(m/n) = log10(m/n)
        # This implies:
        # log10(20x) / log10(22x) = log10(m/n)
        # Let's test for x that satisfies:
        # (log10(20x) / log10(22x)) == log10(m/n)

        # To avoid dividing by zero, ensure logs are well-defined:
        # x > 0, so 20x > 0 and 22x > 0 always holds.

        # We can rewrite the equation:
        # log10(20x) / log10(22x) = log10(m/n)

        # Let's attempt to find x such that:
        # log10(20x) / log10(22x) = log10(m/n)

        log_ratio = math.log10(ratio)

        # Define:
        # f(x) = log10(20x) / log10(22x)
        # We check if for some x > 0, f(x) = log_ratio.

        # For given m,n, solve for x:
        # log10(20x) = log_ratio * log10(22x)
        # Let y = log10(x)
        # Then:
        # log10(20) + y = log_ratio * (log10(22) + y)
        # Distribute:
        # log10(20) + y = log_ratio * log10(22) + log_ratio * y
        #
        # Bring all y terms to one side:
        # y - log_ratio * y = log_ratio * log10(22) - log10(20)
        # y (1 - log_ratio) = log_ratio * log10(22) - log10(20)
        #
        # Solve for y:
        denominator = 1 - log_ratio
        if abs(denominator) < 1e-12:
            # Prevent division by zero
            continue
        y = (log_ratio * math.log10(22) - math.log10(20)) / denominator
        # Compute x:
        x = 10 ** y

        # Now, check if x satisfies the initial conditions:
        # - 0 < x
        # - x != 1/20
        # - x != 1/2
        if x <= 0:
            continue
        if math.isclose(x, 1/20, rel_tol=1e-9) or math.isclose(x, 1/2, rel_tol=1e-9):
            continue

        # Record the sum m + n
        candidate_sums.add(m + n)

        # Print the candidate solution details
        print(f"m={m}, n={n}, x={x:.6f}, sum={m + n}")

# After enumeration, suggest the minimal candidate sum
if candidate_sums:
    min_sum = min(candidate_sums)
    print(f"Candidate minimum sum m + n: {min_sum}")
