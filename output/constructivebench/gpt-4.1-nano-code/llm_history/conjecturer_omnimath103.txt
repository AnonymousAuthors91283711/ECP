The pattern suggests isGood M ⇔ ∃ a b c d, with these inequalities and a * d = b * c, and M lies between a and d within a certain range with a < b < c < d. Typically, such a condition on M relates to the product b*c and the bounds involving a, d, with the maximal or minimal M corresponding to these bounds. When analyzing the extremal M, the maximum M satisfying isGood is likely M = 0, corresponding to the minimal case where the product is minimal or the bounds minimal.

Thus, the greatest M with isGood is 0, and the least M with isBad is 1 (since it’s just ≥ 0 and ≤ 49).

Therefore, answer:

<<<0>>>
