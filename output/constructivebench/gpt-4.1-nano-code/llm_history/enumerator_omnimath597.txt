The problem appears to deal with a hypercube graph on the set of vertices in \(\{0,1\}^4\), which has 16 vertices, and possibly paths or chains of length 4 connecting vertices with edges differing in exactly one coordinate. To estimate the number of such paths (or sequences), I will generate all possible sequences \( s: \{0,1,2,3,4\} \to \{v\}\) satisfying the constraints: start at \(0\), end at \(1\), each consecutive vertices differ in exactly one coordinate, and consecutive vertices are distinct. 

Since the hypercube has 16 vertices, and each step moves along an edge, the maximum number of such paths is overestimating all possible sequences respecting the constraints, with the real answer likely smaller.

Here's how I will proceed:
- Use small sample hypercube vertices in \(\{0,1\}^4\).
- Generate all paths of length 4 starting at 0 and ending at 1.
- For each path, verify the neighbor condition (exact one differing coordinate).
- Count all such valid paths.
- Print each path as discovered, to enable conjecture.

This approach prioritizes enumeration, efficiency, and streaming results.

```python
import itertools

# Generate all vertices of hypercube in {0,1}^4
vertices = [tuple(v) for v in itertools.product([0, 1], repeat=4)]
vertex_set = set(vertices)

# Function to check if two vertices are connected by an edge (differ in exactly one coordinate)
def is_edge(v1, v2):
    diff = sum(a != b for a, b in zip(v1, v2))
    return diff == 1

# Bound parameters
start_vertex = (0, 0, 0, 0)
end_vertex = (1, 1, 1, 1)
path_length = 4

# Store all valid paths
valid_paths = []

# Generate all sequences s of length 5 (from s0 to s4)
for path in itertools.product(vertices, repeat=path_length + 1):
    if path[0] != start_vertex or path[-1] != end_vertex:
        continue
    # Check minimal number of steps
    if any(path[i] == path[i+1] for i in range(path_length)):
        continue
    # Check edge condition
    if all(is_edge(path[i], path[i+1]) for i in range(path_length)):
        # Path satisfies constraints
        print(path)
        valid_paths.append(path)

# Output total number of paths (for information)
print(f"Total paths: {len(valid_paths)}")
```
