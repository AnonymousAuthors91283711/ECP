Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: List ℕ
Because the fold sum equals -2013 with `n * (-4) + d`, the sum simplifies to `-4 * sum of the list + sum of list elements`. Setting the sum of elements = S, total sum: `-4 * Σ + Σ = -3 * Σ`. So `-3 * S = -2013` gives `S = 671`.  
Patterns suggest each `d` component is from {0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10} with specific repetitions. They combine to form total sum 671 and the pattern (3, 0, 2, 0, {i}, {j}) generalizes to `(3, 0, 2, 0, 671, 4)`.  
Final: <<<[3, 0, 2, 0, 671, 4]>>>
