Ground Truth Answer: 27/64
Proposed Answer: 3
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is calculating the expected value of a binomial distribution scenario with 3 coins, where each coin has a 1/2 probability of success. The expression is summing over all possible outcomes of flipping 3 coins, and for each outcome with k successes, it calculates the probability of that outcome multiplied by the number of ways to get exactly 1 more success in the remaining (3 - k) coins.

2. The ground truth answer is 27/64, which is approximately 0.421875.

3. The proposed answer is 3, which is clearly different from 27/64.

4. The correct calculation would be:
   - For k=0: 1 * (1/2)^0 * (1/2)^3 * 3 * (1/2)^1 * (1/2)^2 = 3/64
   - For k=1: 3 * (1/2)^1 * (1/2)^2 * 2 * (1/2)^1 * (1/2)^1 = 12/64
   - For k=2: 3 * (1/2)^2 * (1/2)^1 * 1 * (1/2)^1 * (1/2)^0 = 12/64
   - Sum: 3/64 + 12/64 + 12/64 = 27/64

The proposed answer of 3 is incorrect.
