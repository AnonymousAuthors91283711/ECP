This problem involves summing over the integers from 0 to 2020 (since range(2021)), applying a filter on prime factors less than 6, counting them, squaring the count, and summing these squares. To synthesize possible answers, we can focus on sample values and small ranges to observe patterns.

Key observations:
- For each n, primeFactors(n) is the set of prime factors of n.
- We filter primeFactors(n) to include only primes < 6, i.e. {2, 3, 5}.
- The count of such prime factors influences the contribution to the sum.

Efficient approach:
- For small n, explicitly compute the count of prime factors < 6.
- Sum their squares across all n up to a small threshold.
- Use small sample ranges to estimate the total sum.
- Printing intermediate results to facilitate conjecture.

Here's the code:

```python
# Enumerate over small sample range to observe patterns
import math

# Function to compute prime factors of n
def prime_factors(n):
    factors = set()
    num = n
    for p in [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]:
        while num % p == 0:
            factors.add(p)
            num //= p
        if num == 1:
            break
    # For larger remaining factors, omit for simplicity
    return factors

# Sum squared count of prime factors < 6
sum_result = 0
for n in range(1, 2001):
    factors = prime_factors(n)
    count_lt6 = sum(1 for p in factors if p < 6)
    sum_result += count_lt6 ** 2
    if n % 200 == 0:
        print(f"Sum up to {n}: {sum_result}")

print("Approximate total sum:", sum_result)
# The sum for total 2020 can be extrapolated or examined directly.
```

This approach provides partial results to reason about the total sum, demonstrating the distribution of prime factors less than 6 across numbers up to 2020, supporting conjecture on the pattern and the final sum.
