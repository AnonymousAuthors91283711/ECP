This problem involves analyzing the roots of two cubic polynomials with parameters, and their relations when shifted. The key is to understand the roots and their transformations given the conditions, then find the particular value of \(b'\) in the set \(S\).

To handle this, Iâ€™ll:
- Enumerate possible numeric values for \(a, b, r, s\) within small ranges since the problem is not explicitly continuous.
- Check roots of the given cubic polynomials.
- Use the conditions to identify the possible \(b'\) values.
- Since the problem is high-school level, approximate solutions are acceptable for root-finding.
- Use `numpy`'s polynomial root-finding for efficiency.

Let's implement the enumeration accordingly.

```python
import numpy as np

# Define the polynomial evaluation function
def eval_poly(coeffs, x):
    return np.polyval(coeffs, x)

# Enumerate small ranges for parameters to find candidates
candidate_b_primes = set()

# Small ranges for a, b, r, s (chosen for simplicity)
for a in np.linspace(-10, 10, 21):
    for b in np.linspace(-10, 10, 21):
        # Construct base polynomial: X^3 + a*X + b
        base_coeffs = [1, 0, a, b]
        # Find roots of the base polynomial
        roots_base = np.roots(base_coeffs)
        for r in roots_base:
            for s in roots_base:
                if r != s:
                    # Check the conditions for the shifted polynomials
                    # Polynomial with b+240
                    b_shifted = b + 240
                    shifted_coeffs = [1, 0, a, b_shifted]
                    # Check roots for the shifted polynomials
                    roots_shifted = np.roots(shifted_coeffs)

                    # For each pair of roots in shifted polynomial, check the conditions
                    for r2 in roots_shifted:
                        for s2 in roots_shifted:
                            if r2 != s2:
                                # Conditions:
                                # eval r of base polynomial = 0 (already True for r)
                                # eval s of base polynomial = 0 (already True for s)
                                # eval (r+4) of shifted polynomial = 0
                                val_r_plus4 = eval_poly(shifted_coeffs, r2 + 4)
                                # eval (s-3) of shifted polynomial = 0
                                val_s_minus3 = eval_poly(shifted_coeffs, s2 - 3)

                                # Check if these evaluations are close to zero
                                if abs(val_r_plus4) < 1e-6 and abs(val_s_minus3) < 1e-6:
                                    b_prime = abs(b)
                                    print(f"Found: a={a}, b={b}, r={r}, s={s}, shifted roots={r2},{s2}")
                                    print(f"b' = |b| = {b_prime}")
                                    candidate_b_primes.add(b_prime)

# Output the set of candidate b' values
print("Candidates for b':", sorted(candidate_b_primes))
```
