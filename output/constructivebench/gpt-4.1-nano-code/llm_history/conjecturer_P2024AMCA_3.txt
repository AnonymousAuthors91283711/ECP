The problem seeks the least k such that there exists a multiset s with elements between 10 and 99 inclusive, summing to 2024. Given the pattern, minimal elements should be as small as possible, summing closely to 2024.

Constructing the minimal sum with the least larger number 99, and as many 10s as needed:
Number of 99s: ⌊2024/99⌋ = 20 (since 99*20=1980), remainder 2024-1980=44 < 99, so need an extra element ≥ 10 with sum 44.

Possible set: 20 elements of 99 and 1 element of 44 (treating the sum for minimization).

Sum: 20*99 + 44 = 1980 + 44 = 2024.

Minimal maximum element k = 44.

Hence, the least such k is 44.
