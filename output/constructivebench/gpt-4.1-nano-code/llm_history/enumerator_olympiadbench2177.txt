[write_program]
The problem appears to be a formal mathematical statement about least natural numbers `k` with certain properties related to coloring and functions, including additivity and its failure. To interpret or verify such a theorem, a computational approach involves enumerating small values of `k`, possible colorings, and functions satisfying the additive conditions, and looking for counterexamples to additivity.

Since the problem asks for the minimal such `k`, and involves colorings `color : ℕ → Fin k`, as well as functions `f : ℕ → ℕ` satisfying linearity (the additive condition) but failing it somewhere, I will write a Python program that:

- Iterates `k` starting from 1 upward.
- For each `k`, considers small, simple colorings over a finite subset of ℕ (e.g., 0..N).
- For various functions `f : ℕ → ℕ` with small domains, checks the additivity and its failure.
- When it finds a candidate `k`, it reports it immediately.

This approach is heuristic, limited to manageable small values and subsets, and explores possible configurations to conjecture the minimal `k`.

```python
# Enumerate smallest k > 0 where there exists:
# - a coloring of some initial segment of naturals into k colors
# - a function f : ℕ → ℕ on the same segment
# satisfying additivity for all pairs, but not globally.
# The program searches for the minimal such k.

def main():
    max_k = 10  # upper limit for search
    N = 10  # check within first N natural numbers for simplicity

    for k in range(1, max_k + 1):

                yield []
            else:
                for c in range(k):
                    for rest in generate_colorings(n - 1, k):
                        yield [c] + rest
