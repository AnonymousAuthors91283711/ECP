Given the pattern of the equation \(\frac{(a+b-1)(a+b)}{2} - a + 1 = 2015\), simplifying suggests \(a + b\) should satisfy \(\frac{(a+b-1)(a+b)}{2} \approx 2015 + a - 1\). Since \(a, b > 0\), the dominant part depends on \(a + b\). Testing \(a + b = 64\) gives \(\frac{63 \times 64}{2} = 2016\),

Thus, \(a + b = 64\) with \(a \geq 1\), \(b \geq 1\). The unique \(a\) minimizing the equation with the constraints is confirmed at \(a=1\), \(b=63\). 

Final answer:

<<<(1, 63)>>>
