abbrev omnimath3038_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath3038 : 
  8 * omnimath3038_answer = 26 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found candidate: 13/4 = 3.25. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The enumerated candidate suggests the answer is 13/4, which is equivalent to 3.25. To satisfy 8 * answer = 26, answer must be 26/8 = 13/4. Therefore, the closed form is simply 13/4, which matches the candidate 13/4.

<<<(13:ℚ) / 4>>>
