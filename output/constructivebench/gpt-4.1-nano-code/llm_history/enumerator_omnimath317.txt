The problem appears to involve a functional equation with conditions on triples of nonzero real numbers and the goal of characterizing functions satisfying this relation. Since the exact solution is not provided (`abbrev omnimath317_answer` is `sorry`) and the theorem's proof is not completed, we can help by enumerating potential simple solutions based on the structure of the equation and standard functions in such contexts.

Here's my reasoning:
- The functional relation connects quadratic and product forms.
- Common solutions for such equations often include constant functions, linear functions, or functions satisfying particular symmetry.
- Testing simple functions like constants or linear functions might yield solutions.
- We will check for constant functions f(x) = c, and linear functions f(x) = kx, for small parameter values.

Since the problem involves the specification of functions over ℝ → ℝ and expects enumeration for insight, I will systematically test these simple conjectured solutions, verify if they satisfy the functional equation for various small parameters, and output the candidates.

```python
# Program to enumerate simple candidate functions for the functional equation.
# Testing constant functions and linear functions for small parameter values.
# Printing solutions that satisfy the equation for sample triples.

def check_constant(c):
    # Check if constant function f(x) = c satisfies the functional relation for various triples.
    for x in [1, 2, -1]:
        for y in [1, -1, 2]:
            for z in [1, -1, 2]:
                if x != 0 and y != 0 and z != 0:
                    # Compute LHS and RHS
                    lhs = c**2 - c * c
                    rhs = x * (x + y + z) * (c + c + c)
                    if abs(lhs - rhs) > 1e-8:
                        return False
    return True

def check_linear(k):
    # Check if linear function f(x) = kx satisfies the relation for sample triples.
    for x in [1, 2, -1]:
        for y in [1, -1, 2]:
            for z in [1, -1, 2]:
                if x != 0 and y != 0 and z != 0:
                    fx, fy, fz = k * x, k * y, k * z
                    lhs = fx**2 - fy * fz
                    rhs = x * (x + y + z) * (fx + fy + fz)
                    if abs(lhs - rhs) > 1e-8:
                        return False
    return True

# Enumerate and print constant solutions c
for c in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
    if check_constant(c):
        print(f"Constant solution: f(x) = {c}")

# Enumerate and print linear solutions kx
for k in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
    if check_linear(k):
        print(f"Linear solution: f(x) = {k} * x")
