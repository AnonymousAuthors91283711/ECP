This problem involves a functional equation with several variables and a set of functions satisfying a particular relation. Since the goal is to enumerate possible functions \( f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) that satisfy the given relation, and the instruction emphasizes enumeration with small sample values, the typical approach is to consider candidate functions like linear functions \( f(x) = ax + b \), constants, or perhaps specific known solutions that are easy to test.

The functional equation is:
\[ f(f x + f y + f z) = f(f x - f y) + f(2 x y + f z) + 2 f(x z - y z) \]

Given the complexity, an effective approach is to test particular types of functions:
- constant functions \( f(x) = c \)
- linear functions \( f(x) = a x \)
- and maybe the zero function as a trivial candidate.

The program will:
- Define a small sample for \( x, y, z \) (e.g., \(-1, 0, 1\))
- Check candidate functions on these samples
- Print those that satisfy the equation exactly for all combinations tested

This approach may not find all solutions but will help discover some, fulfilling the enumeration task. 

```python
# Enumerate simple candidate functions and test them on small sample points to identify solutions.
# We test constant and linear functions for simplicity.

def test_function(f, test_points):
    # Verify the functional equation on all combinations of test points
    for x in test_points:
        for y in test_points:
            for z in test_points:
                lhs = f(f(x) + f(y) + f(z))
                rhs = f(f(x) - f(y)) + f(2 * x * y + f(z)) + 2 * f(x * z - y * z)
                if abs(lhs - rhs) > 1e-9:
                    return False
    return True

# Sample points to test
sample_points = [-1, 0, 1]

# Candidate functions
candidates = []

# Constant functions c = 0, 1, -1, 2, -2
for c in [0, 1, -1, 2, -2]:
    def c_func(x, c=c): return c
    if test_function(c_func, sample_points):
        print(f'Constant f(x)={c} fits on sample points.')

# Linear functions f(x)=a*x for a in -2,-1,0,1,2
for a in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
    def lin_func(x, a=a): return a * x
    if test_function(lin_func, sample_points):
        print(f'Linear f(x)={a}*x fits on sample points.')

# Zero function
def zero_func(x): return 0
if test_function(zero_func, sample_points):
    print("Zero function f(x)=0 fits on sample points.")
```
