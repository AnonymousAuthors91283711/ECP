The problem is about a Fibonacci-like sequence \( F \) with given initial values and a recurrence, and it seeks the least positive integer \( m \) such that:
- \( F(m) \equiv 0 \pmod{127} \)
- \( F(m+1) \equiv 1 \pmod{127} \).

This effectively asks for the first \( m > 0 \) where the sequence modulo 127 hits the pair (0, 1). Since the sequence is akin to Fibonacci numbers modulo a prime, the sequence of pairs \( (F(n), F(n+1)) \pmod{127} \) eventually repeats with a period called the Pisano period. For small moduli like 127, we can compute this period explicitly.

The approach:
- Generate Fibonacci numbers modulo 127 until the pair (0, 1) occurs, marking the start.
- Record each pair, and the first time the pair (0, 1) appears again is the period.
- The first occurrence after the initial pair (since the first is at n=0, with F0=0 and F1=1) that satisfies the pair (0,1) with m > 0 will be our answer.

Here's the Python code that efficiently finds that minimal m:

```python
# The code finds the first m > 0 where Fibonacci sequence mod 127 hits (0, 1)
# which indicates the start of a new cycle in the Pisano period.

MOD = 127
F_prev, F_curr = 0, 1
seen_pairs = {(F_prev, F_curr): 0}
m = 1  # start from index 1

while True:
    F_next = (F_prev + F_curr) % MOD
    m += 1
    pair = (F_curr, F_next)
    if pair == (0, 1):
        print(m - 1)  # m-1 because we want the index where pair (0,1) first occurs after initial
        break
    if pair in seen_pairs:
        # cycle detected, but the (0,1) pair should have appeared before
        # just continue until found
        pass
    else:
        seen_pairs[pair] = m
    F_prev, F_curr = F_curr, F_next
```
