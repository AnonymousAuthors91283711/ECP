[write_program]
This problem involves finding the greatest possible value of a certain rational expression involving positive integers \(a'\) and \(b'\), under the constraint that \(\frac{a' b' + 1}{a' + b'} < \frac{3}{2}\).

Given the nature of the question, a practical approach is to systematically enumerate small positive integer pairs \((a', b')\) that satisfy the given inequality, compute the value:
\[
r = \frac{a'^3 b'^3 + 1}{a'^3 + b'^3}
\]
and track the maximum such value. This will assist in conjecturing the answer, as larger values tend to come from larger inputs, so we focus on small candidates first for efficiency.

The program will:
- Set small bounds for \(a'\) and \(b'\) (e.g., 1 to 20).
- For each pair, verify the inequality.
- Compute \(r\) and print it if it satisfies the inequality.
- Track the maximum \(r\) found.

Here's the implementation:

```python
# Enumerate small positive integer pairs (a', b') satisfying the inequality:
# (a' * b' + 1) / (a' + b') < 3/2
# and compute r = (a'^3 * b'^3 + 1) / (a'^3 + b'^3)
# to find possible answers for the problem.

max_r = -1
max_pair = (0, 0)

for a in range(1, 21):
    for b in range(1, 21):
        numerator = a * b + 1
        denominator = a + b
        if numerator / denominator < 1.5:
            a_cubed = a ** 3
            b_cubed = b ** 3
            r_num = a_cubed * b_cubed + 1
            r_den = a_cubed + b_cubed
            r = r_num / r_den
            print(f"a={a}, b={b}, r={(r_num)}/{(r_den)} = {r}")
            if r > max_r:
                max_r = r
                max_pair = (a, b)

print(f"Maximum r found: a={max_pair[0]}, b={max_pair[1]}, r={max_r}")
```

This code will print all candidate values, helping to analyze and conjecture the maximum possible \(r\).
