The problem involves solving the quadratic equation \( 2x^2 = 9x - 4 \) under the condition \( x \neq 4 \). The goal is to find the possible values of \( 2x \).

To assist in conjecturing the true answer, we'll:
- Solve the quadratic equation \( 2x^2 - 9x + 4 = 0 \) for small rational values.
- Exclude the root \( x = 4 \).
- Enumerate possible solutions for \( 2x \), streaming answers as soon as they are identified.

Since \( 2x^2 - 9x + 4 = 0 \), the roots are \( x = \frac{9 \pm \sqrt{81 - 32}}{4} = \frac{9 \pm \sqrt{49}}{4} = \frac{9 \pm 7}{4} \). The roots are \( x = 4 \) and \( x = \frac{1}{2} \).

Given \( x \neq 4 \), the remaining solution is \( x = \frac{1}{2} \). The corresponding \( 2x = 2 \times \frac{1}{2} = 1 \).

We can conclude the only possible value for \( 2x \) (other than excluded root) is 1.

```python
# Enumerate potential solutions for x and 2*x based on the quadratic
# Roots are x=4 (excluded), and x=1/2
solutions = [0.5]  # only x=1/2 remains after exclusion
for x in solutions:
    result = 2 * x
    print(result)
```
