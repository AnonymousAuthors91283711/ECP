Ground Truth Answer: 2/3
Proposed Answer: 5/9
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. First, let's solve the equation from the hypothesis:
   4x + 20 + 140 = 360
   => 4x + 160 = 360
   => 4x = 200
   => x = 50

2. Now plug x=50 into the expression (4*x)/360:
   (4*50)/360 = 200/360 = 5/9

3. The ground truth answer is given as 2/3, which equals 240/360, not 200/360.

4. The proposed answer is 5/9, which correctly matches our calculation.

The ground truth answer appears to be incorrect, while the proposed answer is correct.
