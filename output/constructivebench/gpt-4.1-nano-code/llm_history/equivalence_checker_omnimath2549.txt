Ground Truth Answer: fun k n => if k > 1 ∧ n > 1 then k * n else k + n
Proposed Answer: fun k n => max 1 (k + n - 1)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the minimal size d such that for any finite set S of points in ℝⁿ, if every "generic" affine hyperplane (those with full-dimensional direction) intersects S in all but fewer than k points, then there exists a subset T ⊆ S with similar properties but size ≤ d.

2. The ground truth answer suggests:
   - For k > 1 and n > 1: k * n
   - Otherwise: k + n

3. The proposed answer suggests: max 1 (k + n - 1)

Comparison:
- For k=1 or n=1: Both answers give k + n (since max 1 (k+n-1) = k+n when k+n-1 ≥1, which is true when either k or n is ≥1)
- For k=2, n=2: Ground truth gives 4, proposed gives 3
- For k=3, n=2: Ground truth gives 6, proposed gives 4

The answers clearly differ for k,n > 1 cases. The proposed answer grows linearly with k+n while the ground truth grows multiplicatively.
