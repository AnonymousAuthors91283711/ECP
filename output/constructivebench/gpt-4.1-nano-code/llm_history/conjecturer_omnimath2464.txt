theorem omnimath2464 :
  (∫ t in Icc 0 2, (if t ≤ 0.25 then 50 else if t ≤ 0.5 then 50 - 60*(t - 0.25) else 0) * (1/2)) = omnimath2464_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Approximate integral: 4.6875. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The integral segments form a piecewise linear function, with the area summing to a combined constant. The total integral simplifies to a sum of trapezoids: (Region 1) 0.25 * 50 / 2, (Region 2) 0.25 * 50 / 2, and (Region 3) a triangle area corresponding to the linear decay. Summing these yields 4.6875. 

Answer:
<<<(50 * 0.25 / 2) + (50 * 0.25 / 2) + (0.5 * 60 * 0.25^2)>>>, which simplifies to 4.6875
