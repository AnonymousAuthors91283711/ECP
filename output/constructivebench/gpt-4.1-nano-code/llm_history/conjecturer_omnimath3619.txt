The recurrence resembles a pattern where the sequence terms relate to perfect squares of a linear form involving a. Based on typical forms derived from such recurrence relations, the set of all a such that 2 * recurrenceSequence a n - 1 is a perfect square appears to be those a for which the initial terms produce the sequence of squares offset by 1. The pattern suggests that a reduces to specific quadratic expressions, with solutions like 0 and 1.
