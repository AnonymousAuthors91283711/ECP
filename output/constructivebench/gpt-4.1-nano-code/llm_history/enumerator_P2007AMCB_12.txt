The problem involves a total number of students, seniors' average score, and overall average score. The goal appears to be to determine some value related to juniors' scores, possibly to verify or find the sum or average for juniors, given constraints, and the number of students is divisible by 10.

I will generate candidate values for the juniors' sum of scores, given the constraints, by iterating over plausible parameters and printing those where the equations hold, especially focusing on the relation:

\[ \text{overallAvg} \times \text{totalStudents} = \text{seniorsAvg} \times \text{seniorsCount} + P2007AMCB_12_answer \]

You asked for immediate output of each candidate answer, so I will enumerate possible seniors' and overall averages under reasonable bounds, and compute the juniors' sum accordingly. Since the problem relates to averages, the key is to consider that scores are integers, and the averages are tied to total sums.

Here's the code implementation:

```python
# Enumerate plausible values for totalStudents, seniorsAvg, overallAvg
# Assume score values are small integers for demonstration
for totalStudents in range(10, 101, 10):  # total students in steps of 10
    juniorsCount = totalStudents // 10
    seniorsCount = 9 * totalStudents // 10
    for seniorsAvg in range(0, 101):  # seniors' average score
        for overallAvg in range(0, 101):  # overall average score
            # Check the key inequality:
            # 9 * totalStudents / 10 * seniorsAvg <= overallAvg * totalStudents
            # avoids floating point, using integer multiplication
            lhs = 9 * totalStudents * seniorsAvg
            rhs = 10 * overallAvg * totalStudents
            if lhs <= rhs:
                # compute the total sum of scores
                total_score = overallAvg * totalStudents
                # seniors total
                seniors_total = seniorsAvg * seniorsCount
                # juniors total
                juniors_total = total_score - seniors_total
                # P2007AMCB_12_answer: juniors' total score
                print(f"totalStudents={totalStudents}, seniorsAvg={seniorsAvg}, overallAvg={overallAvg}")
                print(f"Juniors' total score: {juniors_total}")
```
