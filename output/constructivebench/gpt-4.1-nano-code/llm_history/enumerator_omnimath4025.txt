The problem involves exploring pairs of positive integers (x, y) with a specific divisibility and coprimality condition involving their cubes. To assist in understanding the set described by the theorem, we'll enumerate small pairs (x, y) with x > 0 and y > 0, check the divisibility conditions, and then analyze the related divisibility condition involving gcds.

We will:
- Choose small positive integers for x and y.
- Compute x^3 + y^3.
- For each pair, find all divisors a, b > 0 of x^3 + y^3.
- For each such pair (a, b) with gcd(a, b) = 1, verify whether a + b - 1 divides x^3 + y^3.
- Collect pairs (x, y) that satisfy the complex condition for some divisors.

This exploration is computationally feasible with small bounds and helps conjecture the set in question.

```python
# Enumerate small pairs (x, y) and check the conditions
from math import gcd, sqrt

limit = 10  # small bounds for explicit enumeration
results = []

for x in range(1, limit + 1):
    for y in range(1, limit + 1):
        sum_cubes = x ** 3 + y ** 3
        divisors = [d for d in range(1, sum_cubes + 1) if sum_cubes % d == 0]
        condition_holds = False

        for a in divisors:
            for b in divisors:
                if gcd(a, b) == 1:
                    if (sum_cubes % (a + b - 1)) == 0:
                        condition_holds = True
                        break
            if condition_holds:
                break

        if condition_holds:
            print(f"Pair (x={x}, y={y}), sum of cubes={sum_cubes}")
            results.append((x, y, sum_cubes))

# Output the pairs satisfying the condition
print("Pairs satisfying the divisibility condition with coprime divisors:")
for (x, y, s) in results:
    print(f"({x}, {y}) with x^3 + y^3 = {s}")
```
