The problem involves two meeting times expressed in minutes, where the first meeting is at 45 minutes, and the second meeting occurs twice as late as the first. We need to evaluate the sum of their times divided by 9 and find the answer. The task is straightforward: compute with the known values directly.

Here's how the calculation proceeds:
- `first_meeting = 45/60 = 0.75` hours
- `second_meeting = 2 * first_meeting = 2 * 0.75 = 1.5` hours
- Sum: `0.75 + 1.5 = 2.25`
- Divide by 9: `2.25 / 9 = 0.25`

So, the answer is 0.25 hours, or in hours format.

The program will compute these steps explicitly, and print the answer without hardcoding, in compliance with the requirements.

```python
# Program computes the times and prints the result directly
def main():
    # Given values
    first_meeting = 45 / 60  # convert minutes to hours
    second_meeting = 2 * first_meeting

    # Compute the sum
    total_time = first_meeting + second_meeting

    # Divide by 9
    result = total_time / 9

    # Print the computed answer
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
