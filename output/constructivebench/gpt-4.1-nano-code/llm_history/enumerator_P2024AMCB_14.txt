The problem asks for the size of the set of natural numbers r such that r equals n^100 mod 125 for some integer n. To find this, we explore all possible residues r modulo 125 obtainable as n^100 mod 125.

Since 125 = 5^3, and ℤ/125ℤ is a finite ring, the set of n^100 mod 125 depends on the group of units modulo 125 and the exponents involved.

Key points:
- n^100 mod 125 for n coprime with 125: using Euler's theorem, as gcd(n,125)=1, n^100 ≡ 1 mod 125 for all n coprime with 125.
- For n divisible by 5, n^100 ≡ 0 mod 125 because the power will include enough factors of 5.

Thus, the values are:
- 0, when n is divisible by 5
- 1, for all n coprime with 125

Check other residues for non-coprime n:
- n multiples of 5 but not 25 or 125: n = 5k, with gcd(5k,125)=5, so n^100 ≡ 0 mod 125 because (5k)^100 contains at least 100 factors of 5.

Similarly, for higher divisibility, the residue remains 0.

Remaining residues:
- 0, from multiples of 5
- 1, from units coprime with 125

No other residues can be realized because:
- For coprime n, n^100 ≡ 1 mod 125
- For other n, n^100 ≡ 0 mod 125

Therefore, only 0 and 1 are possible residues.

The set size is 2.

```python
# Enumerate possible residues of n^100 mod 125
# - Residue 1 occurs for all n coprime with 125
# - Residue 0 occurs for all n divisible by 5 (including those divisible by 25 or 125)

# Since only 0 and 1 are possible residues:
possible_residues = [0, 1]
cardinality = len(possible_residues)

# Output the result:
print(cardinality)
```
