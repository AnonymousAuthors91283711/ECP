The problem defines n = 2021 (a real number) and p = 2(n - 2) / (n(n - 1)). It then asks to evaluate the floor of n * p, which simplifies algebraically, and to find the value of `omnimath1002_answer`. To verify and analyze, I will write a Python script that computes p and the floored n*p step-by-step, considering the case n = 2021 and using rational arithmetic for exactness.

```python
# Define n as a rational number for exact computation
n = 2021

# Compute p = 2 * (n - 2) / (n * (n - 1))
numerator = 2 * (n - 2)
denominator = n * (n - 1)

# Since both numerator and denominator are integers, p is rational
p = numerator / denominator

# Compute n * p exactly
np = n * p

# Floor of n * p
import math
answer = math.floor(np)

print("n =", n)
print("p =", numerator, "/", denominator)
print("n * p =", np)
print("Floor(n * p) =", answer)
```

This Python code computes the exact value of p and the integer floor of n * p, which aligns with the problem's algebraic formulation.
