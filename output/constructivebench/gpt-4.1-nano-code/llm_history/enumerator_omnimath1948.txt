This problem appears to be about finding the smallest set \( S \subseteq \mathbb{N} \) (the set of non-negative integers) that contains the value 100 and has the property that the set of all possible sums of nonempty subsets of a specific finite set of "coins" equals the interval \([1, S]\). In other words, the set of all possible subset sums from the selected coins is exactly all integers from 1 up to \( S \).

Our goal: To find the minimal \( S \) such that:
- There exists a nonempty set of coins (with positive, distinct integers), including 100,
- The subset sums cover exactly the interval \([1, S]\).

Given the complexity, we will:
- Focus on small, manageable guesses for coin sets,
- Enumerate possible coin sets including 100,
- For each candidate, compute all subset sums, and check the coverage of \([1, \max \text{ sum}]\),
- Find the minimal such maximum sum \( S \),
- Report the first such minimal value.

Here's an efficient way to approach the enumeration:

```python
from itertools import combinations, chain

# Generate all subsets of a set as lists, including the empty set
def all_subsets(s):
    return chain.from_iterable(combinations(s, r) for r in range(1, len(s)+1))

# Check if subset sums of coins cover [1, S]
def check_coins(coins):
    sums = set(sum(subset) for subset in all_subsets(coins))
    max_sum = max(sums)
    return sums, max_sum

# Enumerate small coin sets including 100, with increasing size
# Focus on small coins and minimal total sum
minimal_S = None
best_coins = None

# To keep it tractable, limit total coins to size 3 or 4
# First, try all pairs including 100
for c in range(1, 51):  # small coin values
    coins = {100, c}
    sums, max_sum = check_coins(coins)
    if sums == set(range(1, max_sum+1)):
        print(f"Coins: {coins} => S = {max_sum}")
        if minimal_S is None or max_sum < minimal_S:
            minimal_S = max_sum
            best_coins = coins

# Next, try triples including 100
for c1 in range(1, 31):
    for c2 in range(c1+1, 51):
        coins = {100, c1, c2}
        sums, max_sum = check_coins(coins)
        if sums == set(range(1, max_sum+1)):
            print(f"Coins: {coins} => S = {max_sum}")
            if minimal_S is None or max_sum < minimal_S:
                minimal_S = max_sum
                best_coins = coins

# Output the minimal S found
if minimal_S is not None:
    print(f"Minimal S: {minimal_S} with coins {best_coins}")
else:
    print("No suitable small coin set found within search bounds.")
```
