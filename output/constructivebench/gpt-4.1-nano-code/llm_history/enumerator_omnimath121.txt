The problem appears to involve classifying solutions to a functional equation involving the function \(f:\mathbb{N}^+ \to \mathbb{R}\), under a condition relating \(f(k + m)\), \(f(k)\), and \(f(m)\), with a parameter \(\alpha\).

Analyzing the constraints:
- The functional equation is:
  \[
  \text{if } (\alpha m \le k \le (\alpha + 1)m ) \text{ then } f(k + m) = f(k) + f(m)
  \]
- \(\alpha > 0\), given.

Given the complexity, a standard approach involves testing specific values of \(\alpha\), such as \(\alpha=1\) (which simplifies the interval to \(m \le k \le 2m\)) and \(\alpha=0.5\), to see how solutions behave.

The goal is to enumerate solutions \(f\) as those proportional to a "parameter" \(c\), i.e., \(f(n) = c \cdot g(n)\), where \(g(n)\) might be some archetype function satisfying the functional equation.

Since the problem involves a parameter \(\alpha\) and the solutions are tied via an existence statement involving \(c\), we can proceed by fixing some small values of \(\alpha\), and enumerating possible functions \(f\) on small \(n\) satisfying the condition and seeing patterns.

Below is an implementation that:
- Chooses specific \(\alpha\) values (e.g., 1, 0.5)
- Checks possible functions \(f(n)\) on the first few natural numbers
- Looks for solutions with linear form \(f(n) = c \cdot n\)
- Reports candidate functions that satisfy the conditions for these \(\alpha\)

The code follows these guidelines:
- It simulates the functional equation on small \(n\)
- Prints candidate functions immediately when found
- Prioritizes simple, linear solutions to test the conjecture.

```python
# Program to explore solutions for functional equation for specific alpha values
# on small â„•+.

import itertools

# Define small sample parameters
alpha_values = [1.0, 0.5]
max_n = 10
candidate_range = [-10, -5, 0, 5, 10]

def check_solution(f_values, alpha):
    # Check the functional equation conditions for all k, m in [1, max_n]
    for m in range(1, max_n + 1):
        for k in range(1, max_n + 1):
            # Check if the interval condition holds
            if alpha * m <= k <= (alpha + 1) * m:
                # Compute f(k+m) if within range
                sum_idx = k + m
                if sum_idx > max_n:
                    continue
                # For each candidate, verify the functional relation
                if abs(f_values.get(k + m, 0) - (f_values.get(k,0) + f_values.get(m,0))) > 1e-6:
                    return False
    return True

for alpha in alpha_values:
    print(f"Checking for alpha = {alpha}")
    # Assume linear form: f(n) = c * n
    for c in candidate_range:
        f_values = {}
        for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
            f_values[n] = c * n
        # Verify the functional equation with this form
        if check_solution(f_values, alpha):
            print(f"Found candidate solution f(n) = {c} * n for alpha = {alpha}")
            print(f"f: {[f_values[n] for n in range(1, max_n+1)]}")
```
