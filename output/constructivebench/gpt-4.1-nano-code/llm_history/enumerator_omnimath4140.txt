This is a recursive sequence defined with a linear recurrence relation, and the sum involves terms at powers of 2. To conjecture the sum, we can:

- Compute the first several terms of the sequence F(n).
- Sum the reciprocals 1 / F(2^n) for n in a small range.
- Observe the pattern or approach a convergence value.

Note:
- The sequence F(n) is defined recursively, with initial terms explicitly given.
- We need to generate sequence values at powers of 2: F(2^0), F(2^1), F(2^2), etc.

Since the problem wants partial enumeration, the code will:

1. Generate F(n) for n up to, say, 2^10 at least.
2. Sum 1 / F(2^n) for n within this range.
3. Print each partial sum immediately.

Here's the Python code:

```python
# Compute F(n) based on the recursive relation
def compute_F(n, memo={}):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    if n == 0:
        val = 0
    elif n == 1:
        val = 3/2
    else:
        val = (5/2) * compute_F(n-1, memo) - compute_F(n-2, memo)
    memo[n] = val
    return val

# Sum reciprocals at power-of-two indices
max_power = 10  # can increase for more accuracy
total_sum = 0
for n in range(max_power + 1):
    index = 2 ** n
    F_val = compute_F(index)
    reciprocal = 1 / F_val
    total_sum += reciprocal
    print(f"n={index}, F(2^{n})={F_val:.6f}, sum={total_sum:.6f}")
```

This code computes F(n) recursively with memoization and sums reciprocals of F at powers of two, printing each partial sum as soon as it is computed. This approach supports conjecturing about the total sum and inferring whether it converges.
