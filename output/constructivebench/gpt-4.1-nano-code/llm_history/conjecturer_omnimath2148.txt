abbrev omnimath2148_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath2148 :
  IsLeast
    {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ ∃ k : ℤ, k = Real.sqrt (100 + Real.sqrt n) + Real.sqrt (100 - Real.sqrt n)}
    omnimath2148_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 154. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern shows the answer is centered around the value 154, which corresponds to the minimal n satisfying the conditions (since 0 < n and involving nested square roots leading to a specific solution). Given the enumeration, the answer is a fixed constant point satisfying the minimal condition. 

<<<154>>>
