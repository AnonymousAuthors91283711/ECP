The problem appears to involve a matrix \( M \) with entries bounded below by \(\max(i + 1, j + 1)\). We need to determine the minimal possible sum \( \sum_{i,j} M_{i,j} \) satisfying this lower bound and characterize it as the "answer." Since the problem is in Lean, but here we need to enumerate possible answers (likely minimal sums), I will focus on the minimal total sum given the lower bounds and verify if the sum can be less or equal to a certain value.

Our approach:
- We will consider the minimal sum by setting entries exactly at their lower bounds, i.e., \( M_{i,j} = \max(i+1, j+1) \).
- Then, we will verify the sum, thus computing a candidate answer.
- Because the bounds are explicit and small (indices from 0 to 7), we will directly compute the sum for the minimal configuration.
- For demonstration, we will slightly vary parameters to find minimal sums if needed. But since the problem constrains entries below the bounds, the minimal sum occurs at the bounds.

```python
# The bounds are M_{i,j} >= max(i+1, j+1) for i,j in 0..7
# We compute the minimal sum by setting M_{i,j} = max(i+1, j+1)

def main():
    max_sum = 0
    minimal_value_for_element = []
    # For i,j in 0..7
    for i in range(8):
        for j in range(8):
            val = max(i+1, j+1)
            max_sum += val
            minimal_value_for_element.append(val)
            print(val)  # stream partial results
    
    print("Minimal total sum:", max_sum)
    # The minimal configuration respects the bounds; so answer is max_sum
    print("Answer:", max_sum)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
