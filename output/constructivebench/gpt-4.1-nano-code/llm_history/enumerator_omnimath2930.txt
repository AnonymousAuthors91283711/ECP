The problem involves simplifying or calculating the expression \(\frac{1 + (3 \times 5)}{2}\). Observing the expression, it involves basic arithmetic operations. The expected approach is to evaluate this expression and provide possible answers (likely just one exact answer in this case). To assist in conjecturing, we'll write a Python program that enumerates simple rational solutions for similar expressions, printing each candidate answer immediately.

No parameters, straightforward calculation: \(\frac{1 + 15}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8\). The task is to demonstrate this step-by-step by enumerating and confirming the exact value.

```python
# Enumerate all rational candidates within a small range to confirm the answer
for numerator in range(1, 100):
    for denominator in range(1, 100):
        answer = numerator / denominator
        # Check if answer equals (1 + 3*5) / 2, which is 8
        if answer == 8:
            print(f"{numerator}/{denominator} = {answer}")  # Exact answer
        # For completeness, also print approximations if close
        elif abs(answer - 8) < 0.1:
            print(f"Approximate: {numerator}/{denominator} â‰ˆ {answer}")
```
