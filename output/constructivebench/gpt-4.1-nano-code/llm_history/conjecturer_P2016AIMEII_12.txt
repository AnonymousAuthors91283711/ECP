The problem counts permutations of a 6-length cycle with no consecutive equal images, akin to derangements on a cycle. The pattern suggests for a cycle of length 6 over 4 colors, the count resembles 4 × 3^5, considering fixing the first element and choosing subsequent images avoiding consecutive repeats. 

Final answer: 
<<<4 * 3^5>>>
