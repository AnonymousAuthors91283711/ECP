theorem P2022AMCB_9 :
  IsLeast {a₂ : ℕ | ∃ (d : ℕ) (a₀ : ℕ), 0 < d ∧ 0 < a₀ ∧ 
    (∀ n, a₀ + n * d < a₀ + (n + 1) * d) ∧ 
    a₀ + 7 * d - 27 = log 2 (a₀ + 7 * d) ∧ 
    a₂ = a₀ + 2 * d} 
  P2022AMCB_9_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found candidate: a0=4, d=4, a2=12
Found candidate: a0=11, d=3, a2=17
Found candidate: a0=18, d=2, a2=22
Found candidate: a0=25, d=1, a2=27
The minimal a2 satisfying conditions is 12. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The minimal a₂ is 12 when a₀=4, d=4.  
General form: a₂ = a₀ + 2 * d, with minimal a₂.  
The minimal a₂ occurs when a₀=4, d=4, giving a₂ = 12.  

Answer: <<<12>>>
