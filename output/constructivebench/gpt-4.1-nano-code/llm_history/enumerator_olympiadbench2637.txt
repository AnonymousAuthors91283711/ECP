This problem involves summing the reciprocals of the divisors of 24 (excluding zero). To verify the sum, let's enumerate all positive divisors of 24, compute the sum of their reciprocals, and provide a precise answer.

The divisors of 24 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24.  
The sum of their reciprocals is: 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/6 + 1/8 + 1/12 + 1/24.

Calculating this sum exactly, to confirm it's a rational number, and then using Python to verify and print it:

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# List of divisors of 24 (excluding zero, which is not a divisor)
divisors = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24]

# Sum of reciprocals as a Fraction for exactness
sum_reciprocals = sum(Fraction(1, d) for d in divisors)

# Print the sum as a fraction
print(f"Sum of reciprocals of divisors of 24: {sum_reciprocals}")
```
