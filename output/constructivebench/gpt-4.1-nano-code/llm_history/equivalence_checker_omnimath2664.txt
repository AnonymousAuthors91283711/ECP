Ground Truth Answer: 4180
Proposed Answer: 16 * 2^4 + 64 + 4 + 4096
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines 4 pairs and maps each pair (x,y) to 2^(2*y)
2. The pairs and their corresponding values are:
   - (1,6) → 2^(2*6) = 2^12 = 4096
   - (2,3) → 2^(2*3) = 2^6 = 64
   - (3,2) → 2^(2*2) = 2^4 = 16
   - (6,1) → 2^(2*1) = 2^2 = 4
3. The sum is 4096 + 64 + 16 + 4 = 4180 (ground truth)
4. The proposed answer is: 16 * 2^4 + 64 + 4 + 4096
   - 16 * 2^4 = 16 * 16 = 256
   - So total would be 256 + 64 + 4 + 4096 = 4420 ≠ 4180

The proposed answer incorrectly calculates 16 * 2^4 instead of just adding 16. The expressions are not equivalent.
