This task appears to be a formal statement possibly related to polynomial evaluations and their properties over ℝ with integer-coefficient polynomials. The core is to analyze when the product of evaluations corresponds to an integer evaluation of the polynomial. Since the problem is abstract and involves quantifiers, I'll generate specific small polynomials and evaluate the property for pairs of real numbers, then identify all possible outputs where the evaluations produce integers, and check if their product's evaluation is also an integer.

Here's an approach:
- Use small polynomials with integer coefficients (like constants, monomials).
- For small rational, real sample points, evaluate the polynomial.
- Check if both are integers, list the evaluations, and verify the existence of an integer evaluation at the product.
- List all such cases for a small set of sample points, then conjecture the set of polynomials satisfying the property.

This approach provides insights into the structure without overly complex computation, and fits within the output tokens limit.

```python
# Enumerate small polynomials over ℤ[X], sample real evaluation points, and check the property.
import itertools

# Sample polynomials with small coefficients: constant, linear, quadratic.
coeffs = list(range(-2, 3))
polynomials = []

# Generate polynomials of degree 0, 1, 2 with small integer coefficients
for c in coeffs:
    polynomials.append(lambda x, c=c: c)  # constant
for a in coeffs:
    for b in coeffs:
        polynomials.append(lambda x, a=a, b=b: a*x + b)
for a in coeffs:
    for b in coeffs:
        for c in coeffs:
            polynomials.append(lambda x, a=a, b=b, c=c: a*x**2 + b*x + c)

# Sample points: small rationals/integers within [-2, 2]
sample_points = [-2.0, -1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 2.0]

# Function to evaluate polynomial with error handling
def evaluate(poly, x):
    try:
        return poly(x)
    except:
        return None

# Collect polynomials satisfying the property
answers = set()

for p in polynomials:
    for s in sample_points:
        for t in sample_points:
            val_s = evaluate(p, s)
            val_t = evaluate(p, t)
            if val_s is None or val_t is None:
                continue
            # Check if evaluations are close to integers
            m = round(val_s)
            n = round(val_t)
            if abs(val_s - m) < 1e-6 and abs(val_t - n) < 1e-6:
                # Check if eval at s*t yields integer
                val_st = evaluate(p, s * t)
                if val_st is not None:
                    k = round(val_st)
                    if abs(val_st - k) < 1e-6:
                        # Conditions satisfied, record polynomial and product k
                        answers.add((p, s, t, m, n, k))
                        print(f"Polynomial with coefficients approximated by function: {p}")
                        print(f"At s={s}, t={t}: eval = ({val_s:.2f}), ({val_t:.2f}), product eval={val_st:.2f} -> integers ({m},{n},{k})")
# The set 'answers' contains candidates; here we just output the results directly.
