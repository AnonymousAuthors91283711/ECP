. Enumerated answers: (1, 7)
(5, 5)
(7, 1). Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The solutions correspond to pairs of positive integers with a^2 + b^2 = 50. The pairs are (1,7), (5,5), and (7,1). The non-symmetric pairs can be consolidated into ranges, considering symmetry and positivity. The unique sum of squares covering these pairs is when a and b satisfy 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 7, with the specific solutions (1,7), (5,5), and (7,1). Since the problem asks for a closed form in ℕ, counting these solutions: 3. Thus, the answer reflects the total count of solutions, which is 3.
