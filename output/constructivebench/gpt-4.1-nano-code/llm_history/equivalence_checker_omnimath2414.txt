Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: 180
<<<True>>>
The problem gives specific values for burgers (5), sides (3), and drinks (12), and asks for the product of these three numbers. The calculation is straightforward: 5 * 3 * 12 = 180. The proposed answer correctly computes this product, so it is equivalent to the ground truth answer.
