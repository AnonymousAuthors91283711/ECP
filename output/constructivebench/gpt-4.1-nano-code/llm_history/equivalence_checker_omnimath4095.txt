Ground Truth Answer: fun n => n / 2 + 1
Proposed Answer: fun n => n - 2
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the smallest degree k for regular graphs of order n (where n ≥ 3) that guarantees the existence of a triangle (3 vertices all connected to each other).

2. The ground truth answer is `n/2 + 1`, which is correct based on known graph theory results (this is related to the friendship theorem and degree conditions for triangle existence).

3. The proposed answer is `n - 2`. Let's test this with some values:
   - For n=3: ground truth gives 2 (correct, as any 2-regular graph on 3 vertices is a triangle), proposed gives 1 (incorrect, as 1-regular graph on 3 vertices is just a matching with no triangle)
   - For n=4: ground truth gives 3 (correct, as 3-regular graph on 4 vertices is K4 which has triangles), proposed gives 2 (incorrect, as 2-regular graph on 4 vertices could be a square with no triangles)
   - For n=5: ground truth gives 3 (correct), proposed gives 3 (correct in this case, but by coincidence)

The proposed answer only matches the ground truth when n=5, and is incorrect for smaller values. The pattern shows they are not equivalent.
