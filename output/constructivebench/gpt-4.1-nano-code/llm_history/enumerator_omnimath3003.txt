To assist with guessing the value of \( x \) from the equation \( 2x - 3 = 10 \), we can solve this directly. Since the instructions specify enumerating candidate answers and streaming each result, we'll generate potential solutions for \( x \) and compute \( 4x \) accordingly. We'll include small sample values close to the algebraic solution to help recognize the true answer.

```python
# Algebraic solution: x = (10 + 3) / 2 = 13/2 = 6.5
# We will evaluate x candidates around 6.5 to consider approximate and exact forms

# List of candidate x values
candidates = [
    6.4, 6.5, 6.6,            # close approximations
    13/2,                     # exact algebraic form
    6 + 1/2,                  # alternative expression
]

for x in candidates:
    result = 4 * x
    print(f"x = {x} => 4 * x = {result}")
```
