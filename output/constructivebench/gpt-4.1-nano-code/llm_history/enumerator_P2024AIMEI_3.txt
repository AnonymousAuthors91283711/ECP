The problem involves counting how many integers from 0 up to 2024 (inclusive) are divisible by 5 or have a remainder of 2 when divided by 5. Since the set is ranges from 0 to 2024, we need to find the size of the set {n | 0 ≤ n ≤ 2024 and (n % 5 = 0 or n % 5 = 2)}.

Strategy:
- Count how many numbers are divisible by 5 within 0 to 2024.
- Count how many numbers leave a remainder 2 when divided by 5 in the same range.
- Use inclusion-exclusion to avoid double counting (which won't occur here because the remainders are distinct).

Counting numbers divisible by 5:
- Numbers divisible by 5 within 0..2024 are: 0, 5, 10, ..., 2020.
- Count: (2024 // 5) + 1 (because 0 counts as well).

Counting numbers with remainder 2:
- Numbers like 2, 7, 12, ..., up to n ≤ 2024.
- The largest n such that n ≡ 2 (mod 5) and n ≤ 2024:
  n = 2 + 5k ≤ 2024
  5k ≤ 2022
  k ≤ 404.4, so k=404
- Total count: k+1 = 405.

Total count:
= count_divisible_by_5 + count_remainder_2
= (2024 // 5) + 1 + 405

Let's compute and output this answer directly.

```python
# Count numbers in 0..2024 divisible by 5
count_divisible_by_5 = 2024 // 5 + 1  # includes 0
# Count numbers in 0..2024 with remainder 2 when divided by 5
# largest n ≡ 2 mod 5 ≤ 2024
count_remainder_2 = ((2024 - 2) // 5) + 1  # includes 2

total_count = count_divisible_by_5 + count_remainder_2
print(total_count)
```
