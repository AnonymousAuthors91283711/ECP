This problem involves recursively defining a sequence \( x(n) \) with initial values and a relation involving \( x(n) \) and \( x(n+1) \). We are asked to find the number of terms within a range (from 2 to 2021) satisfying a specific algebraic condition, which presumably relates to some pattern or recurrence in \( x(n) \). Since the exact answer is to be discovered, I will implement the sequence calculation, test the relation, and count how many \( n \) satisfy it. To simplify, I will pick small initial parameters and directly compute, streaming results as I go.

Key observations:
- \( M(a,b) = \text{lcm}(a,b) / \gcd(a,b) \), which simplifies to \(\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)/\gcd(a,b)\);
- The recursive definition involves \( x(n+2) = M(n+1, x(n+1)) \);
- We'll set initial conditions \( x(0)=0, x(1)=1 \), then compute forward;
- For each \( n \), check if \( 5x(n)^2 + 5x(n+1)^2 = 26x(n)x(n+1) \) holds, count solutions;
- In the end, count the number of solutions in the range, i.e., for \( n \in [2, 2021] \).

Here's the code:

```python
# Compute the sequence x(n) based on the recursive definition
def M(a, b):
    from math import gcd
    return (a * b) // gcd(a, b)

def generate_sequence(max_n):
    x = [0, 1]  # initial values: x(0)=0, x(1)=1
    for n in range(1, max_n):
        x_next = M(n, x[n])
        x.append(x_next)
    return x

# Check the relation for each n
def check_condition(x, n):
    return 5 * x[n] ** 2 + 5 * x[n+1] ** 2 == 26 * x[n] * x[n+1]

# Count how many n satisfy the relation in [2, 2020]
N = 2021
seq = generate_sequence(N+1)
count = 0
for n in range(2, N+1):
    if check_condition(seq, n):
        print(f"n={n}, x(n)={seq[n]}, x(n+1)={seq[n+1]}")
        count += 1
print("Total solutions:", count)
```

This code computes the sequence, evaluates the relation, streams each solution, and finally prints the total count. It helps in conjecturing the count or pattern to identify the exact value.
