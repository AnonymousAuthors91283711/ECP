Given the pattern and the nature of the problem, the key is to determine the set of n where such a coloring exists with total = 2007. The total involves the sum of cubes of red and blue parts and a count of triples summing to 0 mod n.

Observation: For total = 2007, a natural candidate pattern is where n is divisible by 3, as the sum of the three elements mod n is central, and the total combinatorial sum relates to powers.

Conjecture: The set includes n divisible by 3, specifically n = 3.

Final answer:

<<<{3}>>>
