. Enumerated answers: (m, n) = (1, 2) satisfies: (1*2-1) divides (1^2 + 2^2)
(m, n) = (1, 3) satisfies: (1*3-1) divides (1^2 + 3^2)
(m, n) = (2, 1) satisfies: (2*1-1) divides (2^2 + 1^2)
(m, n) = (2, 9) satisfies: (2*9-1) divides (2^2 + 9^2)
(m, n) = (3, 1) satisfies: (3*1-1) divides (3^2 + 1^2)
(m, n) = (3, 14) satisfies: (3*14-1) divides (3^2 + 14^2)
(m, n) = (9, 2) satisfies: (9*2-1) divides (9^2 + 2^2)
(m, n) = (14, 3) satisfies: (14*3-1) divides (14^2 + 3^2). Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ)
The pattern suggests solutions with small m, n and their symmetric counterparts, primarily involving (1, n), (m, 1), and some special pairs like (2, 9) and (14, 3). The divisibility relies on (m*n - 1) dividing m^2 + n^2, which simplifies to specific algebraic relations. The set includes these solutions and related symmetric pairs.
