This problem involves an expression involving four positive real numbers (x1, x2, x3, x4) satisfying a certain constraint, and asks for an extremal (either minimal or maximal) value of a particular function. Since direct algebraic solutions might be complex or not straightforward, an effective way to gain insight is to consider small, specific sets of positive values satisfying the constraint, then evaluate the function for these and edge cases.

The key steps:
- Choose small positive values for x1, x2, x3, x4 that satisfy the given constraint.
- For each, compute f = x1/x2 + x2/x3 + x3/x4 + x4/x1.
- Collect and print these candidate values as they are found.

To keep the exploration concise, we:
- Generate quadruples with small positive numbers.
- Enforce the constraint.
- Avoid heavy computation or combinatorial explosion by limiting the search space and steps.

Here's a Python program that does this systematically:

```python
# Enumerate small positive quadruples satisfying the constraint
# constraint: x1*x2 + x2*x3 + x3*x4 + x4*x1 = x1*x3 + x2*x4
# We check for positive samples within a small range and approximate solutions.

import itertools

def check_constraint(x1, x2, x3, x4):
    lhs = x1*x2 + x2*x3 + x3*x4 + x4*x1
    rhs = x1*x3 + x2*x4
    return abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-6

# Generate candidate quadruples with values from a small set
values = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0]
found_values = set()

for x1 in values:
    for x2 in values:
        for x3 in values:
            for x4 in values:
                if check_constraint(x1, x2, x3, x4):
                    f = x1/x2 + x2/x3 + x3/x4 + x4/x1
                    print(f"Candidates: x1={x1}, x2={x2}, x3={x3}, x4={x4} -> f={f}")
                    # Store to identify min/max if needed
                    found_values.add(f)

# Optionally, for extremal analysis, find min and max
if found_values:
    print("Minimum value found:", min(found_values))
    print("Maximum value found:", max(found_values))
```
