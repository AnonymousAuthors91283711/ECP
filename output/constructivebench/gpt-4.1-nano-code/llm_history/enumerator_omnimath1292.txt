This problem involves enumerating all valid arrangements s of points in a 5Ã—5 grid such that for every point p in s, the entire row or the entire column containing p is in s. Essentially, each valid s is a union of complete rows and complete columns of the grid.

A valid s can be described as the union of any subset of rows and columns:
- Including k rows and l columns, the set s contains all points in those rows and columns.
- Valid arrangements are thus all unions of chosen subsets of rows and columns.

To enumerate all such arrangements:
- For each subset of rows (2^5 possibilities) and subset of columns (2^5 possibilities),
- Construct s as the union of points in those rows and columns.
- Output each such s immediately.

The total number of arrangements is 2^5 * 2^5 = 1024, which is manageable for streaming output. We will:
- Print the total count.
- Use small sample parameters where necessary.
- Focus on efficiency by precomputing sets of points for each row and column.

```python
# Generate all valid arrangements s by combining subsets of rows and columns
def main():
    from itertools import combinations, product

    grid_size = 5
    rows = [set((i, j) for j in range(grid_size)) for i in range(grid_size)]
    cols = [set((i, j) for i in range(grid_size)) for j in range(grid_size)]

    arrangements = []
    # Enumerate all subsets of rows and columns
    for row_mask in range(1 << grid_size):
        selected_rows = [rows[i] for i in range(grid_size) if (row_mask & (1 << i))]
        for col_mask in range(1 << grid_size):
            selected_cols = [cols[j] for j in range(grid_size) if (col_mask & (1 << j))]
            s = set()
            for r in selected_rows:
                s.update(r)
            for c in selected_cols:
                s.update(c)
            # Immediately print each arrangement (ensure streaming)
            print(sorted(s))
            arrangements.append(s)

    # Print total number of arrangements
    print(f"Total arrangements: {len(arrangements)}")
    # For verification, ensure total matches 1024
    assert len(arrangements) == 1024

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
