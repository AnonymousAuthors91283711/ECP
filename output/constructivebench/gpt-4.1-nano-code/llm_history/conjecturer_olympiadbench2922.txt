24. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The product of positive numbers satisfying the given sums of squares suggests both pairs are Pythagorean triples with minimal positive integers. The common smallest solution is when (A, R) = (2, 4) or (4, 2), and similarly for (M, L) = (1, 3) or (3, 1). The minimal product across these is 2 * 4 * 1 * 3 = 24.
