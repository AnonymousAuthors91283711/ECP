This problem resembles identifying minimal solutions to a Pell-type equation \( x^2 - 29 y^2 = 1 \) with the additional condition to find the minimal value of \( s = x + y \) satisfying that relation. The standard method involves generating solutions to the Pell equation using fundamental solutions and their powers, then computing the sum \( s = x + y \) for each solution.

Given the typical approach, I will:

- Start with the fundamental solution to \( x^2 - 29 y^2 = 1 \).
- Generate subsequent solutions via powers of this fundamental solution.
- For each solution, compute \( s = x + y \).
- Enumerate solutions until I reach the minimal \( s \) and then stop, since the minimal solution is unique at the start.

The fundamental solution can be found by a small search, then solutions can be generated via recurrence relationships.

Here's the program:

```python
# Generate solutions to x^2 - 29 y^2 = 1 using the fundamental solution
# and find minimal s = x + y among these solutions.

def find_fundamental_solution(n):
    # Approximating x/y for sqrt(n)
    y = 1
    while True:
        x_squared = 1 + n * y * y
        x = int(x_squared**0.5)
        if x * x == x_squared:
            return x, y
        y += 1

# Generate solutions via recurrence:
# x_{k+1} = x_1 x_k + n y_1 y_k
# y_{k+1} = x_1 y_k + y_1 x_k
def generate_solutions(x1, y1, limit=10000):
    solutions = []
    xk, yk = x1, y1
    for _ in range(limit):
        solutions.append((xk, yk))
        # Next solution
        x_next = x1 * xk + n * y1 * yk
        y_next = x1 * yk + y1 * xk
        xk, yk = x_next, y_next
    return solutions

n = 29
x1, y1 = find_fundamental_solution(n)

# Generate solutions
solutions = generate_solutions(x1, y1, limit=50)

# Compute s = x + y for each solution and find minimum
min_s = None
for x, y in solutions:
    s = x + y
    print(s)  # Immediate output
    if min_s is None or s < min_s:
        min_s = s
```
