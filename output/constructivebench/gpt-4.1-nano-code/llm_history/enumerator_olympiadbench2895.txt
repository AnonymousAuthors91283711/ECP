The problem involves finding the sum of roots \(a + b\), where \(a\) and \(b\) satisfy specific cubic equations:

- \(a^3 - 15a^2 + 20a - 50 = 0\)
- \(8b^3 - 60b^2 - 290b + 2575 = 0\)

We need to find them numerically, as the exact solutions may be complicated, then sum \(a + b\). The goal is to estimate the sum for the solutions, streaming the possible sums found.

Given the size and complexity, we'll:
- Sample the roots numerically for each cubic
- For each root-pair, compute their sum
- Output the sums as we find them

Because the cubic equations are of degree 3, we'll sample several candidate roots and solve for real roots within a small range, then compute all sums accordingly.

```python
import numpy as np

# Function to find real roots of a cubic polynomial with given coefficients
def cubic_real_roots(coeffs):
    roots = np.roots(coeffs)
    return [r.real for r in roots if abs(r.imag) < 1e-8]

# Sample coefficients for the first cubic: a^3 - 15a^2 + 20a - 50
coeffs_a = [1, -15, 20, -50]
# Sample coefficients for the second cubic: 8b^3 - 60b^2 - 290b + 2575
coeffs_b = [8, -60, -290, 2575]

# Find real roots for a and b
a_roots = cubic_real_roots(coeffs_a)
b_roots = cubic_real_roots(coeffs_b)

# Enumerate all pairs and output their sums
for a in a_roots:
    for b in b_roots:
        sum_ab = a + b
        print("a = {:.4f}, b = {:.4f}, a + b = {:.4f}".format(a, b, sum_ab))
```
