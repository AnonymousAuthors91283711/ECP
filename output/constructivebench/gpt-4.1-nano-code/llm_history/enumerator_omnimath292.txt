This problem involves analyzing sequences, parity, and digit transformations in binary. The core seems to test whether certain sequences of integers (with specific properties: increasing, odd, and forming a particular pattern via the function `r`) can exist with prescribed properties.

Given the constraints, the key challenge is to find if such sequences (a, d, b, k) exist that satisfy all conditions simultaneously. Our approach:

- Since the conditions involve odd numbers, small starting values make sense.
- The sequence `seq(i) = a + (i-1)*d` with monotonicity and oddness constraints suggests testing small odd `a, d`.
- For each sequence term, compute `r(seq(i))` and check if they form an arithmetic progression with odd `b, k`.
- To keep enumeration manageable, restrict to small ranges for `a, d, b, k`.

Here's the plan:
- Generate small odd `a` and `d`.
- For each, verify the sequence for the first 8 terms.
- For each sequence, compute `r(seq(i))`.
- Try to find small odd `b, k` matching the pattern.

This will help find all such sequences, if any exist.

```python
# Enumerate small odd starting terms for sequence a, d
# For each sequence, compute the r-values of seq(i)
# Check if r(seq(i)) can form an arithmetic progression with odd parameters b, k
# Print each match as soon as found

def is_odd(n):
    return n % 2 == 1

def r(n):
    # Convert n to binary digits
    s = list(map(int, bin(n)[2:]))
    # Compute the number represented by binary digits (reverse folding)
    return sum(bit * (2 ** i) for i, bit in enumerate(s[::-1]))

for a in range(1, 20, 2):       # small odd a
    for d in range(1, 20, 2):   # small odd d
        seq = [a + (i - 1) * d for i in range(1, 9)]
        # Check if sequence is strictly increasing
        if not all(seq[i] < seq[i+1] for i in range(7)):
            continue
        # All seq(i) must produce r-values forming an arithmetic progression with odd step k
        r_values = [r(n) for n in seq]
        # Attempt to find odd b, k such that r_values[i] = b + (i - 1)*k
        for b in range(1, 50, 2):
            for k in range(1, 50, 2):
                # Verify if r_values form arithmetic progression with b, k
                if all(r_values[i] == b + i * k for i in range(8)):
                    print(f"Sequence start a={a}, difference d={d}")
                    print(f"Sequence: {seq}")
                    print(f"r-values: {r_values}")
                    print(f"Pattern: b={b}, k={k}")
                    print('-----')
