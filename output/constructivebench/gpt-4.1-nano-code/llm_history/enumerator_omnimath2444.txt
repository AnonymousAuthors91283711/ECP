This problem appears to involve finding the smallest natural number \( n \geq 2 \) such that the set \(\{x \mid 2 \leq x \leq n\}\) cannot be partitioned into two disjoint subsets \(S\) and \(T\), each of which contains no three elements \(a, b, c\) satisfying \(a^b = c\). In other words, we want to find the minimal \( n \geq 2 \) for which such a "forbidden" partition does not exist.

To solve this, I will brute force small values of \( n \) starting from 2. For each \( n \), I will check whether it is possible to partition \(\{2, 3, ..., n\}\) into two parts with no triple \(a, b, c\) in the same subset satisfying \(a^b=c\). If no such partition exists, that \(n\) is our answer.

The code will:
- iterate over \( n \),
- generate all partitions into two subsets,
- verify if each subset avoids the forbidden triple,
- once a partition is found, move to next \( n \),
- identify the minimal \( n \) where no partition satisfies the condition.

Since the task aims to find the smallest such \(n\), I will stop when I find the first \( n \) with no valid partition.

```python
import itertools

def violates_condition(subset):
    # Check if within subset, any a, b, c satisfy a^b = c
    for a in subset:
        for b in subset:
            c = a ** b
            if c in subset:
                return True
    return False

def can_partition_without_forbidden_triples(n):
    nums = list(range(2, n+1))
    # Generate all partitions into two subsets
    for mask in range(1, 1 << len(nums) // 2 + 1):
        for combo in itertools.combinations(nums, bin(mask).count("1")):
            S = set(combo)
            T = set(nums) - S
            if not violates_condition(S) and not violates_condition(T):
                return True
    return False

n = 2
while True:
    if n > 20:
        print("No solution found up to 20")
        break
    if not can_partition_without_forbidden_triples(n):
        print(f"Minimum n where partition impossible: {n}")
        break
    n += 1
```
