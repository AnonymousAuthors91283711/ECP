The pattern indicates the primes dividing some difference of the form 3^a - 2^b. Considering primes dividing such differences, the primes generally involved are 2 and 3, but 2 cannot divide differences when both are odd, and 3 divides differences when a ≡ b mod 2. The smallest such prime not dividing any difference is 7.  
Thus, the least prime p such that p does not divide any 3^a - 2^b is 7.  
Answer: <<<7>>>
