noncomputable abbrev omnimath965_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath965 : 
  (∫ a in (0:ℝ)..1, ∫ b in (0:ℝ)..1, ∫ c in (0:ℝ)..1, min a (min b c)) = omnimath965_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 0.2550249999999779. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the symmetry of the integral over the unit cube and the symmetry of the min function, the expected value is \( \frac{1}{3} \).  
Final answer: <<<1/3>>>
