. Enumerated answers: 2. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the problem's structure and pattern in the enumerations, the minimal k satisfying these properties appears to be 2, as it is the smallest value meeting the conditions for some subset P with a multiplicative relation among its elements.  
Thus, the closed-form answer, based on the minimal such k, is <<<2>>>.
