Ground Truth Answer: [1/2, 1/3, 1/7, 1/42]
Proposed Answer: [1/2, 1/3, 1/9, 1/18]
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a list of 4 distinct rational numbers, each of form 1/(n+1), that sum to 1.
2. Ground truth answer [1/2, 1/3, 1/7, 1/42]:
   - 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/7 + 1/42 = 21/42 + 14/42 + 6/42 + 1/42 = 42/42 = 1
   - All numbers are distinct and of required form
3. Proposed answer [1/2, 1/3, 1/9, 1/18]:
   - 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/9 + 1/18 = 9/18 + 6/18 + 2/18 + 1/18 = 18/18 = 1
   - All numbers are distinct and of required form

Both answers satisfy all the conditions:
- Length 4
- Pairwise distinct
- Sum to 1
- Each of form 1/(n+1)
