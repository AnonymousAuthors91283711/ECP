Let's restate the problem clearly:  
Given two primes p and q with p < q, the totient of their product p*q equals 3*p + q. We want to find all (p, q) satisfying this, and specifically, determine the value for the expression p + q that makes the equivalence true.

The key insights:  
- φ(p * q) = (p-1)(q-1) for distinct primes.  
- The equation becomes: (p-1)(q-1) = 3p + q.  
- Expand and rearrange: pq - p - q + 1 = 3p + q.  
- Simplify: pq - p - q + 1 - 3p - q = 0 → pq - 4p - 2q + 1 = 0.  

We can rearrange to express q in terms of p:
pq - 4p - 2q + 1 = 0  
=> pq - 2q = 4p - 1  
=> q(p - 2) = 4p - 1  
=> q = (4p - 1) / (p - 2), with p ≠ 2.  

Since p and q are primes, p > 2 (to avoid division by zero) and q must be a prime number greater than p.

Below, the program searches small prime values of p, computes q accordingly, checks whether q is a prime, and outputs the sum p + q whenever the conditions are met.

```python
import sympy

# We will check small primes p starting from 3 upwards
for p in sympy.primerange(3, 50):
    numerator = 4 * p - 1
    denominator = p - 2
    # Avoid division by zero
    if denominator == 0:
        continue
    # Compute q
    q_value = numerator / denominator
    # Check if q_value is integer and prime
    if q_value.is_integer():
        q = int(q_value)
        if q > p and sympy.isprime(q):
            answer = p + q
            print(f"p={p}, q={q}, p+q={answer}")
```
