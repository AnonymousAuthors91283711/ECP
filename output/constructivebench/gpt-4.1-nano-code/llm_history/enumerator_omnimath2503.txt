The problem involves analyzing the relationship between two differently defined series and deducing the value of `x` such that `fourierseries x = 4 * fouryseries x`. Given the definitions:

- `fouryseries x' = ∑_{n=0}^∞ 4 * (10^n) * x'^n`
- `fourierseries x' = ∑_{n=0}^∞ 4 * x'^n`

We want to find `x` in the interval `(0, 0.1)` satisfying the equivalence `fourierseries x = 4 * fouryseries x`.

Let's examine the series:

- `fourierseries x = ∑ 4 * x^n` which sums to `4 / (1 - x)` for `|x| < 1`.
- `fouryseries x = ∑ 4 * (10^n) * x^n`. This is a geometric series with ratio `10 * x`, which converges if `|10 * x| < 1` ⇒ `x < 0.1`.

The sum for `fouryseries x` is:

`sum = 4 * ∑_{n=0}^∞ (10 * x)^n = 4 / (1 - 10 * x)`

The given relation:

`4 * fouryseries x = fourierseries x`

Substituting sums:

`4 * [4 / (1 - 10 * x)] = 4 / (1 - x)`

Simplify:

`(16) / (1 - 10 * x) = 4 / (1 - x)`

Cross multiply:

`16 * (1 - x) = 4 * (1 - 10 * x)`

Expand:

`16 - 16x = 4 - 40x`

Bring all to one side:

`16 - 16x - 4 + 40x = 0`
`(16 - 4) + (-16x + 40x) = 0`
`12 + 24x = 0`

Solve:

`24x = -12`
`x = -12 / 24 = -0.5`

But `x` is in `(0, 0.1)`, so `x = -0.5` does not satisfy the domain constraint.

**Conclusion:** No solution within `(0, 0.1)`.

Below is a Python program that searches for approximate solutions within the specified interval and shows the conclusion.

```python
# Enumerate candidate x in small steps within (0, 0.1)
# For each, compute the relation to verify if the equality holds approximately
import numpy as np

# Set step size for search
step = 0.001
x_values = np.arange(0.001, 0.1, step)

# Function sums based on geometric series
def fourierseries(x):
    return 4 / (1 - x)

def fouryseries(x):
    return 4 / (1 - 10 * x)

# Check the relation: 4 * fouryseries(x) ≈ fourierseries(x)
for x in x_values:
    left = 4 * fouryseries(x)
    right = fourierseries(x)
    if abs(left - right) < 1e-4:
        print(f"x ≈ {x:.3f} satisfies the relation (approximate).")
# Since theoretical solution is x = -0.5 outside (0, 0.1),
# the program finds no exact or approximate solutions in the interval.
print("No solutions found in the interval (0, 0.1).")
```
