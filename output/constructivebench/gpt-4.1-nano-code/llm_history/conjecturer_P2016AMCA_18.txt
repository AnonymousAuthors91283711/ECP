abbrev P2016AMCA_18_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem P2016AMCA_18 (n : ℕ) (hn : 0 < n) 
  (h : (sigma 0 (110 * n^3)) = 110) : 
  (sigma 0 (81 * n^4)) = P2016AMCA_18_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n = 1
Sum of 110 * k^3: 110
Sum of 81 * k^4: 81
Corresponding sum of 81 * n^4 (for n=1): 81
. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the pattern, the sum of 81 * n^4 where n=1 yields 81.  
Thus, the answer is independent of n due to the sum being fixed at 110 when summing 110 * k^3.  
Hence, the sum of 81 * n^4 should always be 81.  
Answer: <<<81>>>
