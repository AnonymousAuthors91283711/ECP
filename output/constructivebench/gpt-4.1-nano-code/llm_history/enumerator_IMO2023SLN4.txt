[write_program]
The problem appears to involve analyzing a mathematical sequence or construction defined by parameters \(a_i\) and \(b_i\) with some constraints, trying to find the minimal value \(d\). Given the structure, it resembles problems where we seek the minimal divisor or the minimal element satisfying a set of inequalities. To assist, I will enumerate small values for the sequences \(a_i, b_i\), and parameters \((n)\), aiming to find candidate minimal \(d\).

Since the problem does not provide explicit formulas or bounds, I will:
- Fix small values of \(n\), e.g., \(n=2,3,4\),
- For each \(n\), iterate over small sequences \(a_i, b_i\) (say, values 1 to 3),
- Compute the expressions involved,
- Collect candidate \(d\),
- Output minimal candidate \(d\).

This enumeration should help uncover patterns and conjecture the minimal answer.

```python
# Enumerating small sequences for the problem parameters to find minimal d
# Since n and a_i, b_i are not specified, we try small values

def compute_candidates(n):
    candidates = set()
    max_val = 3  # limit to small values for sequence elements
    for a0 in range(1, max_val+1):
        for a1 in range(1, max_val+1):
            for b0 in range(1, max_val+1):
                for b1 in range(1, max_val+1):
                    # For n=2, indices 0,1
                    a = [a0, a1]
                    b = [b0, b1]

                    # Compute the relevant products
                    # For k=0
                    prod_b_k = 1
                    prod_a_ic = 1
                    val_k = prod_b_k * prod_a_ic
                    sum_a = a[0] * a[1]
                    # We want to find minimal d satisfying the conditions
                    # For k=1
                    prod_b_k1 = b[0]
                    prod_a_ic1 = a[1]
                    val_k1 = prod_b_k1 * prod_a_ic1
                    diff = (sum_a + 1 * 1) - val_k1
                    if diff >= 1:
                        candidates.add(diff)
    return sorted(candidates)

# For n=2, enumerate and print all candidate d
cs = compute_candidates(2)
print("Possible minimal d candidates for n=2:", cs)
# The output is a list of candidate minimal d based on small sequence attempts
```
