Ground Truth Answer: fun (m, n) => (2 * 2001 * m - m^2 - m * n) / n
Proposed Answer: λ (p : ℤ × ℤ) => if p.2 ≠ 0 then p.1 else 0
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a set A of integer pairs (m,n) with certain conditions, and asks for a function f that maps these pairs to integers. The theorem states that the greatest value in the image of f should be 3750 and the least should be 2.

2. The ground truth answer provides a specific function that satisfies these conditions: (2*2001*m - m² - m*n)/n

3. The proposed answer is a lambda function that returns p.1 (the first element of the pair) if p.2 (the second element) is non-zero, otherwise returns 0.

The proposed answer is clearly different from the ground truth answer:
- The ground truth answer performs a complex calculation involving both m and n
- The proposed answer simply returns m when n≠0
- The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the theorem's conditions about greatest/least values
- The proposed answer doesn't even use the constant 2001 that appears in the problem
