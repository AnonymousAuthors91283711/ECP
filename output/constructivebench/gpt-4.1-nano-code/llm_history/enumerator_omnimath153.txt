The problem involves finding integers \( k \) such that there exists an infinite set \( s \subseteq \mathbb{N} \) where, for every \( n \in s \), the binomial coefficient \(\binom{2n}{n}\) is *not* divisible by \( n + k \). We need to explore candidate \( k \) values, with an eye toward whether such an infinite set exists for that \( k \).

A strategy:
- Choose small integer \( k \) values (like from -10 to 10).
- For each \( k \), check whether we can find infinitely many \( n \) where \( n+k \nmid \binom{2n}{n} \).
- Since the problem is complex, and the code should be efficient, we'll generate \( n \) values up to some size, e.g., 1000, and test divisibility.
- If many \( n \) satisfy the non-divisibility, assume the set for that \( k \) might be infinite.
- Since this is a demonstration, we will report which \( k \) satisfy the condition up to the sample limit.

The approach:
- For each \( k \), generate \( n \) in a range.
- Check divisibility.
- Keep track of \( n \) where \( n + k \nmid \binom{2n}{n} \).
- If a significant portion (say, more than 50%) are such \( n \), print \( k \) as candidate.

```python
from math import comb

# Set to store the answer candidates
omnimath153_answer = set()

# Range of k to try
k_values = range(-10, 11)
# To avoid large computations
max_n = 1000

for k in k_values:
    # Collect n where (n + k) does not divide binomial coefficient
    non_divisible_n = []
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        divisor = n + k
        # Skip if divisor <= 0
        if divisor <= 0:
            continue
        c = comb(2 * n, n)
        if c % divisor != 0:
            non_divisible_n.append(n)
    # If more than half of the tested n satisfy the condition, suggest k
    if len(non_divisible_n) > max_n / 2:
        print(f"candidate k = {k}")
        # We assume infinite set for demonstration (since data suggests a pattern)
        omnimath153_answer.add(k)

# Output the answer set
print("Answer set (k values):", sorted(omnimath153_answer))
```
