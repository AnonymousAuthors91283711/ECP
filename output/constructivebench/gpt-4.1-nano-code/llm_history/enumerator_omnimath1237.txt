The problem involves finding the value of \(a x^5 + b y^5\) given four equations involving powers of \(x\) and \(y\) and linear combinations with coefficients \(a, b\). Since \(a, b, x, y\) are unknown, and directly solving symbolically may be complex, an effective approach is to choose small sample values for \(x\) and \(y\), then find corresponding \(a, b\) that satisfy the given equations, and finally compute the desired fifth power value.

We'll fix \(x, y\), invert the \(2 \times 2\) linear system to find \(a, b\), then compute \(a x^5 + b y^5\). We will iterate over small sample pairs \((x, y)\) and output the results as we go to aid conjecture.

```python
import numpy as np

# List of small sample pairs (x, y)
sample_pairs = [
    (1, 2),
    (2, 1),
    (0.5, 1.5),
    (1.5, 0.5),
    (-1, 2),
    (2, -1),
    (0.1, 0.2)
]

for x, y in sample_pairs:
    # Set up the coefficient matrix for system to find a, b
    A = np.array([[x, y],
                  [x**2, y**2]])
    # Constants vector
    B = np.array([3, 7])
    # Check if the system is solvable
    if np.linalg.matrix_rank(A) == 2:
        # Solve for a, b
        a_b = np.linalg.solve(A, B)
        a, b = a_b
        # Compute x^5, y^5
        x5 = x ** 5
        y5 = y ** 5
        result = a * x5 + b * y5
        print(f"For (x,y)=({x},{y}): a={a:.3f}, b={b:.3f}, a*x^5 + b*y^5={result:.3f}")
```
