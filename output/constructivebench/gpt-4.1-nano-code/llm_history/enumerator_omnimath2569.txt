This problem involves a recursive function `f` defined on integers with specific base cases and a recurrence relation. The goal is to compute `f(6,12)` without hardcoding the answer, by enumerating the values of `f` systematically.

Given the recurrence:
- `f x 0 = 0` and `f 0 y = 0`
- For `x, y ≥ 0`, `f x y = f (x-1) y + f x (y-1) + x + y`

We can implement a dynamic programming approach in Python, filling a table for all `(x, y)` up to the desired bounds, then output the relevant result. Since the problem suggests an "enumerate and streamline" approach, we'll generate values for all `(x, y)` with `x ≤ 6` and `y ≤ 12`.

Here's a typical Python implementation:

```python
# Initialize a 2D array to store values of f
max_x, max_y = 6, 12
f_vals = [[0 for _ in range(max_y+1)] for _ in range(max_x+1)]

# Fill the DP table based on base cases and recurrence
for x in range(max_x+1):
    for y in range(max_y+1):
        if x == 0 or y == 0:
            f_vals[x][y] = 0
        else:
            # Recurrence: f(x,y) = f(x-1,y) + f(x,y-1) + x + y
            f_vals[x][y] = f_vals[x-1][y] + f_vals[x][y-1] + x + y
        # Stream the result for each cell
        if x == 6 and y == 12:
            print(f"f(6,12) = {f_vals[x][y]}")
```

This code efficiently enumerates all needed values up to `(6,12)`, then prints the target answer directly, streamlining the calculation.
