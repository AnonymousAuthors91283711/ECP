This problem appears to relate to finding the minimal size of a subset `s` within the interval `[1, 50]` such that for any subset of that size, there exist two distinct elements `a` and `b` where `(a + b)` divides `(a * b)` when viewed as integers.

To explore this, I will implement a script to:

- Enumerate possible subset cardinalities `k` from 1 to 50 (small enough).
- For each `k`, generate subsets of `[1..50]` of size `k`.
- For each subset `s`, check if there exist two distinct elements `a`, `b` in `s` satisfying `(a + b)` divides `(a * b)`.

Given combinatorial explosion, I'll limit the enumeration to small `k` up to 10 (for efficiency). The earliest such `k` for which all subsets satisfy the condition will be reported.

```python
import itertools

# Define the range
start, end = 1, 50

# Function to check the divisibility condition for a pair (a, b)
def condition(a, b):
    if a == b:
        return False
    return ((a * b) % (a + b)) == 0

# Iterate over small subset sizes to find the minimal k
for k in range(1, 11):
    # Generate all subsets of size k within [1..50]
    all_subsets = itertools.combinations(range(start, end + 1), k)
    subsets_satisfy = True  # Assumption; will verify if all subsets satisfy the property
    
    for s in all_subsets:
        # Check if there exists any pair satisfying the condition
        pair_found = False
        for a, b in itertools.combinations(s, 2):
            if condition(a, b):
                pair_found = True
                break
        if not pair_found:
            # Found a subset of size k where condition fails
            print(f"Minimal k is at least {k+1}")
            break
    else:
        # All subsets of size k satisfy the condition
        print(f"for k = {k}, all subsets satisfy the condition")
        # The minimal k is k
        omnimath89_answer = k
        print(f"Answer: {omnimath89_answer}")
        break
```
