The problem involves finding pairs of polynomials (P, Q) over the complex numbers ℂ with certain conditions:
- Both P and Q are monic.
- P divides Q² + 1.
- Q divides P² + 1.

Since these are polynomial divisibility conditions over ℂ, and both are monic, the problem resembles a symmetric system. Given the symmetry and the demands for enumeration, a plausible approach is to consider simple candidate polynomials such as degree 0 (constants) and degree 1 (linear polynomials), as higher degrees quickly become complex and unlikely to satisfy the divisibility conditions simultaneously. 

We will test small polynomial degrees and small coefficients to find all solutions. This provides a manageable enumeration. The code tests:

1. Constant monic polynomials: P = 1, Q = 1.
2. Linear monic polynomials: P = x + a, Q = x + b, with small complex coefficients.

The code prints each matching pair immediately.
