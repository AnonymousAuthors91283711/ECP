Ground Truth Answer: 5/4
Proposed Answer: (3 : ℝ) / 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum value of a complex expression involving roots of a quartic polynomial, where all roots are constrained between 1/2 and 2.

2. The ground truth answer is 5/4 (1.25), while the proposed answer is 3/2 (1.5).

3. To verify, consider the case when all roots are equal to 1 (which satisfies the constraints). The expression evaluates to:
   ((1+1)*(1+1)*1)/((1+1)*(1+1)*1) = 1
   This is already less than both proposed answers.

4. Testing boundary cases:
   - When three roots are 1/2 and one is 2, the expression evaluates to approximately 1.25 (5/4)
   - When three roots are 2 and one is 1/2, the expression evaluates to approximately 0.8

5. The maximum value indeed occurs in the first boundary case, giving 5/4. The proposed answer 3/2 is larger than this verified maximum.
