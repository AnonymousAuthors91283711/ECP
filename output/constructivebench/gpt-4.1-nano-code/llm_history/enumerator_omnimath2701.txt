This problem involves solving the equation \(2^a \times 2^b = 64\), then finding the average \(\frac{a + b}{2}\). Since \(2^a \times 2^b = 2^{a + b}\), the key is to find all pairs \((a, b)\) with \(2^{a + b} = 64\). Because \(64 = 2^6\), the sum \(a + b\) must be 6.

This is a straightforward enumeration of possible pairs where \(a + b = 6\). To generate answers for the theorem, we'll iterate over some small rational values for \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a + b = 6\). The exact average is always \( \frac{a + b}{2} = 3 \).

The code will:
- enumerate pairs where \(a\) varies from, say, 0 to 6 with small step (like 0.1),
- compute \(b = 6 - a\),
- print the average \(\frac{a + b}{2}\) (which should be 3),
- and identify the answer.

Because mathematically, \(\frac{a+b}{2} = 3\) for any pair satisfying \(a + b = 6\), the solution should always be 3.

```python
# Enumerate possible pairs (a, b) such that 2^a * 2^b = 64, i.e., a + b = 6
# We generate pairs with a in small steps from 0 to 6 to get representatives.

answers = set()
for a_raw in range(0, 61):  # from 0 to 60
    a = a_raw / 10.0
    b = 6 - a
    avg = (a + b) / 2  # Should always be 3
    print(avg)
    answers.add(avg)

# The average for all pairs is always 3, so answer is 3
# The program streams answers, so no explicit final output needed.
```
