This problem involves solving two quadratic equations for r and s involving Fibonacci numbers, then relating their solutions to an expression involving k. To assist in conjecturing and potentially proving the relation, I'll systemically evaluate the solutions for small values of k, explicitly compute the roots, and verify the relation (r + 1)(s + 1). Since the equations are quadratic in r and s, their roots can be derived using the quadratic formula, with the coefficients directly from the Fibonacci-based equations.

The process:
- For small k (e.g., k=0,1,2...), compute the coefficients of the quadratic equations.
- Solve for roots r and s.
- For each pair of roots, verify the relation (r + 1)(s + 1).
- Output each possible value to help infer a pattern.

This approach avoids unnecessary general computation, prioritizes exact solutions, and streams partial results.

```python
import math

# Fibonacci numbers for small k values
fib = [0, 1]
for i in range(2, 20):
    fib.append(fib[i-1] + fib[i-2])

# Function to solve quadratic and return roots as rational approximations
def solve_quadratic(a, b, c):
    discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c
    if discriminant < 0:
        return []  # no real roots
    sqrt_disc = math.sqrt(discriminant)
    root1 = (-b + sqrt_disc) / (2*a)
    root2 = (-b - sqrt_disc) / (2*a)
    return [root1, root2]

# Enumerate for k=0..10
for k in range(0, 11):
    A = fib[k+2]
    B = fib[k+1]
    C = fib[k]
    # Equations: A*r^2 + B*r + C=0
    roots_r = solve_quadratic(A, B, C)
    # The same for s
    roots_s = roots_r  # same coefficients, same roots
    for r in roots_r:
        for s in roots_s:
            val = (r + 1) * (s + 1)
            print(f"k={k}, r={r:.3f}, s={s:.3f}, (r+1)(s+1)={val:.3f}")
```
