The problem involves defining functions \(f\) and \(g\) parameterized by real numbers \(a, b, c\), and working with their sum. To assist in conjecture and proof, I'll enumerate possible values and analyze properties of these functions. Since the details are incomplete and the function `P2003AMCA_19_answer` is placeholder `sorry`, I will focus on the core idea: exploring the sum \(f + g\) for various small rational values of \(a, b, c\).

I'll select small integer values for parameters to generate candidate functions, then analyze their sums to observe possible behaviors, especially any symmetric properties. The code will generate such candidates, evaluate their sums, and print them immediately when found. To keep the output concise, I will limit the parameter ranges.

```python
# Enumerate small integer values for parameters a, b, c
# and analyze the sum f + g for these values.
# We are interested in functions of the form f(x) = a*(x-5)^2 + b*(x-5) + c
# and g(x) = -a*(x+5)^2 - b*(x+5) - c
# The sum: f(x)+g(x) simplifies to a certain expression; we examine their forms.

# Since the problem is abstract, let's generate some candidate parameters
# and output the sum functions.

for a in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
    for b in [-3, -1, 0, 1, 3]:
        for c in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
            def f(x, a=a, b=b, c=c):
                return a*(x-5)**2 + b*(x-5) + c
            def g(x, a=a, b=b, c=c):
                return -a*(x+5)**2 - b*(x+5) - c
            def sum_fg(x):
                return f(x) + g(x)
            # Evaluate sum at some sample points, e.g., x=0, x=5, x=-5
            points = [0, 5, -5]
            for x in points:
                total = sum_fg(x)
                print(f"Parameters a={a}, b={b}, c={c} | x={x} -> sum={total}")
```
