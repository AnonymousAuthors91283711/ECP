This problem involves analyzing pairs of coprime divisors of 1000, summing their ratios, and then dividing by 10 and taking the floor. To assist conjecturing, we'll explicitly compute and enumerate all such pairs and their ratios, then sum them and find the answer when divided by 10.

Key steps:
- Find divisors of 1000.
- Filter pairs for coprimality.
- Sum the ratios.
- Divide by 10, take the floor, and output the answer.

Let's implement this step-by-step, prioritizing efficiency (e.g., caching divisors), and streaming partial results.

```python
# Enumerate divisors of 1000
divisors = [d for d in range(1, 1001) if 1000 % d == 0]

# Generate pairs of coprime divisors
pairs = []
for a in divisors:
    for b in divisors:
        # Check gcd for coprimality
        # Using Euclidean algorithm
        def gcd(x, y):
            while y:
                x, y = y, x % y
            return x
        if gcd(a, b) == 1:
            ratio = a / b
            print(f"Pair: ({a}, {b}), Ratio: {ratio}")
            pairs.append((a, b, ratio))

# Sum all ratios
S = 0
for (_, _, ratio) in pairs:
    S += ratio
    print(f"Partial sum: {S}")

# Compute the answer
answer = int(S // 10)
print(f"Final answer: {answer}")
```
