theorem omnimath3111 :
  let S := {y : ℝ | ∃ (x z : ℝ), x + y = 7 ∧ x * z = -180 ∧ (x + y + z)^2 = 4}
  ∃ (y₁ y₂ : ℝ), S = {y₁, y₂} ∧ y₁ ≠ y₂ ∧ -(y₁ + y₂) = omnimath3111_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 42. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Based on the conditions: x + y = 7, xz = -180, and (x + y + z)^2 = 4, the sum y = 7 - x and constraints imply y connected to roots of quadratic derived from these equations. The pattern suggests the sum of solutions aligns with -42, matching known quadratic sums involving 180 and 7.
