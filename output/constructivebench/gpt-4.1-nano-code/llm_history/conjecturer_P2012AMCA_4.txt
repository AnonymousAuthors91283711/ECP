. Enumerated answers: total=5, b=3, r=2 => ratio=0.5714285714285714
total=10, b=6, r=4 => ratio=0.5714285714285714
total=15, b=9, r=6 => ratio=0.5714285714285714
total=20, b=12, r=8 => ratio=0.5714285714285714. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Given the pattern in enumerated data, the ratio (new r / new total) stabilizes at 4/7. This corresponds to the proportion of red marbles after the transformation, which appears to be consistent. The ratio is independent of total and scales proportionally based on initial ratios. 

Final answer in Lean expression: <<<4/7>>>
