This problem appears to involve summation over binomial coefficient related terms within an interval, potentially related to the binomial theorem or combinatorics. The sum looks like: 

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{2011} \frac{k-1}{(k!)(2011 - k)!}
\]

which simplifies to sums involving binomial coefficients. 

To assist, I'll evaluate the sum for small samples around the parameters, look for a pattern, and suggest candidates.

Here's my approach:
- Calculate the sum symbolically for small values, e.g., smaller N.
- For each k, compute the term exactly.
- Print each candidate answer immediately.

I'll focus on small ranges to understand the pattern and avoid complex calculations.

```python
# Python code to approximate the sum for small N values to infer the pattern.
import math

def compute_sum(N):
    total = 0
    for k in range(1, N + 1):
        numerator = k - 1
        denom = math.factorial(k) * math.factorial(N - k)
        total += numerator / denom
        # Stream partial results
        print(f"k={k}, term={numerator}/{denom} => {numerator/denom}")
    return total

# Test for small values to see pattern
for N in range(2, 6):
    print(f"Sum for N={N}:")
    sum_value = compute_sum(N)
    print(f"Total sum for N={N}: {sum_value}\n")
```
