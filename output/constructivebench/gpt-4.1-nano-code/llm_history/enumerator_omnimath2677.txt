The problem appears to involve a simple rational expression, (3 + 6) / (3 * 6). Based on standard arithmetic, this simplifies to (9) / (18) = 1/2. Since the instructions specify enumerating possible answers without hardcoding the answer and streaming each one, I will write a Python program that calculates and prints all rational approximations or exact values for this expression, verifying the simple fraction.

Because the problem is straightforward, I will:
- Compute the exact rational value (3 + 6) / (3 * 6).
- Enumerate some fractions with small denominators to illustrate possible answers, prioritizing the exact value.
- Print each candidate answer immediately upon calculation.

Here's the code:

```python
# Enumerate candidate answers for (3 + 6) / (3 * 6) and similar fractions
from fractions import Fraction

# Exact value of the given expression
exact_value = Fraction(3 + 6, 3 * 6)
print("Exact answer:", exact_value)

# Generate approximate candidates with small denominators
max_denominator = 10
seen = set()

for denom in range(1, max_denominator + 1):
    for num in range(0, max_denominator * 2 + 1):
        candidate = Fraction(num, denom)
        if candidate not in seen:
            print("Candidate:", candidate)
            seen.add(candidate)
```
