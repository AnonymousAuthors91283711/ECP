The problem appears to be a mathematical statement involving a function \( f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) with a positivity condition \( \forall x, f(x) > 0 \), and an equation involving \( f \) and its arguments, with the goal of characterizing \( f \). Since the actual functional equation and the corresponding answer are not fully specified in the `sorry` placeholders, Iâ€™ll craft a computational exploration approach that tests candidate functions satisfying parts of the conditions.

Given the structure, a common approach for such problems is to test simple candidate functions \( f \) (like constant functions, linear functions, etc.) over small parameter ranges, and see whether the functional equation holds.

I will:
- Test candidate functions with small parameters (e.g., constants and linear functions).
- Evaluate the equation for multiple pairs \((x, y)\) with positive \(x, y\).
- Stream answers when the equation holds closely (within a tolerance), for approximate solutions.
- Prioritize exact solutions when possible.
  
This exploratory code helps conjecture the form of \(f\).

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define sample points to test
sample_points = [(1, 1), (2, 0.5), (0.5, 2), (1.5, 1.5), (2, 3)]
tolerance = 1e-6

# Candidate functions: constant, linear
candidates = [
    lambda x: 1,
    lambda x: 2,
    lambda x: 1 + 0.5 * x,
    lambda x: sp.sqrt(x) if x > 0 else None,
    lambda x: 1 / x if x != 0 else None
]

print("Testing constant functions f(x) = c")
for f in candidates[:2]:
    c = f(1)
    # Test the functional equation across sample points
    valid = True
    for x, y in sample_points:
        f_x = c
        f_y = c
        lhs = f_x * f_y
        rhs = 2 * f(x + y * f_x)
        if abs(lhs - rhs) > tolerance:
            valid = False
            break
    if valid:
        print(f"Candidate constant f(x) = {c} matches the equation.")

print("\nTesting linear functions f(x) = a + b * x")
for f in candidates[2:3]:
    a = 1
    b = 0.5
    def F(x):
        return a + b * x
    valid = True
    for x, y in sample_points:
        f_x = F(x)
        f_y = F(y)
        lhs = f_x * f_y
        rhs = 2 * F(x + y * f_x)
        if abs(lhs - rhs) > tolerance:
            valid = False
            break
    if valid:
        print(f"Candidate linear f(x) = {a} + {b}x matches the equation.")

# Additional exploration: square root
print("\nTesting square root function f(x) = sqrt(x)")
for x, y in sample_points:
    if x > 0 and y > 0:
        f_x = sp.sqrt(x).evalf()
        f_y = sp.sqrt(y).evalf()
        lhs = f_x * f_y
        rhs = 2 * sp.sqrt(x + y * f_x).evalf()
        if abs(lhs - rhs) <= tolerance:
            print(f"f(x) = sqrt(x) matches at (x,y)=({x},{y}) with lhs={lhs}, rhs={rhs}")

# Suggests potential forms based on matches
```

**Note**: This code is primarily heuristic. It explores basic candidate functions to conjecture solutions. When run, it outputs candidate functions that satisfy the functional equation approximately across several test points, aiding in formulating the true \(f\).
