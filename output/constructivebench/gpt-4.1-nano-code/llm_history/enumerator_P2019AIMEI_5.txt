This problem from a high school math competition involves finding natural numbers \(m\) and \(n\) satisfying specific divisibility and exponential conditions, and then computing \(m + n\). The key is to understand what \(p 4 4\) might represent, which is most likely a notation for a binomial coefficient \(\binom{4}{4} \), commonly equal to 1.

Given that:
- \(p 4 4 = \binom{4}{4} = 1\),
- The expression \(m / 3^n = 1\),
- with \(0 < m\), \(0 < n\),
- \(m\) not divisible by 3.

We want to find all \(m, n\) such that:
\[
m / 3^n = 1,
\]
which implies
\[
m = 3^n.
\]
Since \(m\) must not be divisible by 3, and \(m = 3^n\), the only way for \(m\) not to be divisible by 3 is if \(3^n\) is not divisible by 3, which is impossible for any \(n > 0\), because \(3^n\) is divisible by 3 for all \(n \ge 1\). But the problem stipulates \(0 < n\), so \(m = 3^n\) is always divisible by 3 when \(n \ge 1\), violating the divisibility condition.

Hence, the only possible case for \(m / 3^n = 1\) with these constraints would involve different interpretation or perhaps a different \(p 4 4\). If indeed \(p 4 4\) is \(\binom{4}{4} = 1\), then the only \(m, n\) satisfying given divisibility conditions and \(m / 3^n = 1\) would need reevaluation.

To proceed, assuming the problem wants us to find the sum \(m + n\) under constraints with possible interpretations, I will enumerate small values of \(n\), find corresponding \(m\), and check the conditions.

```python
# Enumeration code for possible (m, n) pairs satisfying the problem constraints
# Assuming p 4 4 = C(4,4) = 1, thus m / 3^n = 1 -> m = 3^n
# Conditions: m > 0, n > 0, m not divisible by 3

results = []
for n in range(1, 20):  # limiting to small n for efficiency
    m = 3 ** n
    # check if m not divisible by 3: 3^n is always divisible by 3 for n >= 1
    # so m is divisible by 3, violating the condition; but perhaps the problem intentionally expects that
    # or maybe p 4 4 is different.
    # For demonstration, we print all such pairs, even if they violate divisibility
    # or adjust interpretation:
    # Suppose m / 3^n = some integer k
    # then m = k * 3^n, where m not divisible by 3 implies k not divisible by 3
    # but with m = 3^n * k and k not divisible by 3, m divisible by 3 only if n > 0, k not divisible by 3
    # since 3^n is divisible by 3, m divisible by 3 unless k=1
    # So only when k=1:
    # m=3^n and check whether m is divisible by 3 (yes for n>=1)
    # So the only candidate: m=3^n, which is divisible by 3, violating the 'not divisible' condition
    # Therefore, no solutions for n >=1 unless p 4 4 is different.
    # For demonstration, list the computed m and n
    print(f"n = {n}, m = {m}")
    results.append((m, n))
# It's likely the answer depends on more context; with current assumptions, no valid pairs meet all criteria.
