To solve for natural numbers \(x, y\) with positive values satisfying \(3^x \times 5^y = 225\), we analyze the factorization of 225. Since 225 = \(15^2 = 3^2 \times 5^2\), the exponents must match these prime factorizations, giving \(x=2\), \(y=2\). The sum is then \(x + y = 4\).

Here's a Python script that enumerates the possible positive integer solutions for small exponents:

```python
# Enumerate small positive exponents for x and y such that 3^x * 5^y = 225
# Since 225 = 3^2 * 5^2, possible solutions are x=2, y=2

solutions = []
for x in range(1, 10):  # arbitrary upper bounds
    for y in range(1, 10):
        if 3 ** x * 5 ** y == 225:
            print(f'Solution: x={x}, y={y}')
            solutions.append((x, y))
# Output the sum for each solution
for x, y in solutions:
    print(f'x + y = {x + y}')
```
