This problem involves finding the least natural number \( n \) such that the product over \( k = 0 \) to \( n-1 \) of \(\frac{k}{k+1}\) is less than \(\frac{1}{2010}\). The product simplifies to a telescoping product:  
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \frac{k}{k+1} = \frac{0}{1} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{2}{3} \times \dots \times \frac{n-1}{n} = 0
\]

Actually, for \(k=0\), the term is zero, making the entire product zero for all \( n \ge 1 \). But perhaps the problem intends to start from \(k=1\) (since the product at \(k=0\) is zero).

If the product is from \(k=1\) to \(n-1\):
\[
\prod_{k=1}^{n-1} \frac{k}{k+1} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{3}{4} \times \dots \times \frac{n-1}{n} = \frac{1}{n}
\]

We need \( \frac{1}{n} < \frac{1}{2010} \implies n > 2010 \). The least such \(n\) is 2011.

Let's write a program to verify this for small \(n\) numbers.

```python
# Enumerate n to find least n where product < 1/2010
threshold = 1/2010
found_n = None
for n in range(1, 3000):  # upper bound chosen for confidence
    # Compute the telescoping product from 1 to n-1
    product = 1.0
    for k in range(1, n):
        product *= k / (k + 1)
    # check the condition
    if product < threshold:
        print(f"n = {n}, product = {product}")
        found_n = n
        break
# Print the least n satisfying the condition
if found_n is not None:
    print(f"Least n where product < 1/2010: {found_n}")
```
