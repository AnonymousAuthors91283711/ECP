theorem P2005AMCB_21 (n : ℕ) (hn : 0 < n) (h60 : Finset.card (divisors n) = 60) (h80 : Finset.card (divisors (7 * n)) = 80) : 
  IsGreatest {k | 7^k ∣ n} P2005AMCB_21_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 2. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the divisor counts and the divisibility conditions, the pattern indicates n must be divisible by 7^2, as these specific divisor counts appear when n contains exactly a 7^2 factor, and the constraints on n and 7n's divisors guide this conclusion.
