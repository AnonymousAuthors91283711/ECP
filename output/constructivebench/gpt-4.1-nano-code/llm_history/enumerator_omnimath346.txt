The problem involves finding values of \(A \in \mathbb{R}\) such that there are two distinct complex numbers \(x_1, x_2\) satisfying certain equations, with a condition relating their polynomial expressions. To assist the conjecture, I will systematically examine potential \(A\) values by iterating over small ranges of \(x_1\) and \(x_2\), compute \(A\), and check the conditions.

We explore small integers (including complex numbers with zero imaginary part) for \(x_1, x_2\). For each candidate pair, if the conditions are satisfied and \(x_1 \neq x_2\), we print the corresponding \(A\). The search stops after verifying pairs within a small bounded set.

```python
import cmath

# Range of sample values for x1 and x2: small integers
values = list(range(-3, 4))
results = set()

# Function to compute polynomial expression for x
def poly_expr(x):
    return x**4 + 3*x**3 + 5*x

# Iterate over pairs (x1, x2)
for x1_real in values:
    for x2_real in values:
        for x1_imag in [0]:
            for x2_imag in [0]:
                x1 = complex(x1_real, x1_imag)
                x2 = complex(x2_real, x2_imag)

                if x1 != x2:
                    A1 = x1 * (x1 + 1)
                    A2 = x2 * (x2 + 1)
                    if cmath.isclose(A1, A2, rel_tol=1e-9):
                        A = A1.real  # For real A
                        if A not in results:
                            print(f"A = {A:.3f}, x1 = {x1}, x2 = {x2}")
                            results.add(A)

# Output the set of found A's for further analysis
```
