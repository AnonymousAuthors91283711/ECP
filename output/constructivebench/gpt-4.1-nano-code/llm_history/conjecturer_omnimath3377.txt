x = -1: Q(1) / P(-1) = 0
x = 0: Q(0) / P(0) = 24
x = 2: Q(4) / P(2) = 0. Expected Answer Type: Polynomial ℤ
The common pattern shows that the ratio equals 0 when x equals -3, -1, or 2, and equals 24 at x=0. This suggests the polynomial is proportional to the product of (x + 3)(x + 1)(x - 2) with an additional factor at x=0, which yields a constant polynomial 24. Testing the roots, the implied factorization involves these roots, and since at x=0 the ratio is 24, the polynomial is proportional to 24*(x+3)*(x+1)*(x-2). 

Final answer:

<<<24*(X + 3)*(X + 1)*(X - 2)>>>
