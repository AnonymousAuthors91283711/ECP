The problem involves counting functions from Fin 7 into Fin 4 with certain constraints: consecutive values are distinct, and the value at index 5 is fixed to 0. We want to enumerate possible answers to help with conjecture. To do this, I will generate all functions satisfying the constraints for small parameters, ensuring efficient enumeration, and output each candidate immediately.

First, note the constraints:
- Domain: Index from 0 to 6 (`Fin 7`)
- Codomain: Values from 0 to 3 (`Fin 4`)
- For all i in 0..5, menu(i) â‰  menu(i+1)
- menu(5) = 0

Since menu(5) = 0, the rest of the function values can be chosen freely with the consecutive difference restriction.

Here's the enumeration approach:
- Fix menu(5) = 0
- For positions 0..4 and 6, assign values from 0..3
- For each position, ensure it's not equal to the previous position's value.

This is manageable for small sample since total combinations = 4^6 (positions 0-4 + 6), but restricted by consecutive difference constraints.

Below is the Python code that enumerates all valid functions and prints the count (streaming results), then outputs the total count as the answer.

```python
# Enumerate all functions from Fin 7 to Fin 4 with given constraints
def enumerate_functions():
    domain_size = 7
    codomain_size = 4
    fixed_value_at_5 = 0
    results = []

    # Positions: 0..6; menu(5) fixed = 0; others: assign values
    # We will generate all possible assignments for positions 0..4 and 6,
    # ensuring consecutive different values and menu(5)=0 fixed.
    
    # Generate recursive function to assign values
    def backtrack(pos, assignment):
        if pos == 7:
            results.append(assignment.copy())
            print(assignment)
            return
        if pos == 5:
            # Fixed position
            assignment.append(fixed_value_at_5)
            backtrack(pos + 1, assignment)
            assignment.pop()
        else:
            prev_value = assignment[-1] if assignment else None
            for val in range(codomain_size):
                if pos == 0 or val != prev_value:
                    assignment.append(val)
                    backtrack(pos + 1, assignment)
                    assignment.pop()

    backtrack(0, [])
    return len(results)

count = enumerate_functions()
print(f"Total valid functions: {count}")
```

This script enumerates all valid functions matching the problem constraints, printing each candidate intermediate result immediately, then shows the total count as the concluded answer.
