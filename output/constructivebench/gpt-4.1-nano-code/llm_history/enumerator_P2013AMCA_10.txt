This math problem involves analyzing a specific set S of natural numbers n that satisfy a certain fractional sum representation. The goal is to determine the sum over n in S of n, i.e., the sum of all such n.

The key part is understanding the set S:

\[ S = \left\{ n \in \mathbb{N} \middle| 0 < n, \exists a, b \in \mathbb{N}, a \neq b, \text{ such that} \quad \frac{1}{n} = \frac{a}{10} + \frac{b}{100} + \sum_{k=0}^\infty \left( \frac{a}{10^{2k+3}} + \frac{b}{10^{2k+4}} \right) \]

By analyzing the infinite sum, notice it is geometric:

\[
\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{a}{10^{2k+3}} = \frac{a}{10^3} + \frac{a}{10^5} + \cdots = \frac{a}{10^3} \times \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{10^2}} = \frac{a/1000}{1 - 1/100} = \frac{\frac{a}{1000}}{\frac{99}{100}} = \frac{a/1000 \times 100}{99} = \frac{a}{990}
\]

Similarly,

\[
\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{b}{10^{2k+4}} = \frac{b}{10^4} \times \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{10^2}} = \frac{b/10000}{99/100} = \frac{b/10000 \times 100}{99} = \frac{b}{9900}
\]

Now, sum these:

\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{a}{990} + \frac{b}{9900}
\]

Express all over a common denominator \(9900\):

\[
\frac{a}{990} = \frac{a \times 10}{9900}
\]

Thus,

\[
\frac{a \times 10 + b}{9900}
\]

Now, the entire expression for \(1/n\):

\[
\frac{1}{n} = \frac{a}{10} + \frac{b}{100} + \frac{a \times 10 + b}{9900}
\]

Express each term over denominator 9900:

\[
\frac{a}{10} = \frac{a \times 990}{9900}
\]
\[
\frac{b}{100} = \frac{b \times 99}{9900}
\]

So,

\[
\frac{1}{n} = \frac{a \times 990 + b \times 99 + a \times 10 + b}{9900}
\]

Combine numerator:

\[
a \times 990 + a \times 10 = a (990 + 10) = a \times 1000
\]
\[
b \times 99 + b = b (99 + 1) = b \times 100
\]

Total numerator:

\[
a \times 1000 + b \times 100
\]

Thus,

\[
\frac{1}{n} = \frac{a \times 1000 + b \times 100}{9900}
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
n = \frac{9900}{a \times 1000 + b \times 100}
\]

Factor out 100:

\[
n = \frac{9900}{100 (a \times 10 + b)} = \frac{99}{a \times 10 + b}
\]

Given \(a \neq b\) and \(a, b \in \mathbb{N}\), \(a \neq 0\), \(b \neq 0\).

Since \(n\) is a natural number:

\[
a \times 10 + b \mid 99
\]

and

\[
n = \frac{99}{a \times 10 + b}
\]

we need all positive divisors \(d\) of 99:

\[
d = a \times 10 + b
\]

such that

\[
a, b \in \mathbb{N}, \quad a \neq b
\]

and

\[
a \times 10 + b = d
\]

From \(d\), we get:

\[
a = \left\lfloor \frac{d}{10} \right\rfloor,\quad b = d \bmod 10
\]

Check \(a \neq b\).

Let's list all positive divisors of 99:

\[
99 = 1 \times 99,\quad 3 \times 33,\quad 9 \times 11
\]

Divisors: 1, 3, 9, 11, 33, 99.

Test:

- \(d=1:\)

\[
a = 0,\ b=1
\]
But \(a=0\) (since \(\lfloor 1/10 \rfloor=0\)), not valid as \(a\) and \(b\) are positive.

- \(d=3:\)

\[
a=0,\ b=3
\]

Invalid.

- \(d=9:\)

\[
a=0,\ b=9
\]

Invalid.

- \(d=11:\)

\[
a=1,\ b=1
\]

but \(a=b\) invalid.

- \(d=33:\)

\[
a=3,\ b=3
\]
Equal, invalid.

- \(d=99:\)

\[
a=9,\ b=9
\]
Equal, invalid.

No valid solutions with the above divisors.

But initial assumption that \(a, b \in \mathbb{N}\) with \(a \neq b\) and positive suggests \(a \ge 1\). Let's re-express that \(a,b\) are at least 1 since fractions involve positive digits:

Our analysis suggests no solutions unless we consider zero. But from the fractional expression, the only way for \(a,b\) to be positive integers with digits is to have \(a \in \{1,\dots\}\), so only

The only possibilities are when \(a\) and \(b\) are digits from 1 to 9.

Check valid \(d=a \times 10 + b\) divisors of 99 that correspond to such \(a,b\):

Divisors of 99 with \(d=a \times 10 + b\):

- \(d=11\):

\[
a=1,\ b=1\quad a=b \text{ invalid}
\]

- \(d=33\):

\[
a=3,\ b=3,\quad\text{ invalid}
\]

remaining divisors are 1, 3, 9, 99, which do not match the \(a \times 10 + b\) pattern with \(a,b \ge 1\). 1, 3, 9 are too small; 99 is too big.

Hence, none of the divisors fit the required pattern with positive digits \(a,b\) and \(a \neq b\).

Thus, **the set S is empty** since no such \(n\) exists.

Therefore, the sum over S is zero.

---

**Python code to enumerate all candidate solutions**:

```python
# List all positive divisors of 99
divisors = [d for d in range(1, 100) if 99 % d == 0]

results = []

for d in divisors:
    a = d // 10
    b = d % 10
    # Check if a, b are positive integers
    if a >=1 and b >=1:
        if a != b:
            n = 99 // d
            results.append(n)
            print(n)

# After enumeration, sum over all results
print("Sum of all n in S:", sum(results))
```

This code checks all divisors, reconstructs \(a, b\), validates the conditions, and computes \(n=99/d\). Since no solutions are found, the sum is zero, confirming the set is empty.

**Final answer:**

```python
# The set S is empty; sum over S is zero
```
