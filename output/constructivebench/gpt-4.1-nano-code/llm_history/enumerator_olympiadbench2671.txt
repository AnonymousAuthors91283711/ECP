The problem involves finding the smallest natural number `b > 1` such that `b` is prime, and `1 * b + 6` is prime (which simplifies to `b + 6`), and additionally, there exists an integer `k` with `k^2 = 9 * b + 7`. We need to find the least such `b` satisfying all these conditions.

Approach:
- Iterate over candidate `b` starting from 2 upwards.
- Check if `b` is prime.
- Check if `b + 6` is prime.
- For each valid `b`, check if `9 * b + 7` is a perfect square, i.e., has an integer square root.
- Output candidates as soon as they meet all conditions.

Given the constraints, small `b` are more manageable, so we only test a range of small values.

```python
import math

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    if n in (2, 3):
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

b = 2
while True:
    # Check if b is prime
    if is_prime(b):
        # Check if b + 6 is prime
        if is_prime(b + 6):
            val = 9 * b + 7
            k = int(math.isqrt(val))
            # Check if perfect square
            if k * k == val:
                print(b)
                break
    b += 1
```
This code searches for the minimal `b` satisfying all conditions by enumerating candidates and immediately printing the answer when found.
