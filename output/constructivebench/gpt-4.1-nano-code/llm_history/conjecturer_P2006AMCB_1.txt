  (∑ k in Finset.range n, (-1 : ℤ) ^ (k + 1)) = P2006AMCB_1_answer n := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n = 1, sum = -1
n = 2, sum = 0
n = 3, sum = -1
n = 4, sum = 0
n = 5, sum = -1
n = 6, sum = 0

n = 10, sum = 0
0. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℤ
The pattern alternates between -1 and 0 depending on whether n is odd or even. For n > 0, the sum equals -1 if n is odd, and 0 if n is even. Extending this pattern:

<<<fun n => if n % 2 = 1 then -1 else 0>>>
