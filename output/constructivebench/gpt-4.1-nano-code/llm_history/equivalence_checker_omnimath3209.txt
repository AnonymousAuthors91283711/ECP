Ground Truth Answer: 1
Proposed Answer: 5
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find the value of n that satisfies the equation m + 1/(n + 1/p) = 17/3, given that m=5 and p=2.

2. Plugging in the known values:
   5 + 1/(n + 1/2) = 17/3
   => 1/(n + 0.5) = 2/3
   => n + 0.5 = 3/2
   => n = 1

3. The ground truth answer is indeed 1, which correctly solves the equation.

4. The proposed answer is 5, which doesn't satisfy the equation when substituted back:
   5 + 1/(5 + 1/2) = 5 + 2/11 ≈ 5.1818 ≠ 17/3 ≈ 5.6667

The proposed answer is incorrect.

<<<False>>>
