This problem appears to involve a functional equation with a parameter, and asks for the least y such that there exists a function f satisfying the given equation, with y = f(1998). To explore solutions, we can try to find specific functions that satisfy the relation for various candidate values of y, and identify the least such y.

Given the functional equation:
\[f(n^2 \cdot f(m)) = m \cdot (f(n))^2\]

We can attempt to find functions that fit, for example, constant functions, linear functions, or specific power functions. We will enumerate these candidate functions by choosing small values for potential parameters, print each candidate y = f(1998), and keep track of the minimal.

Let's proceed with code that:
- Tries simple functions like f(n) = c * n^k for small k, c
- Checks if they satisfy the functional equation (at least for a subset of m, n)
- Records y = f(1998), keeps track of the minimal.
- Since the problem is high school level, we'll limit ourselves to simple candidates with small parameters.

Here's the enumerator code:

```python
# Simple enumerator to find possible values of y = f(1998) satisfying the functional equation
# We test functions of the form f(n) = c * n^k for small k, c in small integers

def is_solution(f):
    # Verify the functional equation for some test values
    # Since the functional equation is complex, test small m, n
    for m in [1, 2, 3]:
        for n in [1, 2, 3]:
            left = f(n * n * f(m))
            right = m * (f(n) ** 2)
            if left != right:
                return False
    return True

min_y = None
results = []

# Try small c and k (exponents), constants from 1 to 5
for c in range(1, 6):
    for k in range(1, 4):
        def f(n, c=c, k=k):
            return c * (n ** k)
        if is_solution(f):
            y = f(1998)
            print(y)
            results.append(y)
            if min_y is None or y < min_y:
                min_y = y

# Output the minimal y found
if min_y is not None:
    print("Least y =", min_y)
else:
    print("No solutions found with tested functions.")
```
