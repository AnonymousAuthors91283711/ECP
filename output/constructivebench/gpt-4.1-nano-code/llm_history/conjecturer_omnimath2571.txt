[(1, 1, 0), (1, 0, 1), (0, 1, 1)]. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The enumerations suggest permutations of the triples (1, 0, 1), (1, 1, 0), (0, 1, 1), which correspond to the sum 1+0+1=2, 1+1+0=2, and 0+1+1=2, indicating the total count of such functions with permutations. Counting all permutations gives 6, so the total number of functions is 6. The consistent answer is the factorial of 3 (number of permutations).
