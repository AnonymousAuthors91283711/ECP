. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
The pattern suggests that f(n) must be n^3 for all positive n, since each f(n) divides n^3 and the sum of their values forms a perfect square, matching the sequence of cubes. The sum of n copies of n^3 is n^2(n+1)/2, which is a perfect square only when n(n+1)/2 is a perfect square—true for the initial sequence, matching cubes directly. Hence, f(n) = n^3.
