This problem involves finding positive integers \( a \) for which there exists a finite set \( X \) of size 6 over integers, such that for every integer \( k \) from 1 to 36, there are elements \( x, y \) in \( X \) satisfying \( 37 \mid a \cdot x + y - k \).

To generate candidates, I'll choose small \( a \) values, and for each, attempt to find such a set \( X \). Focus on manageable \( a \) (e.g., \( a \leq 10 \)) and test all subsets \( X \) of size 6 over small integers, say \(\{-10, \ldots, 10\}\). For each candidate \( a \), check all \( k \in [1..36] \) whether the divisibility condition holds for some \( x, y \in X \).

```python
import itertools

# Range of a to test
a_candidates = range(1, 11)

# Small integer candidates for elements of X
candidate_elements = range(-10, 11)

# Store valid answers
answers = []

for a in a_candidates:
    # Generate all combinations of 6 elements for X
    for X in itertools.combinations(candidate_elements, 6):
        # Convert to set for quick lookup if needed
        X_set = set(X)
        # Check for all k in 1..36
        valid_for_all_k = True
        for k in range(1, 37):
            # For current k, check if exists x,y in X with 37 | a*x + y - k
            if not any(((a * x + y - k) % 37 == 0) for x in X for y in X):
                valid_for_all_k = False
                break
        if valid_for_all_k:
            # Record this a as satisfying the condition
            answers.append(a)
            print(a)
```
