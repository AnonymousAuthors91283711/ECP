This appears to be a formalization of a problem related to sums of binomial coefficients raised to a power, modulo (n+1). The problem seems to involve characterizing all exponents \(k\) such that for all positive integers \(n\), the sum \(\sum_{i=0}^n \binom{n}{i}^k\) is divisible by \((n+1)\).

Given the structure, it's reminiscent of classical identities involving binomial sums, possibly related to Lucas theorem, binomial identities, or properties of binomial coefficients modulo prime or composite numbers. 

To conjecture the set of such \(k\), I will:
- Test small values of \(k\) and \(n\),
- Check the divisibility,
- Enumerate values where the property holds or fails,
- Use this to identify patterns or extremal candidates.

Here's a Python script that:
- Checks the sum for small \(n\) and \(k\),
- Finds all \(k\) up to a limit (say 50) satisfying the divisibility condition for all tested \(n\),
- Streams each valid \(k\),
- Outputs the potential set for further conjecture.

```python
from math import comb

# Limitations for testing
max_n = 20
max_k = 50

# Store candidates
valid_ks = set()

for k in range(1, max_k + 1):
    all_divisible = True
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        total = sum(comb(n, i)**k for i in range(n + 1))
        if total % (n + 1) != 0:
            all_divisible = False
            break
    if all_divisible:
        print(k)
        valid_ks.add(k)

# Optionally, we could analyze or output the set further
# For now, just printing the candidates found
print("Candidates for k:", sorted(valid_ks))
```
