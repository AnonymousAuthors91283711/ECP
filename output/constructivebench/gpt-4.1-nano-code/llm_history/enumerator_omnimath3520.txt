Let's analyze the problem step-by-step:

- The set is fixed: S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}
- For some answer `x`, removing `x` from S, the average of the remaining elements is 6.1.
- For all other elements `x'`, removing `x'` from S, the average remains 6.1 only when `x'` equals the answer.

This implies:
\[
\frac{\sum_{y \in S \setminus \{x\}} y}{|S \setminus \{x\}|} = 6.1
\]

We can compute the total sum of S:

\[
\sum_{y=1}^{11} y = 66
\]

Since removing `x`, the sum is:

\[
66 - x
\]

and the size of the remaining set:

\[
10
\]

So, the average condition becomes:

\[
\frac{66 - x}{10} = 6.1
\]

Solution:

\[
66 - x = 6.1 \times 10 = 61
\]
\[
x = 66 - 61 = 5
\]

We must verify whether this candidate `x=5` satisfies the additional condition: when removing any other element, the average should not be 6.1. Let's check the average when removing any `x' \neq 5`:

\[
\frac{66 - x'}{10}
\]

- For `x' = 5`, the average is:

\[
(66 - 5)/10 = 61/10 = 6.1
\]

- For `x' \neq 5`, verify:

\[
\neq 6.1
\]
which translates to:

\[
(66 - x')/10 \neq 6.1
\]
or,

\[
66 - x' \neq 61
\]

which is true for all `x' \neq 5`. Therefore, the only `x` that makes the condition true is `x=5`.

Let's write a small enumeration code to verify this systematically:

```python
# Enumerate all elements to verify the solution
S = set(range(1, 12))
target_average = 6.1

for x in S:
    remaining = S - {x}
    total_sum = sum(remaining)
    avg = total_sum / len(remaining)
    # Check if the average is equal to 6.1
    if abs(avg - target_average) < 1e-9:
        print(f"Candidate answer: {x} with sum {total_sum} and average {avg}")
# Also verify that for all other x', the average isn't 6.1
for x in S:
    remaining = S - {x}
    avg = sum(remaining) / len(remaining)
    assert abs(avg - target_average) < 1e-9 or x != 5
```
