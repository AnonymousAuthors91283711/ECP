To simplify the expression, substitute \( T = 362 \) and \( K = \sqrt{T - 1} = \sqrt{361} = 19 \). Then, evaluate the absolute value expression:

\[
|( (K - 20)(K + 1) + 19K - K^2 )| = | ( (19 - 20)(20) + 19 \cdot 19 - 19^2 )| = | (-1)(20) + 361 - 361 | = | -20 | = 20
\]

This pattern suggests the answer is constant at 20 when substituting known values. Hence, the answer is 20.0.

. Enumerated Answers: 20.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The core issue is that the answer is defined as an abbreviation `olympiadbench3028_answer : ℝ := sorry`, but you attempted to assign it a textual explanation instead of a concrete real value. To fix this, we need to define `olympiadbench3028_answer` as the computed real value 20.0, based on the given substitutions and calculations.

Given the calculation: with \(T = 362\), \(K = \sqrt{361} = 19\),
the expression

\[
|( (K - 20)(K + 1) + 19K - K^2 )| = |(-1)(20) + 361 - 361| = | -20 | = 20
\]

Thus, the answer is the constant real number 20.0.

To adhere to the style and requirements, the correct way is:

1. Define `olympiadbench3028_answer` as `20.0`.
2. State the theorem with the explicit calculation, confirming the value matches.

Since the code snippet is just to assign the answer, the fix involves replacing `sorry` with `20.0` in the definition, and the theorem can directly state that the expression equals this value.

**Final Answer:**
```lean
<<<20.0>>>

. Enumerated Answers: 20.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The core issue is that in Lean, the answer should be a definition of a real number, but the syntax `<<<20.0>>>` is invalid. Instead, the answer should directly assign the real number `20.0` to `olympiadbench3028_answer`. 

Given the problem involves constants `T = 362` and `K = sqrt(T - 1)`, and the expression involves a combination of `K` and `K^2`, the numerical answer has been empirically verified as 20.0. Since `20.0` is a valid real number literal in Lean, I will use `20.0` directly.

Furthermore, the original apparent intention was to define `olympiadbench3028_answer` as a constant real number (20.0). The syntax should be:

```lean
abbrev olympiadbench3028_answer : ℝ := 20.0
```

To conform with the required format of output only the answer enclosed in delimiters, I propose:

<<<20.0>>>

This is a valid real number in Lean and will eliminate the syntax error caused by the invalid tokens `<<<` and `>>>`.

The current proposed answer incorrectly reuses the 'abbrev' keyword inside an expression and repeats the declaration, resulting in a syntax error. Instead, the answer should be a direct real number constant, as indicated by the enumerated answer 20.0. Given that the expression involves algebraic and square root operations, and the enumeration suggests the answer is a simple real number, the most consistent closed-form answer is exactly 20.0.

Thus, the fixed answer should omit the 'abbrev' declaration inside the answer and directly assign the real number:

<<<20.0>>>
