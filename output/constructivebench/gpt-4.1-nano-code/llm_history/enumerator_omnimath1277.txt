The problem involves finding the greatest natural number \( n \) such that there exists a list \( l \) of pairs (positions in a 7x7 grid) with specific constraints: starting at (0,0), the list contains no duplicates, consecutive pairs differ by at most 1 in each coordinate, and no consecutive pairs share the same second coordinate. Essentially, this resembles constructing a maximum-length path in a grid with constraints on step size and movement.

Since exact proof and exhaustive checking are complex algebraically, a practical approach is to generate all sequences starting from (0,0) up to a reasonable length, respecting the rules, and determine the maximum length found.

The code below enumerates sequences by depth-first search (DFS), starting from (0,0), exploring all valid next steps, and keeps track of the longest sequence found.

```python
# Enumerates maximum path length in a 7x7 grid with constraints:
# - start at (0,0)
# - steps differ by at most 1 in each coordinate
# - consecutive pairs have different second coordinate
# - no duplicate positions

max_length = 0
visited_global = set()

def dfs(path, visited):
    global max_length
    max_length = max(max_length, len(path))
    last = path[-1]
    for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:
        for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:
            if dx == 0 and dy == 0:
                continue
            next_point = (last[0] + dx, last[1] + dy)
            if 0 <= next_point[0] <= 6 and 0 <= next_point[1] <= 6:
                if next_point not in visited:
                    # Enforce different second coordinate from previous
                    if next_point[1] != last[1]:
                        visited.add(next_point)
                        dfs(path + [next_point], visited)
                        visited.remove(next_point)

# Start from (0,0)
start = (0,0)
dfs([start], {start})
print("Maximum sequence length found:", max_length)
```
