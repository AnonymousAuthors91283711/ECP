noncomputable abbrev P2018AMCA_14_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem P2018AMCA_14 (x : ℝ) (hx1 : x > 0) (hx2 : 3 * x ≠ 1) (hx3 : 2 * x ≠ 1) :
    logb (3 * x) 4 = logb (2 * x) 8 ↔ x = P2018AMCA_14_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Candidate solution for x: 0.75
Candidate solution for x: 0.75
. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Since the equality of logarithms implies (3 * x)^(1) = (2 * x)^(3), solving yields x = 3/4. The general form in ℚ is then 3/4. 

<<<(3:ℚ) / 4>>>
