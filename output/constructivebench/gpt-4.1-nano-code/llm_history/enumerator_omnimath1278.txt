The problem asks us to determine the value of \(f(-2)\) given a functional equation involving \(f : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{Q}\):

\[
3f\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) + \frac{2f(x)}{x} = x^2 \quad \text{for all } x \neq 0
\]

To solve this, we will:
- Explore specific values such as \(x=1\) and \(x=-1\).
- Use these to find \(f(1)\) and \(f(-1)\).
- Seek a potential explicit form for \(f(x)\).
- Then evaluate \(f(-2)\).

Let's implement this in a Python program to enumerate candidate solutions and find \(f(-2)\).

```python
# Explore the functional equation by plugging in specific values
# and solving for f at particular points.

# Since the equation is symmetric in reciprocal, test x=1 and x=-1
x_values = [1, -1]
solutions = {}

# For each x, plug into the functional equation:
# 3f(1/x) + (2f(x))/x = x^2
# For x=1: 3f(1) + 2f(1) = 1^2 -> 3f(1) + 2f(1) = 1
# => 5f(1) = 1 => f(1) = 1/5
f1 = 1/5
solutions[1] = f1

# For x=-1: 3f(-1) + (2f(-1))/(-1) = 1
# 3f(-1) - 2f(-1) = 1 -> (3-2)f(-1)=1 -> f(-1)=1
f_minus1 = 1
solutions[-1] = f_minus1

# Now, test x=2:
# 3f(1/2) + (2f(2))/2 = 4
# 3f(0.5) + f(2) = 4

# Test x=0.5:
# 3f(2) + (2f(0.5))/0.5 = (0.5)^2=0.25
# 3f(2) + 4f(0.5) = 0.25

# Set up a system:
# 3f(0.5) + f(2) = 4  ...(1)
# 4f(0.5) + 3f(2) = 0.25 ...(2)

# Solve for f(2) and f(0.5):

# From (1): f(2)=4 - 3f(0.5)
# Substitute into (2):
# 4f(0.5)+3(4 -3f(0.5))=0.25
# 4f(0.5)+12 -9f(0.5)=0.25
# (4f(0.5)-9f(0.5))=0.25 -12
# -5f(0.5)=-11.75
# f(0.5)=11.75/5=2.35

f_half = 2.35
f2 = 4 - 3*f_half # from (1)
# f(2)=4 - 3*2.35=4 - 7.05=-3.05

# Now, check f(-2):
# For x=-2: 3f(-0.5) + (2f(-2))/(-2) = 4
# which simplifies to 3f(-0.5) - f(-2)=4

# To find f(-0.5):
# Substitute x= -0.5:
# 3f(-2)+ (2f(-0.5))/(-0.5)= 0.25
# 3f(-2) -4f(-0.5)=0.25

# These two equations in f(-0.5) and f(-2):
# 3f(-0.5) - f(-2)=4 ...(a)
# 3f(-2) -4f(-0.5)=0.25 ...(b)

# Solve system:
# From (a): f(-2)=3f(-0.5)-4
# Plug into (b):
# 3(3f(-0.5)-4) -4f(-0.5)=0.25
# 9f(-0.5)-12 -4f(-0.5)=0.25
# (9f(-0.5)-4f(-0.5))=12.25
# 5f(-0.5)=12.25
# f(-0.5)=12.25/5=2.45

# Then, f(-2)=3*2.45 -4=7.35-4=3.35

# Final answer: f(-2)=3.35

# As an approximation, our enumeration suggests f(-2)â‰ˆ3.35
# For an exact rational solution, further algebraic solving is necessary.
