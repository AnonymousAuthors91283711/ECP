This problem involves computing the expected number of moves in a certain process involving divisibility among numbers generated from 1 to 20, where zero is erased. The key step is evaluating the sum of reciprocals of the counts of divisors within the set; because the problem's notation involves finsets and divisibility considerations, an enumeration approach for small sets can give insight or an approximate answer. We will generate the relevant set, compute how many elements are divisible by each number, sum reciprocals, and determine the expected value.

```python
# Enumerate a set of numbers generated by shifting 0..19 by 1 (i.e., 1..20)
numbers = list(range(1, 21))
# We exclude 0 as per the problem statement, but here 0 is not in the set, so no need to erase
# Compute the set of divisors count for each number
div_counts = {}
for d in range(1, 21):
    count = sum(1 for n in numbers if n % d == 0)
    div_counts[d] = count

# Sum of reciprocals of counts
expected_moves = sum(1 / count for count in div_counts.values())

print("Digits:", numbers)
print("Divisors count per number:", div_counts)
print("Expected moves:", expected_moves)
```
