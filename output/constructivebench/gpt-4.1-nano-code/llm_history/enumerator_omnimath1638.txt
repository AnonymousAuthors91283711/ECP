The problem asks to analyze the sum of certain terms over a range, specifically summing `n` from 50 to 100 where `(2 * n + 3)` does **not** divide `(2^(n!) - 1)`. The goal is to find the sum of all such `n`.

Approach:
- Generate `n` from 50 to 100.
- Check whether `(2 * n + 3)` divides `(2^(n!) - 1)`.
- Sum all `n` where this divisibility does **not** hold.
- Stream results as they are computed.
- Conclude with the total sum.

This is feasible because:
- We only check 51 numbers.
- Calculations are manageable with Python's arbitrary-precision integers.

Let's implement the enumeration:

```python
# Python program to find the sum of n in [50..100] where (2 * n + 3) does not divide (2^(n!) - 1)
import math

def divides(a, b):
    return b % a == 0

result_sum = 0
for n in range(50, 101):
    base = 2 * n + 3
    factorial = math.factorial(n)
    # Compute 2^(n!) - 1
    power = pow(2, factorial) - 1
    # Check divisibility
    if not divides(base, power):
        print(n)  # output n immediately if condition holds
        result_sum += n

print("Sum:", result_sum)
```
