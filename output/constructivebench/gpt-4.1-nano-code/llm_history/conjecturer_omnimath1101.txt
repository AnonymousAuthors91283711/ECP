Total count: 22. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the pattern in the enumerated solutions, the solutions satisfy 2^m * n - 2^n * m = 2^k, which resembles powers of 2 and their exponents' relations. Noting observed solutions, the set of (k, m, n) corresponds to M = 2^{n} - 1, K = n - 1, and N = n. Hence, the total number of solutions up to 100 is 22, there are 22 such solutions.

Thus, the answer is the total count, 22:

<<<22>>>
