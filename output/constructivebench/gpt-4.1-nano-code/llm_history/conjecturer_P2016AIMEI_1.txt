. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the geometric series formulas, the sum of ∑' n : ℕ, a^n is 1/(1 - a), and for (-a)^n it is 1/(1 + a), provided -1 < a < 1. The product simplifies to (1/(1 - a)) * (1/(1 + a)) = 1/(1 - a^2). The sum is then (1/(1 - a)) + (1/(1 + a)) = (2)/(1 - a^2). Given the product equals 2016, deduce the sum as 2 times the product, which is 2 * 2016 = 4032.

. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The core issue is that the abbreviation `P2016AIMEI_1_answer` is specified as a constant of type `ℝ`, but the proposed answer `fun _ => 4032` is a function, not a real number. In Lean, to define a constant of type `ℝ`, we should directly assign a real number, not a function.

Given the enumeration "4032" and the typical approach to such exercises, the final answer should be the constant real number 4032. 

To fix the error: replace `fun _ => 4032` with the constant `4032` directly, since `4032` is a `Nat`, and Lean allows interpreting `Nat` as `ℝ` via the coercion from `Nat` to `ℝ`.

Therefore, the corrected answer is simply `4032`, which is of type `ℝ` within the `Mathlib` environment.

**Final answer:**
