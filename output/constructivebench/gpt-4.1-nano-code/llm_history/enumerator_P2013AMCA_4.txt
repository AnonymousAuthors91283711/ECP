The problem appears to be asking for the value of 

\[
\frac{2^{2014} + 2^{2012}}{2^{2014} - 2^{2012}}
\]

which involves large exponents, but can be simplified algebraically before attempting enumeration. To help form a conjecture, we'll compute values at smaller, manageable exponents that resemble the structure to recognize a pattern. Specifically, observe the expression:

\[
\frac{2^{n} + 2^{n-2}}{2^{n} - 2^{n-2}}
\]

which simplifies algebraically.

We'll pick small integers for \(n\) and enumerate possible simplified fractions, then identify the pattern to conjecture the answer at \(n=2014\). The code will generate these ratios for small \(n\) and output the pattern.

```python
# Enumerate ratios for small n to observe the pattern in the expression:
# (2^n + 2^{n-2}) / (2^n - 2^{n-2})

# We'll consider n = 2, 4, 6, 8 to see the pattern
for n in range(2, 10, 2):
    numerator = 2**n + 2**(n - 2)
    denominator = 2**n - 2**(n - 2)
    ratio = numerator / denominator
    # Simplify ratio as a fraction
    from fractions import Fraction
    frac = Fraction(numerator, denominator)
    print(f"n = {n}: ratio = {ratio} (exact fraction = {frac})")
```
