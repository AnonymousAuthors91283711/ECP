Let's analyze the problem carefully:

Given `m, n` with `m â‰¥ n > 0`, we look at the set \( A = \{ k \in \mathbb{N} \mid 0 < k \text{ and } |\log m - \log k| < \log n \} \). The conditions are:

- \( A \) is finite.
- The number of elements in \( A \) is exactly 50.
- \( s = m \times n \).

Our goal: Find the greatest possible \( s \).

Since the set involves logarithms, the condition \( |\log m - \log k| < \log n \) can be rewritten as:

\[
-\log n < \log m - \log k < \log n,
\]
which implies

\[
\log m - \log n < \log k < \log m + \log n.
\]

Exponentiating:

\[
e^{\log m - \log n} = \frac{m}{n} < k < m \times n.
\]

But note that \( |\log m - \log k| < \log n \) is equivalent to:

\[
e^{-\log n} < \frac{k}{m} < e^{\log n},
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
\frac{m}{n} < k < m n.
\]

Rearranged, the possible \( k \) are integers strictly between \( m / n \) and \( m n \). But since \( k \) must be positive, and the inequalities are strict:

\[
k \in (\frac{m}{n}, m n),
\]
and \( k \in \mathbb{N} \).

We also need the set of such \( k \) to have exactly 50 elements.

---

### Approach:

- For fixed \( m, n \),
- Determine the integers strictly between \( m/n \) and \( m n \).
- Count those integers; if exactly 50, compute \( s = m n \) and keep track of the maximum.

---

### Implementation plan:

- Fix small \( n \), from 1 to 20 (arbitrary small range).
- For each \( n \), vary \( m \) starting from \( n \) (since \( m \geq n \)), increasing until the count of relevant \( k \) exceeds 50.
- Count integers \( k \) with \( \lfloor m / n \rfloor + 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor m n \rfloor \), ensuring the count is 50.
- Record the maximum \( s = m n \).

This approach is efficient enough for such small ranges.

```python
# Enumerate small values of n and m to find where exactly 50 integers k satisfy
# (m/n < k < m n), i.e., count of integers between m/n and m n.

max_s = 0  # track maximum s = m * n
for n in range(1, 21):  # small n
    for m in range(n, 50):  # start from m >= n, up to some upper limit
        lower_bound = m / n
        upper_bound = m * n
        # Count integers strictly between lower_bound and upper_bound
        low_int = int(lower_bound) + 1 if lower_bound != int(lower_bound) else int(lower_bound) + 1
        high_int = int(upper_bound)  # because strictly less than m n, so largest k < m n
        count = max(0, high_int - low_int)
        if count == 50:
            s = m * n
            print(f"Found candidate: m={m}, n={n}, s={s}")
            if s > max_s:
                max_s = s

print(f"Maximum s with exactly 50 such k: {max_s}")
```
