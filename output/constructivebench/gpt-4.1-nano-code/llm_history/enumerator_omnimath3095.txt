The problem involves a finite set of 5 players, and the equation relates to the number of ways to choose pairs from these players, multiplied by 3, equaling some answer. The expression `players.card.choose 2` suggests counting pairs among the players.

Given the nature of the problem and the use of `Finset` with cardinality 5, the number of pairs among 5 players is \(\binom{5}{2} = 10\). Multiplying that by 3 yields \(3 \times 10 = 30\). The theorem seems to be stating that \(3 \times \binom{5}{2}\) equals some answer, which should be 30.

To help clarify and verify, we'll write a Python script that enumerates this calculation explicitly, considering the combinatorial choice for 5 elements.

```python
# Enumerate the number of pairs among 5 players and compute 3 times that value
from itertools import combinations

# Define the number of players
players_count = 5

# Generate all combinations of 2 players
players = range(1, players_count + 1)

# Count all pairs
pairs = list(combinations(players, 2))
number_of_pairs = len(pairs)
answer = 3 * number_of_pairs

print(f"Number of players: {players_count}")
print(f"Number of pairs: {number_of_pairs}")
print(f"Answer (3 * pairs): {answer}")
```

This code explicitly enumerates all pairs for 5 players, computes their count, multiplies by 3, and outputs the result for straightforward verification.
