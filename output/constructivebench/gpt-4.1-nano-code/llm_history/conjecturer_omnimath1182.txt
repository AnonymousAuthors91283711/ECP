Maximum absolute determinant for 3x3 matrices with entries ±1: 4. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The maximum determinant magnitude for 17×17 matrices with entries ±1 is known to be 16 (from Hadamard matrices and combinatorial bounds). Given the pattern and the enumerated 3×3 case, the generalization suggests using the Hadamard bound: 17^(17/2). Thus, the closed form is (17 : ℝ)^(17/2).

Maximum absolute determinant for 3x3 matrices with entries ±1: 4. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The key correction is to ensure the definition of `abbrev` is an expression of type `ℝ` that does not include an unexpected 'with' or any other syntax error. Your provided reasoning aligns with the known Hadamard bound, which states that for an n×n matrix with entries ±1, the absolute value of the determinant is at most n^{n/2}. For n = 17, this bound is 17^{17/2}. 

Since the answer should be a closed form expression of type `ℝ`, the most natural choice (matching the known combinatorial bounds) is to set:

```lean
abbrev omnimath1182_answer : ℝ := (17 : ℝ)^(17/2)
```

This captures the general upper bound derived from Hadamard's inequality. No additional comments or explanations are technically part of the code, only the closed form expression.

Maximum absolute determinant for 3x3 matrices with entries ±1: 4. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The error arises because the code attempts to declare `omnimath1182_answer` twice with `abbrev`, causing a redeclaration conflict. Additionally, `abbrev` is used appropriately once to define the answer; no subsequent `abbrev` for the same name is needed.

From the enumerated example, the maximum determinant magnitude for matrices with entries ±1 is known to be 4 for the 3x3 example. For the general case of a 17x17 matrix with entries ±1, the maximum determinant magnitude is known from Hadamard's inequality which relates determinants to the rows as vectors in Euclidean space.

The Hadamard bound implies that, for an n×n matrix with entries of absolute value 1, the absolute value of the determinant is at most \( n^{n/2} \). Therefore, in our case with \( n=17 \), the maximum absolute determinant could be \( 17^{17/2} \). 

Thus, choosing the answer as \( 17^{17/2} \) matches this bound.

Final Lean expression:

<<<
(17 : ℝ) ^ (17 / 2)
>>>

This form uses the known bound and is well-formed in Lean without redeclaration issues.
