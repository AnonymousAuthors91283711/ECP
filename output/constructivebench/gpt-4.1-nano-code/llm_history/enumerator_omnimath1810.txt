This problem involves finding all pairs \((x, y)\) of real numbers satisfying both equations:

\[
x^2 + y = 12 \quad \text{and} \quad y^2 + x = 12
\]

To solve this systematically, we can:
- Express \( y \) from the first: \( y = 12 - x^2 \)
- Substitute into the second: \( (12 - x^2)^2 + x = 12 \)

We then solve for \( x \), and for each \( x \), determine \( y \). To assist in reasoning, we will:
- Enumerate candidate \( x \) values in a reasonable range, here say from \(-10\) to \(10\)
- Check if the substituted \( y \) satisfies the second equation within a small tolerance

This approach avoids overly complex symbolic solving, aligning with the request to generate candidate solutions and stream results immediately.

```python
import math

# Function to check if a candidate pair (x, y) satisfies both equations within tolerance
def check_solution(x, y, tol=1e-7):
    eq1 = abs(x**2 + y - 12)
    eq2 = abs(y**2 + x - 12)
    return eq1 < tol and eq2 < tol

solutions_found = set()

# Enumerate x from -10 to 10 in small steps to find approximate solutions
for xi in [x/100 for x in range(-1000, 1001)]:
    yi = 12 - xi**2
    if check_solution(xi, yi):
        sol = (round(xi, 8), round(yi, 8))
        if sol not in solutions_found:
            solutions_found.add(sol)
            print(f"Found solution: x = {sol[0]}, y = {sol[1]}")

# Note: For exact solutions, algebraic methods could be used, but here we approximate with enumeration.
```
