The problem looks like it's about verifying or exploring the arithmetic of 2020 - 25. To aid in conjecturing or confirming the answer, we can write a simple Python enumerator to generate possible results and check their correctness, especially since the task wants us to explore answers and print each one immediately during enumeration.

Here's a Python script that enumerates candidate answers for 2020 - 25, prioritizes exact calculations, and outputs the results to help verify the answer:

```python
# Enumerate and verify possible answers for 2020 - 25.
# Since this is straightforward, we generate candidates around expected results.

target = 2020 - 25  # Expected value, used to guide enumeration
candidates = range(target - 5, target + 6)  # sample range around expected answer

for answer in candidates:
    # Print each candidate answer immediately
    print(f"Trying answer: {answer}")
    if answer == target:
        print(f"Found exact match: 2020 - 25 = {answer}")
```
