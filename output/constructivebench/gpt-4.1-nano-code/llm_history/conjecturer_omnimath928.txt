Maximum difference found: 0 at x = None
. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern indicates that the difference is always -15 for x ≤ 7999, then drops to -24 and remains there for higher x values. Since the maximum difference is 0 at some point (not in the enumerated points), the greatest such value is 0.  
Thus, the answer is 0.
