The maximum subset size is 2: include pairs (α,α,α) with distinct second and third components.  
This matches enumerations where sizes reach 2 and 1 otherwise, so answer is 16 - 14 = 2.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

In the problem, we seek the maximum size n of a subset with certain properties, specifically the size of a set of triplets over α, which possibly satisfy certain uniqueness conditions per coordinate. The enumeration indicates the sizes are 1 or 2, with the maximum being 2. 

The key insight from the enumeration is that the largest set size with the properties is 2. The property "w₁.1 ≠ w₂.2.2" suggests an anti-symmetry or a disjointness constraint. Since α has size 16, we can find two such triplets satisfying all constraints, but not three, which makes 2 the maximum size.

The fix for the Lean expression should be a constant ℕ value, namely 2, representing this maximum size, since higher n would violate the constraints per the enumeration. 

Therefore, the corrected and generalizable answer:

Based on the problem statement and enumerated data, the goal appears to find the maximum number of triples `(a, b, c)` in a subset of `α × α × α` of size at most 16 (since `|α|=16`) that satisfies the constraints, particularly that no two triples share the same `a` and `c` in conflicting positions (specifically, for any `w₁, w₂`, `w₁.1 ≠ w₂.2.2`). 

The best possible subset seems to maximize the number of such triples. The enumeration suggests the maximum potential size is 2.

Considering the constraints, the maximum size of this set should be 2, because:
- We are choosing triples with unique "start" and "end" elements.
- The total number of such triples can't exceed a small number due to the constraints.

Thus, the answer is 2.

The error in the original code stems from `abbrev omnimath765_answer : ℕ := sorry`, which is replaced with an explicit numeric answer. The function was intended as a constant giving the maximal subset size.

Final correct implementation:

<<<2>>>

This fixed the type mismatch error and aligns with the enumerated data.
