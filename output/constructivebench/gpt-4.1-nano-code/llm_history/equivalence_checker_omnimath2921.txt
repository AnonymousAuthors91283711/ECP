Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: 315
<<<True>>>
The problem asks for the least positive natural number \( k \) that is divisible by 3, 5, 7, and 9. The proposed answer is 315, which is the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers. 

- The LCM of 3, 5, and 7 is \( 3 \times 5 \times 7 = 105 \). 
- Since 9 is \( 3^2 \), the LCM must include the higher power of 3, so the LCM becomes \( 3^2 \times 5 \times 7 = 315 \). 

Thus, 315 is indeed the smallest positive integer divisible by all the given numbers. The ground truth answer is not provided, but the proposed answer is correct.
