The problem defines a specific value of \( r = \sqrt{\sqrt{53}/2 + 3/2} \) and relates \( r^{100} \) to a polynomial expression involving parameters \( a, b, c \in \mathbb{N} \). It asks to relate the parameters \( a, b, c \) to an expression \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \).

Given the structure, it appears that for the specific \( r \), the equation:

\[
r^{100} = 2 r^{98} + 14 r^{96} + 11 r^{94} - r^{50} + a r^{46} + b r^{44} + c r^{40}
\]

has a unique solution in parameters \((a, b, c)\). To assist conjecture and verification, I will evaluate \( r \) numerically and compute the polynomial for decreasing \( a, b, c \) values, starting from small positive integers upward, to find the parameters that satisfy the relation or approximate it.

The plan:
- Calculate \( r \) numerically with high enough precision.
- For small \( a, b, c \), evaluate the right side and compare with \( r^{100} \).
- When the relation holds approximately within a tolerable error (say, \( 10^{-9} \)), record the corresponding \( a, b, c \).
- Then compute \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 \) for such solutions, streaming the answers immediately.

This approach is efficient because:
- \( a, b, c \) are positive integers.
- We limit the search to small ranges (e.g., 1 to 20).
- We stop when we find a match within tolerance.
- We print each match as it appears.

```python
import math

# Calculate r based on the given formula
sqrt_53 = math.sqrt(53)
r = math.sqrt(sqrt_53 / 2 + 3 / 2)

# Compute r powers efficiently
r_pow = [r]
for _ in range(1, 101):
    r_pow.append(r_pow[-1] * r)

r_50, r_40, r_44, r_46 = r_pow[50], r_pow[40], r_pow[44], r_pow[46]
r_94, r_96, r_98, r_100 = r_pow[94], r_pow[96], r_pow[98], r_pow[100]

target = r_100

# Tolerance for approximate equality
tol = 1e-9

# Search space for a, b, c
max_val = 20

for a in range(1, max_val + 1):
    for b in range(1, max_val + 1):
        for c in range(1, max_val + 1):
            expr = (2 * r_98 + 14 * r_96 + 11 * r_94
                    - r_50 + a * r_46 + b * r_44 + c * r_40)
            if abs(expr - target) < tol:
                # Found a candidate solution
                answer = a ** 2 + b ** 2 + c ** 2
                print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c} => a^2+b^2+c^2={answer}")

The program attempts to find integer triples (a, b, c) within small bounds (1 to 20) that satisfy a highly precise numerical equation involving powers of r. Since r is an irrational number (~2.052...), the exact equality is unlikely to be satisfied within a tolerance of 1e-9 for such small integer ranges. The code only prints an answer when the approximation error is less than tol, but the comment indicates no matches are found, resulting in no output.

The problem itself appears to evaluate a power-based equation, with an equivalence to a statement about a^2 + b^2 + c^2. It hints that the solution involves a minimal sum of squares, probably linked to the structure of the equation.

Given the code's search space and the tight tolerance, it is unlikely to find exact solutions, especially considering the irrational r. It appears the current approach does not account for the fact that the true solution might involve larger values or approximate solutions.

**Judgment:**
- The program currently produces no output, which does not meet the requirement to print answers immediately as solutions are found.
- It also uses a very tight tolerance for approximate equality (1e-9), which may be too strict given floating-point approximations of irrational numbers and integer parameters.
- The problem's instructions emphasize that all candidates should be enumerated up to a threshold, and the minimal value should be explicitly printed.

**Acceptance:**
Rejected, because the program outputs nothing, violating the requirement for streaming partial answers and covering the entire candidate space up to the limit.

---

**Corrected Program:**
- Increase the tolerance if necessary, but preferably, implement a way to handle irrational approximations better.
- Also, since the problem probably aims to find the minimal sum of squares of (a, b, c) satisfying the equation, we should store candidates and after enumeration, output the minimal.

The problem as given is a formal Lean theorem with a complex algebraic condition involving roots and natural numbers. It appears to be asking for specific triplet values `(a, b, c)` satisfying a polynomial equation in `r`, with `r` defined as a nested radical. The theorem signature indicates that only the unique triplet `(a, b, c)` solves the equation for the given `r`, and the goal is to relate the sum of their squares to some constant `omnimath2791_answer`.

However, the provided "code" is just a placeholder with no actual implementation or enumeration. The problem states that the enumeration failed with an empty program, indicating no answers were produced.

Given the nature of the problem:
- It involves a specific radical `r = sqrt(sqrt(53)/2 + 3/2)`.
- It relates to solving for `(a, b, c)` in natural numbers satisfying a polynomial expression in `r`.
- Likely, the unique solution `(a, b, c)` is expected to be found via enumeration.

Since the original program contains no code, it should be rejected: it cannot produce any answers, thus violating the problem requirement to enumerate solutions.

**Judgement:**
- The solution should be accepted only if it properly enumerates candidate `(a, b, c)` up to some manageable thresholds, checks whether the equation holds, and then outputs the sum `a^2 + b^2 + c^2` for the unique solution, or confirms it's unique.

**Decision:**
<<<False>>>

**Corrected Program:**
```python
import math

# Define the target radical as per the problem
r = math.sqrt(math.sqrt(53)/2 + 3/2)

# Set reasonable bounds for enumeration for small natural numbers
max_coeff = 20  # Adjust as needed for completeness

# Initialize variable to store the found solution
solution_found = False
candidate_sum = None

for a in range(1, max_coeff + 1):
    for b in range(1, max_coeff + 1):
        for c in range(1, max_coeff + 1):
            # Compute the polynomial at r
            val = (r**100
                   - 2 * r**98
                   - 14 * r**96
                   - 11 * r**94
                   + r**50
