The problem appears to involve geometric configurations: points on a circle and a another circle passing through these points, with a relation on the centers. To assist in conjecturing the minimal value for hk, we can systematically explore possible (h,k) pairs with constraints from the circle equations and the linear relation h + k, then look for the least possible value.

We'll choose a small, manageable grid for x, y, h, k to sample potential solutions, verifying the conditions and outputting results immediately when conditions are nearly satisfied. This will help in identifying the minimal value of h*k or h+k depending on your goal.

```python
# Enumerate over small ranges of x, y, h, k to find candidates satisfying the circle equations and h + k
import math

# Tolerance for approximate equality
tol = 1e-6

# Initialize minimal h * k
min_hk = None

print("Sampling candidate solutions:")

# Explore ranges for x, y, h, k
for x in [i * 0.1 for i in range(-10, 11)]:
    for y in [j * 0.1 for j in range(-10, 11)]:
        # Compute x^2 + y^2, check if close to 1
        if abs(x**2 + y**2 - 1) > tol:
            continue
        # For each h, k, check the second circle condition
        for h in [i * 0.1 for i in range(-20, 21)]:
            for k in [j * 0.1 for j in range(-20, 21)]:
                # Check circle centered at h,k with radius 2 passes through x,y
                dist = math.sqrt((x - h)**2 + (y - k)**2)
                if abs(dist - 2) > tol:
                    continue
                # Check h + k condition or note it
                sum_hk = h + k
                # For the given sum, keep track of minimal h*k if needed
                hk_value = h * k
                # Save or print when conditions nearly match
                print(f"Found candidate: (x,y)=({x:.1f},{y:.1f}), (h,k)=({h:.1f},{k:.1f}), h+k={sum_hk:.2f}")
                if min_hk is None or (h * k) < min_hk:
                    min_hk = h * k
# After enumeration, output the minimal h*k found
print(f"\nApproximate minimal h*k found: {min_hk}")
```
