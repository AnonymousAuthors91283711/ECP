theorem omnimath377 : 
  (Finset.univ (α := Fin 6 × Fin 6)).sum (fun d => if (d.1 + 1 + d.2 + 1) % 5 = 0 then (1 : ℚ)/36 else 0) = omnimath377_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Pair: (0, 3) matches condition
Pair: (1, 2) matches condition
Pair: (2, 1) matches condition
Pair: (3, 0) matches condition
Pair: (3, 5) matches condition
Pair: (4, 4) matches condition
Pair: (5, 3) matches condition
Total pairs satisfying condition: 7
Answer: 0.19444444444444445. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Based on enumerated pairs, the pairs are those where (d.1 + 1 + d.2 + 1) mod 5 = 0. The total satisfying pairs are 7 out of 36.  
7/36 simplifies to 0.19444444444444445.  
Final answer in closed form: <<<((7 : ℚ) / 36)>>>.
