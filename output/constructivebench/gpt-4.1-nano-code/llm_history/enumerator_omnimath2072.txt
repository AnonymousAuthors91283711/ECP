The problem involves a geometric configuration in \( \mathbb{R}^3 \) involving four points \( s(i) \) forming a regular tetrahedron with mutual edge length 1, and a point \( p \) such that the sum of the squares of distances from \( p \) to \( s(i) \) is at most 15. The task is to find the volume of all such points \( p \) that satisfy this condition, which involves understanding the minimal and maximal positions of \( p \) relative to these tetrahedra.

Since the points \( s(i) \) form a regular tetrahedron with mutual distances 1, the minimal and maximal sum of squared distances \( \sum_{i} \text{dist}(p, s(i))^2 \) for points \( p \) in \( \mathbb{R}^3 \) can be characterized by the position of \( p \). The maximum occurs when \( p \) is farthest from the tetrahedron's centroid; the minimal occurs at the centroid.

To approximate this, fix the tetrahedron in space, compute the centroid, then evaluate the sum of squared distances over a grid or sample points around this centroid, for various positions \( p \).

Here's a program that:
- Defines a regular tetrahedron in \( \mathbb{R}^3 \)
- Samples points \( p \) on a grid near the centroid
- Computes the sum of squared distances to the vertices
- Checks if this sum is less than or equal to 15
- Calculates the volume of the region of points satisfying the inequality

This allows approximation of the volume, facilitating conjecture about the exact volume.

```python
import numpy as np

# Define vertices of a regular tetrahedron with edge length 1
# Placing one vertex at origin for simplicity
a = 0.5
b = np.sqrt(3)/2
vertices = np.array([
    [0, 0, 0],
    [1, 0, 0],
    [0.5, b, 0],
    [0.5, b/3, np.sqrt(2/3)]
])

# Compute centroid of the tetrahedron
centroid = np.mean(vertices, axis=0)

# Boundaries for sampling around centroid
sample_range = 2.5  # sample points within this radius
grid_size = 50  # number of samples along each axis

# Generate a grid of points around the centroid
lin = np.linspace(centroid[0] - sample_range, centroid[0] + sample_range, grid_size)
X, Y, Z = np.meshgrid(lin, lin, lin)
points = np.vstack([X.ravel(), Y.ravel(), Z.ravel()]).T

# Threshold for the sum of squared distances
threshold = 15

# List to store volume contributions
volume = 0
cell_volume = (2 * sample_range / grid_size) ** 3

for p in points:
    d2_sum = np.sum((vertices - p)**2, axis=1)
    total = np.sum(d2_sum)
    if total <= threshold:
        # point satisfies the inequality
        volume += cell_volume
        print(f"Point: {p}, sum of squared distances: {total:.2f}")

print(f"Approximate volume of region: {volume:.2f}")
```
