Maximum n: 49. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The provided answer attempts to define an option based on a variable `n`, but `n` is not bound or in scope in an abbrev. In Lean, an abbrev or def at the global scope cannot directly use `n` unless it is an argument or in scope through a lambda. The problem suggests that the answer is a constant (as per the enumerated answers, which are integers from 1 to 49), and the theorem quantifies over `n` but expects a concrete answer as a constant value.

Given the problem's context and the enumeration, it appears the intended answer is a fixed integer, specifically 1, which is the lowest possible value satisfying the problem's conditions (usually such problems consider the minimal such `n`). The structure of the proof hints that the answer does not depend on a particular `n`, but rather is a constant.

Thus, I will define the answer as the constant 1, which satisfies the pattern found in the enumeration, and matches the maximum `n` being 49 (implying the minimal such `n` is 1).

Final answer:
<<<1>>>
