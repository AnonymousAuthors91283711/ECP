Least n satisfying conditions: 7521. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The error arises because the candidate answer `(1000 * 7 + 500, 110)` is a tuple, which is not of type ℕ (natural number). The goal is to declare `omnimath1792_answer` as a specific ℕ, which is the minimal `n` satisfying the conditions. Based on the enumerated candidates, the minimal `n` matching the criteria is 7521, corresponding to the tuple `(a=7, b=5, c=2, d=1)`.

Therefore, the fixed answer should just be the number `7521`, which matches the minimal `n`. This aligns with the type ℕ and satisfies the theorem's assertion.
