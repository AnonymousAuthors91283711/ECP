The problem asks us to find all pairs of positive integers \((n, m)\) satisfying the equation \(n^2 + m^2 = 9364\), and then to explore these solutions. We want to generate all solutions by enumerating \(n\) and \(m\) up to appropriate bounds, with a focus on streaming results as we find them.

Since \(n, m > 0\), and \(n^2 + m^2 = 9364\), the maximum of \(n\) and \(m\) is roughly \(\sqrt{9364} \approx 97\). We will iterate over \(n\) and \(m\) from 1 to 97, check if they satisfy the condition, and print solutions as they are found.

This code will generate all solutions explicitly, streaming each answer immediately, and not hardcoding any ground-truth solutions.

```python
# Find all positive integer solutions to n^2 + m^2 = 9364
import math

MAX = int(math.isqrt(9364))  # maximum possible n or m
for n in range(1, MAX + 1):
    n_squared = n * n
    m_squared = 9364 - n_squared
    if m_squared <= 0:
        continue
    m = int(math.isqrt(m_squared))
    # Check if (n, m) is a solution, considering integer root
    if m > 0 and m * m == m_squared:
        print((n, m))
        # Also consider symmetry, since n and m are symmetric in the equation
        if n != m:
            print((m, n))
```
