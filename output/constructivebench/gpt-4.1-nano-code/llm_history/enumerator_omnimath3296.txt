[write_program]
The problem appears to involve combinatorics and permutations over finite sets, likely related to establishing the existence of certain structured functions or permutations, possibly akin to a variation of Van der Waerden or Hales-Jewett type theorems in a finite setting. To assist in conjecturing, I'll generate sample functions for small values of `n` starting at 3 and check the existence of mappings `M` with the described properties by enumerating small candidates. The program will print each candidate answer that fits the constraints, helping to understand or conjecture the nature of the problem.

The code snippet will:
- Fix small values of `n` (from 3 up to a manageable limit, e.g., 5)
- For each `n`, enumerate all possible functions `M : Fin n → Fin n → ℕ` within some bounded range
- For each `M`, check if the conditions specified (existence of certain `d, a` satisfying the bijective condition) are satisfied
- Generate permutations `σ` and check the second property
- Print each candidate answer `omnimath3296_answer n` when the condition is believed to hold or when findings suggest patterns

This code prioritizes efficiency by limiting the search space and constraints, and only outputs partial results to keep tokens within limits.
