This problem involves defining functions and proving the existence and uniqueness of the solution to a translated line equation. To assist, I'll write a Python script that:
- Defines the functions corresponding to `line` and `translated_line`.
- Finds the value of `x` for which `translated_line x = 0`.
- Checks if the solution is unique.
- Prints potential solutions and confirms the answer.

Since the equations are simple linear functions, the script will just symbolically or numerically solve for `x`. I'll enumerate candidates to verify that the solution is unique and output the answer.

```python
# Enumerate possible x values to find where translated_line(x) = 0
# Given translated_line(x) = (2 * x - 6) + 4 = 2 * x - 2
# Solve 2 * x - 2 = 0 -> x = 1
# We'll check for solutions around x=1 to demonstrate.

def line(x):
    return 2 * x - 6

def translated_line(x):
    return line(x) + 4

solutions = []

# Check a range around x=1
for x_int in range(-10, 11):  # example range
    val = translated_line(x_int)
    if abs(val) < 1e-8:
        solutions.append(x_int)
        print(f"Found solution: x = {x_int}")

# Confirm uniqueness
if len(solutions) == 1:
    answer = solutions[0]
    print(f"The unique solution is x = {answer}")
else:
    print("Multiple solutions or none found in the range.")
```
