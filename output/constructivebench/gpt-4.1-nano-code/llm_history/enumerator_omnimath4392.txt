The given problem involves a symmetric system of equations:

\[
\begin{cases}
x^2 = yz + 1 \\
y^2 = zx + 1 \\
z^2 = xy + 1
\end{cases}
\]

We are asked to find all integer solutions \((x, y, z)\) that satisfy these equations.

Since the equations are symmetric in \(x, y, z\), potential solutions might be small integers, possibly including \(\pm 1, 0, 2, -2,\) etc.

To assist in conjecture, we'll write a Python program that enumerates all integer triplets \((x, y, z)\) within a small bound (say, from -10 to 10). The program will immediately print solutions found, prioritizing exact solutions.

This approach will give us insight into possible solutions without hardcoding or assuming the ground-truth, helping us formulate a proof or further conjectures.

```python
# Enumerate all small integer triplets (x, y, z) within -10 to 10
# Check if they satisfy the system of equations
# Print solutions immediately as they are found
# Helps in conjecturing all solutions systematically

def main():
    bound = 10
    for x in range(-bound, bound + 1):
        for y in range(-bound, bound + 1):
            for z in range(-bound, bound + 1):
                if x*x == y*z + 1 and y*y == z*x + 1 and z*z == x*y + 1:
                    print((x, y, z))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
