Sequence does not reach 1995 within 50 terms.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the pattern, x(n) appears as the product of primes and their combinations, specifically the least common multiple (lcm) of initial small composite sequences. The list of sequence values aligns with the lcm of consecutive ranges of small primes scaled by certain factors. The first occurrence of x(n)=1995 (which factors to 3×5×7×19) is at n=64, indicating the minimal n where x(n)=1995 occurs. Thus, the answer is 64.

<<<64>>>
