Ground Truth Answer: 50
Proposed Answer: if 2 ≤ 20 ∧ 2 ≤ 20 then 14 * 2 + 11 * 2 + 2 * 0 else 0
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the maximum value of v = 14a + 11b + 2c under constraints:
   - a,b,c ≤ 20
   - 5a + 4b + c ≤ 18

2. Ground truth answer is 50, which can be achieved with a=2, b=2, c=0:
   - 5*2 + 4*2 + 0 = 18 ≤ 18
   - 14*2 + 11*2 + 2*0 = 28 + 22 + 0 = 50

3. Proposed answer gives the same combination (a=2, b=2, c=0) but:
   - It's conditional on 2 ≤ 20 (which is true)
   - It doesn't verify the constraint 5a + 4b + c ≤ 18
   - The else clause is irrelevant since the condition is true
   - It correctly calculates 50 for this case

The proposed answer gives the correct numerical result but fails to:
- Consider other possible combinations
- Verify the constraint
- Prove maximality
