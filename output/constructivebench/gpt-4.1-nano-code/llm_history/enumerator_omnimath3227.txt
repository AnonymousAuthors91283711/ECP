This problem involves analyzing the real part of a double product involving complex exponential functions over ranges from 0 to 2014, and relating it to the logarithm base 2.

Given the expression:
\[ \prod_{a=0}^{2014} \prod_{b=0}^{2014} \left( 1 + e^{2\pi i \frac{ab}{2015}} \right) \]
we are asked to evaluate its logarithm (base e), take its real part, and divide by \(\ln 2\).

This resembles properties of roots of unity and their sums/products. The key insight is that for prime modulus 2015, the inner product over b for fixed a resembles sums over roots of unity. The entire double product captures interactions among these roots.

**Approach:**
- For small samples, consider key values:
  - When a = 0, the product over b involves \(1 + e^{0}\) which is 2, repeated 2015 times => product = \(2^{2015}\).
  - For other values, the structure relates to sums over roots of unity; these often produce specific known values (sometimes 0, sometimes powers of 2).
- Because the problem is high school level but involves advanced functions, a reasonable conjecture, based on symmetry and properties of roots of unity, is that the entire product might simplify to a power of 2, allowing easy computation of the log.

Given that, I will write a program that:
- Computes the outer product for a small sample of a values (say, a=0, a=1, a=2).
- For each such a, computes the inner product over b.
- Prints the logs of these partial computations immediately to help in conjecture.

This should assist in finding the ratio of the real part of the logarithm to ln 2 and hence decide the answer.

```python
import math
import cmath

# Range for a and b
N = 2015

# Function to compute the inner product for fixed a
def compute_inner_product(a):
    product = 1+0j
    for b in range(N):
        angle = 2 * math.pi * a * b / N
        term = 1 + cmath.exp(1j * angle)
        product *= term
    return product

# Sample a values to observe patterns
samples = [0, 1, 2]
for a in samples:
    inner_prod = compute_inner_product(a)
    log_value = cmath.log(inner_prod)
    # Print real part of log and the magnitude
    print(f"a={a}: log value={log_value}, |product|={abs(inner_prod)}")
    # Focus on the real part of the log for the ratio
    ratio = log_value.real / math.log(2)
    print(f"a={a}: ratio={ratio}")
```
