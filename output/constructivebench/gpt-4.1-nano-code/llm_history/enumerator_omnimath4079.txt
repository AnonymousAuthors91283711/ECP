This problem involves finding all solutions to the equation \( 2^x + 9 \cdot 7^y = z^3 \) with non-negative integers \( x, y, z \). Since exhaustive enumeration might be necessary, we'll pick small bounds for \( x, y \), compute the corresponding \( z^3 \), and check if it's a perfect cube. We'll output all solutions we find.

To efficiently find solutions:
- Loop over small \( x \) and \( y \).
- Calculate \( 2^x + 9 \cdot 7^y \).
- Check if the sum is a perfect cube, and if so, add the solution \((x, y, z)\).

This approach is feasible for small ranges due to exponential growth.

```python
# Enumerate small values of x and y, check for perfect cubes in z
def is_perfect_cube(n):
    # Approximate cube root
    z = int(round(n ** (1/3)))
    return z ** 3 == n, z

solutions = []

# Choose small bounds for x and y
for x in range(20):
    for y in range(20):
        total = 2 ** x + 9 * 7 ** y
        is_cube, z = is_perfect_cube(total)
        if is_cube:
            # Ensure z >= 0
            solutions.append((x, y, z))
            print((x, y, z))
```
