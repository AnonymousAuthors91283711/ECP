This problem involves evaluating an expression of nested square roots: \( \sqrt{13 + \sqrt{7 + \sqrt{4}}} \). Our goal is to find its exact value or a close rational approximation, then prove the equality in the theorem.

The nested radical simplifies step-by-step:
- \(\sqrt{4} = 2\)
- Then \(7 + 2 = 9\), so \(\sqrt{9} = 3\)
- Next, \(13 + 3 = 16\), so \(\sqrt{16} = 4\)

Thus, the nested radical simplifies exactly to 4.

Below is a Python program that, through enumeration of small rational approximations, confirms that the expression equals 4.

```python
# Enumerate rational approximations to nested radicals.
# Since the nested radical reduces exactly to 4, we aim to confirm this.

# For small rational candidates between 3.95 and 4.05, check closeness.
import math

# Exact simplified value
exact_value = 4

# Search parameters
min_candidate = 3.95
max_candidate = 4.05
step = 0.0005

candidate = min_candidate
while candidate <= max_candidate:
    # Compute nested radical value for candidate
    val = math.sqrt(13 + math.sqrt(7 + math.sqrt(4)))
    # If close to candidate, print candidate and comparison
    if abs(val - candidate) < 1e-6:
        print("Candidate approximation:", candidate)
        print("Nested radical value =", val)
    candidate += step
```

This code confirms the nested radical simplifies to 4 exactly, aiding our conjecture and corresponding proof.
