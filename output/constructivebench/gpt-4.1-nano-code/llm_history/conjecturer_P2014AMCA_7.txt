theorem P2014AMCA_7 : 
  ∃ (r : ℝ), (√3) * r = 3^(1/3) ∧ (3^(1/3)) * r = 3^(1/6) ∧ (3^(1/6)) * r = P2014AMCA_7_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 1.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the pattern, to find r satisfying the equations with cube roots and square roots, the answer should be a known algebraic expression involving powers of 3. 

The equations imply that r relates these roots, namely \( r = 3^{\frac{1}{6}} \) as it simplifies the relationships:

1. \( \sqrt{3} \times r = 3^{1/3} \Rightarrow r = 3^{1/6} \).

2. \( 3^{1/3} \times r = 3^{1/6} \Rightarrow r = 3^{1/6} \).

3. Both relations confirm \( r = 3^{1/6} \).

Final answer:

<<<(3 : ℝ)^(1/6)>>>
