The problem seems to involve calculating the minimum or a specific value of a cost function based on parameters T and M, with constraints T = 100 and M = 30.5 * 60, and the cost formula involving a fixed base fee plus terms depending on T and M (with a maximum function). Since the code indicates "P2011AMCA_1" and the parameters look fixed, and the main task is to enumerate possible answers to assist a conjecture, I will try to find the minimum cost by exploring variations of M (around some small range) and T (which is fixed at 100).

Given the M value is fixed at 30.5 * 60 = 1830, the main variable component is the max term, which depends on M - 1800. So M > 1800, which makes the max term always M - 1800, i.e., 1830 - 1800 = 30.

However, to be thorough, I will enumerate M around the key bounds, and T around the known value, and compute the cost accordingly.

Here's the Python program to do that:

```python
# Program to enumerate possible cost values based on varying M around the threshold and fixed T,
# to assist in conjecturing the minimal cost.

# Fixed parameters
T_fixed = 100
M_fixed = 30.5 * 60  # 1830

# Range for M: around M_fixed, exploring M from 1800 to 1850 in steps
M_start = 1790
M_end = 1850
M_step = 1

# Since T is fixed at 100, only vary M to see how cost changes
for M in range(M_start, M_end + 1, M_step):
    max_term = max(0, M - 1800)
    cost = 20 + 0.05 * T_fixed + 0.1 * max_term
    # If M >= 1800, max_term = M -1800
    print(f"M = {M:.1f}, cost = {cost:.4f}")
```

This will print all candidate costs around the threshold to help see where the minimum is. Since T and M are mostly fixed, the minimal cost occurs at M = 1800, i.e., M just at the threshold.  
Thus, for M=1800, max_term=0, cost=20+0.05*100=20+5=25.

Therefore, the minimal cost is 25, which is achieved at M=1800, T=100.

Complete answer in code with the correct formula: 

```python
# Program to enumerate possible costs for M around 1800, with T fixed at 100.

T = 100
M_values = [1800 + i for i in range(-10, 11)]  # from 1790 to 1810
for M in M_values:
    max_term = max(0, M - 1800)
    cost = 20 + 0.05 * T + 0.1 * max_term
    print(f"M = {M:.1f}, cost = {cost:.4f}")
```

This will output candidate costs, highlighting the minimal at M=1800 with cost=25.
