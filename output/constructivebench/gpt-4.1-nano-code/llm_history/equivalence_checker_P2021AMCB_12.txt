Ground Truth Answer: 184/5
Proposed Answer: 192
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the average of all elements in a set S with given conditions about its maximum, minimum, and various partial averages.

2. The ground truth answer is 184/5, which is 36.8 in decimal form.

3. The proposed answer is 192, which is significantly different from 36.8.

4. The proposed answer doesn't match the structure of the problem's requirements (it should be a rational average, not a large integer).

5. The proposed answer is not equivalent to the ground truth answer in any form (not equal, not simplified version, not different representation).
