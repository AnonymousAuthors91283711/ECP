The problem seems to involve finding the maximum size \(k\) of a finite subset \(s\) of \(\mathbb{Z}\) contained in the interval \([-n, n]\), such that for any three elements \(a, b, c\) of \(s\), the sum \(a + b + c\) is not zero. We want to find the greatest possible \(k\) for given \(n\).

Given the combinatorial nature, for small \(n\), we can attempt to construct large subsets manually and check the property, then enumerate candidates up to the maximum size, seeking the maximum \(k\).

Here's the Python code to approximate and provide candidate answers, testing subsets within \([-n, n]\). We do a naive enumeration with small \(\text{n}\), generating candidate sets, and verifying the sum condition:

```python
import itertools

# For small n, we check subsets of [-n, n]
def check_sum_condition(s):
    # Check if for all a, b, c in s, a + b + c != 0
    for a, b, c in itertools.product(s, repeat=3):
        if a + b + c == 0:
            return False
    return True

def generate_candidate_sets(n, max_size):
    interval = range(-n, n+1)
    answers = []
    for size in range(max_size, 0, -1):
        found = False
        for subset in itertools.combinations(interval, size):
            s = set(subset)
            if check_sum_condition(s):
                print(f"Candidate with size {size}: {sorted(s)}")
                answers.append((size, s))
                found = True
        if found:
            # Once the largest sets are found, no need to look for smaller ones
            break
    # Output the maximum size found
    max_size_found = max(a[0] for a in answers) if answers else 0
    print(f"Maximum subset size for n={n}: {max_size_found}")

# Example usage:
# For small n=3, check subsets up to size 7 (arbitrary small limit)
generate_candidate_sets(3, 7)
```
