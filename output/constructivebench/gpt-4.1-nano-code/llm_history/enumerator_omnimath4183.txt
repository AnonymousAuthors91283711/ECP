The problem asks us to find the greatest natural number \(n\) such that:
- \(0 < n\),
- \(\phi(n)\) divides \(n\),
- and \(\sum_{m} \left( \frac{n}{m} - \frac{n-1}{m} \right) = 1992\).

Note that the sum simplifies because for integer \(m\), \(\left(\frac{n}{m} - \frac{n-1}{m}\right) = 1\) if \(m\) divides both \(n\) and \(n-1\) (which can't happen for the same \(m\), as consecutive numbers are coprime). 

However, more straightforwardly, the sum simplifies to counting the number of \(m\) such that:
- \(m\) divides \(n\) (since \(n/m\) is integer),
- and \(m\) divides \((n-1)\) (again for \((n-1)/m\) to be integer).

Therefore, the sum becomes the number of common divisors of \(n\) and \(n-1\).

But since \(\gcd(n, n-1) = 1\), the only common divisor is 1, so the sum becomes:

\[
\sum_{m} \left( \frac{n}{m} - \frac{n-1}{m} \right) = \text{number of common divisors} = 1
\]

which contradicts the sum being 1992.

Therefore, reconsidering the sum: the sum over all \(m\) is non-zero only when the sum adds something for divisors.

Alternatively, the inner sum over all \(m\) can be seen as counting the number of divisors of \(n\):

\[
\sum_{m} \left( \frac{n}{m} - \frac{n-1}{m} \right) = \sum_{m} \left( \text{1 if \(m\) divides \(n\)} - \text{1 if \(m\) divides \(n-1\)} \right)
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
\# \text{divisors of } n - \# \text{divisors of } n-1
\]

and since for multiple \(m\), these are only 1 unless \(m\) divides both.

But given the sum equals 1992, and recognizing the inner sum as the difference in the number of divisors, perhaps:

\[
\sum_{m} \left( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{m} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{m} \right\rfloor \right) = 1992
\]

which, in fact, represents the count of \(m\) where \(m\) divides \(n\) larger than 1.

In conclusion, the sum simplifies to the count of integers \(m\) for which \(m\) divides \(n\). For each divisor \(m\) of \(n\), the term contributes 1, and for \(n-1\), similar.

But perhaps the problem is more straightforward: as per the sum:

\[
\sum_{m} \left( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{m} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{m} \right\rfloor \right)
\]

which only contributes 1 exactly when \(m\) divides \(n\), because in that case \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{m} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{m} \right\rfloor = 1\), else 0.

Similarly, for divisors of \(n-1\), it equals 1, but the difference appears only for the divisors of \(n\).

Thus, the sum equals the number of divisors of \(n\).

Therefore, the sum is the number of divisors of \(n\).

Given the sum is 1992, then \(d(n)=1992\).

Now, putting it all together:

- \(d(n) = 1992\),
- \(\phi(n)\) divides \(n\),
- \(n > 0\),
- and we want the greatest such \(n\).

So, the problem reduces to:

Find the maximum \(n\) with \(\phi(n) \mid n\) and \(d(n)=1992\).

Our approach:

- First, find the factorization of 1992 to generate candidates for \(n\).

- For each \(n\) with \(d(n)=1992\), check if \(\phi(n)\) divides \(n\).

- To maximize \(n\), pick the \(n\) with the largest value satisfying the conditions.

Number of divisors function, \(d(n)\), is multiplicative, and for \(n = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \cdots\), \(d(n) = (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \cdots\).

Factor 1992:

\(1992 = 2^3 \times 3 \times 83\).

One factorization possibilities for \(d(n) = 1992\):

\[
(a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1)(a_3 + 1) = 1992
\]

For simplicity, pick small exponents to generate candidate \(a_i\):

Test combinations like:

- \( (a_1 + 1) = 83 \Rightarrow a_1=82 \),
- \( (a_2 + 1)=3 \Rightarrow a_2=2 \),
- \( (a_3 + 1)=8 \Rightarrow a_3=7 \),

or

- \( (a_1 + 1)= 24 \), \(a_1=23\),
- \( (a_2 + 1)= 83 \), \(a_2=82\),
- \( (a_3 + 1)=1 \), \(a_3=0\).

But the key is to find \(a_i\), and assign \(p_i\) as primes to get the maximum \(n\).

To maximize \(n\), select the largest primes for the smallest exponents.

Suggest trying factorization:

\(d(n) = 2^3 \times 3 \times 83\)

which can be written as:

- (8) * 3 * 83:

then, possible exponents:

- for (8): \(a_1=7\),
- for 3: \(a_2=2\),
- for 83: \(a_3=82\).

Choose:

- \(p_1=2\), \(a_1=7\),
- \(p_2=3\), \(a_2=2\),
- \(p_3=83\), \(a_3=82\).

Order primes in decreasing order to maximize \(n\):

- assign the largest prime to the lowest exponent perhaps.

But for maximum \(n\), assign largest prime to the smallest exponent.

Thus:

- \(p_1=83\), \(a_1=82\),
- \(p_2=3\), \(a_2=2\),
- \(p_3=2\), \(a_3=7\)?

No, need consistent assignment.

The best way: assign largest prime to smallest exponent for maximum \(n\).

So:

- \(a_1=7\), \(p_1=83\),
- \(a_2=2\), \(p_2=3\),
- \(a_3=82\), \(p_3=2\).

But then \(a_3=82\), prime \(2\), which is smaller.

Actually, to maximize \(n\), assign the largest prime to the smallest exponent:

- \(a=2\), \(p=83\),
- \(a=7\), \(p=3\),
- \(a=82\), \(p=2\),

which does not seem optimal.

Hence, pick the distribution with larger primes to smaller exponents.

Working code will attempt to generate candidates accordingly.

Now, for each candidate \(n\), verify if \(\phi(n)\) divides \(n\).

Use small candidates to generate such \(n\) with \(d(n)=1992\).

Let's implement the code to generate candidate \(n\)s based on these factorizations, then check the condition, and output the maximum \(n\).

```python
# Generate candidates for n with divisor count 1992 and check if φ(n) divides n
import math

def divisor_count(n):
    count = 1
    for p in prime_factors(n):
        count *= (exponents[p] + 1)
    return count

def prime_factors(n):
    factors = {}
    temp = n
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        while temp % i == 0:
            factors[i] = factors.get(i, 0) + 1
            temp //= i
    if temp > 1:
        factors[temp] = factors.get(temp, 0) + 1
    return list(factors.keys()), list(factors.values())

def totient(n):
    result = n
    for p in set(prime_factors(n)[0]):
        result -= result // p
    return result

max_candidate = 0

# Generate structured candidates based on divisor count
# Factorizations of 1992
factorizations = [
    [83, 3, 8],  # (a+1) factors
    [82, 3, 8],
    [82, 2, 12],
]

for exps in factorizations:
    # assign largest primes to smallest exponents
    exps_sorted = sorted(exps)
    primes = [83, 67, 61]  # small primes
    primes_sorted = sorted(primes, reverse=True)
    n = 1
    for a, p in zip(exps_sorted, primes_sorted):
        n *= p ** a
    # check if φ(n) divides n
    phi_n = totient(n)
    if n % phi_n == 0:
        print(n)
        if n > max_candidate:
            max_candidate = n

print("Maximum n:", max_candidate)
```
