. Enumerated answers: x = 2
y = -1
z = -4
Candidate z with delta -2: -6
Candidate z with delta -1: -5
Candidate z with delta 0: -4
Candidate z with delta 1: -3
Candidate z with delta 2: -2
Computed z: -4. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern shows z is derived from the sequence involving x=2, y=-1, leading to z=-4. The candidates with delta 0 match the computed z, indicating the consistent value is -4. Since the sequence seems to be centered around these values, and the computed z aligns with the candidate delta 0, the final answer for the answer variable should be -4.
