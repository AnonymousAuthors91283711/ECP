The given polynomial and evaluations suggest degrees and specific values to determine coefficients. The pattern of evaluations at 5, 11, and 17 indicates the roots or related factors. Since we seek the value at 1, a plausible closed form based on these inputs (with roots located around these points) involves the differences and ratios. Given the pattern, the simplified answer often involves dividing differences to normalize the polynomial's behavior.

<<<(5 * 11 * 17 - 1 * 5 * 17 + 1 * 11 * 5) / (17 - 5)>>>
