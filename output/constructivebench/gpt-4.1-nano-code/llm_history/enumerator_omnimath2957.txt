This problem involves four natural numbers p, q, r, s with the relationships:

- p = q - 1
- q = r - 1
- r = s - 1

and the sum p + s = 109. From these, we want to find q + r.

First, express all variables in terms of p to relate q, r, s:

- p = q - 1 → q = p + 1
- q = r - 1 → r = q + 1 = p + 2
- r = s - 1 → s = r + 1 = p + 3

Given p + s = 109:

p + (p + 3) = 109
2p + 3 = 109
2p = 106
p = 53

Now find q and r:

q = p + 1 = 54
r = p + 2 = 55

The sum q + r = 54 + 55 = 109.

So, the answer is 109.

The code will directly produce the answer without going through brute-force enumeration, as the relationships are straightforward and unique.

```python
# The problem's relationships determine unique values for p, q, r, s
# Derived from the given equations:
# p = 53, q = 54, r = 55, s = 56
# Sum q + r = 109

print(109)
```
