The problem asks for the number of real numbers \(a\) in the interval \([2, 101]\) such that there exists some positive integer \(N\) with the property that for all \(n \geq N\), the value of \(a^{2^n} \bmod 100\) stabilizes (i.e., becomes constant). We interpret this as counting all such \(a\) in \([2,101]\).

Key points:
- \(a \in [2, 101]\)
- \(\exists N > 0\) such that for all \(n \geq N\), \(a^{2^n} \equiv a^{2^N} \pmod{100}\)
- Since mod 100 depends on the periodicity of the powers, focus on the behavior of \(a\) modulo 100, particularly on its prime factorization for the power pattern.

Approach:
- For rational numbers, the pattern simplifies when \(a\) is an integer.
- For real numbers, consider the dynamics via the modulus behavior related to the base's properties modulo 2, 4, 5, and 20, because \(100 = 2^2 \times 5^2\).

Let's only consider integer \(a\) in the range, as general irrational or non-integer \(a\) won't stabilize in the modular case under the given conditions, based on typical number-theoretic behavior.  
Also, special cases:
- When \(a\) is a power of 2 or 5, the pattern tends to stabilize sooner.

I will enumerate \(a\) from 2 to 101, check powers \(a^{2^n} \bmod 100\) for increasing \(n\), and find whether the sequence stabilizes.

```python
def check_stability(a, max_n=20):
    # Compute the sequence of a^{2^n} mod 100 for n in 1..max_n
    seq = {}
    current = a % 100
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        # Square current
        current = (current * current) % 100
        seq[n] = current
    # Check if sequence stabilizes after some N
    for N in range(1, max_n):
        if all(seq[n] == seq[N] for n in range(N, max_n + 1)):
            return True
    return False

count = 0
for a in range(2, 102):
    if check_stability(a):
        print(f"a = {a}")
        count += 1

print(f"Total count: {count}")
```

This code enumerates integers in \([2, 101]\), checks the stabilization of the modular powers, and prints all such \(a\). The total count is also computed.

```python
def check_stability(a, max_n=20):
    # Compute the sequence of a^{2^n} mod 100 for n in 1..max_n
    seq = {}
    current = a % 100
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        # Square current
        current = (current * current) % 100
        seq[n] = current
    # Check if sequence stabilizes after some N
    for N in range(1, max_n):
        if all(seq[n] == seq[N] for n in range(N, max_n + 1)):
            return True
    return False

count = 0
for a in range(2, 102):
    if check_stability(a):
        print(f"a = {a}")
        count += 1

print(f"Total count: {count}")
```
