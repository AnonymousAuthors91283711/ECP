This problem involves finding natural numbers \( n > 1 \) such that the expression \(\frac{n^2 + 7n + 136}{n - 1}\) is a perfect square. To analyze this problem, observe that:

\[
\frac{n^2 + 7n + 136}{n - 1}
\]

is defined for \( n > 1 \). We can perform polynomial division or manipulate the numerator to understand the structure better.

Let's expand the numerator:

\[
n^2 + 7n + 136
\]

Dividing by \( n - 1 \):

\[
n^2 + 7n + 136 = (n - 1)(n + 8) + 144
\]

since:

\[
(n - 1)(n + 8) = n^2 + 8n - n - 8 = n^2 + 7n - 8
\]

Adding 144:

\[
n^2 + 7n + 136 = (n - 1)(n + 8) + 144
\]

Thus,

\[
\frac{n^2 + 7n + 136}{n - 1} = n + 8 + \frac{144}{n - 1}
\]

Note that for the expression to be an integer, \( n - 1 \) must divide 144 neatly.

Set:

\[
k = n - 1
\]

where \( k \ge 1 \) and divides 144, i.e.,

\[
\frac{n^2 + 7n + 136}{n - 1} = n + 8 + \frac{144}{k}
\]

Since \( n = k + 1 \), the expression becomes:

\[
k + 1 + 8 + \frac{144}{k} = k + 9 + \frac{144}{k}
\]

We seek \( m \in \mathbb{Z} \) such that:

\[
k + 9 + \frac{144}{k} = m^2
\]

which rearranges to:

\[
m^2 = k + 9 + \frac{144}{k}
\]

Multiplying both sides by \(k\):

\[
k m^2 = k^2 + 9k + 144
\]

Given \(k\) divides 144, and \(k \ge 1\), we can evaluate all divisors \(k\) of 144, compute \(m^2 = k + 9 + 144 / k\), and check if \(m^2\) is a perfect square.

Our enumeration:

- Find all divisors \(k\) of 144.
- For each, compute \(m^2 = k + 9 + 144 / k\).
- Check if \(m^2\) is a perfect square.
- If so, record \(n = k + 1\).

Implementing this for small \(k\).

```python
# Code to find all n > 1 satisfying the condition
def find_candidates():
    divisors = []
    # Find all divisors of 144
    for i in range(1, 145):
        if 144 % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
    for k in divisors:
        val = k + 9 + 144 // k
        m = int(val**0.5)
        if m * m == val:
            n = k + 1
            print(f"n = {n}, with divisor k = {k}, m = {m}, expression = {val}")

find_candidates()
```
