The problem you've provided appears to involve algebraic expressions, possibly related to cubic polynomials and integer solutions. To assist with conjecturing the answer, I will implement a Python script that enumerates possible integer values for the polynomial evaluated at specific points and searches for roots or specific conditions.

Since the problem involves parameters \(b, c, d\) and a condition about the existence of an integer root \(n\) satisfying \( n^3 + bn^2 + cn + d = 0 \), I'll select small sample values for \(b, c, d\) and check for roots, then evaluate the product of the polynomial at 2015 and 2016 for those parameters.

This approach can help identify possible solutions or patterns.

```python
# Enumerate small integer parameters b, c, d within a limited range
# For each, check if the polynomial has an integer root n
# If so, compute the product at n=2015 and 2016
# Print the results to assist in conjecture

max_param = 5  # limit for parameter enumeration
for b in range(-max_param, max_param + 1):
    for c in range(-max_param, max_param + 1):
        for d in range(-max_param, max_param + 1):
            # Check for integer root n in a small range, e.g., -10 to 10
            has_root = False
            for n in range(-10, 11):
                if n**3 + b*n**2 + c*n + d == 0:
                    has_root = True
                    # Compute the product at 2015 and 2016
                    val_2015 = (2015**3 + b*2015**2 + c*2015 + d)
                    val_2016 = (2016**3 + b*2016**2 + c*2016 + d)
                    product = val_2015 * val_2016
                    print(f"b={b}, c={c}, d={d}, root n={n}, product={product}")
            # Also, check if there are no roots in that range and note that as well
            if not has_root:
                # Optionally, print or ignore
                pass
```
