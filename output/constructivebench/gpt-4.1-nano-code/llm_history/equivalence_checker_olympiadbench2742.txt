Ground Truth Answer: 46760
Proposed Answer: (150 : ℝ)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves finding the sum of evaluations at x=10 for all polynomials A in a special set S. The set S consists of monic polynomials A that satisfy certain conditions with some non-zero polynomial B.

2. The ground truth answer is 46760, which is a very large number, suggesting that either:
   - There are many polynomials in S, or
   - The polynomials evaluate to large values at x=10

3. The proposed answer is 150, which is much smaller than the ground truth answer.

4. Without seeing the detailed derivation, it's impossible for me to verify the exact calculations, but the orders of magnitude difference (46760 vs 150) strongly suggests these are not equivalent answers.
