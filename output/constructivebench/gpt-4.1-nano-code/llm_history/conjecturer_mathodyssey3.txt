. Enumerated answers: 66. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The system likely involves two equations with variables c and s, and their relations lead to a specific s value under given constraints. Since the example hints at a single fixed answer "66" for such bounds, the pattern suggests the solution is a constant value for s, possibly derived via algebraic elimination. Therefore, I conjecture the answer to be the constant 66.

<<<66>>>
