The problem involves a recursive sequence `x(k)` where the absolute value of `x(k)` depends on the previous term plus 3. Given the constraints, the sequence starts at `x(0) = 0`, and for each subsequent `k >= 1`, we have `|x(k)| = |x(k-1) + 3|`. We need to find the minimum possible sum `s = |âˆ‘_{k=0}^{2005} x(k+1)|` that can be achieved under these rules.

To explore this systematically, we observe that at each step, knowing `x(k-1)` determines the possible `x(k)`: since `|x(k)| = |x(k-1) + 3|`, `x(k)` can be either `x(k-1) + 3` or `-(x(k-1) + 3)`.

Thus, the sequence can branch out, and to find minimal absolute sum, we try both options at each step, pruning paths that cannot lead to smaller sums when necessary.

Here's a program that enumerates all possible sequences for a manageable small number of steps (say `n=10`) and finds the minimum absolute sum. This approach can then be scaled or adapted to larger `n` if needed, but for demonstration, it will handle small `n`.

```python
# Enumeration to find minimal absolute sum of sequences with recursive absolute value constraints

def enumerate_sequences(n):
    # Each element in current_states: (current_x, cumulative_sum)
    current_states = {(0, 0)}  # start with x0=0, sum=0
    for _ in range(n):
        next_states = set()
        for x_prev, cumsum in current_states:
            base = x_prev + 3
            for x_curr in (base, -base):
                new_cumsum = cumsum + x_curr
                next_states.add((x_curr, new_cumsum))
        current_states = next_states
    # Compute minimal absolute sum over all sequences of length n
    min_abs_sum = min(abs(cumsum) for _, cumsum in current_states)
    print(f"Minimum absolute sum for n={n}: {min_abs_sum}")
    # Optionally, return the minimal sum for further processing
    return min_abs_sum

# Run for small n to explore possible minimal sums
for n in range(1, 11):
    enumerate_sequences(n)
```
