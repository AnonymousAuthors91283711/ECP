theorem omnimath2539 : 
  let (m, n) := omnimath2539_answer
  m.Coprime n ∧ 
  (∏ i in Finset.range 7, (1 - (1 / (i + 2)))) = m / n ∧ 
  100 * m + n = 108 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: (1, 8). Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ
The pattern suggests m = 1, n = 8, and the product simplifies to (1/2)·(2/3)·(3/4)·(4/5)·(5/6)·(6/7). The product simplifies to 1/7. Thus, m/n = 1/7, and 100 * m + n = 100 + 8 = 108. Final answer: <<< (1, 8) >>>
