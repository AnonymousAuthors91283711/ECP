Ground Truth Answer: 210
Proposed Answer: 6 * 35
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a scenario with two vehicles:
   - Vehicle 1 travels at 35 mph for 1 hour (covering d1 = 35 miles)
   - Vehicle 2 travels at 50 mph (35+15) covering the remaining distance (d2 = d-35)
   - There's a time equation relating total_time to scheduled_time

2. The ground truth answer is 210 miles

3. The proposed answer is 6*35 which equals 210 miles

The proposed answer is mathematically equivalent to the ground truth answer since 6*35 = 210. The expression is different but evaluates to the same value.
