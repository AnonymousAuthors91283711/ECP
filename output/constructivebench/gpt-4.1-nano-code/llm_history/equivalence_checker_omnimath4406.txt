Ground Truth Answer: fun m => m * π - π / 4
Proposed Answer: fun m : ℤ => if (m % 4 = 1) || (m % 4 = 3) || (m % 4 = -1) || (m % 4 = -3) then (π / 4) * m else 0
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for all real numbers x that satisfy a certain trigonometric equation, expressed in terms of an integer parameter m.

2. The ground truth answer gives x = mπ - π/4 for any integer m. This is a simple linear function that covers all solutions.

3. The proposed answer is more complex:
   - It gives (π/4)*m only when m mod 4 is ±1 or ±3
   - Otherwise it gives 0

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
1. It doesn't match the ground truth's simple linear form
2. It returns 0 for even values of m, which are clearly not solutions (plugging m=0 gives x=0, which doesn't satisfy the original equation)
3. The condition and scaling are both wrong - the correct solution should work for all integers m, not just certain residues modulo 4

The correct solution should be periodic with period π (since trigonometric functions are involved), but the proposed answer doesn't capture this correctly.
