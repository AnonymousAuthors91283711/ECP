The problem appears to involve analyzing the set of real numbers \( d \) that satisfy certain inequalities: specifically, those that are not greater than or equal to 6, not less than or equal to 5, and not less than or equal to 4. In logical terms, the conditions are:

- \( \neg (d \geq 6) \) → \( d < 6 \)
- \( \neg (d \leq 5) \) → \( d > 5 \)
- \( \neg (d \leq 4) \) → \( d > 4 \)

Combined, the conjunction is:

\[ (d < 6) \land (d > 5) \land (d > 4) \]
which simplifies to:

\[ d \in (5, 6) \]

The theorem states that this set is equivalent to \( d \in P2018AMCA_4_answer \).

So, the set we want to define is all real numbers between 5 and 6, exclusive.

We will define `P2018AMCA_4_answer` as the open interval (5, 6). To help in conjecture and checking, we'll enumerate some candidates within this interval and observe that the set is precisely the interval.

Here's the code:

```python
# We will enumerate some points in the open interval (5,6)
# and verify that they satisfy the conditions
# then define the set accordingly.

def within_conditions(d):
    return not (d >= 6) and not (d <= 5) and not (d <= 4)

# Sample points in (5,6)
samples = [5.1, 5.5, 5.9]
for d in samples:
    if within_conditions(d):
        print(f"d = {d} satisfies the conditions.")

# The set corresponds to the open interval (5,6)
# Now, define the answer set
P2018AMCA_4_answer = {d for d in [i/10 for i in range(50, 60)]}  # 5.0 to 6.0 in tenths

# For demonstration, print some elements
for d in sorted(P2018AMCA_4_answer):
    if within_conditions(d):
        print(f"Answer candidate: d = {d}")
```
