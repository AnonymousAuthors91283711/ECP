The sequence of iterates reveals the fixed points and the limits of the iterated quadratic function. The fixed points occur at x = 1 and x = 3 (since substituting into f yields the same value). The sequence stabilizes to these points. The main values matching the fixed points are 1.0 and 3.0. The recurring negative and fractional values are convergence points towards these roots. Since the problem asks for the number of solutions with a certain property, and the fixed points are at 1 and 3, the total solutions are 2.
