This problem involves finding a prime number \( n \) within a specific range such that:
- \( 2^8 \leq n \leq 9^8 \),
- all decimal digits of \( n \) are between 2 and 9,
- all digits are distinct.

Given these constraints:
- \( 2^8 = 256 \),
- \( 9^8 \) is 43046721.

We need to enumerate prime numbers within this range with digits in {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} and all distinct.

To efficiently explore options, we'll generate candidate numbers with digits 2â€“9, 1 to 8 digits long, no repetition, and check if they are prime.

```python
import itertools
from sympy import isprime

# Define the digit set: 2 to 9
digits = '23456789'

# Range limits
low_limit = 256
high_limit = 9 ** 8  # 43046721

answers = []

# Generate candidates with length from 3 up to 8 digits (to be within range)
for length in range(3, 9):
    # Generate all permutations of the given length with distinct digits
    for combo in itertools.permutations(digits, length):
        number = int(''.join(combo))
        # Check if within bounds
        if number < low_limit or number > high_limit:
            continue
        # Check if prime
        if isprime(number):
            print(number)
            answers.append(number)
```
