The problem involves finding the absolute value of the complex number \( c \) such that the polynomial \( f(x) = x^4 + (2 - 3i) x^3 + (5 - 6i) x^2 + (2 - 3i) x + c \) has exactly 4 roots in â„‚. Since the polynomial has degree 4 with parameters involving \( c \), and the question is about the roots' count, we can explore possible values of \( c \) that result in all roots being distinct and complex.

To proceed, note that the polynomial's coefficients suggest using Vieta's formulas or attempting specific tests to find when the polynomial is quadratically reducible or has multiple roots. Given the complexity, we'll focus on parametrizing \( c \), testing various values, and noting whether the roots are distinct and count to 4.

We'll select small sample values of \( c \), compute the roots, check their count, and record the absolute value of \( c \).

The code will:
- Define the polynomial with sample \( c \)
- Use numpy roots to find roots
- Check if roots are all distinct
- Print roots, roots count, and \( |c| \)

```python
import numpy as np

# Coefficients of the polynomial, with c as parameter
coeffs_template = [1, 2 - 3j, 5 - 6j, 2 - 3j]

# Sample c values to test
c_values = [0, 1, -1, 2+1j, -2-1j, 3, -3]

for c in c_values:
    coeffs = coeffs_template[:-1] + [c]  # Replace the constant term
    roots = np.roots(coeffs)
    # Check if roots are distinct
    if len(roots) == len(np.unique(np.round(roots, decimals=8))):
        roots_count = len(roots)
        abs_c = abs(c)
        print(f"c = {c}, |c| = {abs_c}")
        print(f"Roots: {roots}\n")
```
