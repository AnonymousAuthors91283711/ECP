This problem involves a recursive sequence defined on ℕ with initial conditions involving large powers, and a recurrence relation for n ≥ 4. The goal is to find a closed-form or at least a conjectured value for a(14^14).

Given the initial conditions:
- a(1) = 11^11
- a(2) = 12^12
- a(3) = 13^13

And the recurrence:
- For n ≥ 4,
  a(n) = |a(n−1)−a(n−2)| + |a(n−2)−a(n−3)|

The sequence probably stabilizes or exhibits predictable behavior, possibly tending toward small values or zeros because of the absolute differences.

I'll implement a direct simulation of the recursive sequence starting from n=1 up to n=14^14, but since 14^14 is enormous, no brute force computing is feasible. Instead, I'll investigate the pattern by simulating starting from the known initial conditions for small n and trying to guess the behavior of the sequence.

In particular, I'll generate the sequence further to observe if it stabilizes or enters a cycle in the small terms, and then hypothesize the value at n=14^14.

Given the constraints, I will:
- Fix a manageable range of n to observe the pattern.
- Robotically generate the sequence, and if it stabilizes at some small value, conjecture that a(14^14) equals that value.
- Or, if the sequence converges to zero, report zero.

Let's implement a simulation for the initial terms and analyze the pattern.

```python
# Generate initial terms based on given values
a1 = 11 ** 11  # large number
a2 = 12 ** 12
a3 = 13 ** 13

# We will try to see the pattern for small n to guess behavior at large n
# Since n=14^14 is enormous, we look for stabilization or cycle in small terms

sequence = [a1, a2, a3]

# Define a function to compute next term based on recurrence
def next_a(a_n1, a_n2, a_n3):
    return abs(a_n1 - a_n2) + abs(a_n2 - a_n3)

# We'll simulate up to, say, 50 terms or until pattern stabilizes
for _ in range(4, 50):
    a_new = next_a(sequence[-1], sequence[-2], sequence[-3])
    print(f"Term_{len(sequence)+1} = {a_new}")
    sequence.append(a_new)
    # Check if last few terms stabilize
    if len(sequence) >= 4 and sequence[-1] == sequence[-2] == sequence[-3]:
        # Sequence has stabilized
        break

# Output the last stabilized value as conjecture
print(f"Conjectured a(14^14) = {sequence[-1]}")
```
