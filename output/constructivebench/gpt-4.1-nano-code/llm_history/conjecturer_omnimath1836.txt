. Enumerated answers: 25. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern and the enumeration suggest that the value depends on the minimal positive integer k such that 49 divides C(2k, k). Since 49 = 7^2, using Lucas's theorem or divisibility properties, the minimal such k corresponds to when 7 divides k. The smallest positive k with 7 | k is k=7, which yields the smallest k satisfying the divisibility.

Thus, the answer is 25, perhaps confirming the 5^2 pattern found in the divisor or minimal k.
