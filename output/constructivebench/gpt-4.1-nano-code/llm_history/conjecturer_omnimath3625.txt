The solution points to specific pairs satisfying m^5−n^5=16·m·n, notably at (0,0) and (−2,2). These can be generalized as solutions where either both are zero or n = −m, with m = ±2. Encapsulating, the set includes (0,0) and all pairs (m, −m) with m=±2. In Lean, this is equivalently represented by:

Solution: m=0, n=0. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℤ × ℤ)
The core of the solution is the set of pairs (m, n) satisfying m^5 - n^5 = 16 * m * n. From the given solutions, they identified two particular points: (0, 0) and (-2, 2). Analyzing these points, note that:

- At (0,0): Clearly, 0 - 0 = 0 and 16 * 0 * 0 = 0, so satisfies.
- At (-2, 2): Let's verify:
  (-2)^5 - 2^5 = -32 - 32 = -64
  16 * (-2) * 2 = 16 * -4 = -64
  So satisfies.

They also suggest that the set could include all solutions where m=0, and n=−m, especially when m=±2.

Since the only identified solutions are m=0, n=0, and m=−2, n=2, we must encode the set accordingly.

In Lean, we define the set as:

- Contains (0, 0).
- Contains (−2, 2).
- Optionally, to generalize, find m such that m^5 - (−m)^5 = 16 * m * (−m).

Let's verify for general m:

m^5 - (−m)^5 = m^5 - (−1)^5 * m^5 = m^5 + m^5 = 2m^5
and
16 * m * (−m) = -16 m^2.

The equation holds when:
2m^5 = -16 m^2
=> dividing both sides by 2:
m^5 = -8 m^2

If m ≠ 0, divide both sides by m^2:
m^3 = -8

m^3 = -8 => m = -2.

Thus, m = -2 is the only solution for m ≠ 0.

Similarly, for m=0: the equation reduces to 0=0: solution holds.

So the entire solution set is just the points:

- (0, 0)
- (−2, 2)

That's consistent with the provided solutions.

Hence, the set can be written as:

{ (0,0), (-2,2) }

In Lean, this is:

<<< {(0, 0), (-2, 2)} >>>


**Final answer:**

<<< { (0, 0), (-2, 2) } >>>

**Explanation:**

The set contains only these two points because they satisfy the given polynomial equation. Larger m values do not satisfy the polynomial condition unless m=−2, as derived. The original solution identified these two specific solutions, which form the complete set for the equation.
