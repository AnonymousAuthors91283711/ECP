This problem explores the existence of a sequence of signs (ε_i = ±1) such that the sum of weighted vectors maintains a bounded sum. The core idea resembles the combinatorial and geometric principles related to the Khintchine inequality and signs balancing.

Since the problem appears to ask for the set of n where this property holds, and it's a high-school level mathematical enumeration, we can try small values of n. For each n, we check if the condition holds for arbitrary functions a, b; to do this in code, we:

- Fix small n values (say, n=1 to 10).
- For each n and randomly generated example functions a, b satisfying |a_i| + |b_i|=1, check if a signing ε exists.
- Determine if the property holds for all possible a, b (simulated by testing multiple samples).

Given the complexity, a simplified approach is:

- For small n, try to find explicit signs ε that satisfy the inequality for representative cases.
- Collect all n where these signs exist for these cases.

```python
import itertools

# Function to check the property for given a, b and ε
def check_signing(n, a, b, epsilon):
    sum_a = sum(e * ai for e, ai in zip(epsilon, a))
    sum_b = sum(e * bi for e, bi in zip(epsilon, b))
    return abs(sum_a) + abs(sum_b) <= 1

# Generate small sample functions a, b with |a_i| + |b_i|=1
def generate_samples(n):
    # For simplicity, test with a_i=1, b_i=0 and vice versa
    samples = []
    a1 = [1 for _ in range(n)]
    b1 = [0 for _ in range(n)]
    a2 = [0 for _ in range(n)]
    b2 = [1 for _ in range(n)]
    # Mix
    for i in range(n):
        a3 = [1 if j == i else 0 for j in range(n)]
        b3 = [0 if j == i else 1 for j in range(n)]
        samples.extend([(a1, b1), (a2, b2), (a3, b3)])
    return samples

# For n=1 to 10, check if property seems to hold
answer_set = set()

for n in range(1, 11):
    # Generate sample a, b
    sample_pairs = generate_samples(n)
    property_holds = True
    for a, b in sample_pairs:
        # Try all possible ε signs
        signs = list(itertools.product([-1, 1], repeat=n))
        exists = False
        for epsilon in signs:
            if check_signing(n, a, b, epsilon):
                exists = True
                break
        if not exists:
            property_holds = False
            break
    if property_holds:
        answer_set.add(n)

# Print all n where the property observed in samples appears to hold
print("Answer set for n where property likely holds:", sorted(answer_set))
```
