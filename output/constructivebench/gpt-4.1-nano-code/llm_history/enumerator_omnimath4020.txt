The problem looks like a Diophantine equation involving positive integers x, y, z, with a specific relationship involving 2023. To explore solutions, I'll generate small values for x, y, z (since the equation involves quadratic and cubic terms), and check the equality. I'll print solutions immediately once found during enumeration.

This enumeration method will be brute-force within small bounds because the problem likely expects small solutions for feasibility. I'll limit x, y, z to a reasonable max (say 20) for efficiency.

```python
# Enumeration for small positive integers x, y, z
# to find solutions satisfying the given equation
# 2*(x + y + z + 2*x*y*z)^2 == (2*x*y + 2*y*z + 2*z*x + 1)^2 + 2023

max_val = 20

for x in range(1, max_val + 1):
    for y in range(1, max_val + 1):
        for z in range(1, max_val + 1):
            lhs = 2 * (x + y + z + 2 * x * y * z)**2
            rhs = (2 * x * y + 2 * y * z + 2 * z * x + 1)**2 + 2023
            if lhs == rhs:
                print((x, y, z))
```
