This problem involves analyzing a set of integers within a range, filtering by a prime condition on a cubic polynomial, and then taking the ratio of the filtered set size to the total. To explore and conjecture the answer, we'll enumerate the values of the polynomial for small T, check which results are prime, and compute the ratio accordingly. We'll print every candidate value immediately as we find it, and handle the case T=9 specifically.

```python
# Helper function to check if a number is prime
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    if n == 2:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    r = int(n**0.5)
    for i in range(3, r + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Enumerate for T=1 to 9 (since hT=9)
T = 9
start = 1
end = 2 * T  # upper bound for the range

prime_count = 0
total_count = end - start + 1

print(f"Analyzing T={T}")
for n in range(start, end + 1):
    val = abs(n**3 - 7*n**2 + 13*n - 6)
    print(f"n={n}, polynomial value={val}")
    if is_prime(val):
        print(f"Prime found: {val} at n={n}")
        prime_count += 1

ratio = prime_count / total_count
print(f"Filtered prime count: {prime_count}")
print(f"Total count: {total_count}")
print(f"Ratio: {ratio:.4f}")

    from fractions import Fraction
    count = 0
    total = 2 * T
    for n in range(1, 2*T + 1):
        val = abs(n**3 - 7 * n**2 + 13 * n - 6)
        if is_prime(val):
            count += 1
    return Fraction(count, total)
