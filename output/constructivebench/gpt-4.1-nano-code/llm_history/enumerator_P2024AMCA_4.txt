[write_program]
This appears to be a formal proof problem involving factorials and divisibility, likely asking for the smallest positive integer n such that n! is divisible by 2024. To assist in conjecturing the answer, I will write a Python program that factors 2024 into its prime factors and then determines the minimal n such that n! contains these prime factors in sufficient quantities. The program will enumerate candidate n and check divisibility conditions directly, printing each candidate answer as it finds it. This approach ensures correctness, transparency, and efficiency.

```python
import math

# Prime factorization of 2024
# 2024 = 8 * 253 = 2^3 * 11 * 23
# So, prime factors are 2^3, 11^1, 23^1

def prime_factors(n):
    factors = {}
    for p in [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]:  # sufficient primes for small n
        while n % p == 0:
            factors[p] = factors.get(p, 0) + 1
            n //= p
        if n == 1:
            break
    return factors

target_factors = prime_factors(2024)
# target_factors should be {2:3, 11:1, 23:1}

def min_n_for_prime(p, exponent):
    # Find minimal n such that sum_{k=1}^∞ floor(n/k) >= exponent
    # sum of floor(n / p^k) for k≥1
    n = 0
    low, high = 1, 100  # initial search bounds
    while True:
        count = 0
        for k in range(1, int(math.log(high, p)) + 2):
            count += high // (p ** k)
        if count >= exponent:
            high = max(high - 1, 1)
        else:
            low = high + 1
            high *= 2
            if high > 1000:
                break
    # Binary search for minimal n
    left, right = 1, high
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        count = 0
        for k in range(1, int(math.log(mid, p)) + 2):
            count += mid // (p ** k)
        if count >= exponent:
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    return left

# Compute minimal n for each prime factor
candidate_ns = []
for p, exp in target_factors.items():
    n_p = min_n_for_prime(p, exp)
    candidate_ns.append(n_p)

# The answer is the maximum among these minimal n's
answer = max(candidate_ns)
print("Prime factors and required exponents:", target_factors)
print("Candidates for minimal n for each prime factor:", candidate_ns)
print("Minimal n such that 2024 divides n!:", answer)
