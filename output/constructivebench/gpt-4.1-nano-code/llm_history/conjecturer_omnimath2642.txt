theorem omnimath2642
(a b : ℕ)
(hab : a > 0 ∧ b > 0 ∧ 8 * a ^ a * b ^ b = 27 * a ^ b * b ^ a)

. Enumerated answers: Solution found: a=6, b=9, a^2 + b^2=117
Solution found: a=9, b=6, a^2 + b^2=117. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern indicates that the sum a^2 + b^2 equals 117 for solutions where a and b swap roles (6 and 9). The symmetry and the specific solutions suggest the answer is a fixed constant, independent of the order.

<<<117>>>
