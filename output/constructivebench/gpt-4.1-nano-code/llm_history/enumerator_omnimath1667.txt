[write_program]
This problem involves analyzing 9-element functions \(f: \mathrm{Fin}\,9 \to \mathbb{N}\) with specific algebraic constraints and symmetries. The constraints relate the permutations of the indices, sums, and sums of squares. Our goal is to enumerate all possible solutions \(f\) based on these relations, considering permutations to capture symmetries, and to output candidate solutions streamingly.

To make the problem tractable, we'll:
- Fix small sample permutations (since the original problem involves permutation symmetry).
- Iterate over possible values of the variables \(a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, k\) within small bounds.
- Check the algebraic relations.
- Print each solution immediately when valid.

Because the problem involves sums and squares, I'll limit search values to a small range (say within 0 to 10) to make enumeration feasible. I'll generate all permutations of indices to ensure coverage of symmetric cases.

Here's the Python program fulfilling all requirements:

```python
import itertools
from math import perm

# Generate all permutations of 9 indices
indices = list(range(9))
permutations = list(itertools.permutations(indices))

# Search bounds for potential variable values
value_bounds = range(0, 11)

# Stream solutions as they are found
for perm in permutations:
    for a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, k in itertools.product(value_bounds, repeat=9):
        # Map according to the permutation
        nums = [0]*9
        for i, val in zip(perm, [a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, k]):
            nums[i] = val
        a_, b_, c_, d_, e_, f_, g_, h_, k_ = nums

        # Check the conditions
        sum1 = a_ + b_ + c_ + d_
        sum2 = d_ + e_ + f_ + g_
        sum3 = a_ + b_ + c_ + d_
        sum4 = g_ + h_ + k_ + a_

        sum_squares1 = a_**2 + b_**2 + c_**2 + d_**2
        sum_squares2 = d_**2 + e_**2 + f_**2 + g_**2
        sum_squares3 = g_**2 + h_**2 + k_**2 + a_**2

        if (sum1 == sum2 == sum3 == sum4 and
            sum_squares1 == sum_squares2 == sum_squares3):
            # Output the candidate solution
            print({
                'permutation': perm,
                'values': {
                    'a': a_, 'b': b_, 'c': c_, 'd': d_,
                    'e': e_, 'f': f_, 'g': g_, 'h': h_, 'k': k_
                }
            })
```
