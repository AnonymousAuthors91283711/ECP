The problem appears to be asking for a pair of natural numbers (A, B) with each â‰¤ 9 such that:

(1001*A + 110*B)^2 = 57108249  
and  
10*A + B = some unique answer.

To proceed, I will:

- Enumerate all pairs (A, B) with A, B in 0..9.
- For each pair, compute (1001*A + 110*B)^2.
- Check if it equals 57108249.
- If yes, record the pair and output 10*A+B as the answer.

This will find the pair(s) satisfying the equation and produce the unique answer.

```python
# Enumerate all A, B in [0..9] to find the pair satisfying the equation
target = 57108249
for A in range(10):
    for B in range(10):
        value = (1001 * A + 110 * B) ** 2
        if value == target:
            answer = 10 * A + B
            print(f"Found: A={A}, B={B}, 10*A+B={answer}")
```
