The problem involves a family of functions \( f(k, x) = \sin^6 x + \cos^6 x + k (\sin^4 x + \cos^4 x) \) parameterized by \( k \), and asks to find all \( k \in \mathbb{R} \) for which there exists some \( c \in \mathbb{R} \) such that \( f(k, c) = 0 \).

To assist, I will:
- Fix various \( k \) values in a small range.
- For each \( k \), explore possible \( c \) values within a reasonable domain.
- Use the structure of the function, noticing it depends on trigonometric powers, so the range is bounded.

The key is to find, for each \( k \), whether the equation has a solution in \( c \). Since \( c \) appears only inside \( \sin c \) and \( \cos c \), I can discretize \( c \) over \([0, 2\pi]\), check if \( f(k, c) \) hits zero, and list all such \( k \).

Here's the code:

```python
import numpy as np

# Define the function based on the given formula
def f(k, x):
    sinx = np.sin(x)
    cosx = np.cos(x)
    return sinx**6 + cosx**6 + k * (sinx**4 + cosx**4)

# Discretize c over [0, 2pi]
c_values = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 1000)

# Range of k to test
k_values = np.linspace(-10, 10, 100)

# Store all k for which solutions exist
solutions_k = []

for k in k_values:
    # Check if any c yields f(k, c) = 0 within tolerance
    values = f(k, c_values)
    if np.any(np.abs(values) < 1e-6):
        print(f'k = {k:.2f} has solutions')
        solutions_k.append(k)

# Output the list of all such k
print('All such k:', solutions_k)
```

This code yields an approximation of the parametric values \( k \) where solutions exist, guiding possible conjectures about the exact set.
