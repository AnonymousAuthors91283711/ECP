theorem omnimath2783 : 
  ∃! (n : ℕ), n + (n + 1) + (n + 2) = 27 ∧ n * (n + 1) * (n + 2) = omnimath2783_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n = 8: sum = 27, product = 720. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The sum condition implies n + (n+1) + (n+2) = 3n + 3 = 27, so n = 8. The product is 8*9*10 = 720. The unique n is 8, so the answer is 720. 

<<<720>>>
