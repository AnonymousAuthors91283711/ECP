Ground Truth Answer: 56
Proposed Answer: 96
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the value of a multivariate polynomial P evaluated at (2,4,8) under certain constraints:
   - Total degree of P is 4
   - P is cyclic in its variables (a,b,c)
   - P vanishes when two variables are equal (a,a,b)
   - P(1,2,3) = 1

2. The ground truth answer is 56, while the proposed answer is 96.

3. The constraints suggest that P should be a multiple of (a-b)(b-c)(c-a)(a+b+c), but since the total degree must be 4, this would require a constant multiplier.

4. Evaluating (1-2)(2-3)(3-1)(1+2+3) = (-1)(-1)(2)(6) = 12, but P(1,2,3)=1, so the polynomial would be 1/12 of this form.

5. Then P(2,4,8) would be (2-4)(4-8)(8-2)(2+4+8)/12 = (-2)(-4)(6)(14)/12 = 56.

The proposed answer of 96 doesn't match this calculation. The ground truth answer of 56 is correct based on the polynomial form implied by the constraints.
