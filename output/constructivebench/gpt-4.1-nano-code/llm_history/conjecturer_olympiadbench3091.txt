. Enumerated answers: Candidate answer for T=2: (5+0j)
Approximate magnitude: 5.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Considering the algebraic expressions, the product (-T - i) * (i - T) simplifies to a real number when T=2. Substituting T=2, the expression yields (5+0j). Therefore, the real part (the answer) is 5.
