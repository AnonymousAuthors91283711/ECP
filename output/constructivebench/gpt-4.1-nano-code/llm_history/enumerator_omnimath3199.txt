The problem appears to involve analyzing divisibility conditions related to powers of two, specifically for natural numbers \( n \) less than \( 10^{100} \). The conditions are:

- \( n \mid 2^n \),
- \( (n - 1) \mid (2^n - 1) \),
- \( (n - 2) \mid (2^n - 2) \).

We are asked to understand the set of all \( n \) satisfying this conjunction, and to enumerate the possibilities within a feasible range for check.

Given the divisibility conditions and the structure, a natural approach is to check small values of \( n \) systematically, and to look for any pattern or potential infinite families.

**Key points:**
- For \( n \) dividing \( 2^n \): only works trivially for \( n=1 \) (since \( 1 \mid 2^1 \)), and unlikely for larger \( n \) unless \( n \) is a power of 2 or related.
- For \( (n-1) \mid (2^n - 1) \): resembles factors of Fermat-like numbers.
- For \( (n-2) \mid (2^n - 2) \): similar pattern, perhaps reducing to small \( n \).

Given the complexity, and the challenge of the problem, the most feasible method in code is to brute-force search for small \( n \), up to a practical threshold, and then observe the results.

Let's choose to examine \( n \) from 1 up to, say, 1000, because beyond that it becomes infeasible to check all without more properties. We will print each \( n \) that satisfies the three conditions.

```python
# Enumerate candidate natural numbers n from 1 to 1000
# Check the three divisibility conditions:
# n divides 2^n
# (n - 1) divides (2^n - 1)
# (n - 2) divides (2^n - 2)
# Print each n that satisfies all three

max_n = 1000

for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
    # Avoid division by zero issues
    if n == 1:
        cond1 = (2 ** n) % n == 0
        cond2 = ((n - 1) != 0 and ((2 ** n - 1) % (n - 1) == 0))
        cond3 = True  # (n - 2) = -1, skip for n=1 as a special case
        if cond1 and (n - 1) == 0:
            # Only first condition matters for n=1
            print(n)
        elif cond1 and cond2:
            print(n)
        continue
    if n == 2:
        cond1 = (2 ** n) % n == 0
        cond2 = ((n - 1) != 0 and ((2 ** n - 1) % (n - 1) == 0))
        cond3 = ((n - 2) != 0 and ((2 ** n - 2) % (n - 2) == 0))
        if cond1 and cond2 and cond3:
            print(n)
        continue
    # For n >= 3:
    cond1 = (2 ** n) % n == 0
    cond2 = ((n - 1) != 0 and ((2 ** n - 1) % (n - 1) == 0))
    cond3 = ((n - 2) != 0 and ((2 ** n - 2) % (n - 2) == 0))
    if cond1 and cond2 and cond3:
        print(n)
```
