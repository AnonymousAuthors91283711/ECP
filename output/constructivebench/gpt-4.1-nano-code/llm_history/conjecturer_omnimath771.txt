theorem omnimath771 : 
  (List.sum (Nat.digits 10 (Nat.choose 1000 100))) = omnimath771_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 621. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The sum of digits of \(\binom{1000}{100}\) can be estimated considering the binomial coefficient's magnitude and distribution of digits. Given the enumerated answer 621 aligns with the sum of digits in the expansion, a plausible closed form respecting the pattern and the nature of digit sums is 621.
