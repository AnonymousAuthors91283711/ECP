The problem asks to compute \(2^{2001} \mod (2^7 - 1)\). Since \(2^7 - 1 = 127\), we're calculating \(2^{2001} \mod 127\). To do this efficiently, we can use modular exponentiation with the Chinese Remainder Theorem if needed, but since 127 is prime, Fermat's little theorem simplifies from \(2^{126} \equiv 1 \pmod{127}\). Thus, we only need \(2001 \mod 126\). 

Calculate \(2001 \mod 126\), then compute \(2^{(2001 \mod 126)} \mod 127\). This approach is straightforward and efficient.

```python
# Compute the exponent modulo 126 because 127 is prime, and Fermat's Little Theorem applies
exponent_mod = 2001 % 126

# Compute 2^{exponent_mod} mod 127
answer = pow(2, exponent_mod, 127)

# Immediately print the result
print(answer)
```
