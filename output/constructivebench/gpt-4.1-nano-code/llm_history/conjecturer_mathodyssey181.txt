theorem mathodyssey181 (x : ℤ) : 
    (x + 4) * 6 = 8 * x + 30 ↔ x = mathodyssey181_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: -3. Expected Answer Type: ℤ
Given the equation (x + 4) * 6 = 8 * x + 30, solving for x yields:

6x + 24 = 8x + 30
Subtract 6x: 24 = 2x + 30
Subtract 30: -6 = 2x
Divide: x = -3

Thus, the answer is a constant expression.
