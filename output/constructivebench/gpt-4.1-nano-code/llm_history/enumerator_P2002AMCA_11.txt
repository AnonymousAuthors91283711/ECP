The problem appears to involve a set of equations relating variables \(d, t, v\). The key is to find all possible \(v\) values satisfying the given conditions. The conditions include:

1. \(d / 40 = t + 3/60\)
2. \(d / 60 = t - 3/60\)
3. \(d / v = t\)

Given these, our goal is to find all \(v > 0\) that satisfy the equations.

To solve this:

- From (1) and (2), we express \(d\) in terms of \(t\):
  \[
  d = 40(t + 3/60) = 40t + 2
  \]
  \[
  d = 60(t - 3/60) = 60t - 3
  \]
  
- Equate these:
  \[
  40t + 2 = 60t - 3
  \]
  \[
  20t = 5 \Rightarrow t = \frac{1}{4}
  \]

- Find \(d\):
  \[
  d = 40 \times \frac{1}{4} + 2 = 10 + 2 = 12
  \]

- From (3):
  \[
  d / v = t = \frac{1}{4}
  \]
  \[
  v = d / t = 12 / (1/4) = 12 \times 4 = 48
  \]

- Check if \(v > 0\): Yes, \(v=48\).

- Since the equations are linear and produce a unique solution, the set of possible \(v\) is \(\{48\}\).

Here's a Python script that enumerates possible \(v\) given the equations, confirming the solution:

```python
# Enumerate candidate solutions for v satisfying the system
# Given the linear relations, solution is unique:
t = 1/4
d = 40 * t + 2  # from first equation
v = d / t      # from third equation
print(f"Possible v: {v}")

# If needed, check the second relation as a consistency check
d2 = 60 * (t - 3/60)
assert abs(d - d2) < 1e-8, "Inconsistent equations"

# Output the answer
print(f"Answer: {v}")
```
