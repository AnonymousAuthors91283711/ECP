This problem involves examining the values of the `powerTower` function, which is a recursive exponential tower, to find the least `n` such that `powerTower n 2 > powerTower 4 3`. To assist in conjecturing and proving the answer, I will enumerate candidate values for `n`, compare their `powerTower` results with `powerTower 4 3`, and determine the minimal satisfying `n`. Since full exact enumeration is challenging for large height towers, I will limit the range and focus on small values first. I will print each candidate answer immediately upon evaluation.


```python
# Enumerate potential n to find the least n > 0 where powerTower(n, 2) > powerTower(4, 3).
# Since powerTower grows extremely rapidly, enumerate small n up to 10 for demonstration.

def power_tower(n, x):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    elif n == 1:
        return x
    else:
        result = 1
        for _ in range(n):
            result = x ** result
        return result

# Compute powerTower(4,3)
target = power_tower(4, 3)
print(f"powerTower(4,3) = {target}")

n = 1
while n <= 10:
    val = power_tower(n, 2)
    print(f"n={n}, powerTower({n}, 2) = {val}")
    if val > target:
        print(f"Found minimal n={n} where powerTower(n, 2) > powerTower(4, 3)")
        break
    n += 1
```
