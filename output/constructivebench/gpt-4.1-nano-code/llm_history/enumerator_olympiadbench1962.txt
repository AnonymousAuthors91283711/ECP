The problem is a classic algebraic number theory puzzle involving three positive natural numbers \(a, b, c\), with conditions related to the differences of their pairwise products being powers of two. Specifically, for positive integers \(a, b, c\), the conditions involve the differences: \(ab - c\), \(bc - a\), and \(ca - b\), each being a power of two.

**Approach:**
- Assign small sample values for the variables \(a, b, c\) with positive constraints.
- Check the conditions:
  - \(ab - c = 2^k\)
  - \(bc - a = 2^l\)
  - \(ca - b = 2^m\)
- Enumerate small values to find possible solutions.
- When found, print the tuple \((a, b, c)\) immediately.
- To confirm the pattern, test a grid of small values and record solutions.

The code will:
- Loop over small values of \(a, b, c\) (say up to 20 to keep within token limits).
- For each, check if the three differences are powers of two.
- If yes, print the solution immediately.

```python
# Enumerate small positive integers for a, b, c
# Check if the differences are powers of two
# Print solutions immediately when found
import math

# Helper to check if a number is a power of two
def is_power_of_two(n):
    return n > 0 and (n & (n - 1)) == 0

# Search over small values of a, b, c
for a in range(1, 21):
    for b in range(1, 21):
        for c in range(1, 21):
            diff1 = a * b - c
            diff2 = b * c - a
            diff3 = c * a - b
            if all(is_power_of_two(d) for d in [diff1, diff2, diff3]):
                print((a, b, c))
```
