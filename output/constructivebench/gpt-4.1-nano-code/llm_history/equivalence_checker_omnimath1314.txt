theorem omnimath1314 : 
  HasSum (fun n : ℕ => (1 : ℚ) / ((n + 3)^2 + (n + 1))) omnimath1314_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 13/36
Proposed Answer: (3 : ℚ) / 8
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find the sum of the series Σ (1/((n+3)² + (n+1))) from n=0 to ∞.

2. The ground truth answer is 13/36 ≈ 0.36111...

3. The proposed answer is 3/8 = 0.375

4. Let's compute the first few terms to check:
   - n=0: 1/(9 + 1) = 1/10
   - n=1: 1/(16 + 2) = 1/18
   - n=2: 1/(25 + 3) = 1/28
   - n=3: 1/(36 + 4) = 1/40
   Sum of first 4 terms ≈ 0.1 + 0.0556 + 0.0357 + 0.025 ≈ 0.2163

The partial sums are clearly converging to something less than 0.375, and the ground truth 13/36 ≈ 0.3611 seems more plausible than 3/8 = 0.375.
