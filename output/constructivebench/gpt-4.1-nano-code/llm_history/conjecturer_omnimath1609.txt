abbrev omnimath1609_answer : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath1609 (x y : ℝ) (hx : 0 < x) (hy : 0 < y) :
  let a := 1 + x / y
  let b := 1 + y / x
  a^2 + b^2 = 15 → a^3 + b^3 = omnimath1609_answer x y := by sorry. Enumerated answers: The computed answer for typical cases is 50.. Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ → ℝ
Based on pattern analysis and symmetry of variables x, y, the answer likely simplifies to a constant independent of x and y. 

Given the structure with a^2 + b^2 = 15 and symmetry, a plausible closed-form for a^3 + b^3 is 50.

<<<50>>>
