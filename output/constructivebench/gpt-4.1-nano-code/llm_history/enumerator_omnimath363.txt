The problem involves a sequence \(a\) with certain constraints: \(a(1) = 1\) and that for all \(i < n\), \(a(i+1) \leq a(i) + 1\). We need to determine the sum over \(i\) of the product over \(j\) of the \(a(j+1)\). Given the constraints, \(a(i)\) can range from 1 up to \(i\), as each step increases by at most 1. The sum of the products depends on the choice of \(a(i)\), so to analyze the possible answers, we'll enumerate candidate \(a(i)\) sequences, prioritizing minimal and maximal values within constraints, and then compute the sum as per the sum of products formula.

The key intuition:
- With initial \(a(1) = 1\), the minimal \(a(i)\) for each \(i\) is 1 (constant),
- The maximal \(a(i)\) increases by 1 at each step, resulting in \(a(i) = i\),

We will enumerate these two cases for small \(n\) (say, up to 5) to observe the sums.

```python
# Program to enumerate sum of products based on sequences with constraints
def enumerate_answers(n):
    results = []

    def generate_a(i, a, max_a_i):
        if i > n:
            # Compute the sum over i
            total = 0
            for idx in range(1, n + 1):
                prod = 1
                for j in range(idx):
                    prod *= a[j]
                total += prod
            print(f"Sequence: {a[1:]}, Sum: {total}")
            return
        # a(i) can be from 1 to a(i-1)+1, but at most n to stay within bounds
        start_value = 1
        end_value = max_a_i + 1
        for val in range(start_value, end_value + 1):
            a[i] = val
            generate_a(i + 1, a, val)

    # Minimal sequence: all a(i) = 1
    a_min = [0] * (n + 1)
    generate_a(1, a_min, 1)

    # Maximal sequence: a(i) = i
    a_max = [0] + [i for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    # Compute sum for maximal sequence directly
    total = 0
    for idx in range(1, n + 1):
        prod = 1
        for j in range(1, idx + 1):
            prod *= a_max[j]
        total += prod
    print(f"Max sequence: {a_max[1:]}, Sum: {total}")

# Run for small n to analyze possible sums and answers
if __name__ == "__main__":
    enumerate_answers(4)
