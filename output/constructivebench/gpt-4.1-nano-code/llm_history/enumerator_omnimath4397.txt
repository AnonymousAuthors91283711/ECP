The problem asks us to find all integer pairs (x, y) satisfying the equation:  
x² + xy + y² = ((x + y)/3 + 1)³

To solve this, we can interpret and bound the possible integer solutions by exploring small integer values. In particular:
- Test small values of (x, y) where |x|, |y| ≤ 10 to find solutions.
- For each, check if the equation holds.
- Output all solutions found.

This guarantees a broad search for solutions, focusing on computational simplicity and completeness within small bounds.

```python
# Enumerate small integer pairs (x, y) within a reasonable bound
max_abs = 10
solutions = []

for x in range(-max_abs, max_abs + 1):
    for y in range(-max_abs, max_abs + 1):
        lhs = x**2 + x*y + y**2
        denom = 3
        sum_xy = x + y
        rhs = ((sum_xy / denom) + 1) ** 3
        # Check if rhs is close enough to an integer (since rhs on RHS is a rational cube)
        # But since rhs is calculated from rational, to check equality:
        if abs(rhs - round(rhs)) < 1e-9:
            rhs_int = round(rhs)
            if lhs == rhs_int:
                print(f"Solution found: (x, y) = ({x}, {y})")
                solutions.append((x, y))
```
