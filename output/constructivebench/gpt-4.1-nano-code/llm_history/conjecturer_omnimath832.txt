. Enumerated answers: 13. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The sequences are linear recursions with exponential growth components. Given the initial conditions and recurrence relations, rabbit grows faster than squirrel after some point. The minimal y > 0 satisfying rabbit y > squirrel y is likely y = 13, as per enumeration.
