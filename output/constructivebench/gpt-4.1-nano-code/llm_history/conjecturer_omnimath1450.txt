. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The probability that two intervals of duration 0.75 hours within the specified ranges overlap is calculated. Given the uniform distributions and the intersection condition, the region is proportional to (start difference + 0.75 minus constraint). The ratio simplifies to \(\frac{1}{8}\times\) overlap length in the joint space, resulting in the fraction \(\frac{11}{40}\).
