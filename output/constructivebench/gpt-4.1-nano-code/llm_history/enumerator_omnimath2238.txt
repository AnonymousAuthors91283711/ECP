The problem seems to involve finding the least natural number \( n \) such that there exist four distinct primes \( p, q, r, s \) satisfying two conditions:

1. \( p + q + r + s = n \)
2. \( p \times q - r \times s \) is divisible by 30

Since the problem asks for the least such \( n \), we can attempt to enumerate small combinations of four distinct primes and check these conditions. Our approach:
- Generate small prime numbers.
- For each combination of four distinct primes, check the divisibility condition and sum.
- Record those sums where the conditions are satisfied.
- Output the minimal sum encountered.

This approach is efficient enough given the small prime samples we will restrict ourselves to (say, first few primes).

```python
# Python code to find the least n = p+q+r+s for four distinct primes p,q,r,s
# satisfying (p*q - r*s) divisible by 30

import itertools

def generate_primes(limit):
    sieve = [True]*(limit+1)
    sieve[0], sieve[1] = False, False
    for i in range(2, int(limit**0.5)+1):
        if sieve[i]:
            for j in range(i*i, limit+1, i):
                sieve[j] = False
    return [p for p in range(2, limit+1) if sieve[p]]

primes = generate_primes(50)  # generate primes up to 50 for small search
min_sum = None

# Generate all combinations of 4 distinct primes
for combo in itertools.combinations(primes, 4):
    p, q, r, s = combo
    # Check divisibility by 30 for p*q - r*s
    if (p*q - r*s) % 30 == 0:
        n = p + q + r + s
        # Update minimum sum
        if min_sum is None or n < min_sum:
            min_sum = n
            # Print every valid combination found immediately
            print(f"Found: primes {combo}, sum {n}, p*q - r*s = {p*q - r*s}")

print("Minimum n with required properties:", min_sum)
```
