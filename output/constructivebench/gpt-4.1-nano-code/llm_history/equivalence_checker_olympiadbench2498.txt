Ground Truth Answer: fun x => (1/2) * Real.sqrt x
Proposed Answer: fun x => sqrt x
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer `fun x => sqrt x` is close to the ground truth `fun x => (1/2) * Real.sqrt x` but not exactly equivalent. The difference is a factor of 1/2. While both involve the square root function, the scaling factor is missing in the proposed answer, making it incorrect for the given equation. The answer is "Close" because the core mathematical operation (square root) is correct, but the coefficient is wrong.
