This problem involves counting bijections \( f: \text{Fin } 6 \to \text{Fin } 6 \) satisfying a particular condition: for each \( k \in \text{Fin } 5 \), there exists an \( i \in \text{Fin } k \) such that \( (f(i)).val > k.val \). In essence, it asks for the number of permutations of 6 elements with a certain property related to the images of initial segments.

To enumerate such permutations:
- We will test all permutations of the 6-element set.
- For each permutation, check if for all \( k \in \text{Fin } 5 \), there exists an \( i < k \) with \( f(i) > k \).
- Count those permutations, output each as we find it.

This brute force approach is feasible because \( 6! = 720 \) permutations, which is computationally manageable.

```python
import itertools

# Fin is 0-based indexing: {0,1,2,3,4,5}
elements = range(6)
count = 0

for perm in itertools.permutations(elements):
    valid = True
    # Check the condition for each k in {0,1,2,3,4}
    for k in range(5):
        # There must exist an i < k with perm[i] > k
        if not any(perm[i] > k for i in range(k)):
            valid = False
            break
    if valid:
        count += 1
        print(f"Permutation: {perm}")
print(f"Total count: {count}")
```
