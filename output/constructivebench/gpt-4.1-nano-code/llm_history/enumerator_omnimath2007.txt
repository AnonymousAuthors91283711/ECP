The provided problem appears to involve modular arithmetic, with the goal of identifying all triple-digit combinations (A,B,C) with each digit in 0..9 such that a specific 7-digit number N (formed by certain digits and parameters) is divisible by 792. The number N is constructed as 
N = 5×10^6 + A×10^5 + B×10^4 + 3×10^3 + 7×10^2 + C×10 + 2.

Our task is to find (A, B, C) such that N % 792 = 0.

Since the problem asks for a Python enumeration to help with conjecture and proof, I'll:
- Fix N's structure for small sample values.
- Loop through all (A, B, C) in 0..9.
- Check divisibility.
- Print all solutions immediately as they are found.

This is straightforward and should help with understanding the divisibility condition.

```python
# Enumerate all possible (A, B, C) in 0..9 for the given N structure
# and print those for which N is divisible by 792.

for A in range(10):
    for B in range(10):
        for C in range(10):
            N = 5_000_000 + A*100_000 + B*10_000 + 3_000 + 700 + C*10 + 2
            if N % 792 == 0:
                print(f"A={A}, B={B}, C={C}, N={N}")
```
