The error arises because Lean does not recognize the notation ±4 or ∓8 directly; such shorthand isn't valid in formal Lean code. Instead, each solution must be explicitly written out, enumerating all possible values consistent with the given solutions. Based on the enumerated solutions, we observe four specific points: (0,0,0), (-4,-8,-8), (4,0,0), and (4,8,8).

To express this as a set comprehensively, I will list these four points directly. To ensure the answer is elegant and matches the pattern of solutions, I define a set containing all these four points explicitly.
