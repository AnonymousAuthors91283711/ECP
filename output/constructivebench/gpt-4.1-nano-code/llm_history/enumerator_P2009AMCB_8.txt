[write_program]
This appears to be formal Lean code, not a high school math problem. However, I will assume it's a typical algebra problem involving parameters `a` and `b`, and that the goal is to find the value of some expression involving `a` and `b`, consistent with the propositions given. 

Given the equations:
1) (2/3)c + w = a
2) (1/2)c + w = b
3) c + w = P2009AMCB_8_answer a b

My task is to write Python code that enumerates possible answers for `P2009AMCB_8_answer a b` given small sample values of `a` and `b`.

Since the equations are linear, we can solve for `c` and `w`:

Subtract (2) from (1):
(2/3)c - (1/2)c = a - b
→ (4/6)c - (3/6)c = a - b
→ (1/6)c = a - b
→ c = 6(a - b)

Then:
From (3): w = a - (2/3)c
But it's clearer to use one of the initial equations:

Using (1):
w = a - (2/3)c = a - (2/3)*6(a - b) = a - 4(a - b) = a - 4a + 4b = -3a + 4b

Similarly, from (3):
c + w = P
→ P = c + w = 6(a - b) + (-3a + 4b) = 6a - 6b - 3a + 4b = (6a - 3a) + (-6b + 4b) = 3a - 2b

So, P(a, b) = 3a - 2b

I will write code to test small values of a and b, and output P(a,b).

```python
# Enumerate small integer values of a and b
for a in range(0, 3):        # a = 0, 1, 2
    for b in range(0, 3):    # b = 0, 1, 2
        P = 3 * a - 2 * b
        print(f'a={a}, b={b} => P = {P}')
```

This code efficiently computes all small test cases and prints the corresponding answer.
