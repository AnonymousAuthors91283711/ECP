  (∑ k in Finset.range 2001, (-1 : ℤ)^(k + 1) * (k + 1) * (k + 2)) = omnimath844_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: -2004002. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the pattern of the sum and the signs, the sum telescopes, revealing a simple expression. The sum simplifies to a constant value independent of complexity. The enumerated answer suggests the pattern is -2004002, and positivity is unlikely given the leading negative pattern. The final simplified expression in a closed form is:

<<<(2 * (2001)^2) - 2004>>>
