    let n := 2020;
    let total := n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) / 6;
    let isosceles := n * (n - 1);
    isosceles / Nat.gcd isosceles total = a ∧
    total / Nat.gcd isosceles total = b := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Candidate answer: a = 3, b = 1009
Answer: (a, b) = (3, 1009)
. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests that total = 100*a + b, with a and b coprime where a is small relative to total, and b close to total / 2. Given the enumeration, the answer matches (a, b) = (3, 1009). The expression 100*a + b = 100*3 + 1009 = 1309. 

Final answer: <<<1309>>>
