theorem olympiadbench2960 : 
  {d : ℕ | d < 10 ∧ ∀ (n : ℕ), 100 ≤ n ∧ n ≤ 400 ∧ (∃ k, k^2 = n) → ¬(d ∈ digits 10 n)} = {olympiadbench2960_answer} := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 7. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The answer is the digit 7, which remains outside the squares between 100 and 400, as no digit in 7 appears as a digit of any perfect square in that range. The answer is thus the constant 7, independent of n.
