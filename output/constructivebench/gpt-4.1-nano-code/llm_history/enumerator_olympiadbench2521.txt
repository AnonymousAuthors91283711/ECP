The problem describes a right triangle with side lengths `a`, `b`, `c`, where `a < b < c`, satisfying \(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\), and the differences between consecutive sides are equal (\(b - a = c - b\)). Additionally, one of the sides is 60, and the area is \(A = \frac{a b}{2}\).

Since \(b - a = c - b\), this implies \(c = 2b - a\). The positions for the side equal to 60 are to be checked, and the goal is to enumerate all possible areas `A` from these configurations.

We can approach as follows:
- For each side being 60, find corresponding `a` and `b`.
- Use the Pythagoras theorem to restrict and find possible `(a, b, c)`.
- Calculate the area and print it.

Because the problem asks for enumeration of solutions and the largest area might be of interest, we'll consider a reasonable range for `a` and `b` around 60 and check for integer solutions that satisfy the equations.

Here's the implementation:

```python
# Enumeration of all right triangles with the given properties.
# For each side equal to 60, solve for other sides and compute the area.

import math

# We will check for 'a', 'b' around 60 in a small range
limit = 200  # limit to search for solutions

def get_area(a, b):
    return (a * b) / 2

answers = set()

# Check when side c=60
for a in range(1, 200):
    for b in range(a+1, 200):
        c = 2*b - a
        if c > 200 or c <= b:
            continue
        # Validate the Pythagorean relation
        if abs(a**2 + b**2 - c**2) < 1e-6:
            # Check if one side is 60
            if 60 in (a, b, c):
                area = get_area(a, b)
                print(area)
                answers.add(area)

# Check when side b=60
for a in range(1, 200):
    c = 2*60 - a
    b = 60
    if c <= b:
        continue
    if abs(a**2 + b**2 - c**2) < 1e-6:
        area = get_area(a, b)
        print(area)
        answers.add(area)

# Check when side a=60
for b in range(1, 200):
    c = 2*b - 60
    a = 60
    if c <= b:
        continue
    if abs(a**2 + b**2 - c**2) < 1e-6:
        area = get_area(a, b)
        print(area)
        answers.add(area)
```
