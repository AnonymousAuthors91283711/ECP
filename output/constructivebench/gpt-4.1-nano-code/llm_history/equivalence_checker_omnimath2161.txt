Ground Truth Answer: {5}
Proposed Answer: { p | p = 5 ∧ Nat.Prime p }
<<<True>>>
The ground truth answer is the set containing only the number 5. The proposed answer is the set of all prime numbers p where p equals 5, which is exactly the set {5}. Both answers are equivalent because they describe the same set. The additional condition Nat.Prime p in the proposed answer is redundant since 5 is already known to be prime, but it doesn't change the resulting set.
