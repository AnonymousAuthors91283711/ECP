This problem appears to involve sets of natural numbers with specific closure properties: containing 0, and if a number is in the set, then adding 8 and 9 also produce numbers in the set. The theorem states that the size (cardinality) of such a set is some value we're asked to determine, but it is currently marked as `sorry`.

To explore possible solutions, we can focus on the smallest set satisfying these conditions and then enumerate all numbers in the set up to some reasonable threshold to infer the size.

The set is closed under the operations of adding 8 and 9, starting from 0, meaning it contains all numbers reachable via any combination of adding 8 and 9 multiple times.

Therefore, the set S consists of all numbers of the form:

    0 + 8a + 9b, for non-negative integers a, b.

We can enumerate all such numbers up to a certain limit, say 300, to see which numbers are represented.

Here's the Python code:

```python
# Enumerate all numbers of the form 8a + 9b where a, b ≥ 0 and the number ≤ 300
limit = 300
numbers_in_set = set()

# Since 8a + 9b ≤ limit,
# limit a and b to (limit // 8) and (limit // 9) respectively
max_a = limit // 8
max_b = limit // 9

for a in range(max_a + 1):
    for b in range(max_b + 1):
        value = 8 * a + 9 * b
        if value <= limit:
            print(value)
            numbers_in_set.add(value)

# Output number of distinct elements found
print('Total elements in set up to', limit, ':', len(numbers_in_set))
```

This program lists all candidate elements of the set, which can help identify the size or pattern.  
The full set will be all numbers `8a + 9b` within the limit, so the size is the count of such unique values.

This approach allows us to approximate the size of the set, and by increasing the limit, we can be more confident about the total size if needed.
