To solve the problem, we need to find the least natural number \( n \) such that:
- \( n > 20 \)
- \( 13 + \frac{n - 20}{4} = \frac{n}{2} \)
- \( (n - 20) \% 4 = 0 \)

Let's analyze the equation:
\( 13 + \frac{n - 20}{4} = \frac{n}{2} \)

Multiplying both sides by 4:
\( 52 + n - 20 = 2n \)

Simplify:
\( 32 + n = 2n \)

Rearranged:
\( 32 = 2n - n = n \)

But this seems inconsistent with the constraints (e.g., \( n > 20 \)), and since \( n = 32 \) satisfies this and the divisibility condition:

- Check \( n=32 \):
  - \( n > 20 \): Yes.
  - \( (n-20) \% 4 = (12) \% 4 = 0 \): Yes.
  - \( 13 + (12/4) = 13 + 3 = 16 \)
  - \( n/2 = 16 \)
The equality holds, so \( n=32 \) satisfies all conditions.

Let's verify if that is the minimal such \( n \). The initial algebra suggests that \( n=32 \) is the only solution.

Now, I'll write a Python script to systematically verify candidate solutions for the smallest \( n > 20 \) that satisfy all conditions, and print the answer immediately when found.

```python
# Python script to find the least n > 20 satisfying the given conditions
for n in range(21, 1000):  # upper bound large enough
    if (n - 20) % 4 == 0:
        left_side = 13 + (n - 20) // 4
        right_side = n // 2
        if left_side == right_side:
            print(n)
            break
```
