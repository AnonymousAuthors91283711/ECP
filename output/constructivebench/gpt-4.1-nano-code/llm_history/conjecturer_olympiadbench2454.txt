theorem olympiadbench2454 :
  let faces := [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]
  let outcomes := (List.product faces faces).map (fun (a, b) => a + b)
  let prime_sums := outcomes.filter (fun n => Prime n)
  prime_sums.length / outcomes.length = olympiadbench2454_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 6/36. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The ratio simplifies to the number of prime sums over total pairs. Out of the 36 pairs, the prime sums are those where a + b is prime: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, from the faces `[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]`. Counting, these total to 6. Thus, the ratio is 6/36 = 1/6. The expression in Lean:

<<<1/6>>>
