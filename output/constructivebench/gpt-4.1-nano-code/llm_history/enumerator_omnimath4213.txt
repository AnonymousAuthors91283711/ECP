The problem relates to polynomial factorization over integers, specifically examining if a quadratic polynomial times some polynomial equals a certain sum involving binomial-like coefficients. To find all integer pairs (a, b) satisfying this condition, I will systematically enumerate possible (a, b) pairs, focusing on small integer values due to the problem's constraints.

Given that the sum involves binomial-like coefficients and the polynomial (X^2 + a X + b), I suspect plausible values are small integers, and the sum resembles a binomial expansion with some sign alterations.

I will:
- Loop over small integer values of a and b (say, from -10 to 10).
- For each pair, check if the polynomial times some polynomial equals the specified sum.
- Express the sum explicitly for small n (e.g., n=0,1,2,...,5) since the sum's size depends on n and the coefficients.
- For each candidate (a, b), perform polynomial expansion and compare.

Given the problem's complexity, I will focus on enumerating potential solutions without solving the entire polynomial equation analytically, just testing small cases.

```python
# Enumerate small integer pairs (a, b) and check if the polynomial times some P matches the sum
import sympy as sp

# Variables
X = sp.symbols('X')

# Define the range for a, b, and n
a_values = range(-10, 11)
b_values = range(-10, 11)
max_n = 5

# Function to generate the sum polynomial for given n
def generate_sum(n):
    total = 0
    for i in range(n+1):
        if i == n:
            coef = 1
        elif i == n - 1:
            coef = 1
        else:
            coef = (-1)**i
        total += coef * X**i
    return total

# Store solutions
solutions = []

for a in a_values:
    for b in b_values:
        poly_q = X**2 + a*X + b
        for n in range(0, max_n+1):
            sum_poly = generate_sum(n)
            # Attempt to find polynomial P such that poly_q * P = sum_poly
            # For degrees up to n, P should be degree n-2 (if n >=2), but since P is unknown,
            # test if sum_poly is divisible by poly_q, or if the division yields a polynomial.
            quotient, remainder = sp.div(sum_poly, poly_q, X)
            if remainder == 0:
                # Found a candidate
                solutions.append((a, b, n))
                print(f"Found solution: a={a}, b={b}, n={n}")
                break  # no need to check larger n for this (a,b)
# Final output of solutions
print("Candidates (a,b,n):", solutions)
```
