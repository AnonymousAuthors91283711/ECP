The problem appears to involve partitioning the integers from 1 to n into three disjoint subsets A, B, and C with the following properties:
- All elements in A are odd.
- All elements in B are even.
- All elements in C are multiples of 3.
- The union of A, B, and C is the set {1, 2, ..., n}.
- These sets are pairwise disjoint.
- The sums over these sets are all equal.

Given that n is even and less than 100, we want to find all such n for which such a partition exists. This is a classic combinatorial problem involving parity and divisibility constraints.

Approach:
- Pick small values of n (even numbers less than 100).
- For each n, check if the set {1, 2, ..., n} can be partitioned into A, B, C satisfying the properties.
- Because the sums must be equal, sum(A) = sum(B) = sum(C). We can use simple heuristics or brute-force enumeration (since n<100) to find such partitions.
- For the sake of efficiency and streamlining, we will precompute the sums, identify candidate subsets, and check conditions.

Here's a Python script to perform this enumeration:

```python
# Enumerates possible n < 100, even, for which such a partition exists.
# It tries all possible partitions by subset enumeration.
import itertools

def check_partition(n):
    numbers = set(range(1, n + 1))
    odds = set(x for x in numbers if x % 2 == 1)
    evens = set(x for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0)
    mult3 = set(x for x in numbers if x % 3 == 0)

    total_sum = sum(numbers)
    # Since sums are equal: 3 * sum_A = total_sum
    if total_sum % 3 != 0:
        return False
    target_sum = total_sum // 3

    # Generate all subsets for A (odd numbers)
    for size_A in range(len(odds) + 1):
        for A_subset in itertools.combinations(odds, size_A):
            A_set = set(A_subset)
            sum_A = sum(A_set)
            if sum_A > target_sum:
                continue
            remaining_after_A = numbers - A_set
            # Generate B subsets (even numbers)
            for size_B in range(len(evens) + 1):
                for B_subset in itertools.combinations(evens & remaining_after_A, size_B):
                    B_set = set(B_subset)
                    sum_B = sum(B_set)
                    if sum_A != sum_B:
                        continue
                    remaining_after_B = remaining_after_A - B_set
                    # For C, must be multiples of 3
                    C_candidates = mult3 & remaining_after_B
                    sum_C = sum(C_candidates)
                    if sum_C == sum_A:
                        # Check disjointness
                        if A_set.isdisjoint(B_set):
                            C_set = C_candidates
                            # Final check: union covers all
                            union_sets = A_set | B_set | C_set
                            if union_sets == numbers:
                                print(f"n={n} with A={A_set}, B={B_set}, C={C_set}")
                                return True
    return False

# Iterate over even n less than 100
for n in range(2, 100, 2):
    if check_partition(n):
        print(f"Possible n: {n}")
```

This will print all n < 100 for which the partition exists along with a sample partition. The code prioritizes finding exact solutions, streaming output, and avoids hardcoded results. Maximize efficiency by pruning impossible partitions early.
