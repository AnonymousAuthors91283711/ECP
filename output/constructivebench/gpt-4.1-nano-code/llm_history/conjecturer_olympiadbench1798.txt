theorem olympiadbench1798 (n : ℕ) (hn : n ≥ 1) :
  (∃ a b : ℕ, a > 0 ∧ b > 0 ∧ (∀ p : ℕ, Nat.Prime p → ¬ p^3 ∣ (a^2 + b + 3)) ∧
  (a * b + 3 * b + 8) / (a^2 + b + 3) = n) ↔ n = olympiadbench1798_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found n=3 for a=1, b=4
Found n=2 for a=3, b=4
Found n=2 for a=5, b=8. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern indicates that the value of n depends on the ratio involving a and b with certain constraints. The enumerated solutions suggest the possible outputs are 2 and 3. Given the structure, the only consistent closed-form answer fitting these constraints appears to be 2, as it corresponds to multiple (a, b) pairs satisfying the conditions. Thus, the answer fixed for all such (a, b) should be 2.
