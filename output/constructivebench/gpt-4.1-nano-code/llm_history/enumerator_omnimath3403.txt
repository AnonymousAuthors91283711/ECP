[write_program]
The problem appears to involve algebraic manipulation of a polynomial with rational coefficients, specifically dealing with roots of a quadratic polynomial expression. The goal is to find the sum or product of roots or some related value. To help with this, I will write a Python program that:

- Defines the polynomial `(X - 4)(X - 2) + (X - 2)(X - 6)`.
- Expands the polynomial to standard form.
- Finds its roots (approximated).
- Computes and prints relevant quantities like roots and their product or sum.
- Streamlines to enumerate solutions or specific answers in the problem context.
  
This approach will allow us to directly compute and verify the roots and related quantities. The code will be concise and efficient, matching the problem's structure.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the variable
X = sp.symbols('X')

# Define the polynomial expression as per the problem
poly_expr = (X - 4)*(X - 2) + (X - 2)*(X - 6)

# Expand the polynomial
poly_expanded = sp.expand(poly_expr)

print(f"Expanded polynomial: {poly_expanded}")

# Find roots of the polynomial
roots = sp.solve(poly_expanded, X)

# Compute the product of roots
product_of_roots = sp.prod(roots)

# Output roots and their product
for i, root in enumerate(roots, start=1):
    print(f"Root {i}: {root.evalf()}")
print(f"Product of roots: {product_of_roots.evalf()}")
```
