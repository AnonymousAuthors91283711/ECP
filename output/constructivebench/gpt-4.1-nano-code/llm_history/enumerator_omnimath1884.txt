This problem involves finding the least natural number \( n \) such that the product of factorials from 1 to \( n-1 \) is greater than \( (n!)^2 \). The statement is about minimal \( n \) satisfying:

\[
\prod_{i=1}^{n-1} i! > (n!)^2
\]

To approach this with a Python program, we'll:

- Iterate over a range of \( n \) values starting from 2 (since for \( n = 1 \), the product is empty).
- For each \( n \), compute the product of factorials from 1 to \( n-1 \).
- Compare this product with \( (n!)^2 \).
- Print each candidate answer immediately as it's found.
- Continue until the inequality holds, then output the minimal such \( n \).

Since factorials grow rapidly, we'll limit our search to a reasonable small range, say up to 50, to capture the behavior.

```python
import math

# We search for minimal n where prod_{i=1}^{n-1} i! > (n!)^2
for n in range(2, 51):
    # Compute product of factorials from 1 to n-1
    prod_factorials = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        prod_factorials *= math.factorial(i)
    # Compute (n!)^2
    n_factorial_sq = math.factorial(n) ** 2
    # Check the inequality
    if prod_factorials > n_factorial_sq:
        print(f"n={n}: product of factorials = {prod_factorials}, (n!)^2 = {n_factorial_sq}")
        # Since we want the least such n, break once condition is met
        break
```
