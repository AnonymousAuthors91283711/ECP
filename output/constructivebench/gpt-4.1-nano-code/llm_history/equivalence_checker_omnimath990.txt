theorem omnimath990 (a : ℝ) (ha : 1 < a) :
  HasSum (fun i : ℕ => (a * i) / (a^i)) (omnimath990_answer a) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun a => (a / (1 - a))^2
Proposed Answer: fun a : ℝ => a / (a - 1)
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem is about finding the sum of the series Σ (a*n)/aⁿ from n=1 to ∞ for a > 1.

Ground truth gives (a/(1-a))²
Proposed answer gives a/(a-1)

Let's compute the correct sum:

The series can be written as a * Σ n*(1/a)ⁿ

We know that Σ n*xⁿ = x/(1-x)² for |x| < 1

Here x = 1/a, and since a > 1, |x| < 1

So the sum becomes:
a * [(1/a)/(1 - 1/a)²] = a * [1/a / ((a-1)/a)²] = a * [1/a * a²/(a-1)²] = a²/(a-1)²

This matches the ground truth since:
(a/(1-a))² = a²/(1-a)² = a²/(a-1)² (since (1-a)² = (a-1)²)

The proposed answer a/(a-1) is different from a²/(a-1)², except when a = a/(a-1), which only happens at a=0 or a=2. For all other a>1, they're different.
