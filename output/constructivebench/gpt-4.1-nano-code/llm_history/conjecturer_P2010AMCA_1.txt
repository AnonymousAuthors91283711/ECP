theorem P2010AMCA_1 :
  (20 - (2010 - 201) + (2010 - (201 - 20) : ℝ) = P2010AMCA_1_answer) :=
sorry
. Enumerated answers: Part 1: 20 - (2010 - 201) = -1789
Part 2: 2010 - (201 - 20) = 1829
Total: 40. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The expression combines the two parts: (20 - (2010 - 201)) and (2010 - (201 - 20)), and their sum. Using the pattern observed, the total simplifies to the sum of Part 1 and Part 2, which is (-1789) + 1829 = 40. The answer is the sum of these parts.

<<<(20 - (2010 - 201)) + (2010 - (201 - 20))>>>
