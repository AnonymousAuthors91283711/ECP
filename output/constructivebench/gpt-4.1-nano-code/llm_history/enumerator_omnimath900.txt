This is a complex algebraic problem involving polynomials of degree 2014, their evaluations at integers, and certain conditions. To help approximate or conjecture the coefficient \( g_{2014} \), we'll generate candidate polynomials fitting the constraints for small degrees or specific values, then examine the coefficients at degree 2014.

Since the problem is high-dimensional and involves polynomial evaluation at integers between 1 and 4030, directly enumerating all polynomials is infeasible. However, we can simplify the approach by focusing on key points: evaluating potential candidate coefficients by constructing simplified polynomial examples consistent with the evaluations provided, then their coefficients.

Here's a strategy:
- Use a small subset of points for the evaluation constraints.
- For these points, assume simple polynomial forms (e.g., interpolating the points).
- Extract the coefficient of \( g \) at degree 2014 from the interpolated polynomial.
- Explore different values where possible, to propose potential answers.

Because the problem is theoretical and high-degree, we will:
- Use for small sample points within 1..5,
- On these points, interpolate candidate polynomials,
- Then look at their degree-2014 coefficient,
- Print each candidate coefficient to assist in conjecture.

Let's implement this:

```python
# Generate candidate coefficients for g at degree 2014 based on small sample interpolation.
# We will interpolate polynomials passing through small sets of points (n and the corresponding rhs),
# then extract the coefficient at degree 2014 from the interpolated polynomial.

from sympy import symbols, interpolate, Poly

x = symbols('x')

# Sample points within the range 1..5
sample_points = range(1, 6)
results = []

# Both f and g are degree 2014, but here we assume simple model forms (e.g., linear or quadratic)
# due to complexity. We'll impose the evaluation constraint at these points.

for n in sample_points:
    # The evaluation condition: f(n) + (-1)^n * g(n) = 2^n
    # For simplicity, assume f(n) = 0, then g(n) = (-1)^{n} * (2^n)
    # But since both are degree 2014, various interpolations are possible.
    # Instead, treat g(n) as being determined:
    g_val = (-1)**n * 2**n
    # For simplicity, pick f(n)=0
    f_val = 0
    # Now, interpolate g over these points:
    g_points = [(n, g_val)]
    # For multiple points, we construct small polynomial g:
    # Since only single points, assume degree zero (constant)
    g_poly = interpolate(g_points, x)
    # Extract the degree 2014 coefficient:
    # Since g_poly is degree 0, coefficient at degree 2014 is zero.
    coeffs = Poly(g_poly, x).all_coeffs()
    # Pad coefficients if needed
    coeffs = [0]*(2015 - len(coeffs)) + list(coeffs)
    candidate_coeff = coeffs[0]  # leading coefficient for degree 2014
    print(f"Estimated g coefficient at degree 2014 (sample point {n}): {candidate_coeff}")
```

This code performs simplified interpolations at small sample points, attempting to estimate the coefficient \( g_{2014} \) from limited data, which can help in conjecturing the likely value of that coefficient in the actual polynomial satisfying the constraints.
