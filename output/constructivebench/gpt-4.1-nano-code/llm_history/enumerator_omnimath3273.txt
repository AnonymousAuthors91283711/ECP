[write_program]
The problem involves verifying a logical equivalence about a function \(f\colon \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) with a domain condition \(x > 1 \implies f(x) > 1\), and a specified inequality involving powers of \(x, y\). The goal is to find a suitable form for \(f\), potentially characterized by some parameter \(c > 0\), such that the equivalence holds.

To explore this, we will:
- Choose small sample values for parameters within the domain \(x > 1\).
- Generate candidate functions consistent with the inequalities.
- Search for candidate constants \(c\) that make \(f\) fit the inequalities.
- For demonstration, we'll test simple base functions like \(f(x) = c x^k\) where \(k\) can be 1, 2, or 3, to match the powers.

The program:
- Enumerates a small range of \(c\) values.
- Checks whether for all pairs in a sampled domain, the inequalities hold.
- Immediately outputs candidate functions matching criteria.
- Constraints for efficient search within tokens.

```python
import math

# Sample small values for c, powers, and domain points
candidate_cs = [0.1 * i for i in range(1, 11)]  # c from 0.1 to 1.0
x_values = [1.2 + 0.1 * i for i in range(10)]  # x in (1.2, 2.1)
y_values = [1.3 + 0.1 * i for i in range(10)]  # y in (1.3, 2.2)

# Enumerate candidate functions of the form f(x) = c * x^k
powers = [2, 3]
for c in candidate_cs:
    for k in powers:
        def f(x, c=c, k=k):
            return c * x**k

        # Check the inequalities for all sample pairs
        valid = True
        for x in x_values:
            if x <= 1:
                continue
            fx = f(x)
            if fx <= 1:
                valid = False
                break
            for y in y_values:
                if y <= 1:
                    continue
                fx_y = f(y)
                # Check the main inequality conditions
                if not (x**2 <= y and y <= x**3):
                    continue
                # Verify the inequalities: (f x)^2 ≤ f y ≤ (f x)^3
                if not ((fx**2) <= fx_y and fx_y <= (fx)**3):
                    valid = False
                    break
            if not valid:
                break
        if valid:
            print(f"Candidate function: f(x) = {c} * x^{k}")
```
