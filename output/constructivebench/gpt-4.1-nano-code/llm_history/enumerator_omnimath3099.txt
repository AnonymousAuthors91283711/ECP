This problem involves calculating a probability based on a list of faces of a die, with particular interest in odd faces (3, 5, 7). The key idea is to enumerate all possible outcomes or configurations that contribute to the probability, then sum their contributions.

We'll:
- Compute the total sum of faces.
- For each odd face, compute two parts:
  - The first part: `(n - 1) * (1 / totalDots)` for each odd face `n`.
  - The second part: `1 / (6 * totalDots)` for each odd face `n`.
- Sum these contributions to find the probability.

Since the list is small and the options are limited, we can explicitly enumerate all contributions, and then compare sums for exactness.

```python
# Enumerate faces and their total
faces = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
totalDots = sum(faces)
oddFaces = [3, 5, 7]

# Calculate the contributions for each odd face
contribs1 = [(n - 1) / totalDots for n in oddFaces]
contribs2 = [1 / (6 * totalDots) for _ in oddFaces]

# Sum the contributions
prob = sum(contribs1) + sum(contribs2)

# Output each contribution and the final probability
for n, c in zip(oddFaces, contribs1):
    print(f'Contribution for face {n} part 1: {c}')

for n in oddFaces:
    print(f'Contribution for face {n} part 2: {1 / (6 * totalDots)}')

print(f'Total probability: {prob}')
```
