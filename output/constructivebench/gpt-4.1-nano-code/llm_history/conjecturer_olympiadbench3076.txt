theorem olympiadbench3076 : 
  coeff ((X + X^2 + X^4 + X^8 + X^16 + X^32).comp (X + X^2 + X^4 + X^8 + X^16 + X^32)) 10 = olympiadbench3076_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Pair found: (2, 8)
Pair found: (8, 2)
The coefficient of X^10 in f(f(X)) is: 2. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the pattern in enumerated pairs and that the coefficient of X^10 is 2, the answer matches the coefficient of the resulting polynomial expansion. The coefficient is obtained from the convolution of coefficients in the composition, ultimately yielding 2. 
Therefore, the closed form answer for the coefficient is 2.
