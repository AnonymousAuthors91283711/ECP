theorem P2015AIMEI_1 : 
  let A := ∑ k in Finset.range 20, (2 * k + 1) * (2 * k + 2) + 39
  let B := 1 + ∑ k in Finset.range 19, (2 * k + 2) * (2 * k + 3) + 38 * 39
  Int.natAbs (A - B) = P2015AIMEI_1_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 26579. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The difference involves the sums over quadratic expressions with linear terms, which telescope when expanded. The pattern suggests a constant value, matching the enumerated answer 26579, independent of the upper bound.
