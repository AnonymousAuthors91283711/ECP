The problem seeks the maximum value of s where the linear combination of a,b,c,d,e with the given coefficients equals 15^3 (i.e., 3375), and their sum is s.  
Given the coefficients, the maximum sum s is attained when the variables are maximized under the constraint. The pattern suggests maximizing larger coefficients first (a, b).  
Calculating the maximum sum: (a=13, b=0, c=0, d=0, e=0) gives 13 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 13, i.e., summing variables proportional to their coefficients yields the highest sum at the limits.  
Thus, the maximum sum is when a=13, with remaining zero, which totals to 13.  

The answer is: <<<13>>>
