The problem is to find the value of `omnimath3187_answer` such that `3 * omnimath3187_answer - 5 = 16`. This simplifies to `3 * x = 21`, so `x = 7`. 

We can write a straightforward Python script to enumerate possible candidates and check the equation, printing the correct value immediately and affirming the solution.

```python
# We are finding x such that 3 * x - 5 = 16
# Solve for x: 3 * x = 21 => x = 7
# Enumerate candidates: 0 to some limit, e.g., 20, and check each

limit = 20
for candidate in range(limit + 1):
    if 3 * candidate - 5 == 16:
        print(candidate)
        # Since this simple linear equation has a unique solution, we break once found
        break
```
