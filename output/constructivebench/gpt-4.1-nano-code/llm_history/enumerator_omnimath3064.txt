The problem defines a sequence starting with term1 = 3 and each subsequent term as next of the previous, where next(m) = m + step(m) + 1 with step(m) = if m even then m/2 else m + 1. We need to compute term5 and find its value to fill in the answer.

To do this, we'll enumerate small values step-by-step:

- term1 = 3
- term2 = next(3) = 3 + (3+1) + 1 = 3 + 4 + 1 = 8
- term3 = next(8) = 8 + (8/2) + 1 = 8 + 4 + 1 = 13
- term4 = next(13) = 13 + (13+1) + 1 = 13 + 14 + 1 = 28
- term5 = next(28) = 28 + (28/2) + 1 = 28 + 14 + 1 = 43

The value of term5 is 43.

```python
# Enumeration based on the sequence described
# Using small sample calculations to find term5

# Step function
def step(m):
    if m % 2 == 0:
        return m // 2
    else:
        return m + 1

# Next function
def next_m(m):
    return m + step(m) + 1

# Terms computation
term1 = 3
term2 = next_m(term1)
term3 = next_m(term2)
term4 = next_m(term3)
term5 = next_m(term4)

print(term5)  # Expected to output 43
```
