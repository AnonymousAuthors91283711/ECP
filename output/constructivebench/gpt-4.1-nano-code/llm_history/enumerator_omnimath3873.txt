This problem asks to find all natural numbers n > 0 such that (n^3 + 3) is divisible by (n^2 + 7). We need to enumerate possible answers to help conjecture the set of such n. We will examineÂ∞èn up to some small limit, check divisibility, and output any solutions we find.

```python
# Enumerate small natural numbers n from 1 to 50
# Check whether (n^3 + 3) is divisible by (n^2 + 7)
# Print each n that satisfies the divisibility condition
for n in range(1, 51):
    numerator = n**3 + 3
    denominator = n**2 + 7
    if numerator % denominator == 0:
        print(n)
```
