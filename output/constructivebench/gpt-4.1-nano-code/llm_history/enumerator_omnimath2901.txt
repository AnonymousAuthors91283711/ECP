The problem states: Given \(x\) and \(y\) are real numbers with the condition \(\frac{x + y}{2} = 7\), and \(x = 5\). We need to find \(y\). The goal is to enumerate possible answers to support reasoning.

Since the problem is straightforward algebra: \( \frac{5 + y}{2} = 7 \Rightarrow 5 + y = 14 \Rightarrow y = 9 \).

However, to follow your instructions, we'll write a Python program that explicitly enumerates candidate \(y\) values around the valid solution, prioritizing the exact answer.

```python
# Enumerate possible y values around the expected solution y=9
# Since the problem is simple, check y in a small range, e.g., 0 to 20
for y in range(0, 21):
    # Check if (x + y)/2 = 7 with x=5
    # We haven't fixed y yet, so test for the condition
    # Given x=5, the condition reduces to:
    # (5 + y) / 2 == 7 --> 5 + y == 14 --> y == 9
    if (5 + y) / 2 == 7:
        print(f"y = {y}")
```
