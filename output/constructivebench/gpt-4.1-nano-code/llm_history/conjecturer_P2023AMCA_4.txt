Given the prime factorization and decimal digit counting, the number of digits of \(8^5 \times 5^{10} \times 15^2\) reduces to counting powers of 10 and remaining factors. Since \(8^5 = 2^{15}\), and \(15^2 = 3^2 \times 5^2\), total factors are \(2^{15}\), \(3^2\), and \(5^{10+2} = 5^{12}\). The number of decimal digits is \(\lfloor \log_{10} (n) \rfloor + 1\), related to the powers of 2, 3, 5, and their composition into base 10. The total digits should be 14.
