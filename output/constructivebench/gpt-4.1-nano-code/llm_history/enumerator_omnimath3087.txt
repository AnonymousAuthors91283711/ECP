The problem appears to involve evaluating a function at a specific value, which simplifies algebraically. The function is f(x) = 4 * x / (x + 2 * x) = 4x / 3x (since x + 2x = 3x), which simplifies further to 4/3 (for x ≠ 0). When x = 2021, the value should be 4/3. The program aims to verify this by enumerating numeric options and the simplified value.

Since the calculation simplifies to 4/3, we can check this exact value and print it, along with the input parameter 2021, to approximate or verify the result.

```python
# The function simplifies to 4/3 for any x ≠ 0.
# At x = 2021, it should be 4/3.
# We will enumerate possible interpretations and verify the value.

def evaluate(x):
    if x == 0:
        return float('nan')  # division by zero, but x=2021 ≠ 0
    return 4 * x / (x + 2 * x)

params = [2021]

# Since the simplified form is 4/3, print the exact value.
print("Parameter:", params[0])          # Display input parameter
expected_value = 4/3
print("Computed value:", evaluate(params[0]))
print("Simplified exact value: 4/3 (approx:", expected_value, ")")
```
