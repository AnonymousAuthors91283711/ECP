theorem P2002AIMEII_7 : 
  IsLeast {k : ℕ | 0 < k ∧ (∑ i in Finset.range (k + 1), i^2) % 200 = 0} P2002AIMEII_7_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 112. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The sum of squares from 0 to k is (k(k+1)(2k+1))/6, and we want this modulo 200 to be 0, and k>0. Based on enumeration and pattern, the minimal positive k satisfying the divisibility condition appears at k=112.
