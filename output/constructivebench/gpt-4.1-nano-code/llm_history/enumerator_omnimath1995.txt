The problem seems to involve enumerating certain configurations of a finite set (likely coin states), with constraints on updates and negations. To help in conjecturing and proving the solution, we will:
- Enumerate possible configurations
- Use small sample parameters (set size = 10)
- Generate all configurations fitting the described conditions
- Count and output the total number of such configurations

Here's an efficient approach:
- Consider the initial state where all positions are True.
- For pairs of distinct coins (c1, c2), update their states: c1 to False, and c2 to negation of c1's original value (which was True, so False) or other logical considerations based on the problem.
- Count the total number of such configurations.

Since the initial state is all True, and the only updates involve setting two positions to False and its negation, the main configurations are determined by the choice of c1 and c2, with constraints.

```python
# Enumerate configurations according to problem constraints
def enumerate_configs():
    n = 10  # size of the set
    results = set()
    indices = range(n)
    # initial configuration: all True
    initial = [True] * n
    for c1 in indices:
        for c2 in indices:
            if c1 != c2:
                config = initial.copy()
                # update c1 to False
                config[c1] = False
                # update c2 to negation of initial[c1](which was True), so False
                config[c2] = not initial[c1]
                # Store configuration as tuple for uniqueness
                results.add(tuple(config))
    # Count total configurations
    print(f"Total configurations: {len(results)}")
    # Print all configurations
    for conf in results:
        print(conf)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    enumerate_configs()
```
