Ground Truth Answer: 8/9
Proposed Answer: (1 : ℚ)
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find a polynomial P with specific roots (1/4, 1/2, 2, 4), leading coefficient condition, and evaluation conditions at x=1 and x=0.

2. The ground truth answer is 8/9 for P(0).

3. The proposed answer is 1.

4. Let's verify:
- The polynomial can be constructed as P(x) = a(x-1/4)(x-1/2)(x-2)(x-4)
- From P(1)=1, we can solve for a
- Then evaluate P(0) which should give 8/9, not 1

The proposed answer of 1 is incorrect compared to the ground truth answer of 8/9.

<<<False>>>
