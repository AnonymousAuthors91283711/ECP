The problem involves analyzing a set defined by a fractional expression and finding the least natural number n satisfying a condition involving the cardinality of such a set. To explore solutions, we'll examine small values of n to identify candidates, then check the set condition.

We focus on small n, compute the set of real x with the specified absolute value condition, and count its elements. We seek the least n for which this set has a certain cardinality, likely 2012 or more.

Since deriving this exactly can be complex, we'll generate and examine values for small n, printing n and the count of solutions:

```python
import math

def count_solutions(n, samples=10000):
    # Count the number of x in [0,1) satisfying the condition:
    # |2 * frac(x) - 1| = frac(n * x)
    count = 0
    step = 1 / samples
    for i in range(samples):
        x = i * step
        frac_x = x - math.floor(x)
        left = abs(2 * frac_x - 1)
        frac_nx = (n * x) - math.floor(n * x)
        # Allow a tiny tolerance due to floating point
        if abs(left - frac_nx) < 1e-8:
            count += 1
    return count

# Enumerate small n to find the minimal n with large set
threshold = 2012
n = 1
while n <= 20:
    length = count_solutions(n)
    print(f"n = {n}, solutions ≈ {length}")
    if length >= threshold:
        print(f"Found n = {n} with solutions ≥ {threshold}")
        break
    n += 1
```
