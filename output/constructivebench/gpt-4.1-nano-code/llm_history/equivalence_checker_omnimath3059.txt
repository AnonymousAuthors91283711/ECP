Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: 5 * (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9)
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer correctly factors out the common factor of 5 from the summation, and computes the sum of integers from 1 to 9 (which is 45) multiplied by 5. This is equivalent to the original summation expression ∑(5*i) for i from 1 to 9. Both expressions evaluate to 225.
