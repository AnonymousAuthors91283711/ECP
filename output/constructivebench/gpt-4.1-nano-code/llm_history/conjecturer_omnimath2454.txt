4. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → Set ℕ
Because the pattern shows (2^k + 2) % p ∈ {1, 4} depending on p and k, for k > 0 the residues stabilize to these two values, with the particular value depending on p. The data indicates that when p ≡ 3 mod 4, (2^k + 2) % p = 1; otherwise, it is 4. For all primes tested, (2^k + 2) mod p is either 1 or 4. Hence, the set of possible values is exactly {1, 4}.
