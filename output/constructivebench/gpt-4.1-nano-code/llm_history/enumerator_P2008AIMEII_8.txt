The problem appears to involve identifying all natural numbers \( n \) for which \( 0 < n \) and \( \sin(n(n+1)(\pi/2008)) \) is an integer. Since \(\sin\) takes values only in \([-1, 1]\), the only integers in this range are \(-1, 0, 1\). 

To find solutions, we need \(\sin(n(n+1)(\pi/2008))\) in \{-1, 0, 1\}.  
- \(\sin(\theta) = 0\) when \(\theta = m\pi\), \(m \in \mathbb{Z}\).  
- \(\sin(\theta) = \pm 1\) when \(\theta = \pi/2 + m\pi\).

Thus, the key is to find \( n \) such that 

1. \( n(n+1)(\pi/2008) = m\pi \) for some \( m \in \mathbb{Z} \); i.e.,

\[
n(n+1) = 2008 m
\]

2. \( n(n+1)(\pi/2008) = \pi/2 + m\pi \), or 

\[
n(n+1) = 2008 \left(m + \frac{1}{2}\right)
\]

for some \( m \in \mathbb{Z} \).

Therefore, the problem reduces to:

- Find all positive integers \( n \) such that \( n(n+1) \) is divisible by 2008 (for the sine being 0).
- Find all positive integers \( n \) such that \( n(n+1) = 2008 \left(m + \frac{1}{2}\right) \), i.e., \( n(n+1) \) equals half-integers multiplied by 2008.

Since 2008 factors as \( 2008 = 2^3 \times 251 \), even for small \( n \), \( n(n+1) \) is small, so we can enumerate \( n \) up to a reasonable limit (say, 1000), check the conditions, and print the valid ones.

```python
# Enumerate n from 1 to 1000
# Check for sine being 0: n(n+1) divisible by 2008
# Check for sine being 1 or -1:
#   n(n+1) = 2008 * (m + 0.5) => (n(n+1))/2008 = m + 0.5
#   so (n(n+1)) / 2008 - floor(...) = 0.5

limit = 1000
divisor = 2008

for n in range(1, limit + 1):
    val = n * (n + 1)
    # Check for sine = 0
    if val % divisor == 0:
        print(f"n={n} yields sin( n(n+1)(π/2008) )=0; since {val} divisible by {divisor}")
    # Check for sine = ±1
    ratio = val / divisor
    if abs(ratio - round(ratio)) > 1e-9:
        # Not an integer, check for half-integer
        if abs(ratio - (int(ratio) + 0.5)) < 1e-9:
            m = int(ratio - 0.5)
            ans = (-1) ** (n*(n+1)/2)  # Sign alternates for ±1
            print(f"n={n} yields sin=±1; condition {val}/{divisor} ≈ {ratio:.3f} ≈ {int(ratio)+0.5}")
```
This code enumerates candidate \( n \) and reports findings, aiding in conjecturing all solutions.
