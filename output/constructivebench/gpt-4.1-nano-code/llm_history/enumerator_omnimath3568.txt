[write_program]
The problem appears to involve functional equations over the real numbers, and the goal is to find all functions `f : ℝ → ℝ` satisfying the given functional equation:
\[ \forall x, y \in \mathbb{R}, \; f(x (x + f y)) = (x + y) f x. \]
Since the code is in Lean and references Mathlib, but we're asked to produce a Python program for enumeration, I'll interpret this as an algebraic exploration task. To assist in conjecturing and proving the solutions, I will write a Python script that searches for candidate functions that could satisfy the equation.

The plan:
- Explore simple forms like constant functions, linear functions, and quadratic functions.
- For each, check if the functional equation holds over a range of sample points.
- Print solutions that satisfy the equation exactly or approximately, prioritizing exact solutions.

Since the actual solution set might be limited and the functions are from ℝ to ℝ, and for simplicity, we will test candidate functions at small sample points rather than exhaustive search.

Here's the Python program:

```python
# The code tests candidate functions (constant, linear) over sample points
# to find functions satisfying the functional equation:
# f(x*(x + f(y))) == (x + y)*f(x)

import math

# Candidate functions to test
def constant_f(c):
    return lambda x: c

def linear_f(a, b):
    return lambda x: a * x + b

# Test if a function satisfies the functional equation over sample points
def test_function(f, xs, ys):
    for x in xs:
        for y in ys:
            left = f(x * (x + f(y)))
            right = (x + y) * f(x)
            # Check exact equality or near, since we deal with float
            if not math.isclose(left, right, rel_tol=1e-9):
                return False
    return True

# Small sample points
sample_xs = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]
sample_ys = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]

# Enumerate constant functions c
for c in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
    f_const = constant_f(c)
    if test_function(f_const, sample_xs, sample_ys):
        print(f"Constant solution: f(x) = {c}")

# Enumerate linear functions of form a*x + b with small coefficients
for a in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
    for b in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
        f_lin = linear_f(a, b)
        if test_function(f_lin, sample_xs, sample_ys):
            print(f"Linear solution: f(x) = {a} * x + {b}")
```

This script tests simple candidate solutions. You can expand the search to include other forms if needed. The outputs help conjecture possible solutions.
