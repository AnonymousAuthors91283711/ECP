  ∀ (m n : ℕ), 0 < m → 0 < n → (1 / n^2 : Rat) - (3 / (2 * n^3)) = (1 / m^2) → (m, n) = omnimath4271_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found solution: m = 4, n = 2. Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ
The given equations link n and m as: \( \frac{1}{n^2} - \frac{3}{2 n^3} = \frac{1}{m^2} \). Simplify to find m in terms of n, revealing m = 4 when n = 2. Add the general condition resulting in m = 4, n = 2. 

<<<(4, 2)>>>
