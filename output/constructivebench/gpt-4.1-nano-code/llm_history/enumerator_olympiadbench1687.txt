[write_program]
This problem appears to define an unknown function `olympiadbench1687_answer` that for each `n` yields a pair of natural numbers `(ℕ × ℕ)`, and relates two functions `f` and `g` via a complicated recurrence involving iteration. The theorem states an equivalence involving these functions and the particular answer function.

The task is to write a Python program that explores possible values of `olympiadbench1687_answer` for small `n`, assuming the problem involves integer functions, and aims to identify a pattern or candidate solutions, which can help in conjecturing or solving the theorem.

Given that the problem looks like an Olympiad problem typical for small `n`, and the theorem suggests that for all `n`, the pair `(f n, g n)` equals `olympiadbench1687_answer n`, a strategic approach is to:

- Sample small values of `n` (e.g., 0 to 10).
- For each `n`, try small candidate pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the recurrence formula.
- Use the recurrence to verify candidate pairs.
- Print each candidate as soon as it satisfies the recurrence for the sample `n`.

Since the exact form of `olympiadbench1687_answer` is unknown, we can attempt to find candidate `(f(n), g(n))` pairs that satisfy the recurrence with small `f, g` values.
