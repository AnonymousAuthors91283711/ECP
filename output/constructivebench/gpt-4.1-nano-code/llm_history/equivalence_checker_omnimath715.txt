Ground Truth Answer: 8
Proposed Answer: 2
Let's analyze this problem carefully:

1. The problem asks for the sum of squares of all distinct real roots of the polynomial p(x) = x⁸ - 14x⁴ - 8x³ - x² + 1.

2. The ground truth answer is 8, which suggests there are multiple roots whose squares sum to 8.

3. The proposed answer is 2, which would only account for a portion of the roots' squares.

4. To verify, we can consider that the polynomial likely has:
   - Some roots whose squares sum to 2
   - Additional roots whose squares sum to 6 (to reach the total of 8)
   - Or perhaps the proposed answer missed some roots entirely

The proposed answer of 2 is clearly less than the ground truth of 8, indicating it's either incomplete or incorrect.
