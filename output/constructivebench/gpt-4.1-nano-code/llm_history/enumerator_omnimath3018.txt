The problem defines a specific set `S = {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 20}` and asks to find a subset `T` of size 3 such that the product of its elements is 80, and also to output the sum of these elements. To assist in conjecturing the sum, I will enumerate all 3-element subsets of `S` with their products and sums, print those that meet the product condition (80), and record their sums.

The key points:
- Generate all combinations of size 3 from `S`.
- For each, check if the product is 80.
- If it is, print the subset, the product, and the sum.

This approach is efficient and straightforward.

```python
from itertools import combinations

# S is given
S = {1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 20}

# Convert to list for combinations
elements = list(S)

# Enumerate all 3-element subsets
for T in combinations(elements, 3):
    product = 1
    for t in T:
        product *= t
    if product == 80:
        subset = T
        sum_T = sum(T)
        print(f"Subset: {subset}, Product: {product}, Sum: {sum_T}")
```
