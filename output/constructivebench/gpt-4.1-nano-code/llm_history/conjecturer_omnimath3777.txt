The problem asks for the greatest such \( n \) satisfying the properties involving primes \( p, q \) and the variable \( k \) such that for all \( m < n \), \( k + m + 1 > 25 \) and \( k + m + 1 \) is a sum of two distinct primes.

Since \( k + m + 1 > 25 \) for all \( m < n \), the minimal \( k + m + 1 \) over \( m \) is \( k + 1 \), which must be greater than 25 for \( m \ge 0 \). The maximum \( n \) occurs at the point where adding any larger \( m \) would violate the prime sum structure.

Given the enumeration answer 5, it is reasoning the maximum \( n \) possible with the properties.

Propose: the maximum \( n \) satisfying conditions is 5, as the enumeration indicates the greatest \( n \).

Final answer:

<<<5>>>
