This problem involves solving a system of equations with two real variables \( p \) and \( q \):

1. \( p + q + \frac{1}{6} = 1 \)
2. \( p^2 + q^2 + \frac{1}{36} = \frac{1}{2} \)
3. Additionally, \( q \leq p \)

We want to find the value of \( p \).

Since the equations are symmetric in \( p \) and \( q \), and only \( q \leq p \), we can solve for \( p \) and \( q \) systematically:

- From (1): \( p + q = 1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6} \)
- Substitute \( q = \frac{5}{6} - p \) into (2):

\[
p^2 + \left(\frac{5}{6} - p\right)^2 + \frac{1}{36} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
p^2 + \left(\frac{25}{36} - \frac{10}{6}p + p^2\right) + \frac{1}{36} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

and further:

\[
p^2 + p^2 - \frac{10}{6} p + \frac{25}{36} + \frac{1}{36} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
2 p^2 - \frac{10}{6} p + \frac{26}{36} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Simplify fractions:

\[
2 p^2 - \frac{5}{3} p + \frac{13}{18} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Bring RHS to LHS:

\[
2 p^2 - \frac{5}{3} p + \frac{13}{18} - \frac{1}{2} = 0
\]

Express \( \frac{1}{2} = \frac{9}{18} \):

\[
2 p^2 - \frac{5}{3} p + \frac{13}{18} - \frac{9}{18} = 0
\]
\[
2 p^2 - \frac{5}{3} p + \frac{4}{18} = 0
\]

Simplify \( \frac{4}{18} = \frac{2}{9} \):

\[
2 p^2 - \frac{5}{3} p + \frac{2}{9} = 0
\]

Multiply entire equation by 9 to clear denominators:

\[
18 p^2 - 15 p + 2 = 0
\]

Quadratic formula:

\[
p = \frac{15 \pm \sqrt{(-15)^2 - 4 \times 18 \times 2}}{2 \times 18} = \frac{15 \pm \sqrt{225 - 144}}{36} = \frac{15 \pm \sqrt{81}}{36}
\]

\[
p = \frac{15 \pm 9}{36}
\]

Two solutions:

- \( p = \frac{15 + 9}{36} = \frac{24}{36} = \frac{2}{3} \)
- \( p = \frac{15 - 9}{36} = \frac{6}{36} = \frac{1}{6} \)

Corresponding \( q = \frac{5}{6} - p \):

- If \( p = \frac{2}{3} \):

\[
q = \frac{5}{6} - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{5}{6} - \frac{4}{6} = \frac{1}{6}
\]

Check \( q \leq p \): \( \frac{1}{6} \leq \frac{2}{3} \) â€” yes.

- If \( p = \frac{1}{6} \):

\[
q = \frac{5}{6} - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

Check \( q \leq p \): \( \frac{2}{3} \leq \frac{1}{6} \)? No.

Thus, only the first solution satisfies the \( q \leq p \) condition.

The answer for \( p \) is \( \boxed{\frac{2}{3}} \).

Now, write the code to verify and enumerate solutions systematically (though we already have exact solutions):

```python
# Program to verify solutions to the system and find p
import math

def find_solutions():
    # Known solutions from algebraic derivation:
    candidates = [
        (2/3, 1/6),
        (1/6, 2/3)
    ]
    for p, q in candidates:
        # Check q <= p
        if q <= p:
            print(f"Solution: p = {p}, q = {q}")
            yield p

# Enumerate solutions
for p in find_solutions():
    print(p)
```
