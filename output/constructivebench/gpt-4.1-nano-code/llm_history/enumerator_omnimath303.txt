The provided code snippet and theorem suggest investigating integer solutions to the linear equation \(a x + b y + c z = 0\) with bounds on the variables \(|x|, |y|, |z| \leq 2n\), excluding the trivial solution all zeros. We want to determine when such solutions exist, for given parameters.

To assist in conjecturing, we'll implement an enumeration that, for fixed \(a, b, c, n\), searches over all \(x, y, z\) with \(|x|, |y|, |z| \leq 2n\). For efficiency, we will:
- Fix small values for \(a, b, c, n\).
- Iterate through all candidate triples.
- Immediately print out solutions that satisfy the conditions.

Since the theorem involves establishment for all \(a, b, c\), we'll focus on a small sample set (say, all \(\left|a, b, c\right| \leq 2\)) to observe whether solutions are common or rare, which may yield insight into the behavior.

Here's the code:

```python
# Enumerates solutions to a*x + b*y + c*z = 0 for small parameters

def find_solutions(n, a, b, c):
    limit = 2 * n
    solutions_found = False
    for x in range(-limit, limit + 1):
        for y in range(-limit, limit + 1):
            for z in range(-limit, limit + 1):
                if (x, y, z) != (0, 0, 0):
                    if a * x + b * y + c * z == 0:
                        print(f'Solution: x={x}, y={y}, z={z}, a={a}, b={b}, c={c}')
                        solutions_found = True
    if not solutions_found:
        print(f'No solutions for a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, n={n}')

# Sample small parameter set:
n_sample = 3
params = [(a, b, c) for a in range(-2, 3) for b in range(-2, 3) for c in range(-2, 3)]

for a, b, c in params:
    print(f'Checking for a={a}, b={b}, c={c} with n={n_sample}')
    find_solutions(n_sample, a, b, c)
```

This enumerates solutions for various small coefficients and a fixed \(n\). The immediate output per valid solution aids in understanding which triples are solutions, helping to conjecture the nature of solutions and possibly prove (or disprove) the theorem.
