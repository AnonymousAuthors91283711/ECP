This problem involves solving a system of equations with integer constraints, related to the variables a, b, c, d, where d involves division and the other variables are natural numbers. 

Here's the systematic reasoning:
- From `b - 3 = 3 * c`, b = 3c + 3.
- From `a + 3 = b - 3`, substituting b yields a + 3 = (3c + 3) - 3 => a + 3 = 3c.
- Hence, a = 3c - 3.
- From `3 * c = d / 3`, we have d = 9c.

Given that all are natural numbers (ℕ), and ℕ includes zero, constraints are:
- a = 3c - 3 ≥ 0 => c ≥ 1
- b = 3c + 3 ≥ 0, always true for c ≥ 1.
- d = 9c ≥ 0, always true for c ≥ 0, but from above c ≥ 1.

Now, the sum condition:
a + b + c + d = 48
Substitute:
(3c - 3) + (3c + 3) + c + 9c = 48
Simplify:
3c - 3 + 3c + 3 + c + 9c = 48
Combine like terms:
(3c + 3c + c + 9c) + (-3 + 3) = 48
(16c) + 0 = 48
So,
16c = 48
c = 3

Now, back to find a, b, d:
a = 3*3 -3 = 6
b = 3*3 + 3 = 12
d = 9*3 = 27

All are non-negative integers, satisfying the conditions.

Here's the Python code that systematically enumerates all possible solutions within a small bound of c, then finds the unique solution:

```python
# Because c must satisfy 16c = 48, c = 3 is the only natural candidate.
# Let's generalize by enumerating c and verifying the equations.
for c in range(1, 20):  # small range to find solutions
    if 16 * c == 48:
        a = 3 * c - 3
        b = 3 * c + 3
        d = 9 * c
        # Verify all are non-negative
        if a >= 0 and b >= 0 and d >= 0:
            print(f"Solution: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}")
```

This code finds and outputs the unique solution matching the constraints.
