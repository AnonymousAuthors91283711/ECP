This appears to be a formal theorem statement involving integer arithmetic, specifically solving the equation \(5(n - 2) = 85\). To assist with conjecturing the answer, I will write a Python script that enumerates integer solutions to the equation, possibly over a small range, and explicitly prints candidates. This helps verify the solution and understand its nature. 

The main idea is to search for integers \( n \) such that \( 5(n - 2) = 85 \). Since the right side is known, and the problem is simple, the enumeration becomes straightforward. To follow your requirements, I will:
- Enumerate candidates in a reasonable range (say from -10 to 10),
- Check the equation for each candidate,
- Print the solutions immediately when they are found,
- Do not hardcode the answer,
- Prioritize exact solutions over approximations.

```python
# Enumerate integers around a small range to find solutions to 5*(n - 2) = 85
for n in range(-10, 11):
    if 5 * (n - 2) == 85:
        print(f"n = {n}")  # Early stream the exact solution
```
This script immediately outputs solutions as soon as found, helping to infer the true value for `n`.
[refine_program]
The given program only tests integers from -10 to 10 for solutions to the equation 5*(n - 2) = 85. Since the actual solution in integers can be found by solving the equation algebraically:

5*(n - 2) = 85  
=> n - 2 = 17  
=> n = 19

n=19 is outside the tested range, so the program produces no output, which matches the error message.

**Judgment:**

- The program's enumeration is limited to integers from -10 to 10, which does not include the actual solution n=19. Since the problem requires streaming actual solutions, and the current code does not find the solution, it should be rejected. Furthermore, the instructions specify that the enumeration should be comprehensive enough to find the answer and print it immediately.

**Acceptance:**

<<<False>>>

**Corrected Program:**

```python
# Enumerate integers in a small range that includes the solution n=19
for n in range(-20, 30):
    if 5 * (n - 2) == 85:
        print(f"n = {n}")  # Stream the exact solution when found
```
