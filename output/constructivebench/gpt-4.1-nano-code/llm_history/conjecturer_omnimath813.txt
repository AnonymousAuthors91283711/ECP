. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The polynomial \(X^{10} + X^{9} + X^{6} + X^{5} + X^{4} + X + 1\) divides \(X^{k} - 1\) only if \(k\) is a multiple of all exponents' orders dividing 1, 5, and 10, that is, the least common multiple of these orders. Since 1 divides everything and 10 is the largest exponent with minimal common divisor 2, the minimal such \(k\) is 2.
