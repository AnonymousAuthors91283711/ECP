Minimal value: 93.53074360871936. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Since the minimal value among given options is \(54 \times \sqrt{3}\), we identify it as the least element. Hence, the answer is that the least element of the set is exactly \(54 \times \sqrt{3}\).

Minimal value: 93.53074360871936. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The core issue is with the use of `sqrt` in Lean: `sqrt` expects a nonnegative real and is a function, but the notation `sqrt(3)` is not correct in Lean. Instead, Lean encourages the use of `Real.sqrt` applied to a real argument, written as `Real.sqrt 3`. 

Furthermore, the answer is a specific value among a set of known real numbers which are claimed to be the least in the set. The first number, `54 * sqrt 3`, is approximately 93.53, which is less than the other two values: 144 and approximately 111.81, confirming that this is the minimal element.

Thus, the correct expression for `omnimath1932_answer` is `54 * Real.sqrt 3`, and the answer should be the value `54 * Real.sqrt 3`.

I also note that the failed attempts include trying to define `omnimath1932_answer` as `noncomputable abbrev` with an expression with invalid syntax for `sqrt`.

Finally, in Environments involving real number operations, it is better to use `Real.sqrt`, rather than `sqrt`, to avoid ambiguity.
