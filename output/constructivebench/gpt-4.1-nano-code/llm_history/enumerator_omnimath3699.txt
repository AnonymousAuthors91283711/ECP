Let's analyze the problem step-by-step:

- We're looking for the least natural number \(A\) with certain properties:
  - \(A > 0\),
  - The number of digits of \(A\) in base 10 is odd,
  - There exists a number \(B\) such that:
    - \(B\) has the same number of digits as \(A\),
    - \(A\) differs from \(B\) in exactly one digit (by replacing a single digit \(d\) at position \(k\) in \(B\)),
    - Both \(A\) and \(B\) are divisible by 2018,
  - The length of the digits of \(A\) is exactly one more than the length of the digits of \(B\), i.e., the change involves a digit insertion.

Since the problem asks for the *least* such \(A\), and involves digit operations, we'll generate candidate numbers systematically from the smallest possible, focusing on numbers divisible by 2018 with odd digit lengths and the described digit relations.

Note:
- We will choose small samples for candidate \(A\), check for division by 2018, odd length, and the digit-replacement structure.
- To simplify, we'll generate \(A\) in ascending order, avoid hitting the time-consuming search of large numbers.

Now, the Python code:

```python
# Enumerate candidates for A with odd number of digits, divisible by 2018
# For each candidate, check existence of B with the described digit insertion and divisibility
# Prioritize the smallest A satisfying all conditions

def find_min_A():
    # We check digit lengths from 1 to 7 (covering small odd lengths)
    for length in range(1, 8, 2):
        start = 10**(length - 1)
        end = 10**length
        for A in range(start, end):
            if A % 2018 != 0:
                continue
            A_digits = list(map(int, str(A)))
            # For each position, try inserting a digit to form B
            for k in range(len(A_digits) + 1):
                for d in range(10):
                    B_digits = A_digits[:k] + [d] + A_digits[k:]
                    # B should have same number of digits as A
                    if len(B_digits) != len(A_digits):
                        continue
                    B = int(''.join(map(str, B_digits)))
                    if B == 0:
                        continue
                    if B % 2018 == 0:
                        # Check if A differs from B in exactly one digit
                        diff_count = sum(1 for x, y in zip(str(A), ''.join(map(str, B_digits))) if x != y)
                        if diff_count == 1:
                            print(f"Candidate A: {A}")
                            return A
# Run the enumeration
if __name__ == "__main__":
    answer = find_min_A()
    print(f"omnimath3699_answer = {answer}")
```

This code systematically searches small candidate values for \(A\) with odd digit length, divisibility by 2018, then checks for \(B\) with the digit insertion condition, ensuring exact differences and divisibility. It prints the first candidate found, which is the minimal such \(A\).
