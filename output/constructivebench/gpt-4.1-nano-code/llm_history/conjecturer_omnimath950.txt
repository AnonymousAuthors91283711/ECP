The problem involves counting injective functions with constraints that relate their images' first and second components, where the second components are within a bounded sequence. Given the enumeration indicates zero solutions, the count is 0 for n=100. 

This logic extends to all n, as the constraints impose impossible conditions beyond small n, leading to a conclusion that the set is empty.
