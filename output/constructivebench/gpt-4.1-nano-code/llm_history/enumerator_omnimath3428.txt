The problem appears to ask for defining a function that relates \( t \) to \( s \) via the equation \( 0.1 \times s = t \). To solve for \( s \), we need to find \( s = t / 0.1 \). Since the denominator is a fixed scalar, the exact solution should be straightforward. For the enumerator, we can verify various \( t \) values and corresponding \( s \) values, but since the main goal is to define the function, this is simply an explicit definition of the inverse.

To assist in understanding, we'll generate examples of \( t \) and the corresponding \( s \), and define the function as \( s = 10 \times t \).

```python
# Define a function that takes a real number t and returns s such that 0.1 * s = t
def omnimath3428_answer(t):
    # s = t / 0.1 = 10 * t
    s = 10 * t
    # Stream the answer immediately
    print(s)
    return s

# Test with sample values of t
for t in [0, 0.5, -1, 2.3, 100]:
    s_value = omnimath3428_answer(t)
    # Verify the relation
    assert abs(0.1 * s_value - t) < 1e-9, f"Failed at t={t}"
```
