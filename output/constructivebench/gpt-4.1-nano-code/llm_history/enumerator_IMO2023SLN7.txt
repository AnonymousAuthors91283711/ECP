The problem appears to be a functional equation involving positive integers \(a, b, c, d\):

\[
\frac{a b}{a + b} + \frac{c d}{c + d} = \frac{(a + b)(c + d)}{a + b + c + d}
\]

Our goal is to enumerate solutions or possible sums \(a + b + c + d\) that satisfy the equation, for small positive integers. Since the equation involves fractions, it's reasonable to restrict ourselves to small values, do a brute-force search within bounds, and output all solutions, focusing on possible sums.

```python
# Enumerate positive integers for a, b, c, d up to a small limit
# Check if the equation holds, and if it does, print the sum a+b+c+d
# Use a small max limit to keep the output within constraints
max_val = 20

for a in range(1, max_val + 1):
    for b in range(1, max_val + 1):
        for c in range(1, max_val + 1):
            for d in range(1, max_val + 1):
                numerator1 = a * b
                denominator1 = a + b
                numerator2 = c * d
                denominator2 = c + d
                numerator3 = (a + b) * (c + d)
                denominator3 = a + b + c + d

                # Compute both sides as floats for verification
                lhs = numerator1 / denominator1 + numerator2 / denominator2
                rhs = numerator3 / denominator3

                # Check for equality within a tolerance to handle floating point issues
                if abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-9:
                    s = a + b + c + d
                    print(f"Solution: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}, sum={s}")
```
