abbrev omnimath3746_answer : Prop := sorry
theorem omnimath3746 : 
  ¬ ∃ (f : ℕ[X]), degree f = 2 ∧ 
    (∀ (n : ℕ), ∃ (k : ℕ), eval n f = 2^k) ↔ omnimath3746_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Candidate polynomial: f(n) = 0*n^2 + 0*n + 1
Candidate polynomial: f(n) = 0*n^2 + 0*n + 2
Candidate polynomial: f(n) = 0*n^2 + 0*n + 4. Expected Answer Type: Prop
The pattern in enumerated answers suggests the polynomial can only produce values as powers of 2, but the constant polynomials like 1, 2, 4 do not satisfy the condition for all n. The problem implies no quadratic polynomial exists that maps every n to some power of 2 (since degree 2 polynomial cannot generate exclusively powers of 2 for all natural inputs). Therefore, the negation holds, that there is no such polynomial.
