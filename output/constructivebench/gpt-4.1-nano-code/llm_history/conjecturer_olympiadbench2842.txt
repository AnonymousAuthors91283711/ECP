The main issue is with syntax: in Lean, an anonymous function (lambda) must use `=>`, not `,` to separate parameter and body. The current answer `λ K : ℚ, 20` causes an unexpected token ',' error. Changing the syntax to `λ K : ℚ => 20` resolves this.

From the enumerated answers, it appears that for the given values of T and K, the required workers always equal 20. Since the theorem involves variables T, K, and their relationships, with K = T - 2, the answer is a constant 20 for all relevant K satisfying the given constraints.

Assuming the answer is a constant number 20 in ℚ (since the problem uses rational arithmetic), the fixed answer expression is:

>>> λ K : ℚ => 20

This form captures the constant nature indicated by the enumerated solutions and conforms to Lean syntax.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
