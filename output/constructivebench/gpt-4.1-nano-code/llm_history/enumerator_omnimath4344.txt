The problem appears to describe a pursuit scenario with a hunter and a rabbit moving along paths, with certain constraints on their movements, and it claims that under these constraints the hunter cannot get within 100 units of the rabbit after a large number of steps. To explore possible outcomes, we can simulate simple discrete scenarios with small steps and specific parameters, and verify if the hunter can approach the rabbit within a certain distance.

Our approach:
- We consider simple, fixed paths for the rabbit and the hunter.
- Both move in consistent steps with length 1 (as per the constraints).
- Check if the hunter can get close enough (within 100 units) after many steps.
- Since the problem is abstract, start with small parameters and specific initial positions.
- Generate candidate strategies and verify the distance after many steps.
- Output results immediately as found to help formulate a conjecture.

```python
import math

# Define small sample parameters
max_steps = 50  # Limit to scalable small simulation, since large steps (10^9) impossible here
initial_rabbit = (0.0, 0.0)
initial_hunter = (0.0, 0.0)

# Path functions
def rabbit_path(k):
    # Moves in a circle of radius 1 at each step, to see if hunter can catch
    angle = k * math.pi / 4  # 45 degrees per step
    return (math.cos(angle), math.sin(angle))

def hunter_strategy(tracking_device, k):
    # Hunter moves directly towards last known rabbit position
    target = tracking_device(k)
    hx, hy = hunter_positions[k]
    tx, ty = target
    dist = math.hypot(tx - hx, ty - hy)
    if dist == 0:
        return (hx, hy)
    # move 1 step towards target
    return (hx + (tx - hx) / dist, hy + (ty - hy) / dist)

# Simulate the pursuit
hunter_positions = [initial_hunter]
rabbit_positions = [initial_rabbit]

for k in range(max_steps):
    # rabbit moves
    r_pos = rabbit_path(k)
    rabbit_positions.append(r_pos)
    # hunter moves based on previous position
    tracking_device = lambda step: rabbit_positions[step]
    h_pos = hunter_strategy(tracking_device, k)
    hunter_positions.append(h_pos)
    # output current distance
    dist = math.dist(h_pos, r_pos)
    print(f"Step {k+1}: Hunter at {h_pos}, rabbit at {r_pos}, distance = {dist}")
    if dist <= 100:
        print("Hunter got close enough within 100 units!")
        break
else:
    print("Hunter did not get within 100 units in simulation.")
