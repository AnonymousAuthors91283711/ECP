. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
Given the pattern, the values of n where divisibility holds are such that n is a power of 2 minus 1 (i.e., n = 2^k - 1 for some k), corresponding to 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, etc. Since the maximum provided is 29, the set includes all n of the form 2^k - 1 with k ≥ 1 and n ≤ 29. Thus, the set is {n | ∃ k ≥ 1, n = 2^k - 1 ∧ n ≤ 29}. 

Answer: <<< { n | ∃ k : ℕ, k ≥ 1 ∧ n = 2^k - 1 ∧ n ≤ 29 } >>>
