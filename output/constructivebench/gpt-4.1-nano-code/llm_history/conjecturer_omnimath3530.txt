The inequality \( x^3 < x^2 \) can be analyzed by rewriting as \( x^3 - x^2 < 0 \), i.e., \( x^2(x - 1) < 0 \). The critical points are at \( x=0 \) and \( x=1 \).

- For \( x < 0 \), \( x^2 > 0 \) and \( x - 1 < 0 \), so the product is negative, satisfying the inequality.
- For \( 0 < x < 1 \), \( x^2 > 0 \) and \( x - 1 < 0 \), so the product is again negative, satisfying the inequality.
- At \( x=0 \), the inequality becomes equality, so not included.
- For \( x > 1 \), the product \( x^2(x - 1) > 0 \), so inequality does not hold.

Including the critical points, the set where the inequality \( x^3 < x^2 \) holds is all \( x \le 0 \) and \( 0 < x < 1 \).

Based on the enumerated solutions and the inequalities, the set simplifies to \( (-\infty, 1) \). It includes all \( x \) less than 1.

Final expression:
<<<set.Ici' (fun x => x ≤ 0) ∪ set.Ico 0 1>>>

This represents all real \( x \) less than zero plus all \( x \) in \( (0, 1) \), matching the analysis and the enumeration.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The main issue in your approach is the incorrect usage of `set.Ici'` and `set.Ico`. In Lean, the correct constructors for sets of real numbers are `set.Icc`, `set.Ico`, `set.Ioc`, and `set.Icc`, but these are not prefixed with `set.` unless you import `Set` notation properly. Since you used `import Mathlib`, you should replace the problematic notation with `set.Ico` and `set.Ico` without attempting to invoke `set.Ici'`. Also, taking the logical structure from the enumerated solutions, the set of x satisfying `x^3 < x^2` appears to be the union of all x less than or equal to 0, and those in the interval (0, 1), excluding 1 because at `x=1`, `1^3 = 1` and `1^2=1`, so `1^3 < 1^2` does not hold. 

The set is therefore:
- all `x ≤ 0`, and
- those `x` strictly greater than 0 but less than 1

Expressed in Lean set notation, this is:

`set.Icc (−∞) 0` unioned with `(0, 1)` which is `set.Ioo 0 1`. But `set.Icc` does not accept `−∞`, so the proper way is to take `set.Ici` (from negative infinity), but there isn't a built-in `set.Ici` for real numbers. The common way is to write `set.Iic 0` for `x ≤ 0`, and `set.Ioo 0 1` for `(0,1)`.

Hence, the final set:

```lean
{
  x | x ≤ 0
} ∪ {
  x | 0 < x ∧ x < 1
}
```

This is `set.Iic 0` union `set.Ioo 0 1`.

In Lean code, that is: `set.Iic 0 ∪ set.Ioo 0 1`

```lean
noncomputable abbrev omnimath3530_answer : Set ℝ := set.Iic 0 ∪ set.Ioo 0 1
```

This set matches all `x` with `x ≤ 0` or `0 < x < 1`, consistent with the enumerated solutions.

**Final answer:**

<<<set.Iic 0 ∪ set.Ioo 0 1>>>
