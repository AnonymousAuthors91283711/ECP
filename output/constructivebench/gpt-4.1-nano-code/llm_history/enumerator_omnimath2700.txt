[write_program]
The problem provides fixed relations: x = 3, y = 2 * x, z = 3 * y. From these, we can deduce z fully. To assist in conjecturing and verifying, let's compute the value step-by-step and list possibilities, even though the relations fix the values precisely.

Because all variables are fixed by the given equalities, we can simply compute z based on these relations. To explore alternative answers as a program, we'll generate values consistent with the relations and list them.

Below, I will enumerate candidate values for z based on small sample variations of x, y, z, respecting the relations, and output the exact value derived from the fixed relations. The enumeration can be extended to small perturbations if needed.

```python
# Enumerate fixed smaller sample values to confirm the relations
for x in [3]:
    y = 2 * x
    z = 3 * y
    print(f"x={x}, y={y}, z={z}")
    # Also display the computed z explicitly
    print(f"Computed z: {z}")

# Since the relations are fixed, the exact value is z=3* (2*x) = 6*x
# For x=3, z=18, so the answer is 18.
# To show alternative approaches, let's add a small range of x near 3 (though only one value is consistent)
for x in [2, 3, 4]:
    y = 2 * x
    z = 3 * y
    print(f"x={x}, y={y}, z={z}")
```
