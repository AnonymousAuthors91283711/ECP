This problem involves analyzing the given equations and deriving the value of \(k\). We are given:

- \( T = 650 \)
- \( \log T = \log 650 \)
- \( \log T = 2 - \log 2 + \log k \)

Rearranging the last equation:

\[
\log T = 2 - \log 2 + \log k
\]

which implies:

\[
\log k = \log T - 2 + \log 2
\]

By substituting \(\log T = \log 650\):

\[
\log k = \log 650 - 2 + \log 2
\]

Since \(\log a + \log b = \log(ab)\), we get:

\[
\log k = \log (650 \cdot 2) - 2 = \log (1300) - 2
\]

Recall that \(\log a - 2 = \log \left(\frac{a}{e^2}\right)\), because:

\[
\log a - 2 = \log a - \log e^2 = \log \left(\frac{a}{e^2}\right)
\]

Therefore:

\[
\log k = \log \left(\frac{1300}{e^2}\right)
\]

which gives:

\[
k = \frac{1300}{e^2}
\]

Python code to compute this precisely:

```python
import math

# Known values
T = 650
logT = math.log(T)
log2 = math.log(2)
log_e_squared = 2  # since e^2, log e^2 = 2

# Compute k
k = math.exp(logT - log_e_squared + log2)  # same as (650 * 2) / e^2

# Print the answer directly
print(k)
```
