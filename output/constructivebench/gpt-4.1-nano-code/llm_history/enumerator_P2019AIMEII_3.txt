This problem involves counting functions t: Fin 7 → ℕ with positive values that satisfy certain linear equations. To enumerate solutions, we'll assign small values to t(0) as parameters and iterate over possible values for the remaining t(i) (i=1..6). We'll particularly look for solutions satisfying all equations.

We'll fix a small value for t(0) (say, 1 to 3), and search for integer solutions that satisfy the constraints. Since the equations are linear and involve sums, we can implement a brute-force enumeration over feasible ranges for t(i).

The key observations:
- All t(i) > 0
- The equations relate sums of t(i), constraining possible values
- We will generate solutions and print them immediately

Here's the code:

```python
# We fix t(0) to small values and enumerate over possible t(1..6)
# Constraints:
# t0 + t1 = t2 + t3
# t0 + t2 = t4 + t5
# t0 + t4 = t6 + t1
# t0 + t6 = t3 + t5
#
# All t(i) > 0, with small t0 to keep search manageable.

max_t0 = 3
solutions_found = 0

for t0 in range(1, max_t0 + 1):
    # We choose ranges up to a small limit for t(i)
    limit = 10
    for t1 in range(1, limit+1):
        for t2 in range(1, limit+1):
            # from first equation: t3 = t2 + t3 - t2, solve for t3
            for t3 in range(1, limit+1):
                # equation 1: t0 + t1 = t2 + t3 => t3 = t0 + t1 - t2
                if t3 != t0 + t1 - t2:
                    continue
                # from second: t0 + t2 = t4 + t5
                for t4 in range(1, limit+1):
                    t5 = t0 + t2 - t4
                    if t5 < 1 or t5 > limit:
                        continue
                    # from third: t0 + t4 = t6 + t1 => t6 = t0 + t4 - t1
                    t6 = t0 + t4 - t1
                    if t6 < 1 or t6 > limit:
                        continue
                    # from fourth: t0 + t6 = t3 + t5
                    if t0 + t6 != t3 + t5:
                        continue
                    # All conditions satisfied
                    print((t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, t5, t6))
                    solutions_found += 1
print(f"Total solutions: {solutions_found}")
```
