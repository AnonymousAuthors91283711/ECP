. Enumerated answers: Answer (floor((3+√5)^34) mod 100): 3. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the pattern from enumerated answers; the modulus pattern suggests likely periodicity. The key is recognizing that (3+√5)^n plus (3−√5)^n is an integer sequence satisfying a recurrence, and modulo 100 the sequence repeats with a certain period. Given the hints and previous similar problems, the answer stabilizes to a constant pattern.

Thus, the answer, based on the pattern, is:

<<<3>>>
