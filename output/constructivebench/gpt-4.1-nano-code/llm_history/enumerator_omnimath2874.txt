This problem asks to evaluate the expression (8 + 4) / (8 - 4) and provide its exact value. Since we can directly compute the values, the answer is a straightforward rational number. The goal is to generate Python code that enumerates candidate answers to help verify or conjecture the exact result.

```python
# Enumerate candidate answers for (8 + 4) / (8 - 4)
# p and q are numerator and denominator candidates respectively
# Consider small integers first for exact fractions, then approximate if needed
for numerator in range(1, 20):
    for denominator in range(1, 20):
        if denominator != 0:
            value = numerator / denominator
            # Check if value matches the target: (8+4)/(8-4) = 12/4 = 3
            if abs(value - 3) < 1e-9:
                print(numerator, '/', denominator, '=', value)
```
