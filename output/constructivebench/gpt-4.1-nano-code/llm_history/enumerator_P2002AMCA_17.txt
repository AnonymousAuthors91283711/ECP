The problem seems to involve finding the least natural number `s` that is the sum of a finite set of primes, with the primes satisfying certain digit-related disjointness conditions—specifically, their digit sets must be pairwise disjoint, and their combined digits cover all digits from 1 to 9 exactly once.

Let's interpret the core constraints:
- A set `ps` of primes.
- Each prime's digits form a set (digits in base 10).
- These digit sets are pairwise disjoint.
- The union of all digit sets is {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}.
- The sum of these primes is `s`.
- The goal is to find the least such `s`.

To simulate an answer-generating program, we'll:
- Generate small primes, with particular attention to those with certain digits to cover all digits 1-9.
- Search for minimal sum `s` by combining disjoint prime digit sets.

Here's the code:

```python
import itertools

def generate_primes():
    # Basic small primes for digit sets
    return [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47]

def digit_set(n):
    # Returns a set of digits in n
    return set(int(d) for d in str(n))

def is_prime(n):
    # Simple primality check for small n
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5)+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

primes = [p for p in generate_primes() if is_prime(p)]
primes = sorted(set(primes))  # ensure uniqueness and sortedness

# Collect primes whose digits cover disjoint parts
results = []

# For small sets, try combinations that form a full digit-1..9 coverage
for r in range(1, 5):  # small subset sizes for efficiency
    for combo in itertools.combinations(primes, r):
        # Check disjoint digit sets
        digit_sets = [digit_set(p) for p in combo]
        if len(set.union(*digit_sets)) == 9 and set.union(*digit_sets) == set(range(1,10)):
            s = sum(combo)
            print(f"Candidate primes: {combo}, sum: {s}")
            results.append(s)

# Find minimum s
if results:
    min_s = min(results)
    print(f"Minimum sum satisfying conditions: {min_s}")
```

This code:
- Generates a list of small candidate primes.
- Checks combinations for disjoint digit coverage of {1,..,9}.
- Streams partial candidate solutions.
- Finds the minimal sum among them.

This approach provides candidate answers to help formulate or conjecture the *least* `s`.

The problem involves selecting primes whose digit sets are disjoint and together cover digits 1 through 9, then summing these primes and finding the minimal such sum. The existing code attempts combinations of small primes but ultimately produces no candidate solutions. This suggests the code is too restrictive—e.g., it considers only very small subset sizes or primes that don't fulfill the digit-disjoint covering criteria.

**Judgement:**  
The code appears logically correct for small testing, but because it outputs empty results and doesn't handle larger or more appropriate prime sets that cover all 1..9 digits efficiently, it doesn't explore the full solution space of the original problem. It also doesn't specifically select solutions that sum to the minimal possible total, only printing candidate sums found in small sets.

**Acceptance:**  
***Rejected***, because the code yields no output and misses the actual minimal sum covering 1..9 with disjoint digit primes.

**Correction plan:**  
- To address this, the corrected program should try all combinations of primes, including those with larger primes, until it finds the minimal sum that covers all digits 1..9 with disjoint digit sets.  
- To ensure efficiency, limit prime search to a small, manageable list (e.g., primes under 50).  
- For each subset size, check if the digit sets are disjoint and cover 1..9.  
- Keep track of minimal sum found, then print it explicitly at the end.

**Here is the corrected program:**

```python
import itertools

def generate_primes():
    # Small prime set covering digits 1..9 is enough
    return [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47]

def digit_set(n):
    return set(int(d) for d in str(n))

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5)+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

primes = [p for p in generate_primes() if is_prime(p)]

min_sum = None
# Try all combinations from size 1 up to length of primes
for r in range(1, len(primes)+1):
    for combo in itertools.combinations(primes, r):

This problem appears to be a formal proof statement in Lean involving prime numbers and digit disjointness, but the provided code is incomplete: it contains only `sorry` placeholders with no actual logic or enumeration of candidates. Without any actual enumeration, the code cannot produce answers nor verify minimality or any property; it only results in an error. Therefore, it should be rejected.

To fulfill the task, I will write a simple exhaustive enumeration of 3-element subsets of primes less than, say, 100, checking for disjoint digit sets that cover {1..9}, then outputting the sum `s`. The goal is to find the minimal such sum, but since the problem asks for partial enumeration, I will print all candidate sums during search, then output the minimal sum.

```python
# Enumerate prime numbers under 100
from itertools import combinations
from math import sqrt

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

primes = [p for p in range(2, 100) if is_prime(p)]
digits_set = set(range(1,10))
candidates = []

# Check all combinations of 3 distinct primes
for ps in combinations(primes, 3):
    # Check if the sets of digits are disjoint
    digit_sets = [set(int(d) for d in str(p)) for p in ps]
    union_digits = set().union(*digit_sets)
    # Verify if union of digits covers 1..9
    if union_digits == digits_set:
        # Sum of primes
        s = sum(ps)
        candidates.append(s)
        print(f"Found candidate sum: {s} for primes {ps}")

# Output the minimal sum
if candidates:
    min_sum = min(candidates)
    print(f"Minimal sum: {min_sum}")
else:
    print("No candidate found.")
```
