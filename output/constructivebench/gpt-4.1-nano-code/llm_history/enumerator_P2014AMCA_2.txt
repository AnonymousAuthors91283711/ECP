The problem involves solving for the adult and child ticket prices based on the given equations.  
Given:  
1. \( h_{child} = \frac{1}{2} h_{adult} \)  
2. \( 5h_{adult} + 4h_{child} = 24.50 \)

Substitute \( h_{child} \) into the second equation:  
\( 5h_{adult} + 4 \times \frac{h_{adult}}{2} = 24.50 \)  
Simplify:  
\( 5h_{adult} + 2h_{adult} = 24.50 \)  
\( 7h_{adult} = 24.50 \)  
So, \( h_{adult} = \frac{24.50}{7} \)

Then, \( h_{child} = \frac{h_{adult}}{2} = \frac{24.50}{14} \)

Finally, the required expression:  
\( 8h_{adult} + 6h_{child} \)

which simplifies to:  
\( 8 \times \frac{24.50}{7} + 6 \times \frac{24.50}{14} \)

Our program will compute these values precisely.

```python
# Enumerate and compute the prices based on the given equations
# and verify the value of 8 * adult_price + 6 * child_price.

# Given:
# child_price = adult_price / 2
# 5 * adult_price + 4 * child_price = 24.50

# Calculate adult_price
adult_price = 24.50 / 7
print("adult_price:", adult_price)

# Calculate child_price
child_price = adult_price / 2
print("child_price:", child_price)

# Calculate the target expression: 8 * adult_price + 6 * child_price
result = 8 * adult_price + 6 * child_price
print("Result for 8 * adult_price + 6 * child_price:", result)
```
