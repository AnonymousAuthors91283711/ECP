The problem involves a sequence \( S: \mathrm{Fin}\,10 \to \mathbb{N} \) with conditions that each \( S_i > 0 \) and each \( S_i \) depends on the gcd of neighboring elements. Specifically:
- \( S_i = 1 + \gcd(S_{i-1}, S_{i+1}) \) (indices modulo 10).
- Each \( S_i \) is positive.
- We need to find the sum \(\sum_{i=0}^9 S_i\) based on these constraints.

Our approach:
- Choose small sample values for initial \( S_i \).
- Use the recursive gcd relation to find consistent sequences.
- Enumerate all plausible configurations where \( S_i \in \{1, 2, 3, ...\} \) and check the constraints.

Here's the code that performs a systematic search for sequences satisfying the conditions, then sums and prints each valid sequence immediately:

```python
# Enumerate all possible small positive sequences satisfying the gcd relation
import itertools
from math import gcd

# We limit the search space to small values to ensure efficiency
max_value = 10

# Generate all possible sequences of length 10 with values from 1 to max_value
for S in itertools.product(range(1, max_value + 1), repeat=10):
    # Check the gcd condition for each i
    valid = True
    for i in range(10):
        prev = S[(i - 1) % 10]
        next_ = S[(i + 1) % 10]
        if S[i] != 1 + gcd(prev, next_):
            valid = False
            break
    if valid:
        total_sum = sum(S)
        print(f"S: {S} sum: {total_sum}")
```
