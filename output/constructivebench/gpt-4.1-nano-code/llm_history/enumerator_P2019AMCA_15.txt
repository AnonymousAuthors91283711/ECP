The problem involves positive real numbers \(a, b\), natural numbers \(m, n, k, l\), and their relations involving logarithms and square roots. Specifically, the theorem gives:

- \(\sqrt{\log a} = m\), with \(m \in \mathbb{N}^+\),
- \(\sqrt{\log b} = n\), with \(n \in \mathbb{N}^+\),
- \(\sqrt{\log a + \log b} = k\), with \(k \in \mathbb{N}^+\),
- \(\sqrt{\log a \times \log b} = l\), with \(l \in \mathbb{N}^+\).

From these, we derive:

\[
\log a = m^2, \quad \log b = n^2,
\]
\[
\log a + \log b = m^2 + n^2,
\]
\[
\sqrt{m^2 + n^2} = k,
\]
\[
\sqrt{m^2 n^2} = l.
\]

Since \(\sqrt{m^2 n^2} = m n\), we get:

\[
l = m n,
\]
and from \(\sqrt{m^2 + n^2} = k\), we get:

\[
k^2 = m^2 + n^2.
\]

The parameters \(m,n,k,l\) are positive integers with:

\[
k^2 = m^2 + n^2,
\]
\[
l = mn.
\]

Given these relations, \(a, b\) are:

\[
a = e^{m^2}, \quad b = e^{n^2}.
\]

The quantity to find is:

\[
a \times b = e^{m^2} \times e^{n^2} = e^{m^2 + n^2} = e^{k^2}.
\]

Thus, for each Pythagorean triple \((m, n, k)\):

\[
a b = e^{k^2}.
\]

Now, to find some possible values, we generate small Pythagorean triples with positive \(m,n,k\):

- (3,4,5): \(a b = e^{25}\),
- (5,12,13): \(a b = e^{169}\),
- (8,15,17): \(a b = e^{289}\),
- (7,24,25): \(a b = e^{625}\),
- (9,40,41): \(a b = e^{1681}\), etc.

Here's the code to generate such solutions and compute \(a b\):

```python
# Enumerate primitive Pythagorean triples with small m, n
import math

# Limit for m and n to control output size
max_mn = 20

# Use Euclid's formula for Pythagorean triples:
# Given m > n > 0, coprime, not of same parity:
# a = m^2 - n^2, b = 2mn, c = m^2 + n^2
# We can generate all such (m, n).

for m in range(2, max_mn):
    for n in range(1, m):
        # Check coprimality and parity
        if math.gcd(m, n) == 1 and (m + n) % 2 == 1:
            k = m * m + n * n  # hypotenuse squared
            # Compute a b
            answer = math.exp(k)
            print(f"m={m}, n={n}, hypotenuse squared={k}, a*b=exp({k}) = {answer}")
```

This enumerates plausible \((m,n)\) pairs, their hypotenuse, and the corresponding \(a b\). You may extend `max_mn` further, but due to constraints, keep it small. The outputs will help in conjecturing the possible values of \(a b\).
