The problem is to find values for d, gd, x such that:

- d = 6
- d + gd = 30
- x ≤ d
- gd = 6 * x
- d + (gd - x) is some answer

Given d=6, from d + gd = 30, gd = 24; then gd = 6 * x implies x = gd/6 = 24/6=4.

Check x ≤ d: 4 ≤ 6, true.

Compute answer: d + (gd - x) = 6 + (24 - 4) = 6 + 20 = 26.

Program enumerates possible values (though here computations are straightforward), so we just confirm this.

```python
# Since variables are fixed by the problem:
# d = 6
# d + gd = 30 => gd = 24
# gd = 6 * x => x = gd / 6 = 4
# x ≤ d => 4 ≤ 6 (True)
# Answer: d + (gd - x) = 6 + (24 - 4) = 26

# For demonstration, enumerate and verify:
for d in [6]:
    gd = 30 - d
    for x in range(d + 1):
        if gd == 6 * x:
            answer = d + (gd - x)
            print(answer)
            # Since the parameters are concrete, only one answer is expected
```
