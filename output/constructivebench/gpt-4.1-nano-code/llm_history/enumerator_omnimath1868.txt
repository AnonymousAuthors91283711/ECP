This appears to be a formal statement involving finite functions, inequalities, and a sum condition, likely related to counting the number of integer functions `a : Fin 6 → ℤ` satisfying two constraints:

- For all `i` in `Fin 6`, `a i ≤ i`.
- The sum over all `i` of `a i` equals 6.

You want to find the total number of such functions.

Since `i` ranges over `{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`, and for each `i`, `a(i)` is an integer with `a(i) ≤ i`.

Note: The problem does not specify a lower bound for `a(i)`; assume `a(i)` can be any integer less than or equal to `i`. To make the problem bounded and tractable, we can assume `a(i) ≥ 0`. This matches standard combinatorial reasoning for counting non-negative integer solutions.

**Approach:**

- For each `i`, possible `a(i)` are integers from 0 up to `i`.
- The sum over `i` of `a(i)` is 6.
- We want to count the number of integer solutions `(a(0), a(1), ..., a(5))` where for all `i`, `0 ≤ a(i) ≤ i`, and sum of all `a(i)` equals 6.

To implement this:

- Enumerate all `(a(0), ..., a(5))` with `a(i)` from 0 to `i`.
- For each, check if their sum is 6.
- Count and print each valid solution.

Since the maximum for `a(i)` is `i`, the total number of candidates is manageable.

```python
# Enumerate all possible functions a : Fin 6 -> ℤ with 0 ≤ a(i) ≤ i and sum a(i) = 6
count = 0
for a0 in range(0, 1):  # a0 in [0,0], only 0
    for a1 in range(0, 2):  # a1 in [0,1]
        for a2 in range(0, 3):  # a2 in [0,2]
            for a3 in range(0, 4):  # a3 in [0,3]
                for a4 in range(0, 5):  # a4 in [0,4]
                    for a5 in range(0, 6):  # a5 in [0,5]
                        if a0 + a1 + a2 + a3 + a4 + a5 == 6:
                            print(f"a = {[a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5]}")
                            count += 1
print(f"Total solutions: {count}")
```
