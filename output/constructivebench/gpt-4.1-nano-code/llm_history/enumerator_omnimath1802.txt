The problem describes a function `f` that resembles the Euclidean algorithm for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD), with a specific recurrence. The goal is to find the maximum possible value `n` of `f(x, y)` over the domain `x, y ≤ 100` with given properties.

The recurrence:
- `f(0, x) = x`
- `f(y, 0) = y`
- If `x ≥ y`, then `f(x, y) = f(x - y, y) + 1`
- If `y ≥ x`, then `f(x, y) = f(x, y - x) + 1`

This is reminiscent of the Euclidean algorithm where the number of steps is proportional to the number of divisions, or the sum related to the GCD process.

The task involves enumerating candidates for `f(x, y)` within the domain (0..100, 0..100) and recording the maximum `f(x, y)` value.

The code below searches through all pairs `(x, y)` within 0..100, computes `f(x, y)` according to the recursion, caches results for efficiency, and keeps track of the maximum value found, streaming outputs for each candidate `f(x, y)`.

```python
# Enumerate all pairs (x, y) where 0 <= x, y <= 100 and compute f(x, y)
# with the given recurrence, and track the maximum value.

def compute_f(x, y, memo):
    if (x, y) in memo:
        return memo[(x, y)]
    if x == 0:
        result = y
    elif y == 0:
        result = x
    elif x >= y:
        result = compute_f(x - y, y, memo) + 1
    else:
        result = compute_f(x, y - x, memo) + 1
    memo[(x, y)] = result
    return result

max_f = 0
max_pair = (0, 0)
memo = {}
for x in range(101):
    for y in range(101):
        val = compute_f(x, y, memo)
        print(val)  # Stream each computed value
        if val > max_f:
            max_f = val
            max_pair = (x, y)

print(f"Maximum f(x, y) within domain is {max_f} for (x, y) = {max_pair}")
```
