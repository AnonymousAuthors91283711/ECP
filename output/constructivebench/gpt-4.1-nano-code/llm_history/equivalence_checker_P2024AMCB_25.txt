Ground Truth Answer: (243, 4096)
Proposed Answer: (3^6, 2^12)
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer (243, 4096) and the proposed answer (3^6, 2^12):

1. First component:
- Ground truth: 243
- Proposed: 3^6 = 729
These are not equal (243 ≠ 729)

2. Second component:
- Ground truth: 4096
- Proposed: 2^12 = 4096
These are equal

The proposed answer is partially correct (second component matches) but incorrect on the first component. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.

<<<False>>>
