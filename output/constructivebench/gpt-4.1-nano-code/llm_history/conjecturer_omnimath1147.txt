theorem omnimath1147 :
  IsGreatest {N : ℕ | N ≤ ⌊(10^4 : ℝ) * 
    (∑ n in Icc 2 (10^6), (largestPrimeFactor (n^2 - 1) : ℝ)) / 
    (∑ n in Icc 2 (10^6), (largestPrimeFactor n : ℝ))⌋} 
  omnimath1147_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Sample range: 2 to 10000
Sum of largest prime factors of n: 10118280.00
Sum of largest prime factors of n^2-1: 17403064.00
N with maximum largest prime factor of n^2-1: 9972. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given that the maximum value of N is prompted by the ratio involving sums of largest prime factors, and the enumerated answer is around 9972, the dominant elements point towards N near this value. The ratio's maximum appears at N close to 10,000, where the sums are largest, especially for larger n. The answer is thus the upper bound in the range 2..10^4.
