This problem involves enumerating functions from a finite set Ω of size 6, with each value in S = {0, 1/2, 1}. We need to count the proportion of functions such that the product of the first three values, when floored, equals the product of the last three, possibly multiplied by f 3. Since the expression involves many combinations, an explicit enumeration approach is suitable.

We'll:
- Define the set S explicitly.
- Enumerate all functions f : Ω → S.
- Compute whether the condition with the floor holds.
- Count favorable cases.
- Compute the ratio as a rational number.

Given the small size of S and Ω (|S| = 3, |Ω|=6), enumeration is feasible within the token limit.

```python
# Enumerate all functions from Ω = {0,1,2,3,4,5} to S = {0, 1/2, 1}
# Count how many satisfy floor(product(f[0:3])) = product(f[3:6]) * f[3]

from itertools import product
from fractions import Fraction

# Define S as a list with rational numbers for exact computation
S = [Fraction(0), Fraction(1, 2), Fraction(1)]
indices = range(6)

total = 3 ** 6  # total number of functions
favorable_count = 0

for f_tuple in product(S, repeat=6):
    f = list(f_tuple)
    prod_first = f[0] * f[1] * f[2]
    prod_second = f[3] * f[4] * f[5]
    # floor of product of first three
    floor_first = int(prod_first // 1)
    # product of last three multiplied by f3
    prod_last_scaled = prod_second * f[3]
    if floor_first == prod_last_scaled:
        favorable_count += 1
        print("Favorable function:", f)

# Compute ratio as a fraction
answer = Fraction(favorable_count, total)
print("Answer:", answer)
```
