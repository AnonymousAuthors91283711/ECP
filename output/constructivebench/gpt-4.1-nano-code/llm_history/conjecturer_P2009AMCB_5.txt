The pattern suggests the answer is independent of the specific variables, relying instead on the product constraint and equalities. Since a = b and a * b * c = 128, substituting b = a yields a^2 * c = 128. With a > 0, possible values for a are divisors of 8, such as 2, 4, 8. For each:
- a=2 ⇒ c=128/4=32, sum=2+2+32=36
- a=4 ⇒ c=128/16=8, sum=4+4+8=16
- a=8 ⇒ c=128/64=2, sum=8+8+2=18
Hence, the sum is minimized at a=4: 16, matching the enumerated answer.
Final answer summarizes the minimal sum:
<<<16>>>
