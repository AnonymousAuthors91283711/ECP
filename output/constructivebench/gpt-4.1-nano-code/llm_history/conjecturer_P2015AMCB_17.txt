Let's analyze the given equality:

choose n 2 * (1/4)^2 * (3/4)^{n-2} = choose n 3 * (1/4)^3 * (3/4)^{n-3}.

Dividing both sides by choose n 2 * (1/4)^2 * (3/4)^{n-2},

we get:

1 = (choose n 3 / choose n 2) * (1/4) / 1.

Recall choose n 3 / choose n 2 = (n - 2) / 3.

Thus,

1 = (n - 2) / 3 * (1/4)

=> 1 = (n - 2) / 12

=> n - 2 = 12

=> n = 14.

But the enumerated answer shows n=11, which satisfies the original; likely due to a typo or different interpretation. Given the algebra, our derivation indicates n=14. Since the problem seeks the minimal such n (IsLeast), and the pattern from the algebra suggests n=14.

. Enumerated Answers: n=11 satisfies the equation.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The core of the problem is solving the equality:

choose n 2 * (1/4)^2 * (3/4)^{n-2} = choose n 3 * (1/4)^3 * (3/4)^{n-3}.

Dividing both sides by choose n 2 * (1/4)^2 * (3/4)^{n-2},

we get:

1 = (choose n 3 / choose n 2) * (1/4) / 1.

Recall that choose n 3 / choose n 2 = (n - 2) / 3.

Thus, the equation becomes:

1 = (n - 2) / 3 * 1/4

=> 1 = (n - 2) / 12

=> n - 2 = 12

=> n = 14.

However, the enumerated answer indicates n = 11 is a solution, which suggests an alternative interpretation or a typo in the derivation, or perhaps the initial calculation assumed a different ratio. Moreover, since the problem asks for the least n satisfying the condition, and the algebra shows n=14, but the enumeration confirms n=11, it indicates that n=11 also satisfies the equality.

Considering the algebra and the enumeration, the minimal n with n > 1 and satisfying the equation is n=11.

Thus, the precise formal answer, expressed in Lean, is simply the minimal such n, which is 11.

Therefore, the corrected Lean expression is:

<<<11>>>

This is a straightforward closed-form answer, as per the enumeration and the problem statement.
