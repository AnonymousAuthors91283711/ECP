This problem asks us to analyze a sequence `s(n)` of lists of digits, construct the number from each list, and determine how many such numbers for `n < 10` are prime. The sequence for each `n` is given by `[1]` concatenated with `n` repetitions of `[2]`, then ending with `[1]`.

Specifically, `s(n) = [1] + replicate n 2 + [1]`. That creates numbers like:
- For n=0: 1  = 1
- For n=1: 1 2 1  = 121
- For n=2: 1 2 2 1  = 1221
- For n=3: 1 2 2 2 1  = 12221
- and so forth, up to n=9.

The problem asks for the cardinality of the set of `n < 10` for which the number formed by these digits is prime.

We can write a Python script to enumerate `n` from 0 to 9, build each number, test for primality, and count the prime cases.

```python
def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    if num in (2, 3):
        return True
    if num % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(num**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

prime_count = 0
for n in range(10):
    digits = [1] + [2] * n + [1]
    number = 0
    for d in digits:
        number = number * 10 + d
    if is_prime(number):
        print(n, number)
        prime_count += 1

print("Total prime counts for n<10:", prime_count)
```
