This problem involves probability distributions over three categories with certain ordering constraints. To help conjecture the true answer, the Python code will enumerate all possible probability vectors over three categories, verify the constraints, and compute the value of the "winning fields" related expression. Specifically, it will:

- Generate all candidate distributions over three categories, with values like 0, 1/4, 1/2, etc.
- Check those distributions satisfy sum and non-negativity constraints.
- For each, compute the sum of the "winning fields" condition.
- Output each candidate and its computed value, to assist in analysis.

```python
# Enumerate discrete probability distributions over 3 categories
import itertools

# Define the sample values to consider
sample_values = [0, 0.25, 0.5]

# Store candidate distributions and their "value"
candidates = []

# Generate all combinations with replacement
for x0, x1, x2 in itertools.product(sample_values, repeat=3):
    total = x0 + x1 + x2
    # Check if sum is 1 (with tolerance for floating point)
    if abs(total - 1.0) < 1e-8:
        # Store the distribution
        distribution = (x0, x1, x2)
        # Count how many "opp_order" (which is the same as "your_order") are less or equal
        your_order = [0.25, 0.25, 0.5]
        # Compute the sum over indices where your_order[i] >= distribution[i]
        winning_fields_count = sum(1 for i in range(3) if your_order[i] >= distribution[i])
        # Output details immediately
        print(f"Distribution: {distribution}, winning fields count: {winning_fields_count}")
        candidates.append((distribution, winning_fields_count))
```
