theorem omnimath4214 (f : ℕ → ℕ) :
  (∀ a b : ℕ, ∃ (x y z : ℕ), x = a ∧ y = f b ∧ z = f (b + f a - 1) ∧ x + y > z ∧ y + z > x ∧ z + x > y) ↔ f = omnimath4214_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: f(n)=n satisfies the inequalities.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
<<<fun n : ℕ => n>>>
This pattern satisfies the inequalities for all a, b; it makes the sums and differences consistent, confirming the answer.
