theorem omnimath2831 (b : ℤ) (h : 3 ≠ b) : 
  (3 + b) / (3 - b) = -4 ↔ b = omnimath2831_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: b = 5 is a solution. Expected Answer Type: ℤ
Given the equation (3 + b) / (3 - b) = -4 and the enumerated solution b = 5, the general solution for b can be derived by cross-multiplying and simplifying: b = 5. Hence, the closed-form answer is simply 5. 

<<<5>>>
