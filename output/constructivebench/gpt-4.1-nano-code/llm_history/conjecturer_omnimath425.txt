. Enumerated answers: Possible period t = 20. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The period of the Fibonacci-like sequence with initial values 1,1 and defining recurrence F(n+2)=F(n+1)+F(n) is known to be 20 modulo the fundamental period properties and previous results. The enumeration confirms this specific period. Thus, the unique period t = 20 can be expressed as:

<<<20>>>
