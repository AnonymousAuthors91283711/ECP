The problem appears to be about finding the greatest constant \( c \) such that, for all functions \( x: \{0, 1, \dots, 2016\} \to \mathbb{R} \), the inequality
\[
\sum_{i=0}^{2015} x_i (x_i + x_{i+1}) \ge c \cdot x_{2016}^2
\]
holds. To approximate this, we want to identify the minimal value of the sum relative to \( x_{2016}^2 \) for different sequences \( x \). A natural candidate is to consider sequences where most terms are zero except at the last term to understand the bounds.

Given the complexity, a simple initial approach is to test sequences:
- \( x_i = 0 \) for all \( i \) except \( x_{2016} = 1 \), which makes the sum zero.
- \( x_i \) linear or geometric sequences to see the effect on the sum.

Let's implement a brute-force search over small sample sequences to estimate the minimal ratio \( \sum x_i(x_i + x_{i+1}) / x_{2016}^2 \).

```python
# Enumerate simple sequences to approximate the greatest c
import numpy as np

# Parameters
length = 2017
max_value = 1  # limit to small values for feasibility

# Initialize minimal ratio high
min_ratio = float('inf')
best_sequence = None

# For simplicity, test sequences where only the last term is non-zero
test_sequences = [
    np.zeros(length),
    np.zeros(length),
    np.zeros(length),
]

# Case 1: x_{2016} = 1, others zero
x = np.zeros(length)
x[-1] = 1
sum_value = sum(x[i] * (x[i] + x[i+1]) for i in range(length -1))
ratio = sum_value / (x[-1] ** 2)
print(f"Sequence with only last term 1: ratio = {ratio}")

# Case 2: x_{2016} = 0.5, others zero
x = np.zeros(length)
x[-1] = 0.5
sum_value = sum(x[i] * (x[i] + x[i+1]) for i in range(length -1))
ratio = sum_value / (x[-1] ** 2)
print(f"Sequence with last term 0.5: ratio = {ratio}")

# Case 3: sequence linearly decreasing
for a in [1, 0.1, 0.01]:
    x = np.linspace(a, 0, length)
    sum_value = sum(x[i] * (x[i] + x[i+1]) for i in range(length -1))
    ratio = sum_value / (x[-1] ** 2)
    print(f"Linear decreasing from {a} to 0: ratio = {ratio}")
```
