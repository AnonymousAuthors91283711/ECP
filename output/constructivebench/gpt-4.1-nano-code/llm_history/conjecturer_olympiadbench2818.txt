The pattern suggests pairs where \( p.1 = p.2 \) or pairs where the values relate by specific negative shifts, all satisfying the quadratic equations with roots in the complex numbers. Given the symmetry and the pattern, the total number of such pairs aligns with all those satisfying either condition within the bound. Counting the pairs in the pattern yields 6.
