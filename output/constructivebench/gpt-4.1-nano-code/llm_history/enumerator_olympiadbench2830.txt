The problem asks for the least possible value of \(s = x + z\) where \(x, y, z \in \mathbb{N}\), with conditions:
- \(x > 0\),
- \(y > 0\),
- \(z > 0\),
- \(xy = 20\),
- \(yz = 12\).

Since \(x, y, z\) are positive integers, we can enumerate all possible pairs for \(x\) and \(y\) satisfying \(xy=20\), then check if the corresponding \(z = \frac{12}{y}\) is an integer and positive.

Here's the Python code to do it:

```python
# Enumerate all pairs of positive integers x, y such that x * y = 20.
# For each pair, compute z = 12 / y if it's an integer > 0.
# Then compute s = x + z and find the minimal such s.
solutions = []
for x in range(1, 21):  # Because x*y=20, x doesn't need to go beyond 20
    if 20 % x == 0:
        y = 20 // x
        # y must be > 0
        if y > 0:
            if 12 % y == 0:
                z = 12 // y
                if z > 0:
                    s = x + z
                    solutions.append(s)
                    print(s)  # print each candidate as soon as found

if solutions:
    print("Minimum s:", min(solutions))
```

This code enumerates all valid solutions and outputs each \(s = x+z\), as well as the minimum \(s\) found.
