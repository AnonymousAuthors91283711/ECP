The problem appears to ask for the number of natural numbers \(k\) for which there exist positive integers \(a, b\) such that \(k \times (a + b) = 2013 \times \operatorname{lcm}(a, b)\). To assist in conjecturing the answer, I'll enumerate possible \((a, b)\) pairs with small values to understand the pattern.

Approach:
- Use small positive integers for \(a\) and \(b\).
- For each pair, compute \(k = \frac{2013 \times \operatorname{lcm}(a, b)}{a + b}\) if it's an integer.
- Collect all unique \(k\) values.

This enumeration helps approximate the count of such \(k\). Since the problem statement suggests counting the number of such \(k\), I'll output that count and possibly list some \(k\) values for insight.

Here's the code:

```python
# Enumerate small positive pairs (a, b)
# For each, compute k = (2013 * lcm(a, b)) / (a + b) if integral
import math

k_values = set()

# Limit for small enumeration
limit = 50

for a in range(1, limit + 1):
    for b in range(1, limit + 1):
        lcm_ab = a * b // math.gcd(a, b)
        denominator = a + b
        numerator = 2013 * lcm_ab
        if numerator % denominator == 0:
            k = numerator // denominator
            print(f"a={a}, b={b}, lcm={lcm_ab}, k={k}")
            k_values.add(k)

# Output the count of distinct such k
print("Total distinct k:", len(k_values))
```
