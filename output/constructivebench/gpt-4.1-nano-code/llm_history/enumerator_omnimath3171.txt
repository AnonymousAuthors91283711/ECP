The problem seems to involve a series with alternating signs, involving the function A(k) which counts divisors of k satisfying certain conditions, and asks to find a sum value. To explore possible answers, I will simulate the partial sums for small k, since the theoretical proof is missing.

We will:
- Define A(k) for small k by explicitly enumerating divisors.
- Calculate partial sums of the series for a small number of terms.
- Use these to conjecture the sum.

Note that the original code references Mathlib and specialized syntax; I will reimplement the logic in Python for enumeration, focusing on small k to keep computations manageable.

```python
# Enumerate A(k): count of divisors d of k where d is odd and d^2 < 2*k
# Compute partial sums of the series sum_{k=1}^N (-1)^(k-1) * A(k) / k for small N
# Print all partial sums to observe pattern and conjecture the total.

def divisors(n):
    divs = []
    for d in range(1, n+1):
        if n % d == 0:
            divs.append(d)
    return divs

def A(k):
    count = 0
    for d in divisors(k):
        if d % 2 == 1 and d**2 < 2 * k:
            count += 1
    return count

partial_sums = []
sum_series = 0.0
N = 20  # small sample size for conjecture
for k in range(1, N+1):
    val = ((-1)**(k-1)) * A(k) / k
    sum_series += val
    print(f"Partial sum up to k={k}: {sum_series}")

# Output the final partial sum as a candidate answer
print(f"Conjectured sum approx: {sum_series}")
```
