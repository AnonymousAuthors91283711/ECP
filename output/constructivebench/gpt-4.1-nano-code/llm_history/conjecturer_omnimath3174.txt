The pattern suggests the answer involves the last digit of the factorial difference in a specific range, likely relating to the last digit of the factorial itself as for large n, factorials end with many zeros. Based on enumerated options and common factorial behaviors, the last digit of (b! - a!) modulo 10 will often be the last digit of a! or b!, considering the factorial values' tail behavior. The most plausible and consistent last digit among options is 6, matching factorial differences for some ranges.
