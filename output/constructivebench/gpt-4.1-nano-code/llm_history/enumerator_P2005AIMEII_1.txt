This problem involves finding the least natural number \( n \geq 6 \) such that \(\binom{n}{6} = 6 \times \binom{n}{3}\). To assist in conjecturing, I'll generate candidate values for \( n \) starting from the minimal value 6 upwards. I'll check the equality \(\binom{n}{6} = 6 \times \binom{n}{3}\) for each \( n \), and stream the results as I go. I will limit enumeration to a reasonable range (e.g., up to 40) for efficiency, considering typical problem constraints.

```python
from math import comb

def check_condition(n):
    return comb(n, 6) == 6 * comb(n, 3)

# Enumeration starting from n=6 upward
for n in range(6, 41):
    if check_condition(n):
        print(f"n = {n} satisfies the condition: C({n},6) = 6 * C({n},3) = {comb(n,6)}")
        break
```
