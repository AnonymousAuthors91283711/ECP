This problem involves determining a minimal constant \(k\) (a threshold) such that any two functions \(A\) and \(B\) from \(\text{Fin }10\) to \(\mathbb{N}\), with sum 2019, satisfying \(A(i), B(i) \geq k\), are mutually reachable via a certain operation. Additionally, it involves counting the size of a certain set \(T\) of functions with the same sum and no two are reachable from one another.

Given the complexity, the key is to find candidate values of \(k\), verify the reachability conditions, and count the maximum size of such an antichain (independent set under reachability). 

A feasible approach is to sample small \(k\) values and generate all functions \(A : \text{Fin }10 \to \mathbb{N}\) with sum 2019 and bounded below by \(k\). Then, check for reachability and independence to find the minimal \(k\) satisfying the conditions.

Below is an example code enumerating candidates for \(k\) from 1 upwards, generating functions with sum 2019 and all entries ≥ \(k\), then forming the set \(T\) and counting maximal antichains.

```python
from itertools import combinations_with_replacement, product
from collections import defaultdict

# Generate all functions A: Fin 10 → ℕ with sum = total_sum and A(i) ≥ k
def generate_functions(n=10, total_sum=2019, k=1):
    # Adjust total sum by subtracting k for each element
    remaining = total_sum - n * k
    # Generate compositions of remaining into n non-negative parts
    # These correspond to A(i) - k ≥ 0
    results = []
    for comp in compositions(remaining, n):
        A = [x + k for x in comp]
        results.append(A)
    return results

# Helper to generate compositions (integral solutions)
def compositions(n, k):
    if k == 1:
        yield [n]
    else:
        for i in range(n + 1):
            for tail in compositions(n - i, k - 1):
                yield [i] + tail

# Check reachability (placeholder: actual logic depends on operation)
def reachable(A, B):
    # Placeholder logic: assume reachability if A and B differ by a sequence of steps
    # For demonstration, consider reachable if A and B are permutations (simplification)
    return sorted(A) == sorted(B)

# Enumeration to find minimal k
for k in range(1, 20):  # limit for efficiency
    functions = generate_functions(k=k)
    # Build the set T
    T = functions
    # Check reachability within T (pairwise)
    reachability_graph = defaultdict(set)
    for i, A in enumerate(T):
        for j, B in enumerate(T):
            if i != j:
                if reachable(A, B):
                    reachability_graph[i].add(j)
    # Find maximal independent set (no two reachable)
    # For simplicity, approximate by greedy
    independent_indices = []
    used = set()
    for i in range(len(T)):
        if i not in used:
            independent_indices.append(i)
            used.update(reachability_graph[i])
    count = len(independent_indices)
    print(f'k={k}, count={count}')
    # If count is large enough or satisfies criteria, can break or return
```
