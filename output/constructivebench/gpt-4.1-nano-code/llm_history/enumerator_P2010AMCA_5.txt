The problem appears to involve finding the minimal integer \( n \) such that, for all functions describing remaining scores of players with certain value restrictions, a certain inequality holds. To enumerate the possible answers and aid in conjecturing, we can consider small values of \( n \) (from 0 up to some upper bound) and check whether the inequality can hold or be violated.

Since the constraints set \( n \) in a finite range and the terms are simple sums over limited sets, we can brute-force small values of \( n \), test whether the inequality can be violated, and identify the minimal \( n \) that guarantees the inequality holds universal regardless of the remaining scores.

Here's an approach:
- Iterate over small \( n \) from 0 to, say, 50.
- For each \( n \), try to find specific configurations of remaining scores from the allowed sets that violate the inequality.
- If no configuration violates the inequality, then this \( n \) is a candidate.
- Print each candidate answer found and ultimately identify the minimal \( n \).

```python
# Enumerate possible values of n from 0 up to a threshold (e.g., 50)
# For each n, test whether the inequality can be violated by choosing worst-case remaining scores
# For simplicity, assume the worst case for Chelsea tries to minimize chelsea_total 
# and opponent tries to maximize opponent_total to find violations.

# Allowed values for remaining scores
chelsea_values = [4, 8, 10]
opponent_values = [0, 2, 4, 8, 10]

# Function to check if for a given n, there's a violation
def can_violate(n):
    # Chelsea minimizes total: choose minimal remaining scores
    chelsea_sum = sum(chelsea_values[0] for _ in range(50))
    chelsea_total = 50 + chelsea_sum + 10 * n

    # Opponent maximizes total: choose maximum remaining scores
    opponent_sum = sum(opponent_values[-1] for _ in range(50))
    opponent_sum2 = sum(opponent_values[-1] for _ in range(50 - n))
    opponent_total = opponent_sum + opponent_sum2

    return chelsea_total <= opponent_total  # violation occurs if inequality not strict

# Enumerate n and check
max_n = 50
for n in range(max_n + 1):
    if not can_violate(n):
        print(f"Candidate answer n = {n}")
        # Since it's minimal n, once found, can stop if desired
```

This code efficiently tests small candidate \( n \), prints candidates immediately as they are found, and helps in conjecturing the minimal \( n \) satisfying the theorem.
