theorem omnimath1628
    (a : Fin 5 → ℝ)
    (ha : ∀ k ∈ Set.Icc 1 5, (∑ i : Fin 5, a i / (k ^ 2 + (i.1 : ℝ))) = 1 / k ^ 2) :
    (∑ i : Fin 5, a i / (37 + (i.1 : ℝ))) = omnimath1628_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: a=(2, 2, 0.1, -2, -2), sum at k=37=0.010014094805494034. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern of the given sums suggests that the sum evaluates to an expression involving the harmonic structure or rational functions of K. As the sum is over constants and the pattern at k=37 approximates to a negligible small value, and given the symmetry, the closed form converges to a rational expression T = 1 / (a + 1). Since the specific summation is consistent with a telescoping or reciprocal sum, the conjectured answer simplifies to 1/2.
