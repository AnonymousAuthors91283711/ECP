Ground Truth Answer: -2
Proposed Answer: -1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the sum of all real solutions x to the equation:
   (x² + 2x + 3)^(x² + 2x + 3)^(x² + 2x + 3) = 2012

2. Let's consider the substitution y = x² + 2x + 3. The equation becomes y^y^y = 2012.

3. The expression y^y^y is strictly increasing for y > e^(-1/e), and y = x² + 2x + 3 = (x+1)² + 2 ≥ 2 > e^(-1/e).

4. Therefore, there's exactly one positive solution y₀ to y^y^y = 2012.

5. For x, we solve x² + 2x + 3 = y₀, which gives two solutions: x = -1 ± √(y₀ - 2).

6. The sum of these roots is (-1 + √(y₀ - 2)) + (-1 - √(y₀ - 2)) = -2.

The ground truth answer correctly shows this sum as -2, while the proposed answer gives -1. The proposed answer is incorrect.
