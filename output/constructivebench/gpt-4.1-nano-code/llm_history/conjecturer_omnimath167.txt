. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern shows that for n=2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20, the residue mod (2^n - 1) is either 1, 4, 16, 256, 1024, 65536 etc., alternating between these powers of 4 or 1; only the odd n produce residues that are powers of 4 (specifically 4, 16, 4, 4, 1024, 4). The pattern indicates that we require n=3, which is the first where the residue is 4, a power of 4, but not divisible by 2, hence not matching the residue 1 pattern nor the explicit divisibility pattern for some n. Based on the enumerated solutions, the n=3 is the first odd n where the residue is 4, which isn't congruent to 1 mod (2^n - 1). 

Thus, the minimal n satisfying the conditions appears to be n=3.
