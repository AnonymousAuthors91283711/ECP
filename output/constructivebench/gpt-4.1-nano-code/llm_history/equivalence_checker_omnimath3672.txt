Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ c : ℝ, ∀ x, f x = c} ∪ {f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ a : ℝ, (a = 0 ∨ a = -1) ∧ ∀ x, f x = a * x}

The proposed answer suggests that the solutions are either constant functions or linear functions with slope 0 or -1. While this covers some important cases, it might not be exhaustive. The ground truth answer (marked as "sorry") suggests we don't have the complete solution to compare against. The proposed answer is likely partially correct but may miss some edge cases or more complex solutions.
