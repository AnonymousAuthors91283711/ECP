abbrev P2008AMCB_2_answer : ℤ := sorry
theorem P2008AMCB_2 :
  ∀ (M : Matrix (Fin 4) (Fin 4) ℕ),
  (∀ i j, M i j = M 0 0 + (j : ℕ) + 7 * (i : ℕ)) →  -- Calendar date property
  let M' := fun i j => if i = 1 ∨ i = 3 then M i (3 - j) else M i j;  -- Reverse 2nd and 4th rows
  let diag1 := ∑ i, (M' i i : ℤ);  -- Main diagonal sum as ℤ
  let diag2 := ∑ i, (M' i (3 - i) : ℤ);  -- Anti-diagonal sum as ℤ
  |diag1 - diag2| = P2008AMCB_2_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: M(0,0)=-2: difference=0
M(0,0)=-1: difference=0
M(0,0)=0: difference=0
M(0,0)=1: difference=0
M(0,0)=2: difference=0. Expected Answer Type: ℤ
<<<0>>>

The difference is invariant of M(0,0) due to symmetry conditions. The answer is always 0 regardless of initial M(0,0).
