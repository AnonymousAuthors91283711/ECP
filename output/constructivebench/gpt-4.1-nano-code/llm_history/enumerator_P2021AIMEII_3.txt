This problem involves enumerating permutations of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} (elements of Fin 5) and counting how many satisfy the condition that the sum (over i in Fin 5) of (Ï€(i) * (i.val + 1)) is divisible by 3. Since it is a high-school level difficulty, I will create a Python program that systematically generates all permutations of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, computes the sum for each permutation, and counts how many satisfy the divisibility condition. The code prints each qualifying permutation's sum immediately upon finding it. Finally, it reports the total count.

Because exhaustive enumeration over 5! = 120 permutations is quick, I will directly implement this approach.

The code will output each permutation, the sum, and the total count at the end. This helps in conjecturing the exact answer.

```python
import itertools

# Generate all permutations of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
permutations = itertools.permutations([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
count = 0

for perm in permutations:
    total = sum(perm[i] * (i + 1) for i in range(5))
    if total % 3 == 0:
        # Print permutation and sum immediately upon finding a qualifying permutation
        print(f"Permutation: {perm}, Sum: {total}")
        count += 1

print(f"Total permutations satisfying the condition: {count}")
```
