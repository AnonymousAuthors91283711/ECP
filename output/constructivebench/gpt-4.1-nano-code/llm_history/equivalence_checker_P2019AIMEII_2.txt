theorem P2019AIMEII_2 :
  let (p, q) := P2019AIMEII_2_answer
  probVisits7 7 = p / q ∧ p.Coprime q := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: (99, 128)
Proposed Answer: (21, 32)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive probability function probVisits7 where:
   - Base cases: probVisits7 0 = 0, probVisits7 1 = 1, probVisits7 2 = 1
   - Recursive case: probVisits7 (n+3) = (probVisits7 (n+2) + probVisits7 (n+1))/2

2. We need to compute probVisits7 7 and express it as a reduced fraction p/q.

3. Let's compute the values step by step:
   probVisits7 3 = (1 + 1)/2 = 1
   probVisits7 4 = (1 + 1)/2 = 1
   probVisits7 5 = (1 + 1)/2 = 1
   probVisits7 6 = (1 + 1)/2 = 1
   probVisits7 7 = (1 + 1)/2 = 1

Wait, this seems incorrect as it would give 1/1, which contradicts both answers. Let me recompute more carefully:

probVisits7 0 = 0
probVisits7 1 = 1
probVisits7 2 = 1
probVisits7 3 = (1 + 1)/2 = 1
probVisits7 4 = (1 + 1)/2 = 1
probVisits7 5 = (1 + 1)/2 = 1
probVisits7 6 = (1 + 1)/2 = 1
probVisits7 7 = (1 + 1)/2 = 1

This still gives 1/1. There must be a misunderstanding of the problem. The ground truth answer (99,128) suggests the recursion might be different. 

Looking at the proposed answer (21,32), which is approximately 0.65625, while the ground truth (99,128) ≈ 0.7734, these are clearly different fractions. Since neither matches our initial computation and they don't match each other, and without knowing the exact intended recursion, we can only judge the answers relative to each other.
