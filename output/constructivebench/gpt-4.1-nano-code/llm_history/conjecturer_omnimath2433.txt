The problem counts arrangements where permutations satisfy a cyclic inequality among indices. The total permutations of 10 elements are 10!. The specified inequalities correspond to choosing three elements in increasing order and then cyclically ordered images under π, which simplifies to combinations and cycles. The count aligns with the number of 3-cycles times permutations of remaining elements, roughly 3! * 8! = 6 * 40320 = 241920; but considering the initial inequalities and cyclic nature, the enumerated answer suggests total arrangements: 10! * (number of valid cycles). From enumeration, the total is 7,257,600, matching 10! / (number of cycles).  
Final answer: <<<720 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7>>>
