This problem involves a specific 3x3 matrix defined by a parameter m and the vector (a, b, c). The theorem is about the uniqueness of solutions to a linear system and a particular difference condition involving a function `omnimath4215_answer`. To assist in conjecturing and proving the true answer, I will enumerate candidate values of m, a, b, c, and test the difference condition for various solutions, focusing on small, manageable samples.

Since the matrix is 3x3 and parameters are real numbers, but to keep computations simple and finite, I will consider small integer or rational values for m, a, b, c. I will iterate over these, compute the solution (assuming invertibility), and check the difference condition.

Note: The core task is to generate candidate solutions y that satisfy \(A y = b\), then verify the difference property.

Here is the Python code doing this enumeration:

```python
import numpy as np
from itertools import product

# Enumerate small values for m, a, b, c
m_values = [-1, 0, 2]
a_values = [-1, 0, 1]
b_values = [-1, 0, 1]
c_values = [-1, 0, 1]

# Function to create matrix A given m
def create_matrix_A(m):
    return np.array([[1, 1, m],
                     [1, m, 1],
                     [m, 1, 1]])

# Attempt to solve Ax = b for each parameter set
for m in m_values:
    A = create_matrix_A(m)
    if abs(np.linalg.det(A)) < 1e-8:
        continue  # Skip singular matrix
    for a, b, c in product(a_values, b_values, c_values):
        b_vec = np.array([a, b, c])
        x = np.linalg.solve(A, b_vec)
        # Check difference condition for u=1,0,2
        diff_ok = True
        for i in range(3):
            i_next = (i + 1) % 3
            diff = x[i_next] - x[i]
            # The diff should be d for all i
            # Since values differ, just record the difference
            pass
        # Compute differences for all i
        diffs = [x[(i+1)%3] - x[i] for i in range(3)]
        # Check if all differences are equal
        if len(set(np.round(diffs, 6))) == 1:
            d_val = diffs[0]
            print(f"M={m}, a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, solution={x.round(4).tolist()}, diff={d_val}")
```

This code enumerates small parameter values, solves the linear system when invertible, and checks for when the successive differences are equal, assisting in understanding the structure of solutions and the difference condition. It streams each candidate for easy analysis and conjecture formation.
