[write_program]
This problem involves summing a series of rational numbers and finding the exact sum. To assist in conjecturing and possibly proving the sum, I will write a Python program that enumerates possible partial sums of the series for small values of `n`. This helps in observing the pattern or the exact sum.

The series is:
\[
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(n+3)^2 + (n+1)}
\]

which simplifies to:
\[
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(n+3)^2 + n + 1}
\]

To make the pattern clearer, I'll explore partial sums for `n` from 0 up to 20, printing each sum. This helps in conjecturing the total sum.

```python
# This script computes partial sums of the series to help conjecture the total sum.
# Series: sum_{n=0}^âˆž 1 / ((n+3)^2 + (n+1))
import math

def partial_sum(n_max):
    total = 0
    for n in range(n_max + 1):
        denominator = (n + 3)**2 + (n + 1)
        term = 1 / denominator
        total += term
        print(f"n={n}, term={term:.6f}, partial sum={total:.6f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    partial_sum(20)
```

This code outputs each partial sum immediately, allowing us to estimate the total sum as `n` increases. From the pattern, one might recognize convergence near a specific rational or decimal value, which can then be targeted for an exact sum discovery.
