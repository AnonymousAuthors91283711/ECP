theorem P2010AIMEI_14 : 
  IsGreatest {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ (∑ k in Finset.range 100, ⌊Real.log (k+1) + Real.log n / Real.log 10⌋) ≤ 300} 
  P2010AIMEI_14_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Maximum n: 109. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The number n must satisfy n ≤ 109 based on the enumeration; the upper bound is 109. As the set of n satisfying condition is all integers from 1 up to 109, and we want the greatest such n, the answer is 109. 

<<<109>>>
