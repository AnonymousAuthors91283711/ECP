Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The enumerated pattern indicates that maximal counts correspond to specific bit patterns, with increasing counts for certain f bits. The maximum found is 9, achieved by particular patterns (like 0b1110101). These patterns imply the optimal set size is 9, regardless of specifics. Therefore, a closed-form answer is the maximum count, which is 9.
