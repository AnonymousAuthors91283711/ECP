The recurrence relation suggests a linear pattern; based on initial conditions, the sequence resembles an arithmetic progression. Observing the pattern with given values, the sum from 1 to n aligns with the quadratic formula. Recognizing the sequence’s behavior, the sum up to 2018 is proportional to a quadratic in x and y. The pattern hints at a formula involving (x + y) and constants, simplified into a closed form.

<<<fun x y => (2018 * (x + y) + 2017 * (2018 - 1)) / 2>>>
