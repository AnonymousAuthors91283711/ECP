Ground Truth Answer: (fun x => x, Polynomial.X)
Proposed Answer: (id, Polynomial.C 0 + Polynomial.X)
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer because:
1. The function `id` is identical to `fun x => x` (both represent the identity function)
2. `Polynomial.C 0 + Polynomial.X` simplifies to `Polynomial.X` (adding zero doesn't change the polynomial)
Both components of the pair are mathematically equivalent to the ground truth answer.
