This problem appears to involve matrices of size 17x17 with entries only ±1, and concerns the possible bounds of their determinants. Since the determinant's magnitude is bounded and the matrix entries are restricted, it's a combinatorial optimization over potential matrices.

Given the problem's complexity, an exhaustive enumeration over all 17x17 matrices with entries ±1 is computationally infeasible. Instead, a typical approach for similar problems is to consider known special matrices or small-dimensional analogs, and use smaller sample sizes to conjecture bounds. We can, for example, examine smaller matrices (like 2x2 or 3x3) with entries ±1, compute their determinants, and look for extremal values. While this doesn't directly solve the 17x17 case, it helps form a conjecture.

**Plan:**
- Pick small matrix sizes (e.g., 2x2 or 3x3).
- Generate all matrices with entries ±1.
- Compute their determinants.
- Track the maximum and minimum determinant magnitudes.
- Print candidate bounds, with a focus on the maximum determinants found.

This approach aligns with the requirement to enumerate possible answers and streaming partial results, leading to a plausible conjecture.

```python
import itertools
import numpy as np

# Small dimension for enumeration
dimension = 3  # changing to 2 or 3 for feasibility

max_det_magnitude = 0
candidate_bounds = []

# Generate all matrices with entries ±1
for entries in itertools.product([-1, 1], repeat=dimension*dimension):
    matrix = np.array(entries).reshape(dimension, dimension)
    det = round(np.linalg.det(matrix))
    magnitude = abs(det)

    # Update maximum determinant magnitude
    if magnitude > max_det_magnitude:
        max_det_magnitude = magnitude
        print(f"New maximum determinant magnitude: {max_det_magnitude} for matrix:\n{matrix}\n")
    # Store candidate bounds
    candidate_bounds.append(magnitude)

# Conjecture based on small case
# For 3x3, maximum absolute determinant is known for Hadamard matrices (det=±8)
# For the purposes of this enumeration, print the maximum found
print(f"Maximum absolute determinant for {dimension}x{dimension} matrices with entries ±1: {max_det_magnitude}")
```
