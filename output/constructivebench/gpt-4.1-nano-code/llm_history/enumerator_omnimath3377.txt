The problem involves a polynomial \( P \), which is given explicitly, and a polynomial \( Q \), constructed from the roots of \( P \). The goal is to analyze the quotient \(\frac{Q.eval(x^2)}{P.eval(x)}\) for \( x \) where \( P(x) \neq 0 \).

Given the explicit polynomial \( P = X^4 + 2X^3 - 13X^2 -14X + 24 \), we want to:

- Find the roots \( r \) of \( P \),
- Construct \( Q = \prod_{r} (X - r^2) \),
- For a test \( x \), compute \( \frac{Q(x^2)}{P(x)} \).

Our approach:
- First, factor \( P \) to find roots.
- For each root \( r \), compute \( r^2 \), then construct \( Q \) as the product over these roots.
- Evaluate the quotient \( Q(x^2) / P(x) \) for some sample points \( x \) where \( P(x) \neq 0 \).
- Because the exact answer is a polynomial over the integers, it suggests the quotient might be a polynomial in \( x \).

In Python, using SymPy (a symbolic mathematics library), we can:

- Define \( P \),
- Find roots numerically (approximate roots),
- Build \( Q \),
- Evaluate the ratio at sample points.

This script provides enumerations of potential answers and outputs values step-by-step.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define variable
x = sp.symbols('x')

# Define polynomial P
P = x**4 + 2*x**3 - 13*x**2 - 14*x + 24

# Find roots numerically
roots = list(sp.solve(P, x))
# For accuracy in root squaring, use numeric approximations
roots_numeric = [r.evalf() for r in roots]

# Construct Q = product of (X - r^2) over roots
Q = 1
for r in roots_numeric:
    Q *= (x - r**2)

# Generate some sample values x where P(x) != 0
test_x_values = [-3, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]
for val in test_x_values:
    # Check if P(val) != 0 to avoid division by zero
    if P.subs(x, val) != 0:
        numerator = Q.subs(x, val**2)
        denominator = P.subs(x, val)
        ratio = sp.Rational(numerator, denominator).simplify()
        print(f"x = {val}: Q({val**2}) / P({val}) = {ratio}")
```
