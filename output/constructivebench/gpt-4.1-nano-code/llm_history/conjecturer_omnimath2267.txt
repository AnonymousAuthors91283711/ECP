theorem omnimath2267 :
  IsGreatest {N : ℕ | ∃ (d : ℕ → ℕ), (∀ i, d i < 4) ∧ (∃ k, ∀ i ≥ k, d i = 0) ∧ 
    N = ∑ i in Finset.range 2013, d i * 4^i} (4^2013 - 1) ∧
  (4^2013 - 1) % 210 = omnimath2267_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 63. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<(4^2013 - 1) / 210>>>

// Reasoning: The maximum N, given the constraints, occurs when d i = 3 for i < k and 0 for i ≥ k, making N a geometric sum with ratio 4, sum 3 * (4^k - 1) / 3 = 4^k - 1; for the greatest N, choose maximal k = 2013, N = 4^2013 - 1, and remainder (4^2013 - 1) mod 210 = 63. Hence, answer is (4^2013 - 1) / 210.
