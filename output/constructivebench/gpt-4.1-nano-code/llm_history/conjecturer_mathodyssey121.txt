  IsLeast {n : ℕ | ∃ k : ℕ, 7 * n ≡ 0 [MOD 52] ∧ n ≡ 0 [MOD 2]} mathodyssey121_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 52. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The set includes n where 7 * n ≡ 0 (mod 52) and n ≡ 0 (mod 2). Since 52 = 4 * 13, n divisible by 52 (least such n) satisfies both conditions, and is divisible by 2. The smallest such n is 52.
