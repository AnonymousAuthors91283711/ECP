The problem involves analyzing the infinite sum of powers of cosine for a specific angle θ, where sin θ relates to T = 32. The sum appears to be a geometric series with ratio r = cos θ, and the terms are sums of (cos θ)^n over n from 0 to infinity, which converges for |cos θ| < 1.

Given T = 32 and sin θ = sqrt(T^2 - 64)/T, we note:

- sin θ = sqrt(1024 - 64)/32 = sqrt(960)/32.
- cos^2 θ = 1 - sin^2 θ.
- The sum over n is: ∑'_{n=0}^∞ (cos θ)^n = 1 / (1 - cos θ), provided |cos θ| < 1.

Our goal is to find the greatest possible sum of this series for angles θ satisfying the given sine relation.

Approach:
- Express cos θ in terms of T, using the Pythagorean identity.
- Since sin θ is positive, cos θ could be positive or negative, but to maximize the sum, choose cos θ close to 1.
- The candidate sum is 1 / (1 - cos θ), which is largest when cos θ approaches 1 from below.

Enumerating possible cos θ:
- Using sin θ = sqrt(960)/32.
- cos θ = sqrt(1 - sin^2 θ) = sqrt(1 - (960/1024)) = sqrt(64/1024) = sqrt(1/16) = 1/4 or -1/4.

Choosing cos θ = 1/4 (to get the greatest sum), sum = 1 / (1 - 1/4) = 1 / (3/4) = 4/3 ≈ 1.3333.

But considering the angle where cos θ approaches 1 (which isn't exactly attainable within the sine constraint), I will enumerate cos θ values consistent with sin θ, near 1 and -1, but given the sine is fixed, cos θ is fixed as above.

Here's a Python program to:

- Compute cos θ for the sine given.
- Check if sum converges.
- Print the sum value.

```python
import math

# Given T = 32
T = 32
# Calculate sin θ
sin_theta = math.sqrt(T**2 - 64) / T  # sqrt(960)/32
# Compute cos θ
cos_theta_pos = math.sqrt(1 - sin_theta**2)
cos_theta_neg = -cos_theta_pos

# Function to compute sum of geometric series if |cos θ| < 1
def geometric_sum(cos_theta):
    if abs(cos_theta) < 1:
        return 1 / (1 - cos_theta)
    else:
        return None  # Series does not converge

# Check both possibilities
sum_pos = geometric_sum(cos_theta_pos)
sum_neg = geometric_sum(cos_theta_neg)

# Enumerate and print results
if sum_pos is not None:
    print(f'cos θ (positive) = {cos_theta_pos:.6f}, sum = {sum_pos:.6f}')
if sum_neg is not None:
    print(f'cos θ (negative) = {cos_theta_neg:.6f}, sum = {sum_neg:.6f}')
```
