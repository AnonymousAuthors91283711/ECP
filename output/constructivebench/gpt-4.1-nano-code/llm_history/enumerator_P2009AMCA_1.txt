This problem asks to find integers \( h \) and \( m \) such that:  
\[ h \times 60 + m = (1 \times 60 + 18) - (10 \times 60 + 34) \]  
with \( 0 < m < 60 \) and \( 0 < h \). The goal is to find \( h + m \).  

Let's analyze:  
\[(1 \times 60 + 18) = 78\]  
\[(10 \times 60 + 34) = 634 \]  
So, the difference: \(78 - 634 = -556\).  
Since \(h \times 60 + m = -556\), and \(h, m\) are non-negative with those constraints, the only way is that \(h\) is negative or we need to consider negative \(h\). However, \( h \) is just a natural number \( \mathbb{N} \), so this indicates perhaps the problem intends to find such \(h, m\) with the given constraints that satisfy this equation, possibly negative \(h\).

But the constraints say \( 0 < m < 60 \), and \(h, m \in \mathbb{N}\). Usually, \( \mathbb{N} \) denotes positive integers. Since the result is negative, there is no valid positive \(h,m\).  

Alternatively, if the problem is about calculating the difference assuming \(h\) could be zero or negative, but the theorem states \( h,m : \mathbb{N} \) and \( 0 < m < 60 \).  

Actually, the key is to find all \(h, m\) satisfying the equation; given the difficulty, let's brute-force small positive \(h\) and \(m\) to check.

Here's the plan:  
- For \(h\) from 1 to some small limit, e.g., 10  
- \(m\) from 1 to 59  
- Check if \(h \times 60 + m = 78 - 634 = -556\).  
- Since the left side is positive and right is negative, no solutions.  

Alternatively, this suggests perhaps the problem is meant to be backward: maybe the calculation should be the other way or the initial difference is positive.

Let's check whether the original subtraction is intended as \((10 \times 60 + 34) - (1 \times 60 + 18) = 634 - 78 = 556\).  
Yes, more logical in context: the difference of times in transit might be positive, so maybe the subtraction is reversed.

In that case:  
\[ (10 \times 60 + 34) - (1 \times 60 + 18) = 634 - 78 = 556 \]  
then  
\[ h \times 60 + m = 556 \]  
and constraints \(0 < m < 60\), \(h \ge 0 \).

Let's implement to find all \(h, m\) with this:  

- For \(h\) from 0 up to `556 // 60 + 1` (to cover all possible hours):  
- For \(m\) in 1..59:  
- Check if \(h * 60 + m = 556\), and \(1 \le m \le 59\).  
- Compute \(h = (556 - m) // 60\), check if \(h \ge 0\) and if \( (556 - m) \equiv 0 \mod 60\).  

Let's proceed with this approach.

```python
# Enumerate all possible (h, m) such that h * 60 + m = 556, with 0 < m < 60 and h >= 0
target = 556
for m in range(1, 60):
    if (target - m) >= 0 and (target - m) % 60 == 0:
        h = (target - m) // 60
        if h >= 0:
            print(f"h: {h}, m: {m}")
            print(f"Sum h + m: {h + m}")
```
