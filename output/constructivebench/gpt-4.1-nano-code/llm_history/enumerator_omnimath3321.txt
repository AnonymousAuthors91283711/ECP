The problem appears to involve defining a recursive process related to ant movement or position, with an expression involving fractions 1/(4 + (k-1)). The goal is to find the least `n` such that the recursive position `ant_position(n, 0)` reaches or exceeds 1. We will implement a simulation to compute `ant_position(n, 0)` for increasing `n` until it is ≥ 1, and then output that smallest `n`. 

Given the problem constraints, reasonable small `n` values are to be tested, and the partial results are to be printed as soon as found, iterating from 1 upwards.

```python
def ant_position(k, pos):
    if k == 0:
        return 0
    new_pos = ant_position(k - 1, pos) + 1 / (4 + (k - 1))
    if new_pos >= 1:
        return new_pos
    else:
        return new_pos

n = 0
while True:
    n += 1
    position = ant_position(n, 0)
    print(f"n = {n}, position = {position}")
    if position >= 1:
        print(f"Least n where position ≥ 1 is {n}")
        break
```
