Ground Truth Answer: ∃ a b, 0 < a ∧ 0 < b ∧ a ≠ b ∧ 
  Infinite {n | 0 < n ∧ (a^n + b^n) ∣ (a^(n+1) + b^(n+1))}
Proposed Answer: ∃ a b : ℕ, a > 0 ∧ b > 0 ∧ b = 2 * a
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer gives a specific case (b = 2a) that satisfies the condition, but the ground truth is more general (any a ≠ b). The proposed answer is correct for this specific case, but doesn't cover all possible cases that satisfy the original condition.
