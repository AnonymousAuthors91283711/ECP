[write_program]
The provided code snippet references Mathlib and an unimplemented theorem related to modular arithmetic and prime numbers. Given the context and typical high-school level math competition problems, I will interpret the challenge as exploring values for \( p \) (prime), \( k \), with conditions on the function \( i^k + i \) over residues mod \( p \).

Since the goal is to generate candidate answers and verify the theorem, I'll write a Python program that:
- Checks various small primes \( p \),
- Varies \( k \) over small positive integers,
- Verifies the injectivity condition (which resembles a permutation),
- Computes \( (2^k + 2) \mod p \),
- Outputs all such results.

This approach aligns with enumerating possibilities and streaming answers, prioritizing exact matches.

```python
# Enumerate small primes p and small k to verify values of (2^k + 2) mod p
import itertools

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5)+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Generate small primes up to 50
primes = [n for n in range(2, 50) if is_prime(n)]

# For each prime p and small k, check the injectivity condition
# For small p and k, check if the mapping i â†¦ i^k + i mod p is injective
# over all i in [0, p-1].
results = []

for p in primes:
    for k in range(1, 10):  # small positive k
        residues = list(range(p))
        mapping = {}
        injective = True
        for i in residues:
            val = (pow(i, k, p) + i) % p
            if val in mapping:
                # collision found, not injective
                injective = False
                break
            mapping[val] = i
        if injective:
            val = (pow(2, k, p) + 2) % p
            print(f"For p={p}, k={k}, injective: yes, (2^k+2)%p = {val}")
            results.append(val)
# Output all distinct results
print("All candidate answers found:")
for ans in sorted(set(results)):
    print(ans)
```
