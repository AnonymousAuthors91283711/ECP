The problem appears to involve analyzing a function \( f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) with a key property relating its domain and the image of the interval [0,2], and then defining a new function \( g(x) = 1 - f(x + 1) \). The task is to find sets \( P_{2008AMCA\_12\_answer.1} \) and \( P_{2008AMCA\_12\_answer.2} \) satisfying the conditions on the domain and the range of \( g \).

Given that, the goal is to search for intervals and their images based on the given conditions, especially focusing on the fix-point set within the domain and the effect of shifting and transforming \( f \) into \( g \).

Here is an enumeration approach:
- Consider the domain interval \( Icc 0 2 \).
- Based on the condition \( \forall x, x \in Icc 0 2 \leftrightarrow f x \in Icc 0 1 \), the set \( f^{-1}(Icc 0 1) \) should align with \( [0, 2] \).
- For \( g(x) = 1 - f(x+1) \), analyze the range and preimage by shifting \( x \) by 1.

Since the problem is high-level, we will assume typical candidate intervals:
- The domain is [0,2].
- \( f \) maps [0,2] into [0,1].
- Then analyze how \( g \) maps some interval, deducing from transformations.

```python
# Enumerate possible intervals for the preimage sets based on the problem's conditions
# focusing on the domain [0, 2], and the transformation g(x)=1 - f(x+1).

# Since f maps [0,2] onto [0,1], and g involves a shift:
# g(x) = 1 - f(x+1)
# For x in domain, x+1 ∈ [1,3]. Since f(x+1) = ? We look at the inverse images.

# To find sets for the answer, we consider:
# - The preimage of [0,1] under f is [0, 2]
# - Therefore, f(x) ∈ [0,1] iff x ∈ [0, 2]
# - When considering g(x), x + 1 ∈ [0,2] for the transformation to be consistent.

# Candidate domain set for the answer (x such that x+1 in [0,2]):
answer_domain_candidates = [
    (x for x in [ -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 ]),
]

# Corresponding ranges for g(x) based on f(x+1),
# which aligns with the image of f over [0,2].

# Enumerate possible range for g(x)
range_candidates = [
    (1 - 1, 1 - 0),  # g when f(x+1) = [0,1]
]

# Generate and print all candidate set pairs
for x in [-1, 0, 1, 2, 3]:
    # Prefixed sets based on x
    domain_set = (x,)
    shifted_x = x + 1
    if 0 <= shifted_x <= 2:
        range_set = (0, 1)  # as f maps [0,2] to [0,1], g(x) maps accordingly
        print(f"x in [{x}]; x+1 in [0, 2]; g(x) in [{1 - 1}, {1 - 0}]")
    else:
        print(f"x in [{x}]; x+1 not in [0, 2]; domain and range may vary")
```
