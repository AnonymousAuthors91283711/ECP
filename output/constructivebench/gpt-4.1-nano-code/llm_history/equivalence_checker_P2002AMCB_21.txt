Ground Truth Answer: 448
Proposed Answer: 514
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a function `a(n)` that returns different values based on divisibility conditions of `n` by 11, 13, and 14. It then asks for the sum of `a(n)` from n=0 to 2001.

2. The ground truth answer is 448.

3. The proposed answer is 514.

4. To verify, let's consider the counts:
   - Numbers divisible by 11,13,14 (LCM=2002): Only 0 in range [0,2001] → 6*1=6
   - Numbers divisible by 11,13 (LCM=143): ⌊2001/143⌋=13 → 4*13=52
   - Numbers divisible by 11,14 (LCM=154): ⌊2001/154⌋=12 → 3*12=36
   - Numbers divisible by 13,14 (LCM=182): ⌊2001/182⌋=10 → 2*10=20
   - Numbers divisible by 11 only: ⌊2001/11⌋=181 minus above cases → 181-1-13-12=155 → 1*155=155
   - Numbers divisible by 13 only: ⌊2001/13⌋=153 minus above cases → 153-1-13-10=129 → 1*129=129
   - Numbers divisible by 14 only: ⌊2001/14⌋=142 minus above cases → 142-1-12-10=119 → 1*119=119
   - Total: 6+52+36+20+155+129+119=517 (not matching either answer)

However, the ground truth 448 is likely correct based on standard competition solutions, while 514 is incorrect. The proposed answer doesn't match the correct calculation.
