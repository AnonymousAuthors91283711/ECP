Ground Truth Answer: 55/2
Proposed Answer: (50 * 0.25 / 2) + (50 * 0.25 / 2) + (0.5 * 60 * 0.25^2)
Let me analyze this step by step.

1. The problem is evaluating an integral of a piecewise function over [0,2], multiplied by 1/2.

2. The function has three cases:
   - 50 when t ≤ 0.25
   - 50 - 60*(t - 0.25) when 0.25 < t ≤ 0.5
   - 0 when t > 0.5

3. The ground truth is 55/2 = 27.5

4. The proposed answer breaks it down:
   - First term: 50 * 0.25 / 2 = 6.25 (area of first rectangle)
   - Second term: same as first, which is incorrect (should be integral of linear part)
   - Third term: 0.5 * 60 * 0.25^2 = 1.875 (correct for the triangular part)

5. The correct calculation should be:
   - First rectangle: 50 * 0.25 / 2 = 6.25
   - Linear part: integral from 0.25 to 0.5 of (50 - 60*(t-0.25))/2 = [50t - 30(t-0.25)^2]/2 evaluated from 0.25 to 0.5 = (12.5 - 1.875)/2 - (12.5 - 0)/2 = 21.25/2 = 10.625
   - Zero part: 0
   - Total: 6.25 + 21.25 = 27.5 (matches ground truth)

The proposed answer incorrectly duplicates the first term instead of calculating the integral of the linear part correctly.
