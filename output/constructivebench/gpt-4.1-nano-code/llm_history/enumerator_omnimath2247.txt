This problem appears to involve counting the number of pairs (m, n) with m in a range and satisfying certain divisibility conditions involving exponentiation. Since the original code references a set of pairs (m, n) with m between 1 and 49, and the condition m divides \( n^{n+1} + 1 \), the main task is to enumerate all such pairs and count them.

The key points:
- Consider m from 1 to 49.
- For each m, find all n such that \( m \mid (n^{n+1} + 1) \).
- Count all such pairs (m, n).

To efficiently enumerate:
- Iterate m from 1 to 49.
- For each m, limit n to a manageable range, e.g., 0 to 100, since higher n are unlikely to give additional solutions within small m, and it's computationally feasible.
- Check divisibility condition.
- Count pairs and output the total.

Here's the implementation:

```python
# We will estimate the total number of pairs (m, n) with 1 ≤ m ≤ 49 and 0 ≤ n ≤ 100
# where m divides (n^(n+1) + 1). Because n can grow large, but for small m, this should uncover all solutions.
# This enumeration allows us to conjecture the total count without overcomputing.
# We do not assume the known answer; just accumulate and print each count along the way.

limit_m = 49
limit_n = 100
total_pairs = 0

for m in range(1, limit_m + 1):
    for n in range(limit_n + 1):
        val = pow(n, n + 1, m)  # Compute n^(n+1) mod m efficiently
        if (val + 1) % m == 0:
            total_pairs += 1
            print(f"m={m}, n={n} -> n^(n+1)+1 divisible by {m}")
print("Total pairs found:", total_pairs)
```
