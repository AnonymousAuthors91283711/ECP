This problem involves constructing complex-valued functions with constraints on their values' arguments and magnitudes, specifically on the unit circle, and analyzing their sums. To help conjecture the maximal possible sum magnitude, we can generate candidate functions with certain angular distributions, respecting the constraints, and compute their sums.

Given the constraints involve angular sectors with bounds, and the cardinality bounds, we will explore functions whose values are equally spaced on the unit circle within specified sectors. For simplicity and efficiency, we consider a small number of points per sector, systematically testing configurations with different angular distributions.

Below is a Python enumeration that constructs functions with points evenly distributed on the unit circle within the defined sectors, respecting the cardinality constraints, then computes the sum of their values:

- For simplicity, we select a fixed number of points in each sector (not exceeding the limits).
- We test a range of central angles θ.
- We generate functions by assigning points in those sectors.
- We compute the sum magnitude for each configuration and print results immediately.

This approach aids in discovering potential maximal sums by sampling structured possibilities.

```python
import math
import cmath

# Define sectors based on angle constraints
def generate_points_in_sector(theta_center, angle_width, max_points):
    points = []
    # Distribute points evenly within the sector
    for i in range(max_points):
        phi = theta_center + (i / max_points) * angle_width
        # Map to the unit circle point
        point = cmath.exp(1j * phi)
        points.append(point)
    return points

max_points_cond1 = 200
max_points_cond2 = 120
sector_width_cond1 = math.pi  # sector length for cond1
sector_width_cond2 = math.pi / 3  # for cond2

# Sample multiple central angles to cover the circle
angle_samples = [0, math.pi/4, math.pi/2, 3*math.pi/4, math.pi]

for theta_center in angle_samples:
    # Generate candidate points for f in the first constraint (cond1)
    f_candidates = generate_points_in_sector(theta_center, sector_width_cond1, min(10, max_points_cond1))
    # Generate candidate points for f in the second constraint (cond2)
    g_candidates = generate_points_in_sector(theta_center, sector_width_cond2, min(10, max_points_cond2))
    
    # Construct functions by assigning points from these candidates
    # For simplicity, assign all points in the first sector (or skip if too many)
    # We attempt to generate sums with different combinations
    for subset_size_cond1 in range(1, min(10, max_points_cond1)+1):
        for subset_size_cond2 in range(1, min(10, max_points_cond2)+1):
            # Sum of selected points
            sum_f = sum(f_candidates[:subset_size_cond1], start=0)
            sum_g = sum(g_candidates[:subset_size_cond2], start=0)
            total_sum = sum_f + sum_g
            magnitude = abs(total_sum)
            print(f"θ = {theta_center:.2f}, cond1 points = {subset_size_cond1}, cond2 points = {subset_size_cond2}")
            print(f"Sum magnitude: {magnitude:.3f}")
```

This code enumerates various structured functions complying with the constraints, printing out their sum magnitudes. Through this sampling, one can observe approximate extremal behaviors and refine hypotheses about the maximal sum magnitude under the given constraints.
