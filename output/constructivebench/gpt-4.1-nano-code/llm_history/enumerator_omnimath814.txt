This problem involves large expressions with multiple nested square roots. Since the goal is to conjecture or approximate the ratio A / B, a practical approach is to assign simplified numerical approximations to the radical expressions and compute the ratio for those small sample values. To ensure accuracy and stream the results immediately, we can try several simple approximations, using rational multiples or floating-point approximations, and examine the ratio.

The code will:
- Define the nested radical expressions explicitly.
- Use approximate floating-point values for the radicals.
- Compute the ratio A / B.
- Print the computed ratio each time.

Since the problem aims at exploring possible answers, we'll try a few candidate approximations and see what ratios they produce.

```python
# Enumerate approximate values of the radical expressions
import math

# Define approximate values for radicals
sqrt2 = math.sqrt(2)
sqrt3 = math.sqrt(3)
sqrt6 = math.sqrt(6)

# Define the factors A and B based on the given expressions
A_factor = (1 + 2*sqrt2 + 3*sqrt3 + 6*sqrt6) * \
           (2 + 6*sqrt2 + sqrt3 + 3*sqrt6) * \
           (3 + sqrt2 + 6*sqrt3 + 2*sqrt6) * \
           (6 + 3*sqrt2 + 2*sqrt3 + sqrt6)

B_factor = (1 + 3*sqrt2 + 2*sqrt3 + 6*sqrt6) * \
           (2 + sqrt2 + 6*sqrt3 + 3*sqrt6) * \
           (3 + 6*sqrt2 + sqrt3 + 2*sqrt6) * \
           (6 + 2*sqrt2 + 3*sqrt3 + sqrt6)

# Compute the ratio A / B
ratio = A_factor / B_factor

print("Approximate ratio A / B:", ratio)
```

This code computes a single approximate ratio for the expressions with floating-point radicals. To explore multiple candidates, you could vary the approximation further or test other rational approximations, but given the problem's complexity, this provides a very close estimate to conjecture the ratio's value.
