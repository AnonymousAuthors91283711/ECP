[write_program]
The problem appears to involve an additive function \( f \) over natural numbers, with a particular focus on the set of \( n \) where \( f \) behaves symmetrically, and the characterization of \( f \) using parameters \( p \) and \( c \). To facilitate exploration, I will write a program that enumerates possible functions for small parameters and checks the properties, especially focusing on the if-and-only-if statement involving primes.

Since the original code involves advanced math and formal proof language, I will create a simplified Python version that enumerates potential solutions consistent with the problem's specifications—particularly candidate functions with parameters \( p \) and \( c \).

The code will:
- Use small primes \( p \).
- Generate candidate functions \( f(n) \) based on parameters.
- Check the symmetry set condition.
- Print the candidates immediately as they are found.

```python
# Enumerate small primes for p
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5)+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

primes = [p for p in range(2, 20) if is_prime(p)]

# Explore small non-zero c
cs = [c for c in range(1, 10)]

# Generate candidate functions based on parameters p, c
# For simplicity, define an example candidate: f(n) = c * n mod p
def candidate_function(n, p, c):
    return (c * n) % p

# Check the symmetry condition: set of n where ∀ k < n, f(k) = f(n - k) is infinite
def symmetry_set_infinite(p, c):
    # For small p and c, test n up to a certain range
    max_n = 50
    sym_set = []
    for n in range(1, max_n):
        symmetric = True
        for k in range(n):
            if candidate_function(k, p, c) != candidate_function(n - k, p, c):
                symmetric = False
                break
        if symmetric:
            sym_set.append(n)
    return len(sym_set) == max_n - 1  # If all n in range satisfy property

# Enumerate all possibilities
for p in primes:
    for c in cs:
        if symmetry_set_infinite(p, c):
            print(f"p={p}, c={c}: symmetric set condition holds (infinite in testing range).")
```
