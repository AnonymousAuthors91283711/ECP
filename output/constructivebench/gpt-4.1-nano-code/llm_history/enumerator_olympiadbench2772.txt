The problem involves finding the smallest natural number greater than 2023 such that the sum of its decimal digits equals 17. The theorem states that the answer is the least such number.

To assist in conjecturing and verifying this, I'll write a Python script that enumerates numbers greater than 2023, checks their digit sum, and outputs candidates immediately. I'll limit the search to numbers up to a specific threshold, say 3000, since the smallest number greater than 2023 with digit sum 17 should be relatively close.

This helps identify the minimal candidate without hard-coding the answer.

```python
# Enumerate numbers greater than 2023, check their digit sum for equality to 17
start = 2024
end = 3000  # set an upper bound for search

for n in range(start, end + 1):
    digit_sum = sum(int(d) for d in str(n))
    if digit_sum == 17:
        print(n)
```
