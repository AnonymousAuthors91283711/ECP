The problem appears to involve finding natural numbers \(a\) such that when you manipulate their decimal digits in a certain way, you get a relation involving their square \(a^2\), and with some cyclic digit shifting involved. To explore this, I will enumerate small values of \(a\), check the involved conditions, and identify candidates satisfying these relations.

Specifically:
- For each \(a\) up to a certain limit, compute \(b = \) number formed by digits of \(a\),
- then \(c = b^2\),
- digit-shift \(c\) to produce \(d\),
- verify whether \(d = a^2\),
- collect all \(a\) satisfying the condition.

This approach should help conjecture the possible answers.

```python
# Python code to find all a (up to 10000) such that
# digit manipulation involving their squares satisfies the given condition.

def digits(n):
    return list(map(int, str(n)))

def ofDigits(d_list):
    return int(''.join(map(str, d_list)))

max_a = 10000
answers = []

for a in range(1, max_a + 1):
    a_digits = digits(a)
    # b: number formed by digits of a
    b = ofDigits(a_digits)
    c = b ** 2
    c_digits = digits(c)
    if not c_digits:
        continue
    # d: shift last digit of c to front
    d_digits = c_digits[-1:] + c_digits[:-1]
    d = ofDigits(d_digits)
    if d == a ** 2:
        answers.append(a)
        print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}")
        
# Optional: print the conjectured set of solutions
print("Candidates satisfying the condition:", answers)
```
