. Enumerated answers: 30. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Since \( f \) is linear, \( f x = m x + b \), and from the given \( f 6 - f 2 = 12 \), we have \( (m * 6 + b) - (m * 2 + b) = 12 \), simplifying to \( 4 m = 12 \Rightarrow m = 3 \). Therefore, \( f x = 3 x + b \), and the difference \( f 12 - f 2 = (3 * 12 + b) - (3 * 2 + b) = 36 - 6 = 30 \). Final answer: 

<<<30>>>
