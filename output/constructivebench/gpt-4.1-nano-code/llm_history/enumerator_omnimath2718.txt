[write_program]
This appears to be a formal theorem statement in Lean, not a typical Python problem. However, your request is to write a Python program that can enumerate possible answers to help with a math problem involving parameters. 

If I interpret the core of the problem, it looks like there's an equation:
\[ 3 - 5 + 7 = 6 - x \]
which simplifies to:
\[ (3 - 5 + 7) = 6 - x \]

We want to solve for \( x \). The exact solution is:
\[ x = 6 - (3 - 5 + 7) \]

Let's write a Python program that enumerates integers \( x \) around that expected value, printing answers immediately, and finding the exact answer.

```python
# Solve the equation 3 - 5 + 7 = 6 - x
# Simplify the left side
left_value = 3 - 5 + 7  # equals 5

# Exact solution for x
exact_x = 6 - left_value  # equals 6 - 5 = 1
print(f"x = {exact_x}")  # stream the exact answer immediately

# To mimic enumeration and confirm, check a small range around the answer
for x_candidate in range(exact_x - 2, exact_x + 3):
    if 6 - x_candidate == left_value:
        print(f"Candidate answer: x = {x_candidate}")
```
