This problem involves complex numbers, roots of unity, coprimality, and trigonometric functions. We are searching for integers m, n, and complex numbers z, w satisfying certain algebraic relations, with the key being the value of n, which appears in a sine function, and is tied to possible roots of unity.

Approach:
- We look for small integers n, coprime with m, such that the sine value corresponds to an angle related to m/n.
- The key equations involve z^13 = w, w^11 = z, and z's imaginary part is sin(mπ/n).  
- From the equations:
  - z^13 = w
  - w^11 = z
  Combining:
  - z^{13 * 11} = z ⇒ z^{143} = z
  - So z^{142} = 1 ⇒ z is a 142nd root of unity or zero.
  - Since we're talking about roots of unity, assume z ≠ 0, so z is a 142nd root of unity.
- The imaginary part of z is sin(mπ/n).  
- For z to have imaginary part equal to sin(mπ/n), and z = e^{iθ} for some θ, then Im(z) = sin(θ).

Let's systematically:
- For small n, check coprime m, 1 ≤ m < n, and verify whether sin(mπ/n) can match the imaginary part of some root of unity z satisfying the algebraic relations.

Because z is a 142nd root of unity (from Z^{142} = 1), the imaginary part varies as sin(kπ/142) for k=1..142.

We seek sin(mπ/n) corresponding to some sine value of a root of unity, i.e., sin(kπ/142) for some k.

Let's limit n to small values, like 1..19, and check these relationships. Since the problem asks to assign and output the answer for `n`, and `n` appears as `P2012AIMEI_6_answer`, we'll try small coprime pairs.

Let's implement the enumeration for small n, m coprime to n, and check whether sin(mπ/n) matches sin(kπ/142) for some k.

We will store minimal n satisfying the conditions, and for demonstration, pick small n values.

```python
import math

# Since the imaginary part of z is sin(mπ/n), and z's imaginary part can also be sin(kπ/142),
# we try small n and m coprime, then check whether sin(mπ/n) ≈ sin(kπ/142).

# We look for n, m, k such that sin(mπ/n) ≈ sin(kπ/142), which implies
# m/n ≈ k/142 (modulo sine symmetry).

# We consider a small threshold for approximate equality
epsilon = 1e-6

# Store the best candidate for n (smallest n satisfying the conditions)
candidate_n = None

# We try small values of n up to 20
for n in range(2, 20):
    for m in range(1, n):
        if math.gcd(m, n) == 1:
            target_angle = m * math.pi / n
            target_sin = math.sin(target_angle)
            # Check for some k in 1..142
            for k in range(1, 143):
                k_angle = k * math.pi / 142
                k_sin = math.sin(k_angle)
                if abs(target_sin - k_sin) < epsilon:
                    # Found a candidate
                    print(f"n={n}, m={m}, k={k}, sin({m}π/{n}) ≈ sin({k}π/142)")
                    candidate_n = n
                    # We can break as soon as we find one for minimal n
                    break
            if candidate_n == n:
                break
    if candidate_n == n:
        break

# Assign the found n to the answer
if candidate_n is not None:
    # Print the answer for P2012AIMEI_6_answer
    print(f"Found candidate n = {candidate_n}")
else:
    # fallback if none found
    candidate_n = 1  # default minimal value
    print(f"No suitable n found in range, defaulting to {candidate_n}")

# Set the answer as the found n
abbrev_P2012AIMEI_6_answer = candidate_n
