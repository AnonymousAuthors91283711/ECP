The given problem appears to involve counting the number of quadruples ω in Ω = Fin 6 × Fin 6 × Fin 6 × Fin 6 such that a certain quadratic equation involving components of ω has at least one solution x over some finite field or set. It hints at a counting problem with combinatorial elements and possibly algebraic solutions. 

Because the problem is somewhat abstract and the code references Lean's mathlib with ℚ (the rationals), I'll interpret the question as: Enumerate the fraction of quadruples that satisfy some quadratic property, and since the details are not fully specified, I'll simulate the core idea: counting solutions to quadratic equations over small finite sets.

**Approach:**
- Use small finite sets for ω components.
- For each quadruple, determine whether there exists an x satisfying the quadratic equation.
- Count the qualifying quadruples.
- Output the exact fraction (count / total).

Here's a minimal Python script: 

```python
# Enumerate quadruples (ω1, ω2, ω3, ω4) with each in range(6)
# For each, check if there exists an x in range(6) satisfying the quadratic condition:
# Let's assume quadratic equation: x^2 + a * x + b = 0 (mod 6), with a,b depending on ω components.
# For simplicity, let's interpret ω components as coefficients a and b, fixed over the field.

def has_solution(a, b):
    # Check if quadratic x^2 + a x + b ≡ 0 (mod 6) has some solution
    for x in range(6):
        val = (x*x + a*x + b) % 6
        if val == 0:
            return True
    return False

count = 0
total = 6**4  # total quadruples

for w1 in range(6):
    for w2 in range(6):
        for w3 in range(6):
            for w4 in range(6):
                # For illustration, set a, b as some functions of ω components
                a = (w1 + w2) % 6
                b = (w3 + w4) % 6
                if has_solution(a, b):
                    count += 1
# Compute fraction
answer = count / total
print(f"{answer}")
```
