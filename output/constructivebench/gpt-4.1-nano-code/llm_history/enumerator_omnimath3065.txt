The problem involves finding an integer answer to satisfy the equation \(2 \times 3 \times 4 = 6 \times \text{answer}\). Simplifying, \(2 \times 3 \times 4 = 24\), so answer must be \(24 / 6 = 4\).

To assist in conjecturing and verifying, let's write a Python script that enumerates candidate answers close to possible solutions, checks the exact division, and outputs the answer when it matches.

```python
# Enumerate candidate answers and check the equation 2*3*4 = 6*answer
# Since 2*3*4=24, answer=24/6=4
for answer in range(0, 20):  # small range for demonstration
    if 6 * answer == 24:
        print(answer)  # output exact integer answer as soon as it's found
```
