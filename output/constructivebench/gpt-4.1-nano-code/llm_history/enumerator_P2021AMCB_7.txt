This problem appears to involve calculating sums over divisors of a particular number, distinguishing between odd and even divisors, and then forming a ratio of these sums. To assist in conjecturing or approximating the answer, I will enumerate divisors of the given number, separate odd and even divisors, and compute their sums. Given the large factorization, careful optimization is necessary, but since the number is taillored for a high school or early college level, we'll implement an efficient divisor enumeration by prime factorization.

The number \(N = 34 \times 34 \times 63 \times 270\).  
Prime factorization:
- 34 = 2 × 17
- 34 = 2 × 17 (again)
- 63 = 3^2 × 7
- 270 = 2 × 3^3 × 5

Thus:
\[
N = (2 \times 17)^2 \times 3^2 \times 7 \times 2 \times 3^3 \times 5
\]

Let's combine:
\[
N = 2^{(2+1)} \times 17^2 \times 3^{(2+3)} \times 7^1 \times 5^1
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
N = 2^{3} \times 17^{2} \times 3^{5} \times 7^{1} \times 5^{1}
\]

Now, for divisor enumeration:
- For primes 2^a, a in [0,3]
- For 17^b, b in [0,2]
- For 3^c, c in [0,5]
- For 7^d, d in [0,1]
- For 5^e, e in [0,1]

We enumerate all possible combinations via nested loops and check the parity of divisors.

Here's the implementation:

```python
# Enumerate divisors based on prime factorization and sum odd/even divisors
n_factors = {
    2: 3,
    17: 2,
    3: 5,
    7: 1,
    5: 1
}

sum_odd_divisors = 0
sum_even_divisors = 0

# Generate all combinations of exponents
for a in range(n_factors[2] + 1):
    for b in range(n_factors[17] + 1):
        for c in range(n_factors[3] + 1):
            for d in range(n_factors[7] + 1):
                for e in range(n_factors[5] + 1):
                    divisor = (2 ** a) * (17 ** b) * (3 ** c) * (7 ** d) * (5 ** e)
                    if divisor % 2 == 1:
                        print(f"Odd divisor: {divisor}")
                        sum_odd_divisors += divisor
                    else:
                        print(f"Even divisor: {divisor}")
                        sum_even_divisors += divisor

# Compute the ratio
if sum_even_divisors != 0:
    ratio = sum_odd_divisors / sum_even_divisors
    print(f"Ratio of sums: {ratio}")
else:
    print("No even divisors found.")
```
