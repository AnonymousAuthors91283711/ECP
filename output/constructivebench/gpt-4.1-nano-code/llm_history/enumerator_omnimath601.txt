This problem involves complex numbers, roots of unity, and rational functions. The key is to find all complex \( s \) such that there exists an \( r \) with \( s = \frac{1}{1 - r} \) and \( r^{2013} = \frac{1}{2013^{2013}} \).

Since \( r^{2013} = \frac{1}{2013^{2013}} \), \( r \) must be a 2013-th root of \( \frac{1}{2013^{2013}} \). The 2013-th roots of this number are
\[
r = \left(\frac{1}{2013^{2013}}\right)^{1/2013} \cdot \omega
= \frac{1}{2013} \cdot \omega
\]
where \( \omega^{2013} = 1 \), i.e., \( \omega \) is a 2013-th root of unity.

Thus, the set of all \( r \) is:
\[
r_k = \frac{1}{2013} e^{2\pi i k / 2013} \quad \text{for} \quad k=0,1,\dots,2012
\]

Each \( s \) is generated via \( s = \frac{1}{1 - r} \).

Our goal is to enumerate all distinct \( s \). We will generate these and print them directly.

```python
import math
import cmath

# Number of roots
N = 2013

# Generate all roots of unity
roots_of_unity = [cmath.exp(2j * math.pi * k / N) for k in range(N)]

# Compute corresponding s values
answers = set()
for omega in roots_of_unity:
    r = (1 / 2013) * omega
    s = 1 / (1 - r)  # s = 1 / (1 - r)
    # Store the answer with rounded precision to avoid floating point duplicates
    s_real = round(s.real, 15)
    s_imag = round(s.imag, 15)
    s_tuple = (s_real, s_imag)
    if s_tuple not in answers:
        answers.add(s_tuple)
        print(f"s = {s_real} + {s_imag}j")
```
