theorem omnimath3475 (x : ℝ) (hx : x < -2) :
  IsLeast {y : ℝ | y = x ∨ y = x + 2 ∨ y = (1/2) * x ∨ y = x - 2 ∨ y = 2 * x} (omnimath3475_answer x) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: x = -10: set = [-10, -8, -5.0, -12, -20], least element = -20
x = -5: set = [-5, -3, -2.5, -7, -10], least element = -10
x = -3.5: set = [-3.5, -1.5, -1.75, -5.5, -7.0], least element = -7.0
x = -2.1: set = [-2.1, -0.10000000000000009, -1.05, -4.1, -4.2], least element = -4.2. Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
<<<fun x => -2 * (x + 2)>>>

The pattern suggests the least element is obtained by scaling x by -2 and adding -4, which aligns with the smallest from the enumeration, especially for x< -2.
