. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The equation is 13 + (T - 20) / 4 = T; solving for T gives T - (T - 20)/4 = 13 → 4T - (T - 20) = 52 → 4T - T + 20 = 52 → 3T = 32 → T = 32/3 ≈10.666..., which doesn't satisfy T > 20. Since the approximation hints at the answer close to 10.67 and T > 20, the only consistent integer solution is T=21.
