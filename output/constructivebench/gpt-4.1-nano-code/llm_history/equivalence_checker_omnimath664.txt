Ground Truth Answer: (-7) / 16
Proposed Answer: (1/2 : ℂ)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the sum of squares of all distinct roots of a given 10th degree polynomial.

2. The ground truth answer is -7/16, which is a rational number expressed as a complex number.

3. The proposed answer is 1/2, which is different from -7/16.

4. To verify, we can use Vieta's formulas. For a polynomial p(X) = aₙXⁿ + ... + a₀, the sum of roots is -a_{n-1}/a_n. Here, the sum of roots would be 7/4.

5. The sum of squares of roots is (sum of roots)² - 2*(sum of product of roots two at a time). Calculating this would indeed give us -7/16, not 1/2.

The proposed answer is incorrect.
