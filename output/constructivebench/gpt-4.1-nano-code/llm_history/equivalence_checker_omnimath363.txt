Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (2 * n - 1)!!
Proposed Answer: fun n => n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) / 6
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding a closed-form expression for a sum of products of a sequence a(i) with certain constraints.

2. The ground truth answer uses double factorial (!!), which for odd numbers means (2n-1)!! = 1×3×5×...×(2n-1).

3. The proposed answer gives a cubic polynomial in n (n(n+1)(2n+1)/6), which is actually the formula for the sum of squares of first n natural numbers.

4. These are clearly different functions:
- For n=1: ground truth gives 1, proposed gives 1
- For n=2: ground truth gives 3, proposed gives 5
- For n=3: ground truth gives 15, proposed gives 14

The answers diverge starting from n=2, and have completely different growth rates (super-exponential vs cubic).
