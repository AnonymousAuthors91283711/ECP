The problem seems to involve two disjoint groups within a set of n=30 individuals: one group called huggers with size k=20, and another called handshakers with size m=10. The expression to be maximized or analyzed is:

(number of handshakes among handshakers) + (number of handshakes between handshakers and huggers)  
= (m*(m-1))/2 + m*k

Given the parameters, the possible answers depend on the specific configuration of who is a hugger or handshaker, with the constraints:

- |huggers| = k = 20
- |handshakers| = m = 10
- Disjoint sets

Assuming the goal is to enumerate combinations that satisfy these conditions, focusing on the total number of handshakes involved.

Below is a Python script that enumerates all possible counts of handshakes of the described form and tracks their maximum. The main goal is to provide potential answers to help in conjecture and proof, streaming each candidate.

```python
# Enumerate all possible configurations given small parameters
# and compute the total handshake counts as specified.

# Parameters
n = 30
k = 20
m = 10

# Since sets are disjoint and sizes fixed, the total number of ways
# to choose huggers and handshakers are combinatorial, but for enumeration purposes,
# we focus on handshake counts.

max_handshakes = -1
answers = []

# For all possible overlaps (since sets are disjoint, overlap = 0)
# The handshake counts are based on fixed sizes, so only one configuration
# per the sizes, but the actual counts are fixed:
handshakes_among_handshakers = (m * (m - 1)) // 2
handshakes_between_groups = m * k

total_handshakes = handshakes_among_handshakers + handshakes_between_groups

# Outputting the total handshake count
print(total_handshakes)
```
