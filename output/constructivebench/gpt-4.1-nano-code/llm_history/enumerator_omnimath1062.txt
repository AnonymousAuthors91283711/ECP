This problem involves evaluating a sum involving powers of 2, an alternating sign depending on the number of 1's in the binary representation of n, and then multiplying by 1/255. The summation runs from n=0 to 15 (since Finset.range 16). The key is to understand the sum:

\[
\sum_{n=0}^{15} 2^n (-1)^{s(n)}
\]

where \(s(n)\) counts the number of 1’s in the binary expansion of n.

Let's decompose the sum: each term depends on the binary representation of n, and we observe that:

\[
\sum_{n=0}^{15} 2^n (-1)^{s(n)}
\]

can be viewed as the expansion of a product over bits since each binary digit independently contributes to the overall sum.

Noticing that:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{3} (1 + (-1)^{b_k} 2^{2^k})
\]

— over all subsets of 4 bits (since 15 in binary is 1111) — may produce the sum, but more straightforwardly, because n is from 0 to 15, and the sum involves binary operations, let's interpret the sum in terms of:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{3} (1 + (-1)^{b_k} 2^{b_k})
\]

when summing over all binary strings of length 4, this resembles the expansion of a product, leading to a closed form.

Alternatively, to concretely evaluate the sum, we can directly enumerate all n from 0 to 15, compute the sum, then divide by 255, and output the exact value.

```python
# Enumerate n from 0 to 15
# for each n, compute s(n): number of 1 bits in binary representation
# sum the terms 2^n * (-1)^s(n)
# finally, divide the sum by 255 to get the answer

def count_ones(n):
    return bin(n).count('1')

total_sum = 0
for n in range(16):
    s_n = count_ones(n)
    term = (2 ** n) * ((-1) ** s_n)
    print(f"n={n}, s(n)={s_n}, term={term}")
    total_sum += term

result = total_sum / 255
print("Computed sum:", total_sum)
print("Result (sum / 255):", result)
```
