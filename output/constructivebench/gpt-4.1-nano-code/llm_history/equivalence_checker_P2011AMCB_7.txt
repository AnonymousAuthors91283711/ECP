Ground Truth Answer: fun (x, y) => x / y
Proposed Answer: fun p : ℕ × ℕ => (p.fst + p.snd) / 2.
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find the maximum value of x/y where x and y are two-digit numbers (10-99) whose average is 60.

2. The ground truth answer correctly gives the ratio x/y as the solution.

3. The proposed answer gives the average (x+y)/2 instead of the ratio x/y.

4. The average is always 60 by the problem's condition (hmean), so this doesn't help find the maximum ratio.

5. The maximum ratio occurs when x is as large as possible and y is as small as possible while maintaining (x+y)/2=60. This would be x=99, y=21, giving ratio 99/21.

The proposed answer is completely different from what's being asked (ratio vs average), so they are not equivalent.
