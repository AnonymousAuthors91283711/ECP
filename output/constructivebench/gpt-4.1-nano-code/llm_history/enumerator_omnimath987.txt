The theorem seeks to find the greatest natural number \( n \) such that there exists a finite type \( V \) with \( \text{card } V = n \), and an edge relation \( E \) satisfying a specific cyclical pattern akin to a directed 3-cycle or triangle configuration with particular edge orientations. To guess the maximum \( n \), we need to explore small finite sets and check if such arrangements exist, focusing on small sizes to ensure efficiency.

We'll:
- Iterate over small finite types of sizes from 1 up to, say, 7.
- For each size, enumerate possible directed graphs (relations) on these vertices.
- Check if the relation satisfies the recurrent pattern outlined.
- Stream solutions when found.
- Keep track of the largest found \( n \).

This approach relies on small explicitly generated graphs because arbitrary enumeration of all relations is exponential but manageable at small sizes.

```python
import itertools

def check_pattern(n):
    # Create all possible directed edges (E) combinations
    vertices = range(n)
    for edges_bits in range(1 << (n * n)):
        E = [[False]*n for _ in range(n)]
        bits = edges_bits
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                if i != j:
                    E[i][j] = (bits & 1) == 1
                    bits >>= 1
        # Check the pattern condition for all triples
        for A in vertices:
            for B in vertices:
                for C in vertices:
                    if len({A, B, C}) == 3:
                        cond1 = E[A][B] and not E[B][C] and not E[C][A]
                        cond2 = not E[A][B] and E[B][C] and not E[C][A]
                        cond3 = not E[A][B] and not E[B][C] and E[C][A]
                        if not (cond1 or cond2 or cond3):
                            break
                else:
                    continue
                break
            else:
                continue
            break
        else:
            return n  # Found a relation satisfying the pattern
    return None

max_n_found = 0
for size in range(1, 8):  # Search sizes up to 7
    result = check_pattern(size)
    if result is not None:
        print(f"Found pattern for size {size}")
        max_n_found = size

print(f"Maximum n satisfying the pattern is {max_n_found}")
```
