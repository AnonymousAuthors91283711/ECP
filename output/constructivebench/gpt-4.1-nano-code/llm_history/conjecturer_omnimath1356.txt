theorem omnimath1356 : 
  (∑ i in Finset.range 2016, 2^i / 25) % 100 = omnimath1356_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 21. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The sum of \( 2^i \) over \( i \in [0, 2015] \) divided by 25, modulo 100, is derived from the geometric series \( \frac{2^{2016} - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^{2016} - 1 \). Since \( 2^{2016} \equiv 0 \pmod{25} \) (by Fermat's little theorem, as 25 divides \( 2^{20} - 1 \)), the sum simplifies to \( (2^{2016} - 1)/25 \equiv 21 \pmod{100} \).

Answer:
<<<21>>>
