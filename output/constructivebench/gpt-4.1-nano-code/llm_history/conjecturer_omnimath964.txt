theorem omnimath964 : 
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ ∀ m : ℕ, ∃ s : Finset (Fin n), (∏ x in s, (x.val + 1)) ≡ m [MOD 100]} 
  omnimath964_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: N = 17 covers all residues modulo 100. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests that for coverage of all residues modulo 100, the minimal n is 17, as per the enumerated answer.
