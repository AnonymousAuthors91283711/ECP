The problem appears to involve finding the minimal value of \(a_2 = a_0 + 2d\) under certain conditions involving arithmetic progressions and logarithms. The constraints involve natural numbers \(a_0, d\), with positive differences, and a relationship involving \(\log_2(a_0 + 7d)\).

Given the nature of the problem, I will enumerate small values for \(a_0\) and \(d\), check the conditions, and compute \(a_2 = a_0 + 2d\). The goal is to find the minimal such \(a_2\) for which all the conditions hold, as the theorem says "IsLeast".

**Approach:**
- Iterate over small values of \(a_0\) and \(d\).
- Check the inequalities and conditions step by step.
- When the conditions are met, output \(a_2\).
- Keep track of the least \(a_2\) found.

This enumeration ensures correctness for small parameters, suitable for High School level mathematics, and stays within 400 tokens.

```python
import math

def check_conditions(a0, d):
    if d <= 0 or a0 <= 0:
        return False, None
    a2 = a0 + 2 * d
    # Check the inequality: a0 + n * d < a0 + (n + 1) * d for all n, trivially true for d > 0
    # Now check the logarithmic condition:
    # a0 + 7d - 27 = log2(a0 + 7d)
    x = a0 + 7 * d
    if x <= 0:
        return False, None
    log_x = math.log2(x)
    # Check if a0 + 7d - 27 == log2(a0 + 7d)
    if abs((a0 + 7 * d) - 27 - log_x) > 1e-9:
        return False, None
    return True, a2

min_a2 = None
for a0 in range(1, 100):  # small range for enumeration
    for d in range(1, 100):
        valid, a2 = check_conditions(a0, d)
        if valid:
            print(f"Found candidate: a0={a0}, d={d}, a2={a2}")
            if (min_a2 is None) or (a2 < min_a2):
                min_a2 = a2

if min_a2 is not None:
    print(f"The minimal a2 satisfying conditions is {min_a2}")
else:
    print("No candidate found within range.")
```
