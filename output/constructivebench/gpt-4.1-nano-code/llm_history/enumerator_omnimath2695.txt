[write_program]
The problem appears to define some real numbers `x` and `v`, with `x` constrained to be 2 and `v` related to `x`. It then asks to evaluate the expression \( 2v - 5 - (2x - 5) \). Our task is to compute this expression with the given conditions.

The steps:
- Given \( x = 2 \),
- \( v = 3 \times x = 3 \times 2 = 6 \),
- Calculate \( 2v - 5 - (2x - 5) \).

So the answer is:

\[
2 \times 6 - 5 - (2 \times 2 - 5) = 12 - 5 - (4 - 5) = 7 - (-1) = 8
\]

The program will enumerate these directly, produce the answer, and assign it to `omnimath2695_answer`.

```python
# Enumerate the values based on given conditions
x = 2
v = 3 * x
result = 2 * v - 5 - (2 * x - 5)
print(result)
# Assign answer
omnimath2695_answer = result
```
