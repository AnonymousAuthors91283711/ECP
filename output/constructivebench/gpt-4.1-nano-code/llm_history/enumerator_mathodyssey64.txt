The problem involves complex geometric and algebraic relations, specifically involving hyperbolas, affine maps, and points on these curves. To approach this, I will:

- Fix sample values for the parameters `a`, `b` that satisfy the given relations.
- Use these to compute candidate values for `x` or interpret the relations to approximate `mathodyssey64_answer`.
- Since the instructions specify streaming results and prioritizing exact over approximate values, I will focus on representing key algebraic solutions with small, manageable sample values.

Given the problem's complexity, a pragmatic approach is to select small positive values for `a` and `b`, then compute the corresponding potential values for `m + n`. I will examine the primary hyperbola relation `(3/a)^2 - (sqrt 2 / b)^2 = 1`, and find concrete `(a, b)` pairs satisfying this.

Here's the Python code implementing this approach:

```python
# This script enumerates candidate answers for the complex geometric relations
# by sampling small positive values of a and b satisfying the hyperbola relation,
# then computes corresponding m + n values based on the simplified geometric assumptions.

import math

def enumerate_candidates():
    # Set small sample values for a and b
    sample_as = [0.5, 1.0, 1.5]
    sample_bs = [0.5, 1.0, 1.5]

    for a in sample_as:
        for b in sample_bs:
            # Check if the hyperbola relation holds approximately
            lhs = (3 / a) ** 2 - (math.sqrt(2) / b) ** 2
            if abs(lhs - 1) < 1e-6:
                # For these a, b, compute candidate m + n based on simplified relations
                # Assume the points on the hyperbola at x = a + delta, y evaluated accordingly
                # Here, for simplicity, consider xA and xB at x = a + 0.1 and x = a + 0.2
                xA = a + 0.1
                yA = (a**2 + b**2 - xA**2) ** 0.5  # approximate y on circle x^2 + y^2 = 4
                xB = a + 0.2
                yB = (4 - xB**2) ** 0.5
                # compute m and n as difference ratios (simplified assumption)
                m = (yA - 0) / (xA - 0) if xA != 0 else 0
                n = (yB - 0) / (xB - 0) if xB != 0 else 0
                total = m + n
                print(f"a={a}, b={b}, m+n={total}")
                yield total

# Enumerate and print candidate answers
for answer in enumerate_candidates():
    print(answer)
```

This code evaluates small sample parameter sets, checks the hyperbola relation, and reports approximate sums of slopes `m + n` that could correspond to the geometric configuration, helping to generate conjectures about the value of `mathodyssey64_answer`.
