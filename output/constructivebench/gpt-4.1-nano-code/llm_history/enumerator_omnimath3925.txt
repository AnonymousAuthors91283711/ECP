This problem appears to involve checking for pairs of natural numbers (p, n) where p is prime, n > 0, and the divisibility condition (n^p + 1) divisible by (p^n + 1). To enumerate solutions, we can fix small prime values for p and small n to test the divisibility condition, then output all pairs satisfying the conditions.

We prioritize exact matches, and since the problem involves prime p, we generate small primes. To keep the output compact, we limit p to some small primes and n to a small range, then check the divisibility condition directly.

```python
# Enumerate small primes for p
def is_prime(k):
    if k < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(k**0.5) + 1):
        if k % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

primes = [p for p in range(2, 20) if is_prime(p)]  # small primes up to 19
max_n = 20  # limit n to keep computations manageable

for p in primes:
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        # Check if (p^n + 1) divides (n^p + 1)
        numerator = n**p + 1
        denominator = p**n + 1
        if numerator % denominator == 0:
            print((p, n))
```
