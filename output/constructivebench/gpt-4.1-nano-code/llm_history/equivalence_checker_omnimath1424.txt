Ground Truth Answer: 738826
Proposed Answer: (8 * factorial 9) / 4 + (4 * factorial 7) / 2 + 4 * factorial 6 + 4 * factorial 4 + factorial 3 + factorial 2 + factorial 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step:

1. The original expression is:
   8 * (factorial 9) / (2 * 2) + 4 * (factorial 7) / 2 + 4 * (factorial 6) + 
   4 * (factorial 4) + (factorial 3) + (factorial 2) + (factorial 2)

2. The proposed answer rewrites this as:
   (8 * factorial 9) / 4 + (4 * factorial 7) / 2 + 4 * factorial 6 + 4 * factorial 4 + factorial 3 + factorial 2 + factorial 2

3. Key observations:
   - (2 * 2) simplifies to 4, so the first term is equivalent
   - All other terms are identical in both expressions
   - The order of operations is preserved
   - The ground truth value (738826) would be the same for both expressions

The proposed answer is mathematically equivalent to the original expression, just with a minor simplification in the denominator of the first term.
