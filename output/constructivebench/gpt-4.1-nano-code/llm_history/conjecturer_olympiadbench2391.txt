abbrev olympiadbench2391_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem olympiadbench2391 (n : ℕ) :
    n^2 - 10 * n + 70 = 5 + 10 * (n - 1) ↔ n ∈ olympiadbench2391_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 5
15
. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
<<<{ n | n = 5 ∨ n = 15 }>>>
This set contains integers satisfying the equation, which simplifies to n = 5 or n = 15.
