. Enumerated answers: 0.3333333333333337. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Based on the pattern in enumerated answers and the typical trigonometric identities involved, the answer simplifies to a constant value related to the cosine difference that matches the enumerated decimal. The value 1/3 is consistent with known cosine difference identities when summing sines and cosines. Therefore:

<<<1 / 3>>>
