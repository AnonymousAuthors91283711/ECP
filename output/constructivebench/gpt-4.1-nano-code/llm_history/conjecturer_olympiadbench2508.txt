. Enumerated answers: 6.5. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The expression (2×x+1)/x simplifies to 2 + 1/x; setting y = f((2x+1)/x), the relation becomes y = x + 6. From the functional equation, for x ≠ 0, f(2 + 1/x) = x + 6, implying a linear relation. Substituting back and solving yields a constant value at the specific argument 4, corresponding to the inverse relation. The answer is constant and independent of x, giving the value 6.5.
