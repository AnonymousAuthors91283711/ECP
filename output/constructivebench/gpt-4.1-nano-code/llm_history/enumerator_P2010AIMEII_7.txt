This problem involves analyzing a cubic polynomial with complex roots shifted by specific values, and relating the roots to the coefficients \( a, b, c \). The key is to use Vieta's formulas and the conditions on roots to find the sum \( a + b + c \). Since the problem is a high-school competition level, I will choose small sample parameters and systematically examine possible roots, then derive the potential value of \( |a + b + c| \). 

To make the enumeration manageable and efficient, I will:
- Fix candidate values for the root \( w \) (e.g., small integers),
- Check the conditions on roots,
- Record the corresponding \( a, b, c \),
- Compute \( a + b + c \).

The answer asks for \( |a+b+c| \). The code will print all candidate values encountered during enumeration and then suggest the extremal value (which in such problems, is often a particular integer or rational number).

```python
# Enumerate small integer values for w
# For each w, derive roots as given: w+3i, w+9i, 2w-4
# Use Vieta's formulas to compute coefficients
# Check for consistency and record |a+b+c|
# The code does not solve symbolically; instead, it approximates by sampling.

import cmath

# Candidate values for w (small integers)
w_values = range(-5, 6)

results = []

for w_int in w_values:
    w = complex(w_int, 0)
    root1 = w + 3j
    root2 = w + 9j
    root3 = 2 * w - 4
    
    # Sum of roots (Vieta): root1 + root2 + root3 = -a
    sum_roots = root1 + root2 + root3
    # Product of roots: root1*root2*root3 = -c
    product_roots = root1 * root2 * root3
    
    # Sum of pairwise products (Vieta): root1*root2 + root2*root3 + root3*root1 = b
    sum_pairwise = (root1*root2 + root2*root3 + root3*root1)
    
    a = -sum_roots.real
    b = sum_pairwise.real
    c = -product_roots.real
    
    sum_abc = a + b + c
    # Store the absolute value
    results.append(abs(sum_abc))
    print(f"w={w_int}: |a+b+c|={abs(sum_abc):.2f}")

# Report the minimal and maximal candidate found
min_val = min(results)
max_val = max(results)
print(f"Minimal |a+b+c|: {min_val:.2f}")
print(f"Maximum |a+b+c|: {max_val:.2f}")
```
