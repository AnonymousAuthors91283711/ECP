theorem omnimath1348
(P : Polynomial ℝ)
(hP1 : P.eval 1 = 1)
(hP : ∀ x : ℝ, x ≠ -7 → (P.eval (2 * x)) / (P.eval (x + 1)) = 8 - 56 / (x + 7))
: (P.eval (-1) = omnimath1348_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Candidate answer for P(-1): 5. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests that the ratio condition restricts P, and the value at -1 appears to relate to a constant expression involving the polynomial's behavior. The simplified pattern indicates the answer should be a fixed rational related to the structure, notably 5. 

Hence, our closed form conforms to the observed enumeration: 

<<<5>>>
