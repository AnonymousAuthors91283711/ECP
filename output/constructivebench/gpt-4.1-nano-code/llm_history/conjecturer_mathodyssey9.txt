. Enumerated answers: Triple: (5, 3, 2)
Total count of solutions up to limit 50: 1. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests solutions are formed with decreasing order and specific divisibility conditions ties to small triples. The only solutions within limit 50 are symmetric or small triples. Based on this, the total count matches a fixed pattern, restricted to triples like (a, b, c) with small integers. 

From enumeration, only one solution exists: (5, 3, 2). The count is thus 1, and to avoid existential quantifier, the explicit count is 1. 

Final answer: <<<1>>>
