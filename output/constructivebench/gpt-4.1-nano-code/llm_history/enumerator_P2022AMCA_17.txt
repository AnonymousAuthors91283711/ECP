The problem involves understanding the condition involving two distinct points \( x_1, x_2 \) in the interval \( (0, \pi) \), and a parameter \( a \) such that certain relations involving sine functions hold for both \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \). The goal appears to characterize the possible values of \( a \), possibly related to three specific real numbers \( p, q, r \) with some ordering and sum.

To tackle this computationally, I will:
- Consider the key relation: \( a (\sin x + \sin 2x) = \sin 3x \).
- Express \( a \) explicitly: \( a = \frac{\sin 3x}{\sin x + \sin 2x} \), where the denominator is non-zero.
- Sample numerous points \( x \) in \( (0, \pi) \).
- Compute \( a \) values for these points.
- Collect distinct \( a \) values where the denominator is non-zero.
- Since the problem hints at finding certain extremal or specific values, I will also look for maxima and minima of \( a(x) \) over the sampled interval to see potential extremal \( a \) values.
- The structure suggests the final \( a \) could be related to three numbers, often hinting at roots or extremal values.

Here's a Python script performing such enumeration:

```python
import numpy as np

# Define the function that calculates 'a' given x
def compute_a(x):
    numerator = np.sin(3 * x)
    denominator = np.sin(x) + np.sin(2 * x)
    if np.abs(denominator) < 1e-12:
        return None  # Ignore points where denominator is effectively zero
    return numerator / denominator

# Sample the interval (0, pi)
x_values = np.linspace(1e-3, np.pi - 1e-3, 10000)  # 10,000 points for high resolution

#a set to store possible 'a' values
a_values = set()

# Enumerate all 'a' values
for x in x_values:
    a = compute_a(x)
    if a is not None:
        print(k := round(a, 6))
        a_values.add(k)

# Find extremal values (max and min) among computed 'a's
max_a = max(a_values, key=float)
min_a = min(a_values, key=float)

print("Approximate maximum a:", max_a)
print("Approximate minimum a:", min_a)
```

This code:
- Computes \( a \) at dense points \( x \in (0, \pi) \).
- Prints each computed \( a \) immediately.
- Collects approximate \( a \) values for analysis of their extremal points.

This will help conjecture the structure of \( a \), which can then guide formal proof or further algebraic exploration.
