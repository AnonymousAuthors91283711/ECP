Ground Truth Answer: 8096
Proposed Answer: (2^7 - 1) * 2^6 - 32
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves summing k * (C(127,k) mod 8) for k from 1 to 63 (k=0 term is 0).

2. The ground truth answer is 8096.

3. The proposed answer is (2^7 - 1)*2^6 - 32 = (127)*64 - 32 = 8128 - 32 = 8096.

The proposed answer simplifies to exactly the same value as the ground truth answer (8096). The expression (2^7 - 1)*2^6 - 32 is just a different way of writing 8096.
