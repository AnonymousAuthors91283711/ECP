. Enumerated answers: x = 70 degrees
x = 110 degrees. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
Given the equation: √3 * cos(10°) = cos(40°) + sin(x°), recognizing a co-function or sum-to-product identity, the possible solutions align with x degrees being 70° or 110°. Truthfully, these correspond to the angles where the sum of cosine and sine yields the given value, typically related to 70° and 110°. Generalizing, solutions are x = 70° and x = 110°.  
Final answer: <<<{x | x = 70 ∨ x = 110}>>>
