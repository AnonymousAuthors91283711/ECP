The problem asks for the sum of the digits of a particular sum S, where S is over even numbers k less than 10,000 that satisfy the condition \(k^2 \mod 10^{\text{length of }k} = k\). We want to enumerate candidates and find the sum of digits for such k, then sum all those values.

Key observations:
- The condition \(k^2 \equiv k \pmod{10^{\text{len}(k)}}\) means that \(k^2\) ends with \(k\).
- The only numbers that satisfy \(k^2 \equiv k \pmod{10^{n}}\) are fixed points of the function \(f(k) = k^2 \bmod 10^{n}\).

We will:
- Explore small values for \(k\), focusing on those ending with themselves.
- Check the condition efficiently.
- Sum all such k that meet the criteria.

Since the problem involves a large range (up to 10,000), but the specific property constrains the candidates drastically, we find all such k, sum them, then output the sum of their digits.

```python
# Enumerate all even k < 10000 such that k^2 ends with k
# These are fixed points of the squaring modulo 10^len(k)

def fixed_point_candidates():
    candidates = []
    for k in range(0, 10000, 2):  # only even k
        k_str = str(k)
        length = len(k_str)
        modulus = 10 ** length
        if (k * k) % modulus == k:
            candidates.append(k)
            print(k)
    return candidates

candidates = fixed_point_candidates()

# Sum these k
S = sum(candidates)

# Function to compute sum of digits
def sum_digits(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

# Compute and print the sum of digits of S
print(sum_digits(S))
```
