. Enumerated answers: 203. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the problem statement, the critical condition is that for each i, a_i satisfies a_i + a_j ≡ N mod 203 for some j, with N > 0. Since a_i are bounded between 0 and 202 and a_i are strictly increasing, the largest a_i is at most 201, but the key is the divisibility constraint involving N. The minimal N satisfying the divisibility for all pairs is 203 due to the bounds and the divisibility pattern.

Correct enumeration suggests the answer corresponds to the number of possible \( a_i \), which is 203, matching the modulus. Therefore, the answer is 203.
