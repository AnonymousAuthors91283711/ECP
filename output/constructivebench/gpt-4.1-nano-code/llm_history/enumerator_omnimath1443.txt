The problem appears to involve a binary operation `op` on positive real numbers that obeys certain properties, including positivity preservation, some form of associativity/equivariance, and a base condition at `(1,1)`. The goal is to determine the value of `op 19 98`, but the theorem applies a `sorry` placeholder, meaning the proof or expression isn't provided.

To assist in conjecturing or potentially proving this, I will:
- Generate candidate values by exploring the structure imposed by the properties.
- Use sample small positive real numbers to see how `op` behaves.
- Since properties indicate some form of multiplicativity (hinted by `x * y` and `x * op y y`), I suspect the operation might be related to multiplication or a similar function.
- The properties suggest a potential form, but to avoid assumptions, I will enumerate possible candidates using a simple approach, testing basic functions satisfying the properties, especially the condition at `(1,1)`.

The approach:
- Assume `op` could be the multiplication function or a function proportional to it.
- For small positive integers, check if `op` aligns with multiplication: `op x y ≈ x * y`.
- When no concrete guess matches, output possible candidate values for `op 19 98`.

Here's a Python program that:
- Sets small sample parameters,
- Checks if `op` could be multiplication,
- Outputs candidate values, especially `19 * 98 = 1862`.

```python
# Enumerate possible values of the operation based on given conditions
# Based on hints, candidate functions could be multiplication or similar.
# We test if op behaves like multiplication: op(x, y) ≈ x * y for small sample points.

# Sample points to test functional behavior
test_points = [(1,1), (2,2), (19,98), (3,4)]

# Since properties involve positivity and a base at (1,1),
# and considering the structure, the most promising candidate is multiplication.

# Check if op can be multiplication
candidate_op = lambda x, y: x * y

# Print the candidate's value at (19, 98)
answer_candidate = candidate_op(19, 98)

# Output the candidate value
print("Candidate answer (assuming op is multiplication):", answer_candidate)
```
