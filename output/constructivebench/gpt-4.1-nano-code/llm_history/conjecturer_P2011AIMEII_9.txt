The problem maximizes the cyclic sum of triplet products under positive constraints and sum to 1. Symmetry suggests the maximum occurs for equal x_i, giving each approximately 1/6, and each triplet product around (1/6)^3=1/216. Calculated sum yields 6 * 1/216 = 1/36, and the minimal product involved in the inequality is 1/540, consistent with uniform distribution. The maximum value chosen as numerator/denominator simplifies to (1,36).
