[write_program]
This problem appears to involve a combinatorial inequality involving sums and products of functions over a finite set, with parameters over natural numbers. To assist with conjecture and proof, I will implement a Python program that enumerates small test cases to observe the behavior of the inequality. The goal is to identify for which n the inequality might hold or fail and to gather data points on specific sequences \( a_i \). 

Given the constraints, I will:

- Use small fixed values for n (say 1 to 5).
- For each n, consider a few candidate sequences \( a_i \), such as constant sequences, sequences with small integer values, or geometric progressions.
- Evaluate the expression and output the results immediately as they are computed, to help observe patterns.
- Since the problem involves inequalities, I focus on detecting cases where the inequality is nearly tight or fails, to aid in conjecture.

Below is the Python code that enumerates potential sequences for small n, evaluates the inequality, and outputs the results immediately.

```python
# Enumerate small sequences a_i over a finite range to observe behavior of the inequality.
# Focus on small n (1 to 4) and small values for a_i (e.g., 1 to 3).
# For each n and sequence, evaluate the inequality:
# (sum a_i^2) * (sum a_i) - sum a_i^3 >= 6 * product a_i

def evaluate_inequality(a):
    sum_a = sum(a)
    sum_a2 = sum(x**2 for x in a)
    sum_a3 = sum(x**3 for x in a)
    prod_a = 1
    for x in a:
        prod_a *= x
    left = sum_a2 * sum_a - sum_a3
    right = 6 * prod_a
    return left, right

# Generate sequences with small integers for each n
for n in range(1, 5):
    print(f"n = {n}")
    # Generate all sequences of length n with entries in 1..3
    from itertools import product
    for a in product([1, 2, 3], repeat=n):
        left, right = evaluate_inequality(a)
        print(f"a = {a} => left = {left}, right = {right}, {'holds' if left >= right else 'fails'}")
```
