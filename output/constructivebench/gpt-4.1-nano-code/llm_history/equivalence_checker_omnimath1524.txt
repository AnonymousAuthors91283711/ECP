theorem omnimath1524 : 
  Nat.card {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ n < 1998 ∧ Nat.Coprime n 1547} = omnimath1524_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 1487
Proposed Answer: 1997 - (1998 / 11 + 1998 / 139) + 1
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the count of numbers between 1 and 1997 that are coprime with 1547.

2. First, factorize 1547: 1547 = 7 × 13 × 17

3. The ground truth answer is 1487, which is correct because:
   - Total numbers: 1997
   - Subtract numbers divisible by 7: floor(1997/7) = 285
   - Subtract numbers divisible by 13: floor(1997/13) = 153
   - Subtract numbers divisible by 17: floor(1997/17) = 117
   - Add back numbers divisible by both 7 and 13 (91): floor(1997/91) = 21
   - Add back numbers divisible by both 7 and 17 (119): floor(1997/119) = 16
   - Add back numbers divisible by both 13 and 17 (221): floor(1997/221) = 9
   - Subtract numbers divisible by all three (1547): floor(1997/1547) = 1
   - Final calculation: 1997 - (285 + 153 + 117) + (21 + 16 + 9) - 1 = 1487

4. The proposed answer incorrectly:
   - Uses 1998 instead of 1997
   - Uses wrong factors (11 and 139 instead of 7, 13, 17)
   - The formula structure is incorrect for inclusion-exclusion principle
