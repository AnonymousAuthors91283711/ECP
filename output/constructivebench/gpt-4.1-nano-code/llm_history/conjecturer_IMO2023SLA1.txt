    ∃ N : Fin 100 → ℕ, (∑ i, N i = 100) ∧ (∑ i, |(N i : ℝ) - C i| ≤ IMO2023SLA1_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Answer conjecture: minimal total deviation approximates to 0 based on evenly distributed integers.. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<0>>>
The minimal total deviation approaches zero when N_i equals C_i, but since N_i are integers summing to 100 and C_i > 0, the best approximation is when N_i are close to C_i, making the total deviation arbitrarily small.
