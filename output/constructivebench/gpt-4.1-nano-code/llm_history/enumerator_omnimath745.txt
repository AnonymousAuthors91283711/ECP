This problem involves summation over ranges, binomial coefficients modulo 3, and a quotient. To assist in conjecturing and verifying the answer, I'll write Python code that enumerates all possible sums of binomial coefficients modulo 3 for `a` and `b` in [0,80], considering the condition `b ≤ a`. It will compute the sum directly and approximate the value for the entire sum divided by (81*81). Since `Mathlib` uses `ZMod 3`, we're specifically interested in binomial coefficients modulo 3.

We'll perform the calculation:
\[
\frac{\sum_{a=0}^{80} \sum_{b=0}^{a} \binom{a}{b} \ (\bmod\, 3)}{81 \times 81}
\]

This Python code will:
- Enumerate `a` in [0,80]
- For each `a`, iterate `b` in [0, a]
- Sum binomial coefficients modulo 3
- Calculate the total sum, then divide by 81×81
- Print the result for analysis.

```python
import math

# Total number of terms
N = 81

total_sum_mod3 = 0

for a in range(N):
    for b in range(a + 1):
        # Compute binomial coefficient
        binom = math.comb(a, b)
        # Take modulo 3
        total_sum_mod3 += binom % 3

# Compute the average (double sum divided by total number of pairs)
average_mod3 = total_sum_mod3 / (N * N)

print(f"Total sum modulo 3: {total_sum_mod3}")
print(f"Average over all pairs divided by 81*81: {average_mod3}")
```

This enumeration helps identify the behavior of the sum and supports conjecture about the exact value in ℚ.
