The problem involves finding integer triples (a,b,c) satisfying a specific relation involving N, where N is related to the product of differences divided by 2 and then shifted by 2. The key is to understand when N equals a power of 2016, i.e., N = 2016^n for some non-negative integer n. Since 2016 factors as 2^5 * 3^2 * 7, N must be a power of 2, a power of 3, and a power of 7, simultaneously. The relations involve the differences (a-b), (b-c), (c-a). The goal is to generate candidate values of a, b, c that satisfy this relation and N, then check when N is of the form 2016^n.

To systematically generate solutions, choose small sample values for these differences and compute corresponding N, checking for powers of 2016.

```python
import math

# Function to check if a number is a power of 2016
def is_power_of_2016(N):
    if N <= 0:
        return False
    log_N = math.log(N, 2016)
    # Check if log_N is approximately an integer
    return abs(log_N - round(log_N)) < 1e-9

# Generate candidate difference triplets and compute N
# Differences between a, b, c are small integers (to keep enumeration manageable)
max_diff = 10

for dx in range(-max_diff, max_diff + 1):
    for dy in range(-max_diff, max_diff + 1):
        for dz in range(-max_diff, max_diff + 1):
            # Differences: (a-b), (b-c), (c - a)
            # Relations: (a - b)=dx, (b - c)=dy, (c - a)=dz
            # For consistency, check if dx + dy + dz == 0 (since a - b + b - c + c - a =0)
            if dx + dy + dz != 0:
                continue
            # Solve for c in terms of a, b: c = b - dy, and a = b + dx
            # N = ((a - b)*(b - c)*(c - a))/2 + 2
            # Substitute:
            # a - b = dx
            # b - c = dy
            # c - a = dz
            # The product: dx * dy * dz
            N = (dx * dy * dz) // 2 + 2
            # Check if N is a positive power of 2016
            if is_power_of_2016(N):
                # Compute n from N = 2016^n
                n = round(math.log(N, 2016))
                # Retrieve actual a, b, c
                b_candidate = 0  # take b=0 for simplicity
                a_candidate = b_candidate + dx
                c_candidate = b_candidate - dy
                print(f"Found N={N} (2016^{n}), with differences dx={dx}, dy={dy}, dz={dz}")
                print(f"Corresponding (a,b,c): ({a_candidate}, {b_candidate}, {c_candidate})")
```
