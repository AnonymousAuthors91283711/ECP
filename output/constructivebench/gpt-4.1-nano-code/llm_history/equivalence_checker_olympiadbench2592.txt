Ground Truth Answer: 4.2
Proposed Answer: (( (1 - 0.029) * (1 + 0.089) * (1 + 0.069) - 1 ) * 100)
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer calculates the equivalent annual rate by computing the geometric mean of the three given rates. However, it doesn't account for the compounding effect over three periods. The correct approach would be to take the cube root of the product (1-0.029)(1+0.089)(1+0.069), subtract 1, then multiply by 100. The proposed answer gives approximately 4.2, but this is coincidental - the calculation method is incorrect even though the numerical result is close to the ground truth.
