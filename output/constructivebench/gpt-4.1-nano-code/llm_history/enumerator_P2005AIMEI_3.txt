The problem appears to be about counting integers from 1 to 2500 that have exactly 3 divisors, with some conditions on the divisors. Specifically, for each number n, we consider its divisors less than n and not equal to n, and count how many such divisors are less than 50. We want to find how many numbers have exactly 3 such divisors.

Insight:
- For a number n to have exactly 3 proper divisors (excluding n itself), n must be of the form p^2 where p is prime: 
  - n = p^2
  - Divisors of n are {1, p, p^2}
  - Proper divisors (excluding n): {1, p}
  - We want exactly 3 divisors d < n, so proper divisors count is 2, but the problem counts d < n ∧ d ≠ n, which aligns.

- For each such p^2, divisors less than n are {1, p}
- The condition in the problem is counting divisors less than n and not equal to n, with a subset for divisor d that satisfy d ≠ n and d < 50.
- Since divisors are small, check p and 1.

Given these observations, the key is:
- Find primes p where p^2 ≤ 2500
- Count such primes p where p < 50 (since we want all d < 50 for divisor).

Implementation:
- Generate primes up to 2500
- Filter primes p < 50
- Count p^2 ≤ 2500, p < 50, and p prime

Here's the Python code:

```python
import math

# Generate primes up to 2500 using Sieve of Eratosthenes
limit = 2500
sieve = [True] * (limit + 1)
sieve[0] = sieve[1] = False
for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(limit)) + 1):
    if sieve[i]:
        for j in range(i*i, limit+1, i):
            sieve[j] = False

primes = [p for p in range(2, limit+1) if sieve[p]]
# Filter primes p < 50
small_primes = [p for p in primes if p < 50]

# Count p where p^2 ≤ 2500
answers = []
for p in small_primes:
    n = p**2
    if n <= 2500:
        answers.append(n)
        print(n)
```
