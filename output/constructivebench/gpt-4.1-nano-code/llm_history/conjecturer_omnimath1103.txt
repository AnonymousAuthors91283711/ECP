The sum over all permutations σ of size 2013 of the 4th power of the number of fixed points is known to equal 2013!. The sum is classical: the expected number of fixed points × the number of permutations. Because the sum of fixed points is N!, and the 4th power involves higher moments but the sum of fixed points for all permutations considers the arrangement symmetry. The total sum involves all permutations, so the sum of (fixed points)^4 over all permutations is 2013! multiplied by the 4th moment of the fixed points distribution. Known moments of fixed points in symmetric groups yield 2013! × 1, suggesting the total is 2013! * some constant; standard combinatorics for fixed points shows the sum totals to 2013! * 24 (deriving from the number of permutations fixing a specific subset).  

Final answer in Lean:  
<<<2013! * 24>>>
