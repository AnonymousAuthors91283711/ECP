theorem P2005AMCB_12 (m n p : ℚ) (hm : m ≠ 0) (hn : n ≠ 0) (hp : p ≠ 0) 
  (h : ∃ (r s : ℚ), (X^2 + C p * X + C m).roots = {r, s} ∧ (X^2 + C m * X + C n).roots = {2 * r, 2 * s}) :
  n / p = P2005AMCB_12_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: p = 1, m = 2, n = 8, n/p = 8
p = 2, m = 4, n = 16, n/p = 8
p = 3, m = 6, n = 24, n/p = 8
p = 4, m = 8, n = 32, n/p = 8
p = 5, m = 10, n = 40, n/p = 8. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
<<<8>>>

The pattern suggests n/p always equals 8, regardless of m and p, under the given roots conditions.
