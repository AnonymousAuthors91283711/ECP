The code snippet is written in Lean formal proof language, not Python. To approach this as a Python enumeration problem, I need to interpret what the problem is asking.

Given the sequence \( a(n) = a(1) + (n-1) d \) with known terms \( a(16) = 13 \) and \( a(30) = 20 \), and a target value \( T \), the goal is to find all \( k \) such that \( a(k) = T \). The theorem states that this is equivalent to \( k \) being equal to some specific answer \( olympiadbench2730_answer T \).

The problem reduces to solving a linear equation for different \( T \), i.e.,

\[ a(k) = a(1) + (k - 1) d = T. \]

Given points:
- \( a(16) = a(1) + 15d = 13 \),
- \( a(30) = a(1) + 29d = 20 \).

From these, we can determine \( d \) and \( a(1) \):

\[
\begin{cases}
a(1) + 15d = 13 \\
a(1) + 29d = 20
\end{cases}
\]

Subtracting the two:

\[
(29d - 15d) = 20 - 13 \implies 14d = 7 \implies d = \frac{7}{14} = 0.5.
\]

Using \( a(16) = 13 \):

\[
a(1) + 15 \times 0.5 = 13 \implies a(1) + 7.5 = 13 \implies a(1) = 5.5.
\]

Now, the sequence is:

\[ a(k) = 5.5 + 0.5(k - 1). \]

Given that, for a target \( T \):

\[
T = 5.5 + 0.5(k - 1) \implies 0.5(k - 1) = T - 5.5 \implies k - 1 = 2(T - 5.5) \implies k = 2T - 11 + 1 = 2T - 10.
\]

Since \( k \) is an integer, \( 2T - 10 \) must be an integer. 

The possible \( T \) for integer \( k \) satisfy:

\[ T \in \left\{ \text{any } T \text{ such that } 2T - 10 \in \mathbb{Z} \right\} \implies T \in \mathbb{Z} \text{ (all integers)}. \]

But be aware that sequence values are continuous (since \( a(k) \) involves half-integers), and \( a(k) \) at integer \( k \) is:

\[
a(k) = 5.5 + 0.5(k - 1).
\]

Suppose we want to find all integers \( T \) (possible sequence values) within a certain range or step.

For simplicity, let's set \( T \) in a small range like from 0 to 30, and enumerate all \( T \) with their corresponding \( k \).

Here's the Python code:

```python
# Enumerate sequence values T for k in range 1..50
# and find all pairs where a(k) = T
# sequence: a(k) = 5.5 + 0.5*(k - 1)
# For integer k, a(k) is always 0.5 + 0.5*k, i.e., half-integers starting at 1.0

for k in range(1, 51):
    a_k = 5.5 + 0.5 * (k - 1)
    print(f"k={k}, a(k)={a_k}")

# To find all T within the sequence values for k in 1..50
sequence_values = set(5.5 + 0.5 * (k - 1) for k in range(1, 51))
for T in sorted(sequence_values):
    k = int(2 * T - 10)
    print(f"T={T}, corresponding k={k}")
```

This code enumerates the sequence for \( k=1..50 \), prints each \( a(k) \), and then maps each sequence value to the specific \( k \) that generates it. It illustrates the sequence enumeration and the relation between \( T \) and \( k \).

```python
# Enumerate sequence for k from 1 to 50
for k in range(1, 51):
    a_k = 5.5 + 0.5 * (k - 1)
    print(f"k={k}, a(k)={a_k}")

# Map each sequence value T to the corresponding k
sequence_values = set(5.5 + 0.5 * (k - 1) for k in range(1, 51))
for T in sorted(sequence_values):
    k = int(2 * T - 10)  # derives from the formula
    print(f"T={T}, corresponds to k={k}")
```
