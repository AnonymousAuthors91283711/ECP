This problem involves identifying quadruples of natural numbers (a, b, c, d) satisfying specific inequalities and equations:

- a > b > c > d
- a + b + c + d = 2010
- a^2 - b^2 + c^2 - d^2 = 2010

We aim to find the number of such solutions, or at least candidate solutions, by enumerating.

To efficiently approach this:
- Fix small values of d and c, then solve for a and b considering the inequalities and equations.
- Use the relations to reduce the number of checks.
- Focus on possible integer solutions.

The key step is to eliminate variables:
- Write a + b + c + d = 2010, so a + b = 2010 - c - d.
- Rewrite the quadratic equation as:
  (a^2 - b^2) + (c^2 - d^2) = 2010

Note that:
- a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)
- c^2 - d^2 = (c - d)(c + d)

Substitute:
- (a - b)(a + b) + (c - d)(c + d) = 2010

Given the inequalities, a > b > c > d, which implies:

- a > b > c > d ≥ 0
- (a - b), (c - d) are positive.

Iterate over small c, d:

Here's the implementation:

```python
# Enumerate possible (c, d) pairs with c > d ≥ 0
# For each, compute S = 2010 - c - d, then find (a, b)
# Check that a > b > c > d and a + b = S
# For each candidate, verify if the quadratic condition holds

def main():
    solutions = 0
    for d in range(0, 1001):
        for c in range(d + 1, 1001):
            S = 2010 - c - d
            # Because a > b > c and a + b = S
            for b in range(c + 1, S // 2 + 1):
                a = S - b
                if a > b and a > c and a + b == S:
                    # Check the quadratic equation:
                    # (a - b)(a + b) + (c - d)(c + d) == 2010
                    # Since a + b = S,
                    # (a - b) * S + (c - d)(c + d) should equal 2010
                    left_side = (a - b) * S + (c - d) * (c + d)
                    if left_side == 2010:
                        print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}")
                        solutions += 1
    print("Total solutions found:", solutions)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code enumerates candidate quadruples based on the inequalities and the sum condition, then checks the quadratic relation for each. It streams solutions as soon as it finds them, aligning with the problem requirements.
