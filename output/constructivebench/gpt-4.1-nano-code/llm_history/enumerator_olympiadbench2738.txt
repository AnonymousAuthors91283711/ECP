This problem involves analyzing the set of positive real numbers \( x \) such that \( 0 < x \) and \(\log x = \frac{3 + \lfloor (\log x)^2 \rfloor}{4} \), which is finite, and then considering the product \( P \) of all such \( x \). Our goal is to find the value of \( y \) satisfying \( P = 10^y \).

First, note that the set's defining condition depends only on \(\log x\), specifically:
\[
\log x = \frac{3 + \lfloor (\log x)^2 \rfloor}{4}.
\]
Let \( t = \log x \). Then:
\[
t = \frac{3 + \lfloor t^2 \rfloor}{4}.
\]
Rearranged:
\[
4t = 3 + \lfloor t^2 \rfloor,
\]
which implies:
\[
\lfloor t^2 \rfloor = 4t - 3.
\]

Since \(\lfloor t^2 \rfloor\) is an integer and \( t \in \mathbb{R} \), the right side must be an integer as well. So \( 4t - 3 \) is an integer.

Set \( N = \lfloor t^2 \rfloor \):
\[
N = 4t - 3,
\]
and
\[
t^2 \in [N, N+1),
\]
which yields:
\[
N \leq t^2 < N + 1.
\]
Since \( t = \frac{N + 3}{4} \),
\[
t^2 = \left(\frac{N + 3}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{(N + 3)^2}{16}.
\]
The inequalities become:
\[
N \leq \frac{(N + 3)^2}{16} < N + 1.
\]

Multiply through by 16:
\[
16N \leq (N + 3)^2 < 16(N + 1),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
16N \leq N^2 + 6N + 9 < 16N + 16.
\]

From the first inequality:
\[
16N \leq N^2 + 6N + 9,
\]
\[
0 \leq N^2 - 10N + 9,
\]
\[
N^2 - 10N + 9 \ge 0.
\]

Discriminant:
\[
D = 100 - 36 = 64,
\]
roots:
\[
N = \frac{10 \pm 8}{2}.
\]
So:
\[
N = 9 \quad \text{or} \quad N = 1.
\]
Since quadratic opens upwards:
\[
N \leq 1 \quad \text{or} \quad N \geq 9.
\]

Next, from the second inequality:
\[
(N + 3)^2 < 16N + 16,
\]
\[
N^2 + 6N + 9 < 16N + 16,
\]
\[
N^2 - 10N - 7 < 0.
\]

Discriminant:
\[
D = 100 - 4 \times 1 \times (-7) = 100 + 28 = 128,
\]
roots:
\[
N = \frac{10 \pm \sqrt{128}}{2} = \frac{10 \pm 8\sqrt{2}}{2} = 5 \pm 4\sqrt{2}.
\]

Numerically:
\[
4\sqrt{2} \approx 5.6569,
\]
thus:
\[
N \in (5 - 5.6569, 5 + 5.6569) \Rightarrow N \in (-0.6569, 10.6569).
\]

Since \( N \) is integer:
\[
N \in \{0, 1, 2, \dots, 10\}.
\]

Combining both conditions:

- From the first, \( N \leq 1 \) or \( N \geq 9 \.)
- From the second, \( N \in \{0,\dots,10\} \).

Intersection:

- For \( N \leq 1 \), \( N \in \{0,1\} \),
- For \( N \geq 9 \), \( N \in \{9, 10\} \).

Check for each \( N \):

1. \( N=0 \):

\[
t = \frac{0+3}{4} = \frac{3}{4}=0.75,
\]
\[
t^2= 0.75^2=0.5625,
\]
and \(\lfloor 0.5625 \rfloor=0\). But this should match \( N=0\), which it does.

2. \( N=1 \):

\[
t= \frac{1+3}{4} = 1,
\]
\[
t^2=1,
\]
\(\lfloor 1 \rfloor=1\), matches \( N=1 \).

3. \( N=9 \):

\[
t=\frac{9+3}{4}=\frac{12}{4}=3,
\]
\[
t^2=9,
\]
\(\lfloor 9 \rfloor=9\), matches \( N=9 \).

4. \( N=10 \):

\[
t=\frac{10+3}{4}=\frac{13}{4}=3.25,
\]
\[
t^2= (3.25)^2=10.5625,
\]
\(\lfloor 10.5625\rfloor=10\), matches \( N=10 \).

Furthermore, only positive \( x \) are considered, so:

\[
x= e^t,
\]
and the set of solutions corresponds to:

\[
t \in \{0.75, 1, 3, 3.25 \}.
\]

Corresponding solutions:

\[
x= e^{0.75}, \quad e^{1}, \quad e^{3}, \quad e^{3.25}.
\]

Now, the product:

\[
P = x_1 x_2 x_3 x_4 = e^{0.75} \times e^{1} \times e^{3} \times e^{3.25} = e^{0.75 + 1 + 3 + 3.25} = e^{8}.
\]

Expressed as a power of 10:

\[
P= e^{8} = 10^{8 / \ln 10}.
\]

Using approximate \(\ln 10 \approx 2.302585093\):

\[
\frac{8}{2.302585093} \approx 3.472,
\]

so

\[
P \approx 10^{3.472}.
\]

Thus, the value of \( y \) is exactly:

\[
y = \frac{8}{\ln 10}.
\]

We define the answer accordingly.
