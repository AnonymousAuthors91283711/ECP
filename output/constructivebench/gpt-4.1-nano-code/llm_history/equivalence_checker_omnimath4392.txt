Ground Truth Answer: {(1, 1, 1), (1, 0, -1), (1, -1, 0), (0, 1, -1), (0, -1, 1), (-1, 1, 0), (-1, 0, 1)}

The proposed answer is missing the solution (1, 1, 1) which is present in the ground truth answer. All other solutions are correctly listed, though in a different format (set builder notation vs explicit enumeration). The missing (1,1,1) case makes this answer incomplete but mostly correct.
