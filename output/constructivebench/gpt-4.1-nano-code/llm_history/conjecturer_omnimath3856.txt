. Enumerated answers: All pairs in [1,2] satisfy the property.. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The pattern suggests minimal values of k=1, 2 satisfy the given property, especially since for these small values, potential divisibility issues are minimized, and the condition holds vacuously or trivially. For larger k, differences become complex and may violate the divisibility condition. Therefore, the set of all such k is just {1, 2}.
