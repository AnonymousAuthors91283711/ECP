This problem involves a recurrence relation for sequences of lists, with a condition on "palindromic" lists. The key is to analyze the recurrence:
- a(1) = [1]
- a(2) = [0]
- a(n+3) = a(n+2) ++ reverse(a(n+1))

The goal is to find all n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) such that a(n) is a palindrome.

Since the sequences are built from concatenations of previous sequences, and initial sequences are small, we can simulate the sequence for n up to 1000, check if each a(n) is a palindrome, and count the total.

Here's the plan:
- For each n from 1 to 1000:
  - Generate a(n) using the recurrence
  - Check if a(n) is a palindrome using the provided palindrome property
- Count how many are palindromic
- For the answer, return the count

This approach is efficient enough for n up to 1000, avoids hardcoding, and streams answers.

```python
# Python implementation simulating the sequence and counting palindromic lists up to n=1000
def is_palindrome(lst):
    return lst == lst[::-1]

a = dict()
a[1] = [1]
a[2] = [0]

for n in range(3, 1001):
    a[n] = a[n - 1] + a[n - 2][::-1]

count_palindromes = 0
for n in range(1, 1001):
    if is_palindrome(a[n]):
        print(f"n={n}, list={a[n]}")
        count_palindromes += 1

# Output the total count of palindromic lists within the range
print(f"Total palindromic sequences from 1 to 1000: {count_palindromes}")

```
