The problem appears to be about finding the greatest possible number of negative coefficients in the square of a real polynomial of degree n, with some constraints. To understand and conjecture the answer, we should consider small degrees explicitly, enumerate possible polynomials, and track the count of negative coefficients in their squares.

The plan:
- Fix a small degree n (like n=2 or 3)
- Generate candidate polynomials with small integer coefficients
- Square each polynomial
- Count negative coefficients in the square
- Track the maximum count found so far
- Output candidate maximums as we go

This approach can help us conjecture the pattern or the exact maximum for a given degree n. Since the problem involves polynomials with real coefficients, to simplify, we can consider polynomials with small integer coefficients, focusing on the 2nd degree for illustration.

```python
import itertools

def count_negative_coeffs(poly_coeffs):
    # Count negative coefficients of the polynomial square
    return sum(1 for c in poly_coeffs if c < 0)

# Generate candidate polynomials of degree up to n
def generate_polynomials(n, coeff_range):
    # Generate all coefficient combinations with degree n
    # For simplicity, consider coefficients from -3 to 3
    for coeffs in itertools.product(range(-3, 4), repeat=n+1):
        # Leading coefficient should not be zero for degree n
        if coeffs[-1] != 0:
            yield coeffs

def polynomial_square_coeffs(coeffs):
    # Compute coefficients of polynomial squared (degree up to 2n)
    degree = len(coeffs) - 1
    result = [0] * (2 * degree + 1)
    for i in range(degree + 1):
        for j in range(degree + 1):
            result[i + j] += coeffs[i] * coeffs[j]
    return result

# For a fixed degree n, find maximum negative coefficients in squares
n = 2
max_neg_coeffs = -1
max_candidates = []

for coeffs in generate_polynomials(n, range(-3, 4)):
    square_coeffs = polynomial_square_coeffs(coeffs[::-1])  # reverse for coeff order
    neg_count = count_negative_coeffs(square_coeffs)
    print(f"Poly coeffs: {coeffs}, square coeffs: {list(reversed(square_coeffs))}, negatives: {neg_count}")
    if neg_count > max_neg_coeffs:
        max_neg_coeffs = neg_count
        max_candidates = [coeffs]
        print(f"New max negative coefficient count: {neg_count} with polynomial {coeffs}")
    elif neg_count == max_neg_coeffs:
        max_candidates.append(coeffs)

print(f"Maximum number of negative coefficients in square for degree {n}: {max_neg_coeffs}")
print(f"Candidate polynomials achieving this: {max_candidates}")
```
