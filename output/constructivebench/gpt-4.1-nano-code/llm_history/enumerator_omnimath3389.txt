The problem involves a sum involving powers of sine and cosine, with an explicit formula involving a geometric term. To explore possible answers to this problem, I will focus on specific values of x where the sums are easier to compute, such as multiples of Ï€/2, where sine or cosine values are zeros or one. I'll test small sample values and evaluate the sum explicitly to verify or suggest the form of the answer.

```python
import math

# Function to compute the sum for a given x and n
def compute_sum(x, n):
    total = 0.0
    for k in range(n + 1):
        sin_val = math.sin(2**k * x)
        prod_cos = 1.0
        for m in range(k):
            prod_cos *= math.cos(2**m * x)
        total += (sin_val ** 2) * prod_cos
    return total

# Known special angles for x to test
test_angles = [
    0,
    math.pi / 2,
    math.pi / 4,
    math.pi / 6,
    math.pi / 3
]

# For each angle, compute sums up to n=2010 for some candidates
for x in test_angles:
    print(f"Testing x = {x} (angle in radians)")
    # Compute sum for n=2010
    sum_2010 = compute_sum(x, 2010)
    print(f"Sum up to n=2010: {sum_2010}")
    # Compute sum for n=0
    sum_0 = compute_sum(x, 0)
    print(f"Sum up to n=0: {sum_0}")
    # Check the pattern by sampling some smaller n
    for n in [0, 10, 100, 500, 2000]:
        s = compute_sum(x, n)
        print(f"Sum up to n={n}: {s}")
    print("---")
```
