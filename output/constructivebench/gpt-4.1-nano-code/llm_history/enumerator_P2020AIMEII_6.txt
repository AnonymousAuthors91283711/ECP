[write_program]
The provided code defines a recursive function `t` over natural numbers returning rational numbers, with base cases for 0, 1, and 2, and a recurrence for `n + 3`. The task appears to be to analyze or find the value of `t 2020`. 

Given the structure and the recurrence, direct calculation will be complex because the recursion involves fractions, and the sequence seems to be designed for a certain pattern or closed form. Since the problem mentions estimating or conjecturing the value of `t 2020`, an efficient approach is to generate the first few terms and look for patterns or to check whether `t n` stabilizes or behaves in a predictable way for small `n`, then approximate for large `n`.

Here's a plan:
- Compute `t n` for small `n` (say, n=0..10)
- Observe the pattern of numerator and denominator
- Print intermediate results
- Conclude with an approximation or conjecture for `t 2020`

Note: The code should be efficient, avoid deep recursion, and handle rational calculations precisely. I'll implement memoization for efficiency.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Memoization cache for sequence t
cache = {0: Fraction(0), 1: Fraction(20), 2: Fraction(21)}

def t(n):
    if n in cache:
        return cache[n]
    val = (t(n - 1) + t(n - 2) + 1) / t(n - 1)
    cache[n] = val
    return val

# Compute first few terms and print
for i in range(10):
    val = t(i)
    print(f"t({i}) = {val} (approx {float(val):.4f})")
    
# Approximate t(2020) based on pattern (if any observed)
# For large n, t(n) seems to stabilize; check last computed value
print(f"Approximate t(2020) using recursive relation: {t(2020)}")
```

This code computes initial terms of the sequence, prints both exact rational and approximate float, and then estimates `t(2020)`. Adjustments could be made if a pattern is detected.
