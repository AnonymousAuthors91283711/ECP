x1 = 8.0, x2 = 12.0, x3 = 16.0, sum = 36.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the constraints, the sum of x_i is 36 with x_i = -b_i/m and b_i = 2, 3, 4. Solving for m, we get m = -b_i / x_i, which must be consistent for all i. Using the known x_i, the common m is -2/8 = -1/4, -3/12 = -1/4, -4/16 = -1/4. So, m = -1/4 in general.
