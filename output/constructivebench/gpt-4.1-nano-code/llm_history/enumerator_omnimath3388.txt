[write_program]
The problem involves solving a system of three linear equations in rational numbers and finding the (p, q, r) that satisfy the system. To assist in conjecture and verification, we'll enumerate possible solutions with small rational values for p, q, r, and keep track of solutions that exactly satisfy all three equations.

Since the equations are:
1) p + 3q + r = 3
2) p + 2q + 3r = 3
3) p + q + r = 2

We can try small rational samples (e.g., integers or simple fractions) within a small range.

Here's the Python code:

```python
# Enumerate small rational solutions for the system:
# p + 3q + r = 3
# p + 2q + 3r = 3
# p + q + r = 2
# We choose small rational test values in [-5, 5] with increments of 1 for simplicity.
solutions = []
for p_num in range(-5, 6):
    for q_num in range(-5, 6):
        for r_num in range(-5, 6):
            p = p_num
            q = q_num
            r = r_num
            eq1 = p + 3*q + r
            eq2 = p + 2*q + 3*r
            eq3 = p + q + r
            if eq1 == 3 and eq2 == 3 and eq3 == 2:
                print((p, q, r))
                solutions.append((p, q, r))
# Optionally, show the solutions discovered
# For practical purposes, solutions can be extended or refined
```

This code will print each solution whenever it exactly satisfies all three equations, streaming partial results during the enumeration.
[refine_program]
The program exhaustively searches small integers within [-5, 5], but the system of equations probably has solutions outside that range or non-integer solutions, which the current code doesn't find. 

Since the problem is linear with rational coefficients, the solution is likely unique and can be computed directly by solving the equations, rather than enumerating. The provided enumeration yields no solutions because the solution probably involves rational (non-integer) values outside the small tested range.

Given the problem's constraints, the best approach is to analytically solve the system and then output the exact rational solution (without hardcoding the answer, but showing the actual found solution).

The code should:

- Solve the system exactly (analytically), using algebra or sympy.
- Print the solution when found.
- Not hardcode the answer.
- Be executable as is.

**Acceptance judgment**: The enumeration approach is ineffective—no solutions found—and thus the code doesn't demonstrate any solutions. Therefore, the code is rejected.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define variables
p, q, r = sp.symbols('p q r')

# Set up equations
eq1 = sp.Eq(p + 3*q + r, 3)
eq2 = sp.Eq(p + 2*q + 3*r, 3)
eq3 = sp.Eq(p + q + r, 2)

# Solve the system
solution = sp.solve([eq1, eq2, eq3], (p, q, r), dict=True)

if solution:
    sol = solution[0]
    p_val = sol[p]
    q_val = sol[q]
    r_val = sol[r]
    print(f'({p_val}, {q_val}, {r_val})')
else:
    print('No solution found.')
```
