noncomputable abbrev omnimath2486_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2486
  (a : ℕ → ℝ) 
  (hpos : ∀ n, 0 < a n)
  (hsum : ∀ k, ∑' n, Nat.choose n k * a n = (1/5)^k)
  : ∑' n, (-1)^(n+1) * a n = omnimath2486_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: -0.7142857142857143. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests the sum involves the series with alternating signs and binomial coefficients, resembling the binomial expansion of (1 - x)⁻¹. Recognizing that the sum over n of (-1)^(n+1) multiplied by a scaled binomial coefficient yields a rational constant, the answer simplifies to the value of the sum in a closed form based on geometric series. The value -0.7142857142857143 ≈ -5/7 indicates the sum reduces to -5/7.
