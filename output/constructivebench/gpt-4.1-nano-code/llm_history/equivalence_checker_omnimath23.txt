Ground Truth Answer: {f | ∃ (C : ℝ), C ∈ Set.Icc 0 1 ∧ ∀ (x y : ℤ), f (x, y) = C}
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ c ∈ Set.Icc 0 1, ∀ (x y : ℤ), f (x, y) = c}
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer and the ground truth answer are equivalent. Both express the set of functions f from ℤ × ℤ to ℝ where there exists a constant C (or c) in the interval [0,1] such that for all integers x and y, f(x,y) equals this constant. The only difference is syntactic (using "c ∈ Set.Icc 0 1" versus "C : ℝ, C ∈ Set.Icc 0 1"), but they represent exactly the same mathematical condition.
