The problem describes a scenario involving two rebates, with a relation between them, and asks us to find the sticker price when the difference in rebates is 15. Specifically:

- rebate_A = 0.85 * sticker_price - 90
- rebate_B = 0.75 * sticker_price
- rebate_B - rebate_A = 15

We need to solve for sticker_price given these equations.

Let's derive the solution:
rebate_B - rebate_A = 15  
=> 0.75 * sticker_price - (0.85 * sticker_price - 90) = 15  
=> 0.75 * sticker_price - 0.85 * sticker_price + 90 = 15  
=> -0.10 * sticker_price + 90 = 15  
=> -0.10 * sticker_price = 15 - 90  
=> -0.10 * sticker_price = -75  
=> sticker_price = -75 / -0.10 = 750

Thus, the exact value is 750.

Given the problem constraints, we can implement an enumeration approach: test small sample values around this solution, or directly verify that formula.

Here's a Python program to list candidates for the sticker price:

```python
# Enumerate possible sticker prices within a reasonable range around the computed solution
# to confirm the exact value and potential approximations.

for price in range(700, 801, 1):  # check nearby values
    rebate_A = 0.85 * price - 90
    rebate_B = 0.75 * price
    diff = rebate_B - rebate_A
    print(f"Sticker price: {price}, rebate_A: {rebate_A:.2f}, rebate_B: {rebate_B:.2f}, difference: {diff:.2f}")
```

This code will output the rebate values for sticker prices from 700 to 800, confirming that at price 750, the rebate difference is exactly 15.
