This problem involves summing over integers from 1 to 199, and each term depends on whether n is divisible by 10 and whether n is odd or even.  
The sum can be broken down as follows:

- For n divisible by 10, the term is 0.
- For other n, if n is odd, the term is +1 * n.
- If n is even and not divisible by 10, the term is -1 * n.

We can enumerate terms explicitly to verify this, focusing on the non-zero contributions.  
First, find all n from 1 to 199 that are not divisible by 10:
  
- For odd n: add n.
- For even n (not divisible by 10): subtract n.

Implementing a direct enumeration:

```python
# Enumerate the sum explicitly by iterating over numbers 1..199
total_sum = 0
for n in range(1, 200):
    if n % 10 == 0:
        # term is 0
        continue
    elif n % 2 == 1:
        # odd n
        total_sum += n
        print(f"Adding {n} for odd n")
    else:
        # even, not divisible by 10
        total_sum -= n
        print(f"Subtracting {n} for even n")
print("Sum =", total_sum)
```

This will stream partial calculations and the final sum, helping to identify the exact answer.  
The enumeration efficiently handles the sign and divisibility constraints without unnecessary computations.  

This approach ensures partial results are printed immediately, facilitating conjecture and verification.
