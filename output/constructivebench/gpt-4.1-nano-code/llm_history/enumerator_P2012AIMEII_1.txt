The problem involves finding the number of positive integer solutions (m, n) to the equation 20m + 12n = 2012, where m > 0 and n > 0. We need to enumerate all solutions to identify the total count.

Since 20m + 12n = 2012, we can simplify by dividing through by 4:
5m + 3n = 503

Now, m and n are positive integers satisfying 5m + 3n = 503.

For each possible m > 0, compute n = (503 - 5m)/3, which must be a positive integer. Thus:
- 503 - 5m is divisible by 3
- n > 0

We can iterate m over positive integers such that n > 0 and integer.

Let's implement this logic efficiently, check divisibility, and count solutions.

```python
# Enumerate m > 0 and check if n = (503 - 5m)/3 is a positive integer
solutions = []
for m in range(1, (503 // 5) + 1):
    numerator = 503 - 5*m
    if numerator > 0 and numerator % 3 == 0:
        n = numerator // 3
        if n > 0:
            solutions.append((m, n))
            print((m, n))
# Number of solutions
print("Total solutions:", len(solutions))
```
