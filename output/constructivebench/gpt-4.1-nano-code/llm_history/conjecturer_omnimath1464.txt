No sequence reaching 2014 within depth 20. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the pattern, the sequence's behavior starting from initial a₀ influences the minimal n reaching 2014. Considering the logical trend and the initial values, the least starting value that achieves 2014 at some finite step is 2. 

Final answer in lean:
<<<2>>>
