theorem P2009AIMEII_4 : 
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | ∃ (m : ℕ), ∑ k in Finset.range m, (n + 2 - 2 * (k + 1)) = 2009} P2009AIMEII_4_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Divisor m = 1, computed n = 2009
Divisor m = 7, computed n = 293
Divisor m = 41, computed n = 89
Divisor m = 49, computed n = 89
Divisor m = 287, computed n = 293
Divisor m = 2009, computed n = 2009
Least n = 89 occurs at m = 41. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests that the minimal n is 89 when the divisor m is 41 (or 49). Given the enumeration, the least n is 89, and this occurs when m divides n-1 suitably. The smallest such n consistent with the divisor m = 41 is n = 89.
