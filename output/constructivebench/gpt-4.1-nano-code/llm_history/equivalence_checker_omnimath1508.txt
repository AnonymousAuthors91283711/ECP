abbrev omnimath1508_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath1508 : 
  ∑' (n : ℕ), (fib (n + 1) : ℚ) / (4 ^ (n + 2)) = omnimath1508_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 1/11
Proposed Answer: (3/4 : ℚ)
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about evaluating an infinite series involving Fibonacci numbers and powers of 4.

2. The ground truth answer is 1/11, which is a known result for this type of series involving Fibonacci numbers.

3. The proposed answer is 3/4, which is significantly different from 1/11 (≈0.0909 vs 0.75).

4. To verify, we can consider the generating function for Fibonacci numbers. The sum ∑ fib(n+1)/4^(n+2) can be rewritten as (1/16)∑ fib(n+1)/4^n.

5. Using the generating function ∑ fib(n)x^n = x/(1-x-x²), we can evaluate this at x=1/4 to get (1/4)/(1-1/4-1/16) = (1/4)/(11/16) = 4/11.

6. Therefore, our original sum is (1/16)*(4/11) = 1/44, but this doesn't match either answer. However, if we consider the sum starts at n=0, we get (1/4)/(11/16) = 4/11, which still doesn't match 3/4.

7. The proposed answer 3/4 is clearly incorrect as it doesn't match either calculation or the ground truth.
