Let's analyze the conditions:

- p and q are primes
- p - q is a perfect square
- p * q - q is a perfect square

From p - q = a², so p = q + a².  
And p * q - q = q(p - 1) = b², which implies q divides b², so q divides b, say b = q * c.

Thus, q * (p - 1) = (q c)² → p - 1 = q c² → p = 1 + q c².

Substituting p = q + a² and p = 1 + q c²:  
q + a² = 1 + q c² → a² = 1 + q c² - q → a² = 1 + q (c² - 1)

Since q is prime and divides the RHS, q divides a² - 1 → q divides (a - 1)(a + 1).

Given q is prime, q divides either a - 1 or a + 1.

- If q divides a - 1, then a ≡ 1 mod q
- If q divides a + 1, then a ≡ -1 mod q

In either case, set a = q * k ± 1 for some integer k.

Then a² = (q k ± 1)² = q² k² ± 2 q k + 1

From earlier, a² = 1 + q (c² - 1), so:

q² k² ± 2 q k + 1 = 1 + q (c² - 1)

Subtract 1: q² k² ± 2 q k = q (c² - 1)

Divide both sides by q:

q k² ± 2 k = c² - 1

Rearranged:

c² = q k² ± 2 k + 1

Observe that c² is perfect square, so c = some integer satisfying above.

Therefore, for each integer k, the couple (p,q) is:

p = q + a² = q + (q k ± 1)²

Let's pick the minimal case with a = q * 0 + 1 = 1:

Then a = 1, p = q + 1

Check q dividing (a² - 1): 1 - 1 = 0, divisible by q for all q

Now compute p:

p = q + 1

Check whether p and q are prime, p = q + 1.

So, the pairs are when q is prime and p = q + 1 is prime.  
But q and p can't both be primes unless q = 2 → p=3, which is prime.

Test:

p=3, q=2:

- p - q=1 → is a perfect square? Yes, 1.

- p * q - q= (3*2) - 2= 6 - 2=4, is a perfect square? Yes, 4.

Conclusion: The pair (3,2) satisfies conditions.

Similarly, with other q:

Take q=2, p=3: Valid.

q=3, p=4: 4 is not prime → discard.

q=5, p=6: Not prime → discard.

q=2, p=3 are primes, and conditioned.

Note that the set of such pairs includes all those with p= q + 1, q prime, p prime, p=q+1.

But p= q+1 prime only when q=2, p=3.

Thus, the only pair satisfying all conditions is (3, 2).

Hence the set:

Set of pairs (p,q) where p and q are primes, p= q+1, and both primes.

But p= q+1 with q prime, p prime, holds only when q=2, p=3.

Therefore,

Answer set:

<<<{(3, 2)}>>>
