The problem appears to involve a logic theorem in the style of Lean 4, asking for the cardinality (`ncard`) of a set of integers `α` satisfying certain properties. Specifically, the property `P α` depends on existence of integers `x, y` such that `x^2 = y + α` and `y^2 = x + α`. 

Given the structure, the main goal is to find the number of integers `α` with `|α| ≤ 2005` that satisfy the property `P α` characterized by these equations. We need to understand how `α` relates to `x` and `y`.

---

### Key insights:
- From `x^2 = y + α`, we get `y = x^2 - α`.
- From `y^2 = x + α`, substitute `y`:
  
  ``` 
  (x^2 - α)^2 = x + α 
  ```
  
- Expand:
  
  ```
  x^4 - 2α x^2 + α^2 = x + α
  ```
  
- Rearrange:
  
  ```
  x^4 - 2α x^2 - x + α^2 - α = 0
  ```

This is a quartic in `x` involving parameter `α`. Since `P α` is equivalent to the existence of integers `x, y` with the above relations, for each candidate `α`, we can attempt to find integer solutions `(x, y)`.

### Approach:
- For `|α|` up to 2005, iterate over small `x` values. Because `x` influences the quartic heavily, restrict `x` to a manageable range using estimation or brute-force.
- For each `α` in range, and each candidate `x`, check if `y = x^2 - α` and verify if `y^2 == x + α`. Only then count `α`.

---

### Implementation:
- Use a small `x` range such as `-10000` to `10000` based on the magnitude bounds.
- For each `α`, count the number of valid solutions.
- Print each valid `α` when found, to stream partial answers.

### Code:
```python
# Enumerate α with |α| ≤ 2005
# For each α, check integers x in a range that covers potential solutions
# For each x, compute y = x^2 - α and verify y^2 = x + α
# Print each α for which solutions exist

LIMIT = 2005
X_BOUND = 10000  # Arbitrary large bound to find solutions

for alpha in range(-LIMIT, LIMIT + 1):
    found = False
    for x in range(-X_BOUND, X_BOUND + 1):
        y = x**2 - alpha
        if y**2 == x + alpha:
            print(alpha)
            found = True
            break  # No need to find multiple solutions per α
```

This code efficiently enumerates all `α` in the specified range satisfying the property, streaming each answer immediately.
