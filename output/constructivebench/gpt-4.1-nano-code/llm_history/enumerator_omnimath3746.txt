This problem seems to involve finding a quadratic polynomial \(f \in \mathbb{N}[X]\) such that for every natural number \(n\), there exists \(k \in \mathbb{N}\) with \(f(n) = 2^k\). The statement to prove or disprove is whether such a polynomial does **not** exist.

To assist in conjecturing and possibly finding such \(f\), I will:

- Enumerate all quadratic polynomials with small coefficients.
- For each polynomial, compute \(f(n)\) for some small \(n\).
- Check whether \(f(n)\) is a power of 2 for small \(n\).
- Stream results immediately whenever a candidate polynomial is found that meets or fails the property.

This will effectively help hypothesize whether such a polynomial can exist by looking at small cases.

```python
# Enumerate quadratic polynomials f(x) = a*x^2 + b*x + c
# with small non-negative integer coefficients a, b, c
# For small n in 0..10, check if f(n) is a power of 2.
# Output candidate polynomials that produce powers of 2 for all tested n.

def is_power_of_two(x):
    return x > 0 and (x & (x - 1)) == 0

# Try small coefficients for quadratic polynomials
max_coeff = 5
max_n = 10

for a in range(max_coeff + 1):
    for b in range(max_coeff + 1):
        for c in range(max_coeff + 1):
            # Skip the zero polynomial
            if a == 0 and b == 0 and c == 0:
                continue
            all_power_of_two = True
            for n in range(max_n + 1):
                val = a * n ** 2 + b * n + c
                if val <= 0 or not is_power_of_two(val):
                    all_power_of_two = False
                    break
            if all_power_of_two:
                print(f"Candidate polynomial: f(n) = {a}*n^2 + {b}*n + {c}")
```
