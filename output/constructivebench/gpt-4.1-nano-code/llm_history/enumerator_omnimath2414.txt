The problem appears to involve calculating the product of three parameters: burgers, sides, and drinks, with given specific values. To assist in conjecturing the answer, I will generate all possible combinations of these parameters with small sample values, verify the product, and print each answer as it is found. Since the parameters are fixed in the theorem—burgers=5, sides=3, drinks=12—I will directly compute the product and output it line by line for clarity.

Given the constants, the product is fixed: 5 * 3 * 12 = 180. To align with the task requirements, I will enumerate possible combinations around these small values as a demonstration (e.g., varying each parameter slightly around the given constants), thereby helping in understanding the answer's behavior.

```python
# Enumerate small variations around the given values for burgers, sides, and drinks
for burgers in range(4, 7):  # 3 to 6
    for sides in range(2, 5):  # 2 to 4
        for drinks in range(11, 14):  # 11 to 13
            product = burgers * sides * drinks
            print(product)
```
