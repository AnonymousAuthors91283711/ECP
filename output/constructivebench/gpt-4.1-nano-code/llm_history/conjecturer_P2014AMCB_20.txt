Given the inequalities ☐ and the logs, the key is recognizing the domain: x between 40 and 60, excluding endpoints due to the logs. The log inequality simplifies to (x-40)(60-x)<1, which leads to an empty set when considering integer x in that interval. 

Therefore, the solution set is empty, and its cardinality is 0.
