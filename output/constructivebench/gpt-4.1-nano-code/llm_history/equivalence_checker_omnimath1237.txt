Ground Truth Answer: 20
Proposed Answer: 63
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem presents a system of equations with variables a, b, x, y and asks for the value of a*x⁵ + b*y⁵ given the values for lower exponents.

2. This is a classic problem that can be solved using recurrence relations or Newton's identities. The sequence formed by S_n = a*xⁿ + b*yⁿ satisfies a linear recurrence relation.

3. For such problems, the correct answer is indeed 20. This can be verified by:
   - Establishing the recurrence relation S_{n+2} = p*S_{n+1} + q*S_n
   - Solving for p and q using the given values
   - Then computing S₅ using the recurrence

4. The proposed answer 63 is incorrect. It doesn't satisfy the established recurrence relation that would be derived from the given equations.
