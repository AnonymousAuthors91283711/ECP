This problem asks us to compute the sum of `k^k` for `k` from 1 to 30303, then find the result modulo 101. Since direct computation is infeasible, we use properties of modular arithmetic and patterns in `k^k mod 101`.

Key observations:
- 101 is prime, so Fermat's little theorem applies: for any `a` not divisible by 101, `a^{100} ≡ 1 mod 101`.
- The pattern of `k^k mod 101` repeats periodically because of `k mod 101`.

Our plan:
- For large sums, inspect the sum over one full cycle of length 101.
- Calculate `k^k mod 101` for `k` in 1..101.
- Sum these, then multiply by the number of full cycles in 1..30303.
- Add any remaining terms for the partial cycle at the end.

Number of full cycles:
- 30303 // 101 = 299

Remaining terms:
- 30303 % 101 = 30303 - (299 * 101) = 30303 - 30099 = 204

But since 101 divides 30303 exactly, no extra partial cycle exists (since 101 * 299 = 30099, sum of 101 * 299 = 299 full cycles, remainder sum over 1..204). Wait, but 30303 is divisible by 101? Let's confirm:

`30303 / 101`:
- 101 * 300 = 30,300
- 30303 - 30,300 = 103
- 103 / 101 ≈ 1.02; so 30303 mod 101:
`30303 ≡ 30303 - 101 * 300 = 30303 - 30,300 = 103`, which is less than 101, so remainder is 103.

Thus, total sum is:
- sum over 299 full cycles (each cycle of length 101)
- plus sum over 1..103

But 103 > 101, so the last partial cycle is 1..103, which exceeds one cycle, so we only take first 103 terms of that cycle.

However, since the pattern repeats every 101, the partial cycle is for k=1..103:

- For the first 102 terms: complete cycles (since 299 * 101 = 30,299 terms used)
- Remaining 4 terms: 30000..30303 (additional 3 terms, since total is 30303)

Altogether, 30303 terms.

Implementing in code:

- Compute sum of `k^k mod 101` for `k` in 1..101, store in a list.
- Compute total sum: `full_sum = sum over cycles * number of cycles + partial sum`.
- Output remainder modulo 101.

Here's the code implementing that:

```python
# Compute the sum of k^k modulo 101 for one full cycle of length 101
cycle_length = 101
full_cycles = 30303 // cycle_length
remainder = 30303 % cycle_length

modulus = 101

# Precompute k^k mod 101 for k in 1..101
power_mods = []
for k in range(1, cycle_length + 1):
    # To compute k^k mod 101 efficiently
    base = k % modulus
    exponent = k
    # Use built-in pow with modulus
    val = pow(base, exponent, modulus)
    power_mods.append(val)

full_cycle_sum = sum(power_mods) % modulus

# Sum over full cycles
total_sum = (full_cycle_sum * full_cycles) % modulus

# Sum over remaining terms
partial_sum = sum(power_mods[:remainder]) % modulus

# Total sum modulo 101
answer = (total_sum + partial_sum) % modulus

print(answer)
```
