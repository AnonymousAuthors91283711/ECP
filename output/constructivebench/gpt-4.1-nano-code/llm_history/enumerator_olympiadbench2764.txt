This problem asks us to find the least integer value \( y \) such that there exists some real \( x \) with \( f(x) = y \), where \( f(x) = \frac{x^4 - 6x^3 + 2x^2 - 6x + 2}{x^2 + 1} \).

To do this, I'll consider integer values of \( y \) starting from a small number and check if there exists an \( x \) satisfying the equation \( f(x) = y \). Since \( f \) is a rational function with a quadratic denominator, I will focus on the numerator's behavior and approximate the range of \( f \).

Note: To efficiently find the minimal \( y \) such that \( f(x) = y \) is solvable for some real \( x \), I will evaluate \( f(x) \) over a small sample of \( x \)-values covering both negative and positive ranges, aiming to find the minimal value of \( f(x) \).

```python
import numpy as np

# Define the function f(x) based on the given formula
def f(x):
    numerator = x**4 - 6*x**3 + 2*x**2 - 6*x + 2
    denominator = x**2 + 1
    return numerator / denominator

# Generate a reasonable range of x values to search for minimum
x_values = np.linspace(-10, 10, 1000)  # dense sample to find minimal f(x)

# Evaluate f(x) over these points
f_values = f(x_values)

# Find the minimal value of f(x)
min_f_value = min(f_values)

# Find the x corresponding to this minimal value (approximate)
min_index = np.argmin(f_values)
x_at_min = x_values[min_index]
estimated_min_f = f(x_at_min)
print(f"# Approximate minimum of f(x) over sampled range: {estimated_min_f}")

# Since we need an integer y such that y <= f(x) for some x, the minimal
# value found is approximately the least 'possible' value.

# To find the least integer y, we can take the floor of min_f_value
least_integer_y = int(np.floor(min_f_value))
print(f"abbrev olympiadbench2764_answer : â„¤ := {least_integer_y}")
```
