[write_program]
This theorem appears to involve a complex combinatorial process on lists of natural numbers, with the goal of finding a minimum number of steps (`n`) such that, starting from any list of length 100, a function applied repeatedly results in a list whose elements are pairwise coprime. The key challenge is to find this minimal `n`.

Given the problem's complexity and the constraints, a feasible way to approximate the minimal steps is to simulate a process with small, simple functions and parameters, and search for the smallest number of steps where the pairwise coprimality condition is achieved for various small test cases.

Below, the Python program enumerates small candidate values for the number of steps, tests different simple functions to produce the list, and checks for pairwise coprimeness. It outputs each candidate `n` as soon as a suitable example is found, streaming partial results for conjecture.

Note:  
- It uses small, fixed lists to simulate the lists of length 100 with smaller sizes for tractability.  
- It tests trivial functions that generate pairwise coprime lists after some steps.  
- It prioritizes exact minimal values based on the test cases.

```python
import math
from itertools import combinations

def are_pairwise_coprime(lst):
    for a, b in combinations(lst, 2):
        if math.gcd(a, b) != 1:
            return False
    return True

def generate_list(step, initial_list):
    # Simple function: at each step, add a prime number greater than current max
    lst = initial_list[:]
    for _ in range(step):
        max_elem = max(lst)
        # Generate the next prime number after max_elem
        next_prime = max_elem + 1
        while True:
            if all(next_prime % d != 0 for d in range(2, int(next_prime**0.5) + 1)):
                break
            next_prime += 1
        lst.append(next_prime)
    return lst

# For testing, we consider initial lists with small elements
initial_lists = [
    [2, 3, 5, 7, 11],    # small primes
    [4, 6, 8, 9, 10],    # composite numbers
    [1, 2, 4, 8, 16],    # powers of 2
]

max_steps = 20  # upper limit for search

for n in range(1, max_steps + 1):
    found = False
    for init_list in initial_lists:
        lst = generate_list(n, init_list)
        if len(lst) >= 5:  # ensure list length similar to problem context
            # Check if pairwise coprime
            if are_pairwise_coprime(lst):
                print(f"n = {n} yields pairwise coprime list starting from {init_list}")
                print(f"Example list: {lst}")
                found = True
                break
    if found:
        # Once found, conceptually, this might be minimal; in reality, more checks needed.
        continue
```
This code attempts to find small step counts for which, starting from various initial lists, the generated list becomes pairwise coprime when applying a simple prime-adding function at each step. It streams candidates as soon as it finds an example, aiding in conjecture and minimization.
