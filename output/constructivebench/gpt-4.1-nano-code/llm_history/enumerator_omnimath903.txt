The problem asks to count four-digit numbers (from 1000 to 9999) that have at least one repeated digit. 

The approach:
- Enumerate all four-digit numbers from 1000 to 9999.
- For each number, determine its digits.
- Check if any digit appears more than once.
- Count those numbers that satisfy this.

This straightforward approach is efficient enough within the range and will list each qualifying number as soon as found.

```python
# Enumerate all four-digit numbers from 1000 to 9999
for n in range(1000, 10000):
    digits = [int(d) for d in str(n)]
    # Check for repeated digits
    if len(set(digits)) < 4:
        print(n)
```
