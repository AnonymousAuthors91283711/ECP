Ground Truth Answer: 112
Proposed Answer: 62
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding a pattern in logarithmic terms and deriving a general arithmetic sequence formula.

2. From the given terms:
   - term1 = log(a³b⁷)
   - term2 = log(a⁵b¹²)
   - term3 = log(a⁸b¹⁵)

3. The condition term2 - term1 = term3 - term2 implies this forms an arithmetic sequence.

4. Calculating the common difference d:
   d = term2 - term1 = log(a²b⁵)

5. The general term is:
   seq k = term1 + (k-1)d = log(a^(3+2(k-1))b^(7+5(k-1)))

6. For k=12:
   seq 12 = log(a^(3+22)b^(7+55)) = log(a²⁵b⁶²)

7. The problem asks for the exponent of b when expressed as log(b^n), meaning we need to eliminate the a term. This would require a²⁵ = 1 ⇒ a = 1 (but a > 0 is given, not necessarily =1).

8. The ground truth answer (112) suggests the sequence might be defined differently or there might be a different interpretation.

The proposed answer (62) correctly follows from the arithmetic sequence derivation, but the ground truth suggests a different approach or additional constraints. Since the problem doesn't specify that a=1, the proposed answer seems mathematically correct based on the given information.
