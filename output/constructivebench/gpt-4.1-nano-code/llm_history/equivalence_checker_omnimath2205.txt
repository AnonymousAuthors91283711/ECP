Ground Truth Answer: -4
Proposed Answer: -1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us a polynomial f(X) = X⁴ - 4X³ + 8X² - 7X + 3 and asks us to evaluate a certain sum involving its roots.

2. First, we need to find the roots of the polynomial. Factoring gives:
f(X) = (X-1)²(X² - 2X + 3)
So the roots are: 1 (double root), and 1 ± i√2 (complex roots)

3. The sum in question involves:
- For each root rᵢ, we take rᵢ² divided by the sum of squares of all other roots
- Then we sum this over all roots

4. Calculating this:
- For r₁ = 1: numerator = 1² = 1
  denominator = 1² + (1+i√2)² + (1-i√2)² = 1 + (-1+2i√2) + (-1-2i√2) = -1
  term = 1/(-1) = -1

- For r₂ = 1 (same as above): term = -1

- For r₃ = 1+i√2: numerator = (-1+2i√2)
  denominator = 1² + 1² + (1-i√2)² = 1 + 1 + (-1-2i√2) = 1 - 2i√2
  term = (-1+2i√2)/(1-2i√2) = -1

- For r₄ = 1-i√2: numerator = (-1-2i√2)
  denominator = 1² + 1² + (1+i√2)² = 1 + 1 + (-1+2i√2) = 1 + 2i√2
  term = (-1-2i√2)/(1+2i√2) = -1

5. Total sum = -1 + -1 + -1 + -1 = -4

The ground truth answer is correct (-4), while the proposed answer is -1. They are not equivalent.
