This problem defines a function \( f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \) with certain properties: it is strictly increasing, satisfies initial condition \( f(1) = 1 \), and obeys a recurrence relation involving even and odd inputs. The relation is:

\[
f(2n) \times f(2n + 1) = 9 \times (f(n))^2 + 3 \times f(n)
\]

We need to find \( f(137) \), which is an odd number. To do this, we'll explore possible values of \( f(n) \), starting from the known initial condition, and iteratively compute \( f \) for various \( n \). Since the recurrence involves the term \( f(n) \), we can attempt to find a pattern or a closed-form.

Given the complexity, and no additional constraints, a reasonable approach is to assume the values of \( f(n) \) for small \( n \), and check whether the potential values satisfy the recurrence, returning consistent paths to \( n=137 \).

```python
# Enumerate possible f(n) values starting from known initial condition
# Given the recurrence relation: f(2n)*f(2n+1) = 9*(f(n))^2 + 3*f(n)
# and f(1)=1, f strictly increasing, we explore small candidate values

max_n = 138  # We'll explore up to 138 to include 137

# Store computed f(n) candidates in a dictionary: n -> list of possible f(n)
f_candidates = {1: [1]}

# Function to compute possible f(2n) and f(2n+1) given f(n)
def expand(n):
    results = []
    for f_n in f_candidates.get(n, []):
        rhs = 9 * (f_n)**2 + 3 * f_n
        # Since f(2n)*f(2n+1) = rhs, find factor pairs of rhs
        for i in range(1, rhs + 1):
            if rhs % i == 0:
                j = rhs // i
                # Since f is strictly increasing, enforce order
                # Also, ensure candidate values are integers and consistent
                # We assume f(2n) = i, f(2n+1) = j
                # Both must be >= previous values to maintain monotonicity
                # For initial expansion, just record possibilities
                if i >= 1 and j >= 1:
                    results.append( (2*n, i, 2*n + 1, j) )
    return results

# Expand iteratively up to max_n
from collections import defaultdict
for n in range(1, max_n//2 + 1):
    for new_n, val1, new_n2, val2 in expand(n):
        # Add new candidates if consistent
        f_candidates.setdefault(new_n, []).append(val1)
        f_candidates.setdefault(new_n2, []).append(val2)

# Now, attempt to find a monotonic increasing sequence to n=137
# for each candidate path leading to 137
import itertools

# Filter candidate sequences that reach 137
possible_values = []

# Generate all possible sequences (states) leading to 137
# Due to multiple candidates at each step, this is complex;
# but since the enumerations are small, we can attempt to construct possible f(137)

# For simplicity, check all candidate f(137)
if 137 in f_candidates:
    for val in sorted(set(f_candidates[137])):
        print(f"Possible f(137) value: {val}")
