[write_program]
This problem defines a recursive sequence S(k) based on previous values, with the goal of counting how many times 1988 appears in S(1988). To assist in conjecturing and possibly solving the problem, we'll implement a Python script that generates S(k) for small k values, especially focusing on S(1988), and counts the occurrences of 1988.

Since directly computing S(1988) would be huge, we will:
- Focus on small k (like 0, 1, 2, 3, 4) to identify the pattern.
- For larger k, observe how values evolve and attempt to deduce counting mechanisms.
- For the counting of 1988, note that initial sequences do not contain such large numbers, and the sequence seems to grow gradually, resembling a form of the Fibonacci sequence.

The code will:
- Implement the sequence S(k) up to small k.
- Count occurrences of 1988 for small k where feasible.
- Print all answers, aiding in conjecture.

```python
# Sequence generator for small k, based on the problem's recursive definition.
def S(k):
    if k == 0:
        return []
    elif k == 1:
        return [1, 1]
    else:
        prev = S(k - 1)

        def expand(lst):
            result = []
            for i in range(len(lst)):
                result.append(lst[i])
                if i + 1 < len(lst):
                    result.append(lst[i] + lst[i + 1])
            return result

        return expand(prev)

# Generate and print sequences for small k to observe pattern.
for k in range(5):
    seq = S(k)
    count_1988 = seq.count(1988)
    print(f"S({k}) = {seq}")
    print(f"Count of 1988 in S({k}) = {count_1988}")
```

This code helps in understanding how large numbers appear in the sequence and whether 1988 is likely to occur at all. The sequence resembles a modified Fibonacci sequence starting with [1,1], with each subsequent term being the sum of adjacent pairs. For larger k, the sequence becomes very large, and 1988's occurrence can be inferred or approximated based on the growth pattern observed at small k.
