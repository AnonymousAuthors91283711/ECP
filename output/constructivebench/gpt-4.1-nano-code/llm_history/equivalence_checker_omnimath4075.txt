Ground Truth Answer: fun n p => ∃ k, n = k * p^2
Proposed Answer: fun n p => ∃ (x : ℕ), x * p = n * (n - 1) / 2
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about partitioning numbers from 0 to n-1 into p boxes with certain properties:
   - Disjoint boxes
   - Union covers all numbers
   - Each box has equal sum

2. The ground truth answer states that such a partition exists iff n is a multiple of p² (n = k*p²)

3. The proposed answer states that such a partition exists iff there exists x such that x*p = n(n-1)/2

Analysis:
- The total sum of numbers from 0 to n-1 is n(n-1)/2
- For equal division among p boxes, this sum must be divisible by p (n(n-1)/2 must be divisible by p)
- However, the ground truth condition is stronger - it requires n itself to be divisible by p²
- The proposed answer only captures the divisibility requirement but not the stronger condition

Example where they differ:
- Take n=6, p=3
- 6*5/2 = 15 is divisible by 3 (x=5 satisfies proposed condition)
- But 6 is not divisible by 3²=9 (ground truth fails)
- Indeed, such a partition doesn't exist for n=6, p=3
