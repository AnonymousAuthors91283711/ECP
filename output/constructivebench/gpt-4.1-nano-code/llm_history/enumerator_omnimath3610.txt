The problem appears to involve understanding the relationship between a number's divisors, their divisors, and the sum of these counts. To assist, I'll generate candidate values for \( n \) greater than 1, compute the sum of the counts of divisors of each divisor, and compare it to \( n \). I'll check small \( n \) up to a certain threshold for simplicity.

We follow the instructions:
- Iterate over \( n \) from 2 to 20.
- For each \( n \), compute the divisors, then the sum of counts of their divisors.
- Print cases where the sum equals \( n \).

```python
# Enumerate n from 2 to 20 and check the sum condition
import math

def divisors(k):
    return [d for d in range(1, k + 1) if k % d == 0]

for n in range(2, 21):
    divs = divisors(n)
    sorted_divs = sorted(divs)
    sum_counts = sum(len(divisors(k)) for k in sorted_divs)
    # Output candidates satisfying the condition
    if sum_counts == n:
        print(f"n={n}, divisors={sorted_divs}, sum of their divisor counts={sum_counts}")
```
