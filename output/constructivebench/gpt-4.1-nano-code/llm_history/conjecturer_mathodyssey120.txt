theorem mathodyssey120 : 
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | ∀ (f : Perm (Fin 100)), 
    (∃ (s : Finset (Perm (Fin 100))) (h : s.card = n), 
      ∃ σ ∈ s, ∃ i : Fin 100, σ i = f i)} mathodyssey120_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Minimal n for size 10 with coverage over 20 tests: 4. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The minimal n where for all permutations f of Fin 100, there exists a coverage set s of size n including some σ with f(i) = σ(i) for some i, is 4, as it satisfies the coverage constraint considering the enumerated data pattern.
