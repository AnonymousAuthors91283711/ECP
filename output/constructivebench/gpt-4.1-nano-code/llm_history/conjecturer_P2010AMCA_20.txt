. Enumerated answers: At n=67, a(n) * b(n) = 2010
At n=134, a(n) * b(n) = 2010
At n=201, a(n) * b(n) = 2010
At n=335, a(n) * b(n) = 2010
At n=402, a(n) * b(n) = 2010
At n=670, a(n) * b(n) = 2010
At n=1005, a(n) * b(n) = 2010
At n=2010, a(n) * b(n) = 2010
Maximum n with a(n)*b(n)=2010 is 2010. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<2010>>>

The enumerated indices are multiples of 67, suggesting the product occurs precisely at the maximum n=2010. The problem asks for the greatest such n, which matches the largest enumerated value.
