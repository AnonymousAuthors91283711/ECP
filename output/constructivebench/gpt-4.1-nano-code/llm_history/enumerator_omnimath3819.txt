The problem asks to find all functions \(f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) satisfying:
- \(f(x) \geq 0\) for all \(x\),
- \(f(2) = 0\),
- For \(x \in [0,2)\), \(f(x) \neq 0\),
- The functional equation \(f(xf(y)) \cdot f(y) = f(x + y)\).

Given the constraints, the key observations are:
- \(f(2)=0\),
- \(f\) is non-negative,
- \(f\) is zero at \(x=2\),
- For \(x \in [0,2)\), \(f(x) \neq 0\),
- The functional equation involves compositions and multiplication.

Let's test simple candidate solutions like constant zero, linear functions, etc., and restrict the search to plausible parameters.

```python
# Approximate enumeration based on simple functional forms satisfying constraints
import math

# Candidate functions to check
candidates = []

# Constant zero function: f(x) = 0
# satisfies f(2)=0, non-negativity, but for x in [0,2), f(x)=0 violates f(x)!=0
# So discard

# Linear candidate: f(x) = a * (2 - x) for x in [0, 2]
# with the property that f(2)=0, f(x)>0 for x in [0,2), check the functional equation

# Let's define functions of the form: f(x) = k*(2 - x)^n, with k>=0, n > 0
# Must have f(2)=0, for x<2 f(x)>0, for x in [0,2), f(x)!=0

# We'll test some small integer powers n=1,2,3 and various k

for n in [1, 2, 3]:
    for k in [0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0]:
        def f(x, k=k, n=n):
            if 0 <= x < 2:
                val = k * (2 - x) ** n
                return val
            elif x == 2:
                return 0
            else:
                # For x>2, try extrapolation: pick similarly
                return max(0, k * (x - 2) ** n)
        # Verify the functional equation at sample points
        # Due to complexity, test at x=0, y=1
        x0, y0 = 0.0, 1.0
        try:
            lhs = f(x0 * f(y0))
            rhs = f(x0 + y0)
            lhs_val = lhs * f(y0)
            rhs_val = rhs
            # Check approximate equality
            if abs(lhs_val - rhs_val) < 1e-3:
                # Verify constraints
                if f(2)==0 and all(f(x)>0 for x in [0,1.9]) and f(2)==0:
                    # Accept candidate
                    print(f"Candidate: f(x) = {k} * (2 - x)^{n}")
        except Exception:
            pass

# Also check the simple constant 0 function (though at the boundary)
# f(x)=0 for all x; but f(x)!=0 on [0,2) => discard

# Given the checks, the main candidate forms are:
print("Enumeration complete.")
