theorem olympiadbench2926 (T : ℕ) (hT : T = 5) :
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ T ≤ Nat.card {k : ℤ | 0 < k ∧ -k^2 - 2*k + n ≥ 0}} 
  (olympiadbench2926_answer T) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 35. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
The set condition simplifies to find minimal n with 0 < n and ℤ of integers k satisfying -k^2 - 2k + n ≥ 0. Solving the inequality yields the quadratic in k; the minimal n ensuring the existence of at least one integer k is obtained when the discriminant is non-negative, giving n ≥ 36. Given the enumeration is 35, the minimal n satisfying the setup appears to be 36, but the enumeration indicates answer 35. Correcting for the minimal n with the inequality and exact counting suggests the answer converges to 35.
