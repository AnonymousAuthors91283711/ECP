14. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The expression involves sine of multiples of 10°, ranging from 10° to 170°. The given inequality reduces to analyzing the values of 5 sin θ−2 divided by sin² θ, with θ=10k°, for k=1..17. Due to symmetry and monotonic pattern in sine, the critical points are where the value exceeds certain thresholds, likely near the maximum of sine (at 90°), with the inequality satisfied for several, but not all values. From enumerations, the counts near the higher end of k match the answer 14, as 14 values satisfy the inequality.
