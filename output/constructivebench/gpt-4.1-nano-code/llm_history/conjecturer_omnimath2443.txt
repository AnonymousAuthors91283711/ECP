abbrev omnimath2443_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath2443 (a : ℚ) :
  (∃ B : Matrix (Fin 4) (Fin 4) ℚ, B ^ 2 = !![a, -a, -1, 0; a, -a, 0, -1; 1, 0, a, -a; 0, 1, a, -a]) ↔ a = omnimath2443_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Error: Program is empty. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Based on the pattern and symmetry in the matrix, the answer corresponds to parameterizing the characteristic polynomial or eigenvalues related to a, which suggests the value a must satisfy certain algebraic relations. Observing the structure, the eigenvalues likely involve ±a and ±i or related roots; hence, the real values for a that satisfy B^2 equalling the given matrix are specific. The minimal value, and the consistent solution across the pattern, leads to the conclusion:

<<<0>>>

This is also consistent with the fact that no other algebraic restrictions are presented, and the value a = 0 simplifies the structure to a solvable matrix.
