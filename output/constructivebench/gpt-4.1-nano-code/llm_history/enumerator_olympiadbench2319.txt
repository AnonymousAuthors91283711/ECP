The problem involves finding a specific Skolem sequence of length 18, with known placements for 1 and 8, and a property involving the parity of the elements. We want to generate all candidate sequences satisfying these constraints to help identify the correct sequence.

Key points to implement:
- Generate all length-18 sequences with numbers 1..9, where each k appears exactly twice.
- Enforce fixed positions: s[2] = 1 and s[17] = 8 (using 0-based indexing).
- Only consider sequences where constraints hold.
- Check the parity properties for each potential sequence.
- Output sequences immediately as they are found.

Given the small size (length 18, 9 pairs), we can efficiently generate candidates by fixing known positions, then filling remaining positions from remaining pairs.

```python
from itertools import permutations, combinations
import sys

# Known fixed positions from the theorem
fixed_positions = {2: 1, 17: 8}

# Generate the remaining positions
remaining_positions = [i for i in range(18) if i not in fixed_positions]

# Pairs needed: for numbers 1..9, except 1 and 8 which are fixed
# 1 is already placed: one position (2)
# 8 is already placed: position (17)
# Remaining pairs: for 2..9, excluding 1 and 8, so for 2..9: 7 remaining pairs
# But 1 and 8 are fixed, so pairs for 2..9 include 2,3,4,5,6,7,9 (excluding 1,8)
remaining_numbers = [k for k in range(1, 10) if k not in (1, 8)]
# We'll place these pairs in remaining positions

# Generate all permutations of the remaining numbers for their positions
# Each number appears twice, so for each k in remaining_numbers, choose 2 positions
# This is equivalent to partitioning remaining_positions into pairs labeled with numbers

# Due to combinatorial explosion, limit total candidates
max_candidates = 1000
candidate_count = 0

# Prepare list of position pairs to assign
pos_pairs = list(combinations(remaining_positions, 2))

# Function to check the sequence constraints
def is_valid_seq(seq):
    length = len(seq)
    # check fixed points
    if seq[2] != 1 or seq[17] != 8:
        return False
    # count check
    for k in range(1, 10):
        if seq.count(k) != 2:
            return False
    # check the distance condition
    for k in range(1, 10):
        indices = [i for i, val in enumerate(seq) if val == k]
        if len(indices) != 2:
            return False
        if indices[1] - indices[0] != k:
            return False
    return True

# Enumerate all ways to assign remaining pairs
def generate_sequences():
    global candidate_count
    for perm in permutations(pos_pairs, len(remaining_numbers)):
        seq = [0]*18
        for pos, val in fixed_positions.items():
            seq[pos] = val
        for (i1, i2), num in zip(perm, remaining_numbers):
            seq[i1] = num
            seq[i2] = num
        if is_valid_seq(seq):
            candidate_count += 1
            print(seq)
            if candidate_count >= max_candidates:
                return

generate_sequences()
```
