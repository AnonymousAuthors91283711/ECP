[write_program]
The problem asks for the least prime \( p \) such that \( p \) divides \( 2019^8 + 1 \). To assist in conjecturing the answer, I'll write a Python program that enumerates prime candidates \( p \), checks divisibility, and finds the smallest such prime.

The approach:
- Generate small primes.
- For each prime, check if it divides \( 2019^8 + 1 \).
- Record and print the first prime satisfying this condition.

This way, we can see the candidates and identify the minimal prime.

```python
import sympy

# Target number: 2019^8 + 1
base = 2019
exponent = 8
target = base**exponent + 1

# Generate potential primes up to some threshold
# Since the primes dividing the number are likely small, pick a reasonable upper limit
limit = 10000

# Iterate over primes up to limit
for p in sympy.primerange(2, limit):
    if target % p == 0:
        print(p)
        break
```

This code will print the smallest prime divisor of \( 2019^8 + 1 \).
