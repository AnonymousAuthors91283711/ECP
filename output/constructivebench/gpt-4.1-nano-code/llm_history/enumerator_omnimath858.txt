The problem asks for the number of permutations of the set {0, 1, 2, ..., 9} (i.e., permutations of Fin 10) that satisfy two conditions:
- They have no fixed points (derangements).
- They are involutions, i.e., for every element i, p(p(i)) = i.

An involution with no fixed points means the permutation is a perfect matching: it decomposes into disjoint 2-cycles. Since the permutation is a derangement, it has no 1-cycles, so all cycles are length 2.

Thus, the problem reduces to counting the number of perfect matchings on 10 elements, i.e., the number of pairings of 10 elements into 5 pairs.

The number of such matchings is given by:
\[ \frac{10!}{2^5 \times 5!} \]

which corresponds to the number of ways to partition the set into 5 pairs, considering that within each pair order doesn't matter, and the order of pairs doesn't matter.

Programmatically, we can compute this exact count.

```python
from math import factorial

# Total elements
n = 10
# Number of pairs
k = n // 2

# Count the number of perfect matchings (involutions with no fixed points)
# = n! / (2^k * k!)
answers = factorial(n) // (2 ** k * factorial(k))

print(answers)
```
