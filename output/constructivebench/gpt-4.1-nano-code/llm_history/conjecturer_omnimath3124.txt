theorem omnimath3124 : 
  ∀ (s : ℝ), 4 * s = 28 ↔ s = omnimath3124_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 7.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Based on the enumeration and simple algebra, \( 4s = 28 \implies s = 7 \). The pattern shows that \( s = \frac{28}{4} \). The general solution in Lean is \( 28 / 4 \). 

<<<7.0>>>
