Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {2, 5}
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer {2, 5} is indeed the correct solution set for the problem. We can verify this by checking each number:

1. For n=2:
   - n³+3 = 8+3 = 11
   - n²+7 = 4+7 = 11
   - 11 mod 11 = 0

2. For n=5:
   - n³+3 = 125+3 = 128
   - n²+7 = 25+7 = 32
   - 128 mod 32 = 0

No other natural numbers satisfy the condition, making the proposed answer correct.
