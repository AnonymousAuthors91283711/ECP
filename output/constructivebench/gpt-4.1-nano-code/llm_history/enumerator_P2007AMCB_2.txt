This problem involves calculating the average miles per gallon (MPG) for two cars traveling the same distance, and then expressing the result as a real number. The key is to compute the combined MPG for two vehicles (a car and an SUV) that each travel the same distance, given their individual MPG ratings.

Approach:
- Total distance traveled by each vehicle is 120 miles.
- Total gallons used by each vehicle is distance / mpg.
- Total gallons used together is sum of individual gallons.
- Overall average MPG is total distance / total gallons.

We will evaluate the expression for total gallons, then compute the combined MPG, and print it directly as a floating-point number.

```python
# Calculate the combined miles per gallon for two vehicles traveling the same distance
distance = 120
carMpg = 30
suvMpg = 20

totalDistance = 2 * distance
totalGallons = (distance / carMpg) + (distance / suvMpg)
average_mpg = totalDistance / totalGallons
print(average_mpg)
```
