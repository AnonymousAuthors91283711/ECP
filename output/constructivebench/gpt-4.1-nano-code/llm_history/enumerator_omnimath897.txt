The problem computes the average number of divisors over the set of integers from 1 to 100, divided by the product of the number of divisors and the size of the interval. Essentially, it's the average value of the indicator that `d divides z`, over all divisors `d` of numbers from 1 to 100, and over all `z` in 1..100.

This can be approached by:  
1. Listing all divisors of numbers 1..100.  
2. Computing the sum of all `(1 if d divides z else 0)` values.  
3. Dividing the total sum by `(number of divisors * size of interval)`.

Since the problem uses Lean syntax and sets, but we want a Python script for enumeration, we'll translate this logic into Python:

- Generate divisors for numbers 1..100.
- Loop over each divisor `d` and each `z` in 1..100.
- Count the cases where `d` divides `z`.
- Compute and print the ratio.

Here's the code:

```python
# Enumerate all divisors for numbers 1..100
divisors_list = {}
for n in range(1, 101):
    divisors_list[n] = [d for d in range(1, n+1) if n % d == 0]

D = sum(len(divs) for divs in divisors_list.values())  # Total number of divisors across all numbers
Z = range(1, 101)  # 1..100
total_count = 0

# Count how many times d divides z
for n in range(1, 101):
    for d in divisors_list[n]:
        for z in Z:
            if z % d == 0:
                total_count += 1

# Compute the average
average = total_count / (D * len(Z))
print(average)
```
