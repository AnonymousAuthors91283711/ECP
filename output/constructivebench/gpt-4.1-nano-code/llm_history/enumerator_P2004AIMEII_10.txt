This problem involves enumerating numbers in a very large range (up to 2^40 + 1) that have exactly two '1's in their binary representation, then filtering those divisible by 9. The goal is to compute the probability that such a number is divisible by 9, then find a coprime pair (p,q) with certain properties based on that probability.

Given the scale, the primary challenge is efficient enumeration of numbers with exactly 2 ones in their binary expansion. For small sample testing, we can generate all numbers with exactly 2 bits set within 40 bits, then check their divisibility. We will focus on small parameter regimes for the enumeration to produce candidate answers.

Here's a Python script that enumerates all 40-bit numbers with exactly 2 ones, counts how many are divisible by 9, computes the ratio, and then outputs candidate fractions (p,q), attempting to identify pairs satisfying the problem's conditions.

```python
# Enumerate all 40-bit numbers with exactly two '1's in binary representation
# Count how many are divisible by 9, compute the probability, and find candidate coprime pairs
from math import gcd

# Range for bit positions (0 to 39)
positions = range(40)

S = []
for i in positions:
    for j in range(i + 1, 40):
        n = (1 << i) + (1 << j)
        S.append(n)

divisible_by_9 = [n for n in S if n % 9 == 0]
total = len(S)
count_div_9 = len(divisible_by_9)

# Display probability as a fraction
if total != 0:
    from fractions import Fraction
    prob_frac = Fraction(count_div_9, total)
    
    # Attempt to find small numerator and denominator for p/q
    # such that p and q are coprime, p/q approximates prob
    max_q = 1000
    best_p, best_q, best_diff = 0, 1, 1
    for q in range(1, max_q+1):
        p = round(prob_frac * q)
        if p == 0 or p > q:
            continue
        if gcd(p, q) == 1:
            diff = abs(p/q - float(prob_frac))
            if diff < best_diff:
                best_p, best_q, best_diff = p, q, diff

    # Output the candidate answer as per problem statement
    print(f"Candidate (p, q): ({best_p}, {best_q}) with prob approx {Fraction(best_p, best_q)}")
else:
    print("No numbers with exactly two '1's found in range.")
```
