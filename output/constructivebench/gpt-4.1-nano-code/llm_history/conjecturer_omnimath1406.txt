theorem omnimath1406 (p q : ℕ) (hp : Nat.Prime p) (hq : Nat.Prime q) :
  (∃ a b, p + q = a^2 ∧ p + 7 * q = b^2) ↔ p = omnimath1406_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: p=2, q=2, a=2, b=4. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given that the only enumerated answer is p = 2, q = 2, it suggests the specific primes are fixed, and the expression relates p + q and p + 7q as perfect squares.

Since p = 2, q = 2 simplifies the equations: p + q = 4 = 2^2, and p + 7q = 2 + 14 = 16 = 4^2.

This pattern implies the answer is a fixed value of p.

Thus, the formula p = 2 captures the consistent solution.

Answer in Lean:
<<<2>>>
