The problem asks us to consider all polynomials \( P \in \mathbb{R}[x] \) satisfying a certain functional relation uniformly over all non-zero real \( x, y, z \) with a specific relation involving \( x, y, z \), and then determine the set of such polynomial solutions.

Given the complexity, a practical approach is to test simple polynomial candidates, starting from low degrees, and check whether they satisfy the condition for arbitrary choices of \( x, y, z \). We will:

- Focus on constant and linear polynomials.
- For each candidate polynomial, verify the property over some sample triples \( (x, y, z) \).
- Output candidates satisfying the relation.
- Since we need to stream results and find possible solutions, enumerate systematically, prioritize constants, then lines, etc.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define variables
x, y, z = sp.symbols('x y z')

# Candidate polynomials: degree 0 (constants) and degree 1 (linear)
# We'll test constants first
constant_candidates = [sp.sympify(c) for c in range(-3, 4)]  # small sample constants

solutions = []

# Check constant polynomials
for c in constant_candidates:
    P = c
    # Test for several (x, y, z)
    def check(cand):
        # Generate several sample triples satisfying the given relation
        samples = [
            (1, 2, 0.5),
            (2, 3, 4),
            (-1, -2, -0.5),
            (0.1, 0.2, 0.3),
            (1, -1, 2),
        ]
        for xs in samples:
            xi, yi, zi = xs
            # Avoid zero values as per condition
            if xi == 0 or yi == 0 or zi == 0:
                continue
            # Check the given implication
            left = cand.evalf().subs(x, xi)/ (yi * zi) + cand.evalf().subs(y, yi)/ (zi * xi) + cand.evalf().subs(z, zi)/ (xi * yi)
            rhs = cand.evalf().subs(x, xi - yi) + cand.evalf().subs(y, yi - zi) + cand.evalf().subs(z, zi - xi)
            if abs(left - rhs) > 1e-6:
                return False
        return True

    if check(c):
        print(c)

# Check linear polynomials: P(x) = a*x + b
# For a small grid of (a, b) values
for a in [-1, 0, 1]:
    for b in range(-2, 3):
        P = a * x + b
        def check_linear(P_poly):
            samples = [
                (1, 2, 0.5),
                (2, 3, 4),
                (-1, -2, -0.5),
                (0.1, 0.2, 0.3),
                (1, -1, 2),
            ]
            for xs in samples:
                xi, yi, zi = xs
                if xi == 0 or yi == 0 or zi == 0:
                    continue
                left = P_poly.evalf().subs(x, xi)/ (yi * zi) + P_poly.evalf().subs(y, yi)/ (zi * xi) + P_poly.evalf().subs(z, zi)/ (xi * yi)
                rhs = P_poly.evalf().subs(x, xi - yi) + P_poly.evalf().subs(y, yi - zi) + P_poly.evalf().subs(z, zi - xi)
                if abs(left - rhs) > 1e-6:
                    return False
            return True
        if check_linear(P):
            print(P)
```

This code:
- Checks constant polynomials \( P(x) = c \) to see if they satisfy the relation.
- Checks linear polynomials \( P(x) = a x + b \) over a small parameter grid.
- Uses sample triples where \( x, y, z \neq 0 \) to verify the property approximately.
- Prints candidates that satisfy the condition.

This process identifies possible solutions or indicates that only certain polynomials qualify, assisting in formulating the conjecture.
