The problem involves examining numbers a₁ between 1 and 2008 for which the Collatz step repeatedly produces values greater than a₁ over a sequence of three iterations. The task is to count such numbers.

To assist, we'll enumerate all numbers from 1 to 2008 satisfying the conditions:
- a₁ > 0 and a₁ ≤ 2008
- collatz_step a₁ > a₁
- collatz_step (collatz_step a₁) > a₁
- collatz_step (collatz_step (collatz_step a₁)) > a₁

We will print all candidates immediately as they're found and determine the total count, which is the answer. Since the total number of candidates may be large but should be manageable, this enumeration is straightforward and efficient.

```python
def collatz_step(a):
    return a // 2 if a % 2 == 0 else 3 * a + 1

count = 0
for a in range(1, 2009):
    s1 = collatz_step(a)
    s2 = collatz_step(s1)
    s3 = collatz_step(s2)
    if s1 > a and s2 > a and s3 > a:
        print(a)
        count += 1

print("Count:", count)
```
This script outputs all numbers within the range [1, 2008] satisfying the conditions, allowing for evaluation and conjecture of the total count.
