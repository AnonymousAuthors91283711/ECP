This problem asks for the smallest non-negative integer \( n \) such that there exists a \( k \) with the following properties:
- \( 123456789 \times 10^n = k \times (2^{26} \times 5^{4}) \),
- and \( k \) is coprime with 10.

Rearranged, we have:
\[ k = \frac{123456789 \times 10^n}{2^{26} \times 5^{4}}. \]

Since \( 10^n = 2^n \times 5^n \), the expression for \( k \) becomes:
\[ k = \frac{123456789 \times 2^{n} \times 5^{n}}{2^{26} \times 5^{4}} = 123456789 \times 2^{n - 26} \times 5^{n - 4}. \]

For \( k \) to be an integer, the powers of 2 and 5 in numerator must be at least as large as in denominator:
- \( n - 26 \geq 0 \implies n \geq 26 \),
- \( n - 4 \geq 0 \implies n \geq 4 \).

The first condition dominates, so \( n \geq 26 \).

Now, \( k = 123456789 \times 2^{n - 26} \times 5^{n - 4} \).

To ensure \( \gcd(k, 10) = 1 \), \( k \) must be coprime with 10, i.e., not divisible by 2 or 5.

- \( 2 \mid k \) if and only if \( 2^{n - 26} \) contains a factor of 2, i.e., \( n - 26 \geq 1 \) (meaning \( n \geq 27 \)), and \( 123456789 \) is odd.
- \( 5 \mid k \) if and only if \( 5^{n - 4} \) contains a factor of 5, i.e., \( n - 4 \geq 1 \) (meaning \( n \geq 5 \)).

Since \( 123456789 \) has no factors of 2 or 5, \( k \) is divisible by 2 if \( n > 26 \),
and divisible by 5 if \( n > 4 \).

But \( N \geq 26 \), so:

- For \( n = 26 \):
  \( k = 123456789 \times 2^{0} \times 5^{22} \).

Since \( 5^{22} \) is divisible by 5, \( k \) is divisible by 5, so \( \gcd(k, 10) \neq 1 \).

- For \( n = 27 \):
  \( k = 123456789 \times 2^{1} \times 5^{23} \),
  divisible by 2 and 5, gcd not 1.

- For \( n = 28 \):
  \( k = 123456789 \times 2^{2} \times 5^{24} \),
  still divisible by 2 and 5.

Similarly, at each \( n \geq 26 \), \( k \) contains both 2 and 5 as factors, unless we can get rid of these factors.

Wait, no, because the exponents are increasing, all \( n > 26 \) produce \( k \) divisible by both 2 and 5.

Since \( 123456789 \) is coprime with 10, \( k \) is divisible by 2 if \( n > 26 \), and divisible by 5 if \( n > 4 \).

Therefore, to ensure \( \gcd(k, 10) = 1 \), the only possibility is at the minimal \( n \) where \( k \) is not divisible by 2 or 5.

But this can't happen because for all \( n \geq 26 \),
\[
k = 123456789 \times 2^{n-26} \times 5^{n-4}
\]
contains factors of 2 and 5 unless \( n = 26 \) and \( n = 4 \).

However, the lower bound for \( n \) is 26 (from divisibility), thus the minimal \( n \) where \( k \) is coprime with 10 is at \( n = 26 \) when the powers of 2 and 5 are zero. But at \( n=26 \):
\[
k = 123456789 \times 2^{0} \times 5^{22},
\]
which is divisible by 5 \( (5^{22}) \). So gcd isn't 1.

Similarly, at \( n=26 \), \( k \) is divisible by 5, not coprime.

At \( n=27 \),
\[
k = 123456789 \times 2^{1} \times 5^{23},
\]
divisible by 2 and 5.

Similarly for larger \( n \), \( k \) remains divisible by both.

Thus, the only chance is when \( 5^{n-4} \) has \( n-4 = 0 \to n=4 \), but that violates earlier bounds.

Re-examining, it seems no \( n \) makes \( k \) coprime with 10 unless the power of 5 in \(k\) is zero, i.e., when \( n - 4 = 0 \implies n=4 \).

At \( n=4 \), 
\[
k = 123456789 \times 2^{4-26} \times 5^{0} = 123456789 \times 2^{-22}.
\]
But \( 2^{-22} \) is not an integer, invalid. So \( n \geq 26 \).

Since the expression for \(k\) always contains factors of both 2 and 5 for \( n \geq 26 \), \(k\) is divisible by both 2 and 5 for \( n > 26 \), so gcd \( > 1 \).

Observation: To have \( \gcd(k, 10)=1 \), \(k\) cannot be divisible by 2 or 5, which implies that the powers of 2 and 5 in \(k\) must be zero, but for \( n \geq 26 \), these powers are positive. 

Therefore, the only candidate is at \( n = 26 \):

\[
k = 123456789 \times 2^{0} \times 5^{22}.
\]

Because \( 5^{22} \) divides \(k\), \(k\) is divisible by 5, so gcd is not 1.

At \( n = 26 \), \(k\) is divisible by 5.

Similarly for larger \( n \), \(k\) is divisible by 2 and 5, so gcd cannot be 1 for any \( n \ge 26 \).

**Conclusion: no such \( n \ge 26 \) makes \(k\) coprime with 10.**

But original problem asks for the least \( n \) so that such \(k\) exists with the properties, and the condition is \( \text{IsLeast} \).

Given that, the only way \(k\) is coprime with 10 is if \(k\) has no factors of 2 or 5, which can't happen for \( n \ge 26 \) because \(k\) forms include these factors.

**Thus, the answer is no such \( n \).**

But since the theorem asks to find the least \(n\) with such property, perhaps they mean the minimal \( n \) for which such \(k\) exists even if gcd slightly larger? Usually, the basis would be to check small \( n \), but limits don't align.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem's intended meaning is that the minimal \(n\) for which \(k\) is an integer and co-prime with 10 is if \( n \)

Given your instructions to enumerate, here's a Python approach:

- Check \( n \) from 0 upwards (say up to 30).
- For each \( n \), compute \( k \).
- Check if \( k \) is integer.
- Check gcd with 10.

In the code, I'll explore this brute-force for small \( n \).

```python
import math

# Since k = (123456789 * 10^n) / (2^26 * 5^4)
# 10^n = 2^n * 5^n
# So, k = 123456789 * 2^n * 5^n / (2^26 * 5^4) = 123456789 * 2^(n-26) * 5^(n-4)
# For n < 26 or n < 4, handle accordingly. We'll check for n from 0 to 50.
for n in range(0, 51):
    numerator = 123456789 * (2 ** n) * (5 ** n)
    denominator = (2 ** 26) * (5 ** 4)
    if numerator % denominator == 0:
        k = numerator // denominator
        # check if gcd(k,10)=1
        if math.gcd(k, 10) == 1:
            print(f"n = {n}, k = {k}")
```

This code searches for the minimal \(n\) where \(k\) is integer and coprime with 10.

Since for now we're to output this code, of course, I'll respect the token limit. Here's the final code:

```python
import math

# Enumerate n from 0 to 50 to find the smallest n with k integer and coprime with 10
for n in range(0, 51):
    numerator = 123456789 * (2 ** n) * (5 ** n)
    denominator = (2 ** 26) * (5 ** 4)
    if numerator % denominator == 0:
        k = numerator // denominator
        if math.gcd(k, 10) == 1:
            print(f"n = {n}, k = {k}")
```

The problem requires finding the minimal non-negative integer n such that (123456789 * 10^n) / (2^26 * 5^4) yields an integer k coprime with 10. The original code correctly models the algebraic relationship, iterates over n from 0 to 50, and checks whether the numerator is divisible by the denominator, then checks coprimality.

However, the code seems to produce no output—possibly because for all n in [0,50], the divisibility condition isn't satisfied, or the range is not sufficient.

Key observations:

- 10^n = 2^n * 5^n, leading to k = 123456789 * 2^{n-26} * 5^{n-4}.
- For n < 26, n−26<0, so 2^{n-26} is fractional (but in integer arithmetic, that won't occur, so the check must confirm numerator divisibility).
- For k to be an integer, numerator must be divisible by denominator, which is 2^{26} * 5^4.
- The numerator is 123456789 * 2^n * 5^n.

Divisibility conditions:

- For 2^{26} dividing numerator: numerator must include at least 2^{26} → as numerator includes 2^n, need n ≥ 26.
- For 5^4 dividing numerator: numerator includes 5^n, so n ≥ 4.
  
Thus, minimal n is at least max(26,4)=26, potentially larger.

To find the minimal n satisfying both:

- n ≥ 26 (for 2^26)
- n ≥ 4 (for 5^4)

Check n starting at 26 upwards to find the minimal n where numerator is divisible by denominator.

Also, we should check for coprimality between k and 10, i.e., gcd(k,10)=1.

Given that, the code should:

- Loop from n=26 to an upper limit, say 50.
- For each n, check if numerator divisible by denominator.
- If yes, compute k, check if gcd(k,10)=1.
- When found, print, and stop, since the minimal n.

The problem involves finding the least (smallest) non-negative integer n such that there exists a K satisfying:

123456789 * 10^n = K * (2^{26} * 5^4),  
with the condition that K is coprime with 10.

Given the original program is missing, and only an error message mentions an empty program, we need to interpret and produce a complete solution that satisfies the problem requirements.

Analysis:
- The key equation is: 123456789 * 10^n = K * 2^{26} * 5^{4}
- Since 10^n = 2^n * 5^n, rewrite as:
  123456789 * 2^n * 5^n = K * 2^{26} * 5^{4}
- To solve for K:
  K = (123456789 * 2^n * 5^n) / (2^{26} * 5^{4}) = 123456789 * 2^{n-26} * 5^{n-4}
- For K to be an integer, exponents must be ≥ 0:
  n - 26 ≥ 0 ⇒ n ≥ 26
  n - 4 ≥ 0 ⇒ n ≥ 4
  Combined: n ≥ 26
- For K to be coprime with 10 (i.e., coprime with 2 and 5), K's prime factors 2 and 5 should not appear in K.
- But from above, K = 123456789 * 2^{n-26} * 5^{n-4}
- To ensure coprimality with 10, the exponents of 2 and 5 in K must be zero:
  2^{n-26} = 1 ⇒ n - 26 = 0 ⇒ n = 26
  5^{n-4} = 1 ⇒ n - 4 = 0 ⇒ n = 4
- Both conditions: n = 26 AND n = 4 are incompatible unless n equals both simultaneously (which is impossible).
  
Therefore, the only way for K to be coprime with 10 is for it to have no factors 2 or 5, which implies:
- n = 26 ⇒ then K = 123456789 * 2^{0} *
