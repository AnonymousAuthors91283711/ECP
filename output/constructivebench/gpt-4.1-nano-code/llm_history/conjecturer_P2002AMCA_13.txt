    a + b = P2002AMCA_13_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: a = 1.618033988749895
b = 0.6180339887498949
a + b = 2.23606797749979. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Based on the enumerated example, a and b satisfy a - 1 = 1 / a and b - 1 = 1 / b, leading to quadratic equations a² - a - 1 = 0 and b² - b - 1 = 0. These have solutions involving the golden ratio φ = (1 + √5)/2 and its conjugate. Thus, a = φ, b = (1 - √5)/2. Since a ≠ b and both are positive, the sum a + b = φ + (1 - φ) = 1 + √5 / 2 + (1 - (1 + √5) / 2) = √5. Finite calculations show the sum is √5.
