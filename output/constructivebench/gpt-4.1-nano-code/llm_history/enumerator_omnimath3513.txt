This problem asks us to find all values \( x \in \{-2, -\frac{1}{2}, 0, \frac{1}{2}, 2\} \) such that \( x > x^2 \). We need to programmatically examine each candidate and determine whether it satisfies \( x > x^2 \). The goal is to enumerate all solutions, streaming results as they are found.

Plan:
- For each candidate in the set, check if \( x > x^2 \).
- If true, print \( x \).
- Collect all such \( x \) in a set and assign it to `omnimath3513_answer`.

Here's the implementation:

```python
# Enumerate the given set of x-values and test the inequality x > x^2
def main():
    xvals = [-2, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 2]
    solution_set = set()

    for x in xvals:
        if x > x**2:
            print(x)  # stream partial result
            solution_set.add(x)

    # Assign the found solutions to the answer variable
    omnimath3513_answer = solution_set

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
