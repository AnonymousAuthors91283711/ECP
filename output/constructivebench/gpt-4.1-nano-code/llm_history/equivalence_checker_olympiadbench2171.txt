theorem olympiadbench2171 (f : ℚ → ℚ) :
  (∀ x y : ℚ, f (x * f x + y) = f y + x^2) ↔ f ∈ olympiadbench2171_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {fun x => x, fun x => -x}
Proposed Answer: {f : ℚ → ℚ | ∃ s : ℚ, (s = 1 ∨ s = -1) ∧ ∀ x, f x = s * x}
<<<True>>>

Explanation: The ground truth answer lists the two specific functions f(x) = x and f(x) = -x. The proposed answer describes the set of all functions f where f(x) = s*x with s being either 1 or -1. These are exactly the same two functions described in different ways - one by explicit enumeration and the other by a parameterized description. Both answers correctly identify the only two solutions to the given functional equation.
