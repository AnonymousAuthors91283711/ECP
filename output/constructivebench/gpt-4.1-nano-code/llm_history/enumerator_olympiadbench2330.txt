[write_program]
This problem involves solving a set of equations with real variables `(x, y, z)` under given constraints. The goal is to enumerate solutions that satisfy:

1. `(x - 1) * (y - 2) = 0`, which implies either `x = 1` or `y = 2`.
2. `(x - 3) * (z + 2) = 0`, which implies either `x = 3` or `z = -2`.
3. `x + y * z = 9`.

To generate solutions systematically, we consider the possible cases for `x` from the first two equations, then check if the third is satisfied with possible `y` and `z`. We'll pick small sample values for each split case.

```python
# Program to enumerate solutions satisfying the equations:
# (x-1)*(y-2) = 0, (x-3)*(z+2) = 0, and x + y*z = 9.
# The enumeration considers cases for x: x=1 or y=2, and x=3 or z=-2.

solutions = []

# Case 1: x=1 (from first equation)
x = 1
# For second equation:
# (x-3)*(z+2)=0 -> (1-3)*(z+2)=0 -> (-2)*(z+2)=0 -> z=-2
z_candidates = [-2]
for z in z_candidates:
    # third equation: x + y*z=9 -> 1 + y*(-2)=9 -> y*(-2)=8 -> y=-4
    y = -4
    solutions.append((x,y,z))
    print((x,y,z))

# Case 2: y=2 (from first equation)
# x can be any, but to satisfy the third:
# x + 2*z=9 -> z=(9 - x)/2
# For second equation:
# (x-3)*(z+2)=0 -> either x=3 or z=-2
# Subcase 2a: x=3
x = 3
z = (9 - x)/2  # z = (9-3)/2=3
# z=-2? Let's check:
# z=3 != -2, so coordinate (x, z) does not satisfy second equation unless z=-2,
# but that can't be with x=3 unless z=-2 but then z=3 and -2 are different,
# so z=3 does not satisfy (x-3)*(z+2)=0 with z=-2, so discard. Alternatively:
# Wait, second eq: (x-3)*(z+2)=0, with x=3:
# (0)*(z+2)=0 always true, so any z when x=3.

# So for x=3, second equation holds for any z.
# Now third: 3 + 2*z=9 => 2*z=6 => z=3
solutions.append((3, 2, 3))
print((3, 2, 3))

# Z can be -2 (from second equation), check third:
# For z = -2, third: x + y*(-2)=9 -> 3 + 2*(-2)=3 -4=-1 ≠ 9, discard.

# Subcase 2b: z=-2 (from second equation)
# For z=-2, third: x + y*(-2)=9 -> x - 2*y=9
# y= (x - 9)/(-2) = (9 - x)/2
# From first eq: y=2 or x=1
# - If y=2, then y=2
# 2 = (9 - x)/2 -> 4=9 - x -> x=5
# Check first eq: (x-1)*(y-2)= (5-1)*(2-2)=4*0=0, OK
# Now check second eq:
# (x-3)*(z+2)= (5-3)*(-2+2)=2*0=0, OK
# third: x + y*z= 5 + 2*(-2)=5 -4=1 ≠ 9, discard

# - If x=1, then from y= (9 - x)/2= (9-1)/2=8/2=4
# Check first eq: (1-1)*(4-2)=0*2=0, OK
# second: (1-3)*(-2+2)= (-2)*0=0, OK
# third: 1 + 4*(-2)= 1 -8= -7≠9, discard

# No valid solutions here.

# Summary of solutions found:
# (1, -4, -2)
# (3, 2, 3)

# Output solutions explicitly
# Already printed solutions during enumeration.
