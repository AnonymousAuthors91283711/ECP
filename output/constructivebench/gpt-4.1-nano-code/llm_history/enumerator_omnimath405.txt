This problem resembles the form of a hyperbolic identity where \( x = a - \frac{1}{a} \) and \( y = a + \frac{1}{a} \) for some \( a \). Specifically:
\[
x = a - \frac{1}{a}, \quad y = a + \frac{1}{a}
\]
then:
\[
x^2 - y^2 = (a - \frac{1}{a})^2 - (a + \frac{1}{a})^2
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-4
\]
for any \( a \neq 0 \). The code involves powers of 2001 and inverse powers, which aligns with this pattern. We will approximate and confirm this behavior numerically by choosing small \( a \) close to \( 2001 \) and observe the difference.

```python
import math

# Parameters: test different 'a' values close to 2001
test_as = [2001, 2001 + 1, 2000.5, 1999, 3000]

for a in test_as:
    x = a - 1 / a
    y = a + 1 / a
    result = x**2 - y**2
    print(f"a = {a}, x = {x}, y = {y}, x^2 - y^2 = {result}")
```

This code tests various values of \( a \), computes \( x \), \( y \), and their difference of squares, effectively illustrating the pattern and confirming the conjectured value.
