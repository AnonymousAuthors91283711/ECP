This problem involves constructing a set of 2019 natural numbers with specific properties related to sequences and divisibility conditions involving GCDs and sums of squares. To explore potential solutions, we can attempt to generate sequences satisfying the divisibility conditions with small, manageable parameters and verify if the resulting set contains 2019 elements.

The approach:
- Define a small parameter for `k` (say, 0) and generate a sequence based on simple patterns (e.g., constant, linear).
- Collect the sequence elements into a set `S`.
- Check if the set size reaches 2019.
- Print each candidate as soon as it satisfies the length condition for analysis.

This can reveal whether such a set with the required properties can exist with simple sequences.

```python
# Explore sequences based on small parameters to find large sets satisfying the conditions
# The conditions involve GCD divisibility relations; starting with simple sequences for feasibility.

def gcd_divides(a, b):
    from math import gcd
    return (a != 0 and b != 0 and (a % gcd(a, b) == 0))

max_elements = 2019
k = 0  # small parameter
sequence = []

# Define a simple sequence, e.g., constant sequence or linear sequence
# Here, we try with sequence = n for n in natural numbers
S = set()

n = 1
while len(S) < max_elements:
    a = n  # simple sequence: a_n = n
    # Check conditions for the new element 'a' against existing elements in S
    valid = True
    for x in S:
        # Check if gcd divides the sum of squares condition
        from math import gcd
        g = gcd(a, x)
        # sum of squares condition
        # Be cautious: actual divisibility check
        sum_condition1 = ((a**2 + x**2) % g == 0)
        sum_condition2 = (((a) * (a) + (x) * (x)) % g == 0)
        # gcd divides m^2 + n^2
        gcd_condition = ( (a % g == 0) and (x % g == 0) )

        # For simplicity, assume divisibility checks
        if not (gcd_divides(a, x) and sum_condition1 and sum_condition2):
            valid = False
            break
    if valid:
        S.add(a)
        print(f"Candidate set size: {len(S)} with element: {a}")
        if len(S) == max_elements:
            print(f"Reached {max_elements} elements with sequence starting at {n}")
            break
    n += 1
```
