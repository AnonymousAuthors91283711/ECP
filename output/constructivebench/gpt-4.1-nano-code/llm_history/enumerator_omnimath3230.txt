This problem involves understanding the maximal number of separating lines for finite sets of points in the plane. Based on the geometric interpretation, for a finite set of n points, the maximum number of *distinct* separating lines (each line strictly separating some subset) is known to be related to combinatorial geometry results.

Since the exact open theorem is quite complex and the problem is at a competition level, I'll provide an enumeration that tests small values (n from 1 up to a small threshold), assuming the maximum number is bounded roughly by binomial(n, 2). The code directly enumerates small finite sets and sees how many different separating lines could exist, then finds the maximum.

Note: This is an approximate and exploratory enumeration, not a formal proof, suitable for conjecturing what the maximum is. It prints each candidate count when evaluated, prioritizing easy-to-execute and transparent enumeration.

```python
import itertools

def generate_point_sets(n):
    # Generate small sets of points with integer coordinates for simplicity
    points = []
    for x in range(0, 3):
        for y in range(0, 3):
            points.append((x, y))
    for comb in itertools.combinations(points, n):
        yield comb

def count_separating_lines(points):
    lines = set()
    for p1, p2 in itertools.combinations(points, 2):
        if p1 != p2:
            # Compute line coefficient (a, b, c): derive from two points
            a = p2[1] - p1[1]
            b = p1[0] - p2[0]
            c = p2[0]*p1[1] - p1[0]*p2[1]
            # Normalize for uniqueness
            g = abs(gcd(gcd(a, b), c))
            if g != 0:
                a //= g
                b //= g
                c //= g
            lines.add((a, b, c))
    return len(lines)

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

max_counts = {}
for n in range(1, 7):
    max_sep = 0
    for s in generate_point_sets(n):
        count = count_separating_lines(s)
        if count > max_sep:
            max_sep = count
        print(f'n={n}, set={s}, separating lines={count}')
    max_counts[n] = max_sep
    print(f'Max separating lines for n={n}: {max_sep}')

# Find overall maximum
overall_max = max(max_counts.values())
print(f'Overall maximum separating lines across small sets: {overall_max}')
```
