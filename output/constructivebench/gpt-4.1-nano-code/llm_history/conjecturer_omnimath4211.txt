Given the pattern, the gcd is closely tied to factorization patterns of S(n), notably powers of 2 and specific factors from the sum's structure. Observed gcds often involve 162, 162000, or 2, with cases indicating gcd divides into 162 or multiples thereof. The consistent presence of 2 as a base factor for all gcds suggests the final general form simplifies to the gcd dividing 2 times a power of 3 or a multiple involving 162. Based on enumeration, the recurring prime factors suggest gcd is always divisible by 2, and the gcd pattern correlates with the divisibility of S(n) and S(3n). The most frequent minimal gcd is 2, scaled up for some n.
