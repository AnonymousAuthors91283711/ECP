Let's analyze and find the minimal value of n satisfying the system. The key observations are:

- The logs give equations for sums of x, y, z that we can exponentiate to find relationships between x, y, z.
- Each log condition relates to the sums, and the exponents involve the ratios p/q. Our goal is to find positive x, y, z satisfying all conditions and find the minimal n=p+q.

We will:
- Convert logs to exponential forms.
- Solve for x, y, z in terms of the logs.
- Use constraints to find minimal p+q.

Here's the code that enumerates integer solutions for p, q with small bounds, and computes corresponding n:

```python
# Enumerate small p, q to find minimal n = p + q satisfying the given conditions
for p in range(1, 20):
    for q in range(1, 20):
        # p/q ratio
        r = p / q
        # Compute x + y + z = exp(0) = 1
        sumxyz = 1
        # x + y - z = exp(-1)
        sum_xy_minus_z = 2.718281828459045 ** -1  # Approximate e^-1
        # x - y + z = exp(-2)
        sum_x_minus_y_plus_z = 2.718281828459045 ** -2  # e^-2
        # -x + y + z = exp(-3)
        neg_x_plus_y_plus_z = 2.718281828459045 ** -3  # e^-3

        # Set up equations from above
        # Let's solve for x, y, z
        # Using equations:
        # 1) x + y + z = sumxyz
        # 2) x + y - z = sum_xy_minus_z
        # 3) x - y + z = sum_x_minus_y_plus_z
        # 4) -x + y + z = neg_x_plus_y_plus_z

        # Solve for x, y, z using the equations
        # From (1) and (2): z = (sumxyz - sum_xy_minus_z)/2
        z = (sumxyz - sum_xy_minus_z) / 2
        # From (1) and (3): y = (sumxyz + sum_x_minus_y_plus_z - x) / 2
        # but better to solve directly:
        # sum_xy_minus_z = x + y - z
        # sum_x_minus_y_plus_z = x - y + z

        # Express x, y in terms of z:
        # From (1): x + y = sumxyz - z
        # From (2): x + y = sum_xy_minus_z + z
        # Equate:
        # sumxyz - z = sum_xy_minus_z + z
        # => sumxyz - sum_xy_minus_z = 2z
        # Calculate z:
        z_calc = (sumxyz - sum_xy_minus_z) / 2
        # Consistent with previous z, so use z_calc
        
        # Now, from (1): x + y = sumxyz - z
        x_plus_y = sumxyz - z_calc
        # From (3): x - y = sum_x_minus_y_plus_z - z
        x_minus_y = sum_x_minus_y_plus_z - z_calc

        # Solve for x and y:
        x = (x_plus_y + x_minus_y) / 2
        y = (x_plus_y - x_minus_y) / 2

        # Check positivity
        if x > 0 and y > 0 and z_calc > 0:
            # Check if x * y^5 * z matches the form (1/2)^{p/q}
            product = x * y**5 * z_calc
            # Compute log base 1/2 of product:
            # log_{1/2}(product) = log(product)/log(1/2)
            # log(1/2) = -ln(2)
            from math import log
            log_product = log(product)
            log_half = -log(2)
            ratio = log_product / log_half
            # Check if ratio close to p/q
            approximate_q = round(q)
            approximate_p = round(ratio * q)
            # Validate ratio
            if abs(approximate_p / approximate_q - ratio) < 0.01:
                n = p + q
                print(f"Found solution: p={p}, q={q}, n={n}")
```

This script tests small p, q, computes x, y, z, and checks if the product matches the ratio p/q of powers of 1/2. It prioritizes exact rational approximations within a small epsilon, aiding in the guesswork. The minimal n from these solutions would be the answer.

```python
# Enumerate small p, q to find minimal n = p + q satisfying the given conditions
for p in range(1, 20):
    for q in range(1, 20):
        sumxyz = 1
        sum_xy_minus_z = 2.718281828459045 ** -1
        sum_x_minus_y_plus_z = 2.718281828459045 ** -2
        neg_x_plus_y_plus_z = 2.718281828459045 ** -3

        z = (sumxyz - sum_xy_minus_z) / 2
        x_plus_y = sumxyz - z
        x_minus_y = sum_x_minus_y_plus_z - z

        x = (x_plus_y + x_minus_y) / 2
        y = (x_plus_y - x_minus_y) / 2

        if x > 0 and y > 0 and z > 0:
            from math import log
            product = x * y**5 * z
            ratio = log(product) / -log(2)
            approx_p = round(ratio * q)
            approx_q = q
            if abs(approx_p / approx_q - ratio) < 0.01:
                n = p + q
                print(f"Solution with p={p}, q={q} yields minimal n={n}")
```
