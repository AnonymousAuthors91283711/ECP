Ground Truth Answer: 97/36
Proposed Answer: (25 : ℚ) / 9
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us x + 1/x = 13/6 and asks for x² + 1/x²
2. To solve this, we can square both sides of the given equation:
   (x + 1/x)² = (13/6)²
   x² + 2 + 1/x² = 169/36
3. Then subtract 2 from both sides:
   x² + 1/x² = 169/36 - 2 = 169/36 - 72/36 = 97/36

The ground truth answer is indeed 97/36.

The proposed answer is 25/9, which equals 100/36 when converted to same denominator.

100/36 ≠ 97/36, so the answers are not equivalent.
