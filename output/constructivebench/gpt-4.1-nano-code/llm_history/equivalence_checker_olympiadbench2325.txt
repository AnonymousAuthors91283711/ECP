Ground Truth Answer: fun (x, y) => 
    let x1 := x + y
    let x2 := x1 * y
    let y3 := y + 1
    let x4 := x2 + y3
    let x5 := x4 * y3
    let y6 := y3 + 1
    x5
Proposed Answer: fun ⟨n, m⟩ => 2 * n * n * m
Let's analyze both answers:

1. Ground Truth Answer:
- Computes: ((x + y) * y + (y + 1)) * (y + 1)
- For (10,2): ((10+2)*2 + (2+1))*(2+1) = (24+3)*3 = 27*3 = 81
- But the theorem states olympiadbench2325 (10,2) = 340, which contradicts this calculation

2. Proposed Answer:
- Computes: 2 * n² * m
- For (10,2): 2 * 100 * 2 = 400
- Also doesn't match the theorem's 340

Both answers fail to satisfy the given theorem (340 result for (10,2)), but they are clearly different functions. The ground truth answer gives 81 while the proposed answer gives 400 for the same input.
