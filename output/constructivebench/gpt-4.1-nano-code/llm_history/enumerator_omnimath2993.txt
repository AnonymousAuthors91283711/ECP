The problem asks to determine the number of valid values of \(k\) with \(0 < k \leq 2940\) such that \(\gcd(205800, 35k)\) is a perfect square.

To solve this:
- First, factor 205800 and 35 into prime factors.
- The gcd divides both numbers, so the gcd's prime factorization is determined by their common prime factors.
- Use the divisibility and factorization properties to count how many \(k\) fit the condition (that the gcd is a perfect square).

Prime factorizations:
- \(205800 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \times 17\)
- \(35 = 5 \times 7\)

\(\gcd(205800, 35k) = \gcd(2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \times 17, 5 \times 7 \times k)\)

Since gcd divides both, the gcd divides \(5 \times 7 \times k\). For \(\gcd\) to be a perfect square, the exponents of all prime factors in the gcd must be even.

Constraints:
- Prime factors involved in \(k\) are 2, 3, 5, 7, and possibly other primes.
- Conditions for the gcd to be a perfect square:
  - For 2: \(\min(3, v_2(k) + 0) \Rightarrow \text{exponent in gcd} \leq 3\), but only involves \(k\) if \(k\) contains 2.
  - For 3: similar.
  - For 5: \(\min(2, 1 + v_5(k))\) must be even.
  - For 7: gcd includes 7 if \(\gcd\) has 7, which depends on \(k\).
  - For 17: involves \(k\) only if it contains 17.

Since 205800 contains 17, which appears to only be present once, and 17 is only in the fixed number, the gcd's 17 exponent must match the minimum, which is 0 unless \(k\) contains 17 further. But because 17 appears only once in 205800, and \(k\) can contain 17 to adjust gcd exponents.

To find all \(k \leq 2940\) with \(\gcd(205800, 35k)\) a perfect square:

1. For each \(k\), determine the gcd's prime exponents.
2. Bound \(k\) appropriately.
3. Count the number of valid \(k\).

The easiest way:
- Since the prime factors are small, enumerate \(k\) from 1 to 2940.
- For each, compute gcd and check if it's a perfect square.

Let's implement this approach:


```python
import math

# Function to check if a number is a perfect square
def is_perfect_square(x):
    if x < 0:
        return False
    root = int(math.isqrt(x))
    return root * root == x

# Prime factorizations
# 205800 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 5^2 * 17
# 35 = 5 * 7

# We want to count k in 1..2940 such that gcd(205800, 35k) is a perfect square
count = 0
for k in range(1, 2941):
    g = math.gcd(205800, 35 * k)
    if is_perfect_square(g):
        print(k)
        count += 1

print("Total valid k:", count)
```
