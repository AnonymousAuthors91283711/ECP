The problem involves calculating the probability that two people chosen from a group of 9, consisting of different countries, are from the same country. We are given numbers for Mexico (2), Canada (3), and USA (4), with 3 sleepers (chosen people). We want to examine possible fractions representing the probability that two selected sleepers are from the same country, and find the best simplified fraction.

Given that, we'll enumerate all possible pairs of sleepers from the total group, compute the number of favorable outcomes where the two come from the same country, and then find the probability as a simplified fraction.

```python
from math import gcd

# Group sizes
mexican = 2
canadian = 3
american = 4
total = mexican + canadian + american
sleepers = 3

# Total combinations: choose 3 out of total
total_combinations = 1
for i in range(sleepers):
    total_combinations *= (total - i)
total_combinations //= 1 * 2 * 3  # 3! normal denominator for combinations

# Count the favorable outcomes: choose 2 from the same country and 1 from the rest
def combinations(n, k):
    if k > n or k < 0:
        return 0
    res = 1
    for i in range(k):
        res = res * (n - i) // (i + 1)
    return res

same_country_pairs = 0

# For Mexico
same_country_pairs += combinations(mexican, 2) * (total - mexican)

# For Canada
same_country_pairs += combinations(canadian, 2) * (total - canadian)

# For USA
same_country_pairs += combinations(american, 2) * (total - american)

# Compute probability as a fraction
num = same_country_pairs
den = total_combinations

# Simplify fraction
g = gcd(num, den)
num //= g
den //= g

print(f"Numerator: {num}")
print(f"Denominator: {den}")
```
