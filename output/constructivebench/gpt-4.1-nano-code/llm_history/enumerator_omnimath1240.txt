The problem involves polynomials \(f\) and \(g\) with specified properties, and asks to compute \(g.eval 9\). We know:
- \(f = X^3 + X + 1\)
- \(g(0) = -1\)
- For every real \(x\), \(g(x) = 0\) iff there exists \(y\) with \(f(y) = 0\) and \(x = y^2\).

Since \(g(x) = 0\) iff \(x = y^2\) where \(f(y) = 0\), then the roots of \(g\) are the squares of the roots of \(f\).

First, find roots of \(f(y) = y^3 + y + 1\). It's a cubic, we can estimate roots numerically, then determine their squares, and evaluate \(g(9)\), which will be the root of \(g\) corresponding to some \(y\), so:

- For each root \(y\) of \(f\), \(x = y^2\) is a root of \(g\).
- So, the roots of \(g\) are \(y_i^2\), where \(f(y_i) = 0\).

Now, approximate the roots of \(f\) numerically.

```python
import numpy as np

# Define the polynomial coefficients for f(y) = y^3 + y + 1
coeffs = [1, 0, 1, 1]  # y^3 + 0*y^2 + 1*y + 1

# Find roots of f
roots_f = np.roots(coeffs)

# Filter real roots (since np.roots can return complex)
real_roots_f = [r.real for r in roots_f if abs(r.imag) < 1e-8]

# Compute squares of roots (roots of g)
roots_g = [y**2 for y in real_roots_f]

# The roots of g are roots_g
# g(x) = (x - roots_g[0]) * (x - roots_g[1]) * ... (possibly complex roots)
# The question asks for g(9)
# Since g(x) = product over roots (x - root)

# Evaluate g at x=9
g_at_9 = 1
for root in roots_g:
    g_at_9 *= (9 - root)

print("Approximate roots of f:", real_roots_f)
print("Roots of g (squares of roots):", roots_g)
print("Value of g(9):", g_at_9)
```

This code approximates the roots of the polynomial \(f\), computes the roots of \(g\), and evaluates \(g(9)\) as the product of differences between 9 and each root, considering the roots of \(g\).

**Note:** This is an approximation, but for the enumeration purpose, it's sufficient to guide the conjecture of \(g(9)\). Since roots are real and manageable, the code enables straightforward numerical enumeration, consistent with the problem requirements.
