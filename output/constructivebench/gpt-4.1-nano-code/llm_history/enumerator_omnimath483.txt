This problem is a classic algebraic problem involving positive integers \(a, b, c\), with the key constraint:

\[ a + b + c = 10 \]
and the relationship:
\[ a \times b \times c + 9 = a \times b + b \times c + c \times a \]

We are asked to enumerate all positive integer triplets \((a, b, c)\) satisfying these conditions, in order to determine the size of the set. Since \(a + b + c = 10\), and all are positive integers, \(a, b, c \in \{1, 2, \dots, 9\}\).

The approach:

- Enumerate all triplets \((a, b, c)\) with \(a, b, c \ge 1\) and \(a + b + c = 10\).
- For each triplet, check whether the key relation holds.
- For each that satisfy, output the triplet immediately.

The enumeration is efficient given the small bounds; it's straightforward to generate all triplets summing to 10.

```python
# List all triplets (a,b,c) with positive integers and sum to 10
for a in range(1, 10):
    for b in range(1, 11 - a):
        c = 10 - a - b
        # Check the relation: a*b*c + 9 == a*b + b*c + c*a
        if a * b * c + 9 == a * b + b * c + c * a:
            print((a, b, c))
```
