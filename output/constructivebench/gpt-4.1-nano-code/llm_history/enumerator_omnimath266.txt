The problem describes a polynomial of degree 2006 with roots in the complex plane. It requires finding the minimal number `k` of real roots, given that the roots' absolute values form a set of size 1006, where the total number of roots with these absolute values is consistent with the polynomial's degree and the count of real roots.

Key observations:
- The polynomial degree is 2006.
- The roots' absolute values (magnitudes) form a set of size 1006.
- The roots on the real line (im for imaginary part) are counted as `k`.
- The sum over the roots' magnitudes forms 1006 distinct values.

To minimize the number of real roots, assign as many roots as possible to complex conjugate pairs off the real line, since such pairs contribute to the magnitude set but do not increase real roots.

- Each magnitude can correspond to either:
  - 2 complex roots (conjugate pair),
  - 1 real root.
  
- Total roots: 2006.

- For the smallest number of real roots:
  - Use as many complex conjugate pairs as possible corresponding to the 1006 magnitudes, each pair contributing 2 roots.
  
  Since 1006 magnitudes can host up to 2012 roots if each corresponds to a conjugate pair (2 roots per magnitude), but total roots are only 2006, some counts would need adjustment.

Calculations:
- Maximum roots from 1006 magnitudes with conjugate pairs: 1006 * 2 = 2012 roots (more than 2006), so we must have fewer roots per magnitude.
- To fit within 2006 roots:
  - Use as many conjugate pairs as possible: 1006 conjugate pairs would have 2012 roots, which is too many.
  - Therefore, at most some of the magnitudes correspond to pairs, and some to real roots.

Maximum conjugate pairs:
- If all 1006 magnitudes were pairs, total roots = 1006 * 2 = 2012 > 2006, impossible.
- Reduce pairs to fit the total roots:
  - Suppose `x` of the magnitudes correspond to conjugate pairs: total roots contributed by pairs = 2x.
  - The remaining roots are real roots: `k = 2006 - 2x`.
  
- Since total magnitudes are 1006:
  - Number of magnitudes with conjugate pairs: `x`.
  - Number of magnitudes with real roots: `1006 - x`.
  
- The total roots:
  - From conjugate pairs: `2x`,
  - From real roots: `2006 - 2x`.
  
- Sum:
  - `2x + (2006 - 2x) = 2006`, condition always satisfied.
  
- Minimizing `k = 2006 - 2x`:
  - Maximize `x` (number of conjugate pairs) to minimize `k`.
  
- Maximum `x`:
  - Cannot exceed 1006 (number of magnitudes).
  - To have all roots in conjugate pairs, `x=1006`.
  - Then `k = 2006 - 2*1006 = 2006 - 2012 = -6`.

Since negative `k` is impossible (number of real roots cannot be negative), the maximum number of pairs is 1006, giving:
- Real roots: `k = max(0, 2006 - 2*1006) = max(0, -6) = 0`.

**Conclusion:** The minimal number `k` of real roots is 0.

```python
# Minimizing the number of real roots:
# Maximize conjugate pairs: all 1006 roots correspond to pairs (2 roots each).
# Total roots from pairs = 1006 * 2 = 2012, but total roots are only 2006,
# so only 1003 pairs (2006 roots), leaving 0 real roots.

# Here, we find for the minimal k:
# k = 0

# Since the problem asks for the minimal number of real roots:
minimal_real_roots = 0
print(minimal_real_roots)
```
