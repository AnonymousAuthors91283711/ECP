theorem olympiadbench2783 : 
  logb 4 16 = logb 2 olympiadbench2783_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: b = 2, answer (x) ≈ 4.0
b = 3, answer (x) ≈ 2.3980462891212144
b = 4, answer (x) ≈ 2.0
b = 5, answer (x) ≈ 1.8167414493210314. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests the answer is related to the base of the logarithm; since log_b(16) = 4, and the answer options approximate these values, the most consistent choice for the answer is when the base is 2, matching the log's argument. Based on the enumerations, the answer simplifies to 4, which aligns with log₂(16).
