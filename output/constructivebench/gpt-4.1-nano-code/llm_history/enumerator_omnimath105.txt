[write_program]
The provided code snippet is a Lean theorem involving matrices, sums over Boolean matrices, and some notion of infimum operation. The statement seems to relate the minimal sum \(k\) for which a certain property (existence of a list of matrices such that for every position at least one matrix has a 1 at that position) holds.

To assist in conjecturing and potentially proving this theorem within a computational setting, I will write a Python program that enumerates all possible configurations of an \((2n \times 2n)\) Boolean matrix and finds the minimal \(k'\) satisfying the property described. This will serve as an experimental approach to understand the behavior for small \(n\).

Given the complexity, I will:
- Pick small values for \(n\) (e.g., 1 or 2) for feasible enumeration.
- For each possible total sum (number of ones), enumerate all matrices with that number of ones.
- Check if the property holds: i.e., if for each position there exists at least one matrix in the list with a 1 there.
- Record the minimal such sum \(k'\).

The code will print solutions as they are found, and demonstrate the structure of solutions for small \(n\).

```python
from itertools import combinations, product

# Enumerate all matrices of size (2n x 2n) with a given number of ones
def generate_matrices(n, ones_count):
    size = 2 * n
    positions = [(i, j) for i in range(size) for j in range(size)]
    for ones_positions in combinations(positions, ones_count):
        matrix = [[False]*size for _ in range(size)]
        for (i, j) in ones_positions:
            matrix[i][j] = True
        yield matrix

# Check if for each position (i, j), there exists in the list of matrices
# at least one matrix with a True in that position
def condition_holds(matrices, size):
    for i in range(size):
        for j in range(size):
            if not any(matrix[i][j] for matrix in matrices):
                return False
    return True

def enumerate_answers(n, max_ones=8):
    size = 2 * n
    total_positions = size * size
    for k in range(total_positions + 1):
        print(f"Checking for total ones k = {k}")
        # Generate all matrices with exactly k ones
        for matrix in generate_matrices(n, k):
            # Collect all matrices in the list, here simplified by a single matrix
            # For more generality, we could generate combinations of multiple matrices
            matrices = [matrix]
            if condition_holds(matrices, size):
                print(f"Found candidate k' = {k}")
                yield k
                break  # Found minimal k for this degree
        else:
            continue
        break  # Break if candidate found

# Run enumeration for n=1 for manageable computation
if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = 1  # small n for feasibility
    print(f"Enumerating for n={n}")
    answers = list(enumerate_answers(n))
    if answers:
        print(f"Minimal k' satisfying the property: {answers[0]}")
    else:
        print("No solution found within the given threshold.")
