open Rat

abbrev omnimath3372_answer : ℕ → Rat := sorry
theorem omnimath3372 (n : ℕ) (hn : n ≠ 0) : 
  (1 / n) = omnimath3372_answer n := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (1 / (2 * n)) + (1 / (3 * n)) + (1 / (6 * n))
Proposed Answer: fun n => 1 / n
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find a function that equals 1/n for all natural numbers n ≠ 0.

2. The ground truth answer decomposes 1/n into three fractions:
   (1/(2n)) + (1/(3n)) + (1/(6n)) = (3 + 2 + 1)/(6n) = 6/(6n) = 1/n

3. The proposed answer simply returns 1/n directly.

While both answers mathematically equal 1/n, they are not equivalent in terms of the expression form. The ground truth answer provides an interesting decomposition, while the proposed answer just returns the original term.

However, since the problem only asks for a function that equals 1/n, and doesn't specify any particular form, both answers are mathematically correct solutions.
