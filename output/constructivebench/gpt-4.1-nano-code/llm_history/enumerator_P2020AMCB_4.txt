This problem asks for the least integer \( b \) such that there exists an integer \( a \) with the properties:
- \( a > b \),
- \( a \) and \( b \) are both prime,
- \( a + b = 90 \).

To solve this, we can enumerate prime pairs \( (a, b) \) with \( a + b = 90 \), find those where both are prime, and then determine the minimal \( b \) for such pairs. Because \( a > b \), the candidate \( a \) must be greater than \( b \), so we start from the smallest \( b \) and go upward, checking for the complementary prime \( a = 90 - b \).

```python
import math

def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(5, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1, 6):
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Since a + b = 90, b must be less than a, and both are primes
# a = 90 - b, so b should be less than 90 - b => b < 45
# We iterate over b from 2 up to 44
for b in range(2, 45):
    a = 90 - b
    if is_prime(b) and is_prime(a) and a > b:
        print(f"b = {b}")
        # Since we want the minimal such b, we can exit upon finding the first
        break
```
