This problem involves summing the number of digits in each number from 1 to 2013 when written in base 4. To enumerate possible answers, we should compute the total sum directly, focusing on the digit lengths of numbers in different ranges. 

We know that:
- In base 4, numbers with 1 digit: 1 to 3 (since 4^1 = 4)
- With 2 digits: 4 to 15 (since 4^2 = 16)
- With 3 digits: 16 to 63
- With 4 digits: 64 to 255
- With 5 digits: 256 to 1023
- With 6 digits: 1024 to 4095

We only sum up to 2013, so the ranges will be partially taken for some ranges.

Let's implement the enumeration:

```python
# Summing the lengths of the base-4 representations for numbers 1 to 2013
# in terms of their digit lengths in base 4.

def digit_length_in_base_4(n):
    length = 0
    while n > 0:
        n //= 4
        length += 1
    return length

total_sum = 0
for i in range(1, 2014):
    total_sum += digit_length_in_base_4(i)
    print(total_sum)
```
