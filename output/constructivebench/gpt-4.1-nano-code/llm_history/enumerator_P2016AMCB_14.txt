This problem involves finding the least real value \( S \) such that there exist real numbers \( a, r \) satisfying the conditions:

- \( S = \frac{a}{1 - r} \),
- \( a r = 1 \),
- \( |r| < 1 \),
- \( 0 < S \),
- with \( S \) being minimal among such values.

To explore solutions, note that from \( a r = 1 \), we get \( a = \frac{1}{r} \). Substitute into \( S = \frac{a}{1 - r} \):

\[ S = \frac{\frac{1}{r}}{1 - r} = \frac{1}{r(1 - r)}. \]

Since \( r \neq 0 \) (otherwise \( a \) would be infinite), and \( |r| < 1 \), we seek \( r \in (-1, 0) \cup (0, 1) \). Also, \( S > 0 \) implies the numerator and denominator have the same sign.

- For \( r \in (0,1) \), numerator \( 1 \), positive; denominator \( r(1 - r) > 0 \), so \( S > 0 \). 
- For \( r \in (-1, 0) \), numerator \( 1 \), positive; denominator \( r(1 - r) \), which is negative because \( r < 0 \) and \( 1 - r > 1 \), so \( r(1 - r) < 0 \), making \( S \) negative, which we exclude.

Therefore, only \( r \in (0, 1) \) yields positive \( S \). Our goal: find the minimal value of:

\[ S(r) = \frac{1}{r(1 - r)} \text{ for } r \in (0,1). \]

Observe that as \( r \to 0^+ \), \( S(r) \to +\infty \), and as \( r \to 1^- \), \( r(1 - r) \to 0^+ \), so \( S(r) \to +\infty \).

Since \( S(r) \) is positive and tends to infinity at both ends, the minimal point occurs at the critical point where the derivative of \( S(r) \) is zero.

Let's find the critical points:

\[ S(r) = \frac{1}{r(1 - r)}. \]

Derivative:

\[
S'(r) = - \frac{d}{dr} [r(1 - r)]^{-1} = - \left( - (1 - r) - r \right) / [r(1 - r)]^2
= (1 - r - r) / [r(1 - r)]^2 = (1 - 2r) / [r(1 - r)]^2.
\]

Set \( S'(r) = 0 \):

\[
1 - 2r = 0 \Rightarrow r = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

Since \( r \in (0,1) \), this critical point is valid.

Compute the minimal \( S \):

\[
S\left( \frac{1}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{2} \left( 1 - \frac{1}{2} \right)} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{4}} = 4.
\]

Thus, the minimal \( S \) is 4, attained at \( r = 1/2 \), with \( a = 1/r = 2 \), and

\[
S = \frac{a}{1 - r} = \frac{2}{1 - 1/2} = \frac{2}{1/2} = 4.
\]

We can verify that:

- \( a r = 2 \times 1/2 = 1 \),
- \( a / (1 - r) = 4 \),
- \( |r| < 1 \),
- \( S > 0 \),
- and this is minimal among solutions.

If desired, to confirm, we can numerically enumerate values of \( r \) near \( 1/2 \), but the mathematical analysis suffices.

Now, translating into Python:

```python
# Find the exact minimal value of S
# S(r) = 1 / (r * (1 - r))
# Critical point at r=0.5, S=4

# Generate values of r around 0.5 to confirm minimal
import math

def S(r):
    if r == 0 or r == 1:
        return float('inf')
    return 1 / (r * (1 - r))

# Check r from 0.01 to 0.99 in steps
for r in [i/100 for i in range(1, 100)]:
    val = S(r)
    print(f"r = {r:.2f}, S(r) = {val:.2f}")

# explicit minimal value at r=0.5
r_min = 0.5
S_min = S(r_min)
print(f"Minimum S occurs at r={r_min}, S={S_min}")
```

This code:
- Calculates \( S(r) \) over a range,
- Prints each value immediately for partial results,
- Confirms the minimum at \( r=0.5 \),
- Accordingly, the minimal \( S \) is exactly 4.

---

**Final answer:**

```python
import math

# The minimal value of S is achieved at r=1/2
r_opt = 0.5
a_opt = 1 / r_opt  # a=2
S_opt = a_opt / (1 - r_opt)  # S=4

print("The minimal S:", S_opt)
print("Corresponds to a =", a_opt, "and r =", r_opt)

# Verify and enumerate S(r) around r=0.5
for r in [i/100 for i in range(1, 100)]:
    val = 1 / (r * (1 - r))
    print(f"r = {r:.2f}, S(r) = {val:.2f}")
```
