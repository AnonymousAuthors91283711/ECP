This problem involves understanding an equation involving the logarithm of \(\sin \theta\) to base \(1/2\), and solving for \(\theta \in [0, 2\pi]\) such that the polynomial \(2a^2 - 3a + 1\) evaluated at that logarithm equals zero. To assist in conjecturing the solutions, I will enumerate candidate \(\theta\) values within the interval, analyze the behavior of the function, and approximate solutions.

1. Since the polynomial has roots at specific points, analyze where the logarithm argument makes the polynomial zero.
2. The function involves \(\log_{1/2} (\sin \theta)\), which is decreasing in \(\sin \theta\).
3. We'll sample \(\theta\) at several points \([0, \pi/2, \pi, 3\pi/2, 2\pi]\) and some intermediate values.
4. Evaluate the polynomial at the corresponding log value to find zeros.

The code enumerates sample \(\theta\), computes \(\sin \theta\), finds \(\log_{1/2} (\sin \theta)\), then checks whether polynomial equals zero. It reports candidates immediately.

```python
import math

# Define the polynomial function
def poly(a):
    return 2 * a ** 2 - 3 * a + 1

# Base 1/2 logarithm
def log_base_half(x):
    # log_base_half(x) = log_e(x) / log_e(1/2)
    return math.log(x) / math.log(0.5)

# Candidate \theta values in [0, 2*pi]
thetas = [0, math.pi / 2, math.pi, 3 * math.pi / 2, 2 * math.pi,
          math.pi / 4, (3 * math.pi) / 4, (5 * math.pi) / 4, (7 * math.pi) / 4]

for theta in thetas:
    sin_theta = math.sin(theta)
    # Only consider when sin_theta > 0 to keep log defined
    if sin_theta > 0:
        a = log_base_half(sin_theta)
        val = poly(a)
        # Check if polynomial value is close to zero
        if abs(val) < 1e-5:
            print(f"Theta ≈ {theta:.3f} radians, sin θ = {sin_theta:.3f}, log_base_half(sin θ) ≈ {a:.3f}, polynomial ≈ {val:.3f}")
```
