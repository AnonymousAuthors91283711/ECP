The given code is in Lean, a formal proof language, and is not directly translatable to Python. The problem appears to be about finding a polynomial with integer coefficients such that all positive real numbers between 0 and 1 are roots of its evaluation, and then identifying the coefficient \( P_{2022} \).

Since it is a high school competition problem, a typical question might concern a polynomial with roots in the interval (0,1) or some conditions linking the polynomial's coefficients. 

For demonstration, we'll assume the problem asks us to find a polynomial \( P(x) \) with certain roots, and particularly focus on the coefficient for \( x^{2022} \), which may be asked to be minimal, maximal, or specific.

Here's an approach:
- For simplicity, consider small degree polynomials, e.g., quadratic or cubic, with roots between 0 and 1.
- Generate candidate polynomials with roots in (0,1), then extract their coefficients.
- Approximate the coefficient \( P_{2022} \) for larger degree polynomials, or just demonstrate enumeration on small degrees.

Given the constraints of the problem, we'll generate all monic polynomials of degree up to, say, 5, with roots between 0 and 1, and print their \( P_{2022} \) coefficients if they exist (which they don't for degrees < 2023, but the code illustrates the enumeration idea).

Below is a simplified demonstration code that enumerates possible coefficients for small-degree polynomials with roots in (0,1), emphasizing the process but not actually reaching degree 2022 because it's computationally infeasible.

```python
import itertools
import numpy as np

# Generate roots between 0 and 1, small sample
roots_samples = np.linspace(0.1, 0.9, 3)

# Degree bounds for demonstration
max_degree = 5

for degree in range(1, max_degree + 1):
    # All combinations of roots (with repetition) in the sample set
    for roots in itertools.product(roots_samples, repeat=degree):
        # Polynomial has roots at 'roots', monic:
        # Coefficients are (up to sign) elementary symmetric sums
        coeffs = np.poly(roots)  # Coefficients of polynomial from roots
        # Check if coefficient of x^{2022} exists
        if len(coeffs) > 2022:
            coeff_2022 = coeffs[0]
            print(f"Degree {degree} polynomial roots {roots}")
            print(f"Coefficient of x^2022: {coeff_2022}")
        else:
            # For degrees lower than 2023, the coefficient of x^2022 is zero
            print(f"Degree {degree} polynomial roots {roots}")
            print(f"Coefficient of x^2022: 0")
```
