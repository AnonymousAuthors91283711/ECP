The problem involves two equations relating x, y, and z: \( x = 0.2 y \) and \( x = 0.5 z \). We wish to find the value of \( z \) explicitly in terms of \( y \) and a certain unknown "answer" scaled by 100, i.e., express \( z \) as \(\frac{\text{answer}}{100} \times y \). To determine the "answer," we need to analyze the given relationships and derive an explicit formula for \( z \).

Given the equations:
- \( x = 0.2 y \)
- \( x = 0.5 z \)

Equate:
\[ 0.2 y = 0.5 z \]

Rearranged:
\[ z = \frac{0.2 y}{0.5} = \frac{0.2}{0.5} y = 0.4 y \]

The desired form:
\[ z = \left(\frac{\text{answer}}{100}\right) y \]

Thus:
\[ 0.4 y = \left(\frac{\text{answer}}{100}\right) y \]

Divide both sides by \( y \) (assuming \( y \neq 0 \)):
\[ 0.4 = \frac{\text{answer}}{100} \]

Multiply both sides by 100:
\[ \text{answer} = 40 \]

Therefore, the answer is 40, and the expression for \( z \) is \( z = 0.4 y \).

```python
# This code finds the value of the 'answer' based on given relationships
# and expresses z in terms of y as specified.

# Given relationships:
# x = 0.2 * y
# x = 0.5 * z

# Derive answer:
# 0.2 * y = 0.5 * z
# z = (0.2 / 0.5) * y = 0.4 * y
# answer / 100 * y = z => answer = 40

answer = 40
print(f"Answer: {answer}")

# Expression for z in terms of y:
# z = (answer / 100) * y
```
