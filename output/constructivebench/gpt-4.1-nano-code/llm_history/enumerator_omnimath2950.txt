This problem involves two parts: an equation relating \(r\) and \(b\), and a rational division condition. We need to find the value \(r + b\).

Given:
1. \(r = b + 6\)
2. \(\frac{r}{b} = \frac{5}{3}\)

From (2): \(\frac{r}{b} = \frac{5}{3}\)

Substitute \(r = b + 6\):

\[
\frac{b + 6}{b} = \frac{5}{3}
\]

Cross-multiplied:

\[
3(b + 6) = 5b
\]

Expand:

\[
3b + 18 = 5b
\]

Rearranged:

\[
18 = 2b \implies b = 9
\]

Then:

\[
r = b + 6 = 9 + 6 = 15
\]

Finally:

\[
r + b = 15 + 9 = 24
\]

Since these are exact values, no approximation needed. To confirm the logic and order of enumeration, we'll implement a minimal script that mimics searching over rational candidate values, but given the simplicity, the code will directly compute the candidate and output the answer.

```python
# Enumerate integers b and r satisfying the equations
# Given the equations, b=9, r=15 is the unique solution

b_candidates = [b for b in range(1, 20)]  # small range for searching
for b in b_candidates:
    r = b + 6
    if r / b == 5 / 3:
        answer = r + b
        print(answer)
```
