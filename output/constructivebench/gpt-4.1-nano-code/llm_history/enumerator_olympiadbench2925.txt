This problem asks us to find the least natural number \( n \) such that \( 0 < n \) and \( \frac{2}{2^n} < 0.1 \).

Simplify the inequality:
\[
\frac{2}{2^n} < 0.1 \implies 2^{1 - n} < 0.1
\]

Since \( 2^{1 - n} = \frac{2}{2^n} \), we seek the smallest \( n \) satisfying:
\[
2^{1 - n} < 0.1
\]

Rewrite:
\[
2^{1 - n} < 0.1
\]
which is equivalent to:
\[
2^{1 - n} < \frac{1}{10}
\]

Take logarithm base 2:
\[
1 - n < \log_2 \left(\frac{1}{10}\right) = - \log_2 10
\]

\[
n > 1 + \log_2 10
\]

Estimate \(\log_2 10 \approx 3.3219\), then:
\[
n > 1 + 3.3219 = 4.3219
\]

The least integer \( n > 4.3219 \) is \( n=5 \).

Verify for \( n=4 \):
\[
2^{1-4} = 2^{-3} = 1/8 = 0.125 \not< 0.1
\]
Verify for \( n=5 \):
\[
2^{1-5} = 2^{-4} = 1/16 = 0.0625 < 0.1
\]

So, \( n=5 \) is the minimal such number.

Here's the code implementing this logic to confirm the answer:

```python
# Enumerate n from 1 upwards until the inequality holds
n = 1
while True:
    value = 2 ** (1 - n)  # since 2^{1 - n}
    if value < 0.1:
        print(n)
        break
    n += 1
```
