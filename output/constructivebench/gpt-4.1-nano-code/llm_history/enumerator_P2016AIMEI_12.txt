This problem involves finding the least positive integer \( m \) such that there exists a \( k \ge 4 \) and a function \( p: Fin\,k \to \mathbb{N} \) with all \( p(i) \) prime, satisfying:

\[
\prod_{i=0}^{k-1} p(i) = m^2 - m + 11
\]

We need to enumerate possible factorizations where the product of \( \ge 4 \) primes equals \( m^2 - m + 11 \), and find the least such \( m \).

Approach:
- Fix small values of \( m \), compute \( m^2 - m + 11 \).
- Factor this number into at least 4 primes.
- Check if the factorization contains at least 4 primes (the primes can be repeated).
- For each valid factorization, record \( m \).

We prioritize exact factorizations with small primes for efficiency. 

```python
import itertools
from sympy import primefactors, isprime

# Precompute small prime list for candidate factorization
small_primes = [
    2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47
]

    """

    Return list of prime factors if possible, else None.
    """
    # For small n, try to find combinations of small primes
    for num_primes in range(min_factors, 15):
        # Generate all factorizations with num_primes factors
        for combo in itertools.combinations_with_replacement(small_primes, num_primes):
            prod = 1
            for p in combo:
                prod *= p
            if prod == n:
                return list(combo)
    return None

# Search m starting from 1 upwards
m = 1
found_m = None
max_m = 100  # limit to prevent long run
while m <= max_m:
    val = m*m - m + 11
    # Check if val can be factored into >=4 primes
    factors = factor_into_primes(val, min_factors=4)
    if factors:
        print(f"Found for m={m}: {val} = {' * '.join(map(str, factors))}")
        found_m = m
        break
    m += 1

if found_m is not None:
    print(f"Least m satisfying the condition is {found_m}")
else:
    print("No such m found within search limit.")
