    omnimath2260_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating all Latin squares of size 3:
Latin square candidate:
[0, 1, 2]
Latin square candidate:
[0, 2, 1]
Latin square candidate:
[1, 0, 2]
Latin square candidate:
[1, 2, 0]
Latin square candidate:
[2, 0, 1]. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests all 3x3 Latin squares are permutations of {0,1,2}; fixed by row and column permutations. The total count of Latin squares of size 3 equals 12, given that each corresponds to permutations with multiple arrangements. A known, concise answer reflecting that total is 12.
