The problem seeks the greatest possible `s = A.val + B.val`, where A and B are digits from 0 to 9, and the number formed by their triplet combined with 2018 is divisible by 11. To find the maximum sum, we need to test pairs (A, B) with A, B in [0..9], check if the concatenated number is divisible by 11, and track the maximum sum.

We will:
- Generate all possible A, B in [0..9]
- Form the number with digits `[A, A, B, 2, 0, 1, 8]`
- Check divisibility by 11
- Keep track of the maximum `A + B` where the condition holds
- Print each valid pair and sum as they are found

This process is efficient for small ranges, straightforward, and well within the limit.

```python
# Enumerate A, B in [0..9], compute the number, check divisibility by 11
max_sum = -1
for A in range(10):
    for B in range(10):
        digits = [A, A, B, 2, 0, 1, 8]
        number = 0
        for d in digits:
            number = number * 10 + d
        if number % 11 == 0:
            s = A + B
            print(f"A={A}, B={B}, number={number}, sum={s}")
            if s > max_sum:
                max_sum = s
print(f"Maximum sum s = {max_sum}")
```
