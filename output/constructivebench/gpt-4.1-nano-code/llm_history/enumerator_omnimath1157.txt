This problem appears to involve summing over the powerset of a set S, where S = range 1999, and involves sums of elements in E (subsets) normalized by the total sum over S. The structure suggests a known combinatorial identity related to expectancies or averaging over all subsets.

Since this is a high-school level math problem modeled in a more formal setting, and the goal is to analyze the sum over all subsets E of S, a key insight is that the sum of the sum over all subsets' sums can be expressed in terms of the total sum of S and the size of the set.

A natural conjecture: For such sums, the total sum over all subsets numerator might relate to the total sum over S times 2^(n-1), because for each element, half of the subsets contain it, and for each such subset, x contributes to the sum, leading to an expected value or weighted total.

Let's pick small sample values for testing, e.g., S = range 4, and sum over all subsets. Using linearity, the sum over E in the powerset S of sum x in E of x is:

Sum_{E âŠ† S} sum_{x in E} x = sum_{x in S} x * 2^{n-1}.

Similarly, sum_{x in S} x is straightforward.

And sum over E of (sum_{x in E} x) divided by sum_{x in S} x = 2^{n-1}.

So, for the entire set of size n, the sum over all E of (sum_{x in E}) / (sum_{x in S}) equals 2^{n-1}.

Once we consider S=range 0..1998, n=1999, the total sum over subsets of the normalized sum should be 2^{n-1}.

Now, let's implement this to see the sum over all E: (sum_{x in E}) / (sum_{x in S}) with all E in powerset S.

Since there are 2^n subsets, and the sum over E of sum_x in E x = 2^{n-1} * sum_x in S x, then the total sum of max sum_x in E x is 2^{n-1} * total sum of S.

The sum of S = sum_{x=0}^{1998} x = (1998*1999)/2.

Therefore, the total sum over all E of (sum_x in E of x) / sum_x in S = 2^{n-1} * sum_{x in S} x / sum_{x in S} = 2^{n-1}.

Hence, the total sum is 2^{1998}.

Let's write code to confirm this for smaller n, and then print the resulting answer for the massive case.

```python
# Confirm identity for small values
from math import comb

for n in [2, 4, 10]:
    S = list(range(n))
    total_sum_S = sum(S)
    total_subsets = 2 ** n
    total_sum_subsets_element_sum = total_sum_S * 2 ** (n - 1)
    total_normalized_sum = total_sum_subsets_element_sum / total_sum_S
    print(f"n={n}: sum over E of (sum_x in E)/sum_x in S = {total_normalized_sum}")
# For large n, the sum is 2^{n-1}
n = 1999
result = 2 ** (n - 1)
print(f"For n=1999, total sum over all subsets: {result}")
```
