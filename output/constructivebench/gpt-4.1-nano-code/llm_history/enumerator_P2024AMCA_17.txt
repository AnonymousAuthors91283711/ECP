The problem gives three equations involving integers a, b, c:
1. a * b + c = 100
2. b * c + a = 87
3. c * a + b = 60

We are asked to find the value of a * b + b * c + c * a, given these constraints. To assist, I will enumerate small integer solutions systematically via a Python script, trying small ranges for a, b, c. The goal is to find all solutions satisfying the equations and then compute the sum a*b + b*c + c*a for each.

We will:
- Loop over a, b, c in small ranges (say, -50 to 50).
- Check if the equations hold.
- When they do, compute the sum, and print it.

This will help in conjecturing the solution.

```python
# Enumerate small integer solutions to the system and compute the sum of products
for a in range(-50, 51):
    for b in range(-50, 51):
        for c in range(-50, 51):
            if a * b + c == 100 and b * c + a == 87 and c * a + b == 60:
                result = a * b + b * c + c * a
                print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c} => a*b + b*c + c*a = {result}")
```
