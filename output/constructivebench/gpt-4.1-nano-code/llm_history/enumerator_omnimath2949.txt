This problem involves solving the Diophantine equation \(2x^2 + 8y = 26\) for integers \(x, y\), and then finding the value of \(x - y\). We want to identify possible values of \(x - y\) by enumerating solutions systematically. Since the parameters are small, we'll iterate over small integer ranges for \(x\) and \(y\), compute solutions, and output each result.

```python
# Enumerate small integer solutions to 2x^2 + 8y = 26
# For each solution, compute x - y and print it immediately

for x in range(-10, 11):
    # For each x, derive y from the equation
    numerator = 26 - 2 * x**2
    # Check if numerator is divisible by 8 to get integer y
    if numerator % 8 == 0:
        y = numerator // 8
        answer = x - y
        print(f"x={x}, y={y}, x - y={answer}")
```
