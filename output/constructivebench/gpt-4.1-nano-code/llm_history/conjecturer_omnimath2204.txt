. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern of sequences suggests that the sequence alternates with period 2 or 4, originating from roots of unity like -1 and specific quadratic factors. Given the enumeration, the minimal $k$ where the sequence repeats with these properties is 2, corresponding to roots like $z = \pm i$. Thus, the greatest such $a$ corresponds to sequences derived from the quadratic with coefficient 0.5 and linear term -1.9, which yields a maximal quadratic leading term of 0.5. Hence, the answer is 0.5, representing the limiting quadratic coefficient among all such sequences.
