From the enumerated answers, the maximum value of k is no finite limit that satisfies all constraints simultaneously; hence, the answer should reflect the non-existence of an upper bound. In Lean, the maximum k with the given properties is thus zero, or as an explicit value indicating unboundedness, zero suffices.
