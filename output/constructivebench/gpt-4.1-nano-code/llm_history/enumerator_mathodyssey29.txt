The problem involves finding the number of integer pairs (a, b) where both are nonzero, and satisfying the equation:

\[
(a^3 + b)(a + b^3) = (a + b)^4
\]

Let's analyze the equation to generate potential solutions. For high-school level reasoning, we can test small integer values of a and b, excluding zero, and check whether they satisfy the equation. Since the problem doesn't specify bounds, we'll test small ranges for a and b, say from -10 to 10, and count the solutions.

We'll script this enumeration, printing each solution as soon as encountered, and then conclude with the total count.

```python
# Enumerate small integer pairs (a, b), a ≠ 0, b ≠ 0, and check the equation
count = 0
for a in range(-10, 11):
    if a == 0:
        continue
    for b in range(-10, 11):
        if b == 0:
            continue
        lhs = (a ** 3 + b) * (a + b ** 3)
        rhs = (a + b) ** 4
        if lhs == rhs:
            print(f"Solution: a={a}, b={b}")
            count += 1
print("Total solutions:", count)
```
