theorem omnimath3762 (f g : ℝ → ℝ) (hpos : ∀ x > 0, f x > 0 ∧ g x > 0) :
  (∀ x > 0, ∀ y > 0, (f x + y - 1) * (g y + x - 1) = (x + y)^2 ∧ 
                    (-f x + y) * (g y + x) = (x + y + 1) * (y - x - 1)) ↔ 
  (∀ x > 0, f x = (omnimath3762_answer x).1 ∧ g x = (omnimath3762_answer x).2) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Candidate linear functions:
f(x) = 1*x + 1
g(x) = 1*x + 1. Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ × ℝ
<<<fun x => (x + 1, x + 1)>>>
This pair satisfies the equations for all x > 0; therefore, the solution is linear with both functions being \( x + 1 \).
