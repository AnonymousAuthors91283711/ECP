abbrev P2006AMCB_4_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2006AMCB_4 : 
  IsLeast {p : ℝ | ∃ (change : ℝ), 
    change = 20 - (7.99 + 4.99 + 2.99 + 1.99 + 0.99) ∧ 
    p = |(change / 20 * 100) - P2006AMCB_4_answer|} 0 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 0.25
1.25
2.25
3.25
4.25
5.25
6.25
7.25
8.25
9.25
10.25. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The answer is based on the percentage of change from the total sum of costs to the initial amount, reflecting the normalized absolute difference. Given the enumeration, the result simplifies to 0.25 times the count of scale increments, matching the minimal positive difference, which appears as 0.25. Therefore, the answer is:

<<<0.25>>>
