The theorem seems to explore a particular property of sums and minimal elements related to the parameters \(N, a,\) and \(k\). The main goal appears to be identifying the smallest \(a\) for which a certain property holds, with the property involving sums over a range and some exclusions. Since the problem involves summations, inequalities, and minimality, I can attempt to enumerate relevant candidates for \(a\) by considering small values and checking conditions.

Because the code uses Lean mathlib syntax and references minimality and sum over integer intervals, I will assume the core task is to find the smallest \(a\) such that the predicate holds for some \(N\) involving sums, with restrictions on \(k\).

**Approach:**
- Focus on small values for \(a\), starting from zero.
- For each \(a\), check whether there exists some \(N\) of the form \(\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (a + i)\) with \(k > 1\), where \(N\) satisfies \(P(N,a)\).
- Also verify that for all \(k > 1\) with \(k \neq 2017\), \(\neg P(N, a + k)\).
- Since the exact property \(P\) is unspecified (represented as sorry), I will assume \(P\) is some property that can be approximated, e.g., divisibility, primality, or sum properties.

For demonstration, I will generate candidate triples \((a, N, k)\) for small \(a\) and check if they satisfy similar properties, printing each candidate.

```python
# Enumerate small values of a and k, compute N, and print relevant candidates
# The task is abstract; assuming P involves N and a sum over i in [0, k-1] of (a + i)
# For demonstration, we'll approximate P as "N divisible by a+1" (or similar).
# This is just an assumption for illustrative enumeration, as P is not explicitly defined.

limit_a = 10  # Small range for a
limit_k = 20  # Small range for k
results = []

for a in range(limit_a):
    for k in range(2, limit_k):
        # Compute N as sum of an arithmetic sequence starting at a, length k
        N = sum(a + i for i in range(k))
        # Check if N is divisible by a+1 (arbitrary choice to generate some pattern)
        if (a + 1) != 0 and N % (a + 1) == 0:
            print(f"a={a}, k={k}, sum N={N}")
            results.append((a, N, k))
        # To filter based on the minimality condition, further logic needed
```
