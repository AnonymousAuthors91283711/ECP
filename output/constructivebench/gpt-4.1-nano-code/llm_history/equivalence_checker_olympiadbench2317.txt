Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: (-3, 0)
<<<None>>>
Since the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's not provided), we cannot determine whether the proposed answer (-3, 0) is equivalent to the ground truth answer. The problem involves proving an equivalence between a functional equation and a pair of real numbers, but without knowing the correct answer, we cannot verify the proposed solution.
