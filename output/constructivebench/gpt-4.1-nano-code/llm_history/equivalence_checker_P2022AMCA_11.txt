Ground Truth Answer: 81
Proposed Answer: 10
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find the value(s) of x > 0 that satisfy the given logarithmic equation.

2. The equation can be simplified to:
   |log₆x - log₆9| = 2|log₆10 - 1|

3. This further simplifies to:
   |log₆(x/9)| = 2|log₆(10/6)|

4. The ground truth answer is x = 81, which comes from solving:
   log₆(x/9) = ±2log₆(5/3)
   One solution gives x = 9*(5/3)² = 9*(25/9) = 25 (not given)
   The other gives x = 9*(3/5)² = 81/25 (not given)
   Wait, this seems inconsistent with the ground truth.

5. The proposed answer is x = 10, which would make the left side |log₆(10/9)| and right side 2|log₆(5/3)|, which are not equal.

6. Actually, the ground truth answer of 81 seems incorrect based on this analysis, but the proposed answer of 10 is clearly wrong as it doesn't satisfy the equation.

Given that neither answer seems correct based on the equation, but the problem states the ground truth is 81, I'll go with:

<<<False>>>
