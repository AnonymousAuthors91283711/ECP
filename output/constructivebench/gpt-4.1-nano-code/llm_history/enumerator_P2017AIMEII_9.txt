This problem involves combinatorics with a deck consisting of 7 colors and 7 numbers, forming pairs. We need to analyze how many "valid hands" (sets of 8 cards covering all colors and all numbers) exist, then how many "good hands" (valid hands where removing a specific card still covers all colors and numbers). The goal is to find the ratio of their counts, simplified, and identify a specific sum `P2017AIMEII_9_answer`.

Key observations:
- The total deck size is 49.
- Valid hands are 8-card subsets that contain all colors and all numbers.
- "Good hands" are valid hands where removing one particular card still leaves a set covering all colors and numbers.
- To count valid hands, note that they consist of 8 cards, each with color and number, with coverage of all colors and numbers.

Approach:
- Generate all 8-card subsets.
- Filter those covering all colors and numbers.
- Filter those where removing any card still results in coverage of all colors and numbers.
- Count both and output the simplified fraction.

Since exhaustive enumeration over all 8-card subsets (combinatorial 49 choose 8) is large, we limit ourselves to small sample checks (e.g., fixing some structure) to estimate counts and then deduce the ratio.

Below is the code implementing this reasoning:

```python
from itertools import combinations
import math

colors = range(7)
numbers = range(7)
deck = [(c, n) for c in colors for n in numbers]

# Generate all 8-card subsets
all_hands = combinations(deck, 8)

valid_hands_count = 0
good_hands_count = 0

# Function to check coverage
def covers_all(s, elements):
    return set(s) >= set(elements)

# Iterate over all hands
for hand in all_hands:
    s = set(hand)
    # Check if hand covers all colors and numbers
    if covers_all(s, [(c, n) for c in colors for n in numbers]):
        valid_hands_count += 1
        # Check if removing any card still keeps coverage
        good = True
        for card in s:
            s_minus = s - {card}
            if not covers_all(s_minus, [(c, n) for c in colors for n in numbers]):
                good = False
                break
        if good:
            good_hands_count += 1

# Simplify the ratio p/q
if valid_hands_count > 0:
    gcd_value = math.gcd(good_hands_count, valid_hands_count)
    p = good_hands_count // gcd_value
    q = valid_hands_count // gcd_value
else:
    p = 0
    q = 1

# Output the answer
print(f"{p + q}")  # sum of numerator and denominator
```
