Number of valid pairs: 24
Fraction: 0.5. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The valid pairs occur when (p₁ + 1) * (p₂ + 1) is divisible by 3, which happens if either p₁ + 1 or p₂ + 1 is divisible by 3, i.e., p₁ ≡ 2 mod 3 or p₂ ≡ 2 mod 3. Counting compatible pairs in the respective ranges, the probability simplifies to (2/8 + 2/6 - (2/8)*(2/6)) = 11/24. Final answer:

<<<(11 : ℚ) / 24>>>
