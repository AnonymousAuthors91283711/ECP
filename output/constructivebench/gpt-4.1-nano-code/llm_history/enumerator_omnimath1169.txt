The problem appears to ask for a specific rational number related to the iterative multiplication of the average sum of the numbers 1 through 6, repeatedly divided by 6. To clarify:

- The average \(Ea\) of numbers 1 through 6 is \(\frac{1+2+3+4+5+6}{6} = \frac{21}{6} = \frac{7}{2}\).
- \(Eb = Ea \times \frac{7}{2}\).
- \(Ec = Eb \times \frac{7}{2}\).

This reduces to a sequence where:
- \(Ea = \frac{7}{2}\).
- \(Eb = \frac{7}{2} \times \frac{7}{2} = \left(\frac{7}{2}\right)^2\).
- \(Ec = \left(\frac{7}{2}\right)^3\).

Thus, \(Ec = \left( \frac{7}{2} \right)^3 = \frac{7^3}{2^3} = \frac{343}{8}\).

To assist in verifying this, a small Python enumeration will compute this step-by-step.

```python
# The average of numbers 1 through 6
Ea_num, Ea_den = sum(range(1,7)), 6  # 21/6
Ea = Ea_num / Ea_den

# First multiplication
Eb_num, Eb_den = Ea_num * Ea_num, Ea_den * Ea_den
# (7/2)^2 = 49/4
# Simplify fractions to ensure exact values
from fractions import Fraction
Ea_frac = Fraction(Ea_num, Ea_den)
Ec = Ea_frac * Ea_frac * Ea_frac  # (7/2)^3

print("Ea =", Ea_frac)
print("Eb =", Ea_frac * Ea_frac)
print("Ec =", Ec)
# Print final Ec as a fraction for clarity
print("Ec as a fraction:", Ec)
```
