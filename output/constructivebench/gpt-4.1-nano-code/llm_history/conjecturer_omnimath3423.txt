. Enumerated answers: Candidate answer for p: 0.375
For x=0.1, y=0.16000000000000003, y*(1 - p)=0.10000000000000002
For x=1, y=1.6, y*(1 - p)=1.0
For x=10, y=16.0, y*(1 - p)=10.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests p = 1 - (x / y). Since y = x * 1.6, p = 1 - (x / (1.6 x)) = 1 - (1 / 1.6) = 1 - 0.625 = 0.375. The answer is constant for all x > 0.

<<<0.375>>>
