This problem appears to relate to the coefficient extraction from a polynomial defined as a product over a range, where the polynomial is:

\[ P(x) = \prod_{i=0}^{14} \left( 1 + a_i X \right) \]

with:

\[
a_i = \begin{cases}
-(i+1) & \text{if i is odd} \\
i+1 & \text{if i is even}
\end{cases}
\]

Our goal is to find \(|P.coeff 2|\), the absolute value of the coefficient of \(X^2\) in \(P(x)\).

---

### Approach:
- Express the polynomial as a product of linear factors.
- The coefficient for \(X^2\) in the expanded form corresponds to the sum of all products of \(a_i a_j\) with \(i < j\).
- Generate all pairs \((i,j)\), sum over their products, as these contribute to the \(X^2\) coefficient.
- Compute this explicitly for small \(i\).

---

### Implementation:
Since the range is from 0 to 14, we can directly enumerate all pairs, compute their contributions, sum them, and take the absolute value.

---

```python
# Enumerate coefficients for i in 0..14
a = []
for i in range(15):
    if i % 2 == 1:
        a.append(-(i + 1))
    else:
        a.append(i + 1)

# Sum of products a_i * a_j for i < j (contributing to X^2 coefficient)
coeff_X2 = 0
for i in range(15):
    for j in range(i + 1, 15):
        coeff_X2 += a[i] * a[j]

# The coefficient for X^2 in the polynomial is coeff_X2
# We return its absolute value
print(abs(coeff_X2))
```
