This problem involves counting the number of 4×4 matrices over Fin 2 with certain sum conditions that are preserved under permutations of rows and columns. To enumerate possible solutions, I will:

- Generate all permutation pairs (σ for rows, τ for columns).
- For each pair, construct matrices M where row sums and column sums match the permutation constraints.
- Count matrices satisfying the conditions, ensuring we list all possibilities.

Assuming M(i,j) ∈ {0,1} due to Fin 2, the approach is:
- For each permutation pair, determine target sums for each row and column.
- Generate all matrices with row sums matching the permuted indices plus 1.
- From these, filter those matching the column sum conditions.

Here's the code:

```python
import itertools
import math

# Generate all permutations of size 4
perms = list(itertools.permutations(range(4)))

# Store count of matrices matching any permutation pair
total_count = 0

# Iterate over all row and column permutation pairs
for sigma in perms:
    for tau in perms:
        # Compute required row sums
        row_sums = [sigma_i + 1 for sigma_i in sigma]
        # Compute required column sums
        col_sums = [tau_j + 1 for tau_j in tau]

        # Generate all 4x4 matrices over {0,1}
        for matrix_bits in itertools.product([0, 1], repeat=16):
            M = [list(matrix_bits[i*4:(i+1)*4]) for i in range(4)]
            # Check row sums
            if all(sum(row) == row_sums[i] for i, row in enumerate(M)):
                # Check column sums
                if all(sum(M[i][j] for i in range(4)) == col_sums[j] for j in range(4)):
                    total_count += 1
                    print(f"Permutation pair (σ, τ): {sigma}, {tau}")
                    print(f"Matrix:")
                    for row in M:
                        print(''.join(str(bit) for bit in row))
                    print("-" * 20)

print(f"Total matrices satisfying conditions: {total_count}")
```
