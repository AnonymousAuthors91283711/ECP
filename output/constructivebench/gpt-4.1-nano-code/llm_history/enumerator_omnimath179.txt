This problem involves finding the greatest possible value `s` of a sum with certain constraints involving non-decreasing functions `a` and functions `b` related to their infimum. We need to enumerate candidate solutions for `s` by exploring possible values of `a`, `b`, and the sum structure under the given constraints.

Given the constraints:
- `a` is non-decreasing (`∀ n, a n ≤ a (n + 1)`).
- `b m` is defined as the infimum of `{n | a n ≥ m}`.
- `a 19 = 85`.
- `s` is the sum of `a` over `0..18` plus the sum of `b` over `1..84`.

To find the greatest possible `s`, we should consider the possible behaviors of `a` that maximize the sum, especially noting that `a 19 = 85` fixes the last value of `a`.

For simplicity, we:

- Generate candidate non-decreasing sequences `a` that start at some minimal value and reach 85 at `n=19`.
- For each sequence, solve for `b`: `b m = inf{n | a n ≥ m}`.
- Calculate `s`.

We will iterate over possible starting points and increasing `a n` values, then compute the sums, and update our maximum as we go.

```python
# Enumerate plausible sequences for `a` with fixed a(19)=85, start at a(0)=v <= 85
# and non-decreasing, with possible steps up to 85.
# For each sequence, compute `b` and sum, then output if sum is maximal.

# We attempt small starting values to limit complexity.
max_s = -1
max_sequence_info = None

for start_val in range(1, 86):  # starting point of a, between 1 and 85
    # Build a sequence a of length 20, last element fixed at 85
    # For simplicity, try increasing steps: a_n = start_val + delta, where delta ≥ 0, up to 85
    # To keep it manageable, generate sequences where each step increases by 0 or 1 only.
    # Generate sequences where a[0] = start_val, and a[n+1] >= a[n]
    sequence = [start_val]
    for n in range(1, 20):
        # to maximize sum of a, increase by 1 if possible
        next_val = min(sequence[-1] + 1, 85)
        sequence.append(next_val)
    # Verify last element
    sequence[-1] = 85
    a_seq = sequence

    # Compute b: b m = inf{n | a n ≥ m}
    # For m in [1..84], find the first index where a[n] ≥ m
    b_values = {}
    for m in range(1, 85):
        # find first n with a[n] ≥ m
        for n_idx, val in enumerate(a_seq):
            if val >= m:
                b_values[m] = n_idx + 1  # 1-based index
                break
    # sum over a
    sum_a = sum(a_seq[:19])  # a_{0..18}
    # sum over b
    sum_b = sum(b_values[m] for m in range(1, 85))
    s = sum_a + sum_b

    print(s)
    if s > max_s:
        max_s = s
        max_sequence_info = (a_seq, b_values)

# Output the maximum found sum and sequence for reference
print("Maximum s:", max_s)
print("Sequence a:", max_sequence_info[0])
```

This code explores varying sequences starting from different initial values, constructs non-decreasing `a` sequences ending at 85, computes the associated `b` functions, sums, and streams partial results via `print`. It maintains a maximum to help identify the greatest `s`. The approach balances exploration with efficiency, suitable for high school level conjecture reasoning.
