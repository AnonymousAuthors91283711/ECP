Based on the pattern, the pairs are (p, p) where p is prime, and some specific small cases like (2, 2) and (2, 4). Since for larger primes p ≥ 3, n = p, and for p=2, n=2 or 4, the pattern suggests the answer set consists of pairs where p is prime and n equals p, with an exceptional case at n=4 for p=2.  
Hence, the set captures primes p with n = p, plus the exception (2, 4):

The error originates because `ℕ.prime` is not a recognized identifier in Mathlib; instead, the prime property for natural numbers is `Nat.Prime p`. To fix the code, I will replace `{ (p, p) | p ∈ ℕ.prime }` with `{ (p, p) | p ∈ Nat.Prime }`. Additionally, since the answer set is intended to consist of pairs where `p` is prime, the set should be explicitly constructed using set comprehension notation in Lean, which is `{ (p, p) | p ∈ {p : ℕ | Nat.Prime p} }`. The union with `{ (2, 4) }` remains the same but respects syntax.

Given the enumerated answers, the pattern includes pairs `(p, p)` for prime `p` like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, plus the special case `(2, 4)`. The set should thus be all `(p, p)` with `p` prime, plus `(2, 4)` explicitly.

Therefore, the correct sentence is:
```lean
{ (p, p) | p ∈ { p : ℕ | Nat.Prime p } } ∪ { (2, 4) }
```

This can be summarized as:

<<<
{ (p, p) | p ∈ { p : ℕ | Nat.Prime p } } ∪ { (2, 4) }
>>>

This approach is general enough to include all prime pairs `(p, p)` and the special case `(2, 4)` consistent with the enumerated solutions.
