The problem defines Î© as all sequences of 6 dice rolls (values in Fin 6), and X(d) counts how many of the first five dice match the sixth die. We want to compute the expected value E[X].

Since each die roll is independent and uniformly distributed over {0,...,5}, the probability that a particular of the first five dice matches the sixth is 1/6, regardless of previous outcomes. By linearity of expectation:

E[X] = sum_{i=1 to 5} P(d_i = d_6) = 5 * 1/6 = 5/6.

Our program should verify this by enumerating all sequences, summing X(d), dividing by total sequences (6^6), and outputting the expected value.

```python
# Enumerate all sequences of 6 dice rolls (from 0 to 5)
# For each sequence, count how many of first five match the sixth
# Sum these counts and compute average over total sequences

from itertools import product

total_sequences = 6**6
sum_X = 0

for seq in product(range(6), repeat=6):
    last = seq[5]
    match_count = sum(1 for i in range(5) if seq[i] == last)
    sum_X += match_count

expected_value = sum_X / total_sequences
print(expected_value)
```
