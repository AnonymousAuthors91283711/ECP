The error arises because the 'abbrev' declaration in Lean does not accept '<<' and '>>' syntax, which is just notation used in your placeholder answer. The placeholder '<<0>>' should be replaced with a proper lemma expression or a natural number value. 

Given the pattern and the recursive construction of the list S, the focus is on counting how many times 1988 appears in S(1988). The sequence S seems to be a variant of a recursive construction similar to Pascal's triangle or binomial coefficients, which typically yields positive integers with combinatorial significance.

Looking at the initial parts, for n < 1988, the sequence does not reach 1988, so the count remains zero. For larger n, unless the sequence specifically contains 1988 at position n, the count remains zero. Based on the pattern from the initial sequence, the sequence resembles the construction of Pascal's triangle, where the maximum value at row n is 2^n, so for n=1988, the maximum possible number is 2^1988, which exceeds 1988. However, the actual entries are binomial coefficients, which are usually much smaller, unless at the edges.

Given the pattern, unless 1988 appears as a binomial coefficient term in that specific position, the count is zero. The sequence is similar to the binomial transformation, and the simplified result suggests the answer is 0 or 1 depending on whether 1988 appears.

- Since the sequence's symmetry and recursive construction likely imply that 1988 does not appear at all, especially given the initial zeros at small n, the most reasonable conclusion is that the count of 1988 in S(1988) is 0.

In Lean, I should express the answer as a natural number (ℕ). The placeholder '<<0>>' should be replaced with '0' directly.

Final answer:
<<<0>>>
