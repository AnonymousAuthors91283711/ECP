[write_program]
The problem involves solving a system of equations with real numbers \(a, b, c\):

\[
\begin{cases}
a^2 + b = c^2 \quad (h1) \\
b^2 + c = a^2 \quad (h2) \\
c^2 + a = b^2 \quad (h3)
\end{cases}
\]

We want to find the value of \(a \times b \times c\). Since the system is symmetric in \(a, b, c\), solutions may be symmetric or involve special relationships. 

To assist in conjecturing, we can test small integer or rational values that satisfy the symmetry or attempt to find solutions numerically. The program will systematically test some small candidates for \(a, b, c\) and check if they satisfy all equations, then output the product \(a \times b \times c\).

Here's the code:

```python
# Enumerate small real candidate solutions for the symmetric system
# The goal is to find solutions (a, b, c) satisfying all three equations
# We'll test values in a small range and check the residuals

import itertools

def check_system(a, b, c):
    # Check equations within tolerance
    tol = 1e-6
    return (abs(a**2 + b - c**2) < tol and
            abs(b**2 + c - a**2) < tol and
            abs(c**2 + a - b**2) < tol)

def main():
    candidates = []
    # Use small rational or integer candidates around -3 to 3
    for a in [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]:
        for b in [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]:
            for c in [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]:
                if check_system(a, b, c):
                    product = a * b * c
                    print(f"Found solution: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, product={product}")
                    candidates.append(product)

    # If no solutions found, expand search or check around these
    # Additional numerical search
    for a in [i/10 for i in range(-30, 31)]:
        for b in [i/10 for i in range(-30, 31)]:
            for c in [i/10 for i in range(-30, 31)]:
                if check_system(a, b, c):
                    product = a * b * c
                    print(f"Found solution: a={a:.2f}, b={b:.2f}, c={c:.2f}, product={product}")
                    candidates.append(product)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
