This problem asks us to find natural numbers \( n \ge 2 \) such that:

\[
\frac{\sum_{d \mid n} d}{\sup(\text{primeFactors}(n))} = n
\]

Let's analyze this:

- \(\sum_{d \mid n} d\) is the sum of all divisors of \( n \).
- \(\text{primeFactors}(n)\) gives the list of prime factors (with multiplicity), but in this context, likely the set of distinct prime factors.
- \(\sup(\text{primeFactors}(n))\) is the maximum prime factor of \( n \).

The equation simplifies to:

\[
\frac{\text{sum of divisors of } n}{\text{max prime factor of } n} = n
\]

Which implies:

\[
\text{sum of divisors of } n = n \times \text{max prime factor of } n
\]

Our goal is to enumerate such \( n \) within some small bounds, for example up to 100, and check which satisfy this condition.

Let's implement this in Python:
- For each \( n \) from 2 to 100,
- Compute divisors,
- Find the max prime factor,
- Check if the sum of divisors equals \( n \times \) that max prime factor,
- If yes, print \( n \).

```python
import math

def divisors(n):
    """Return all divisors of n."""
    divs = set()
    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divs.add(i)
            divs.add(n // i)
    return divs

def prime_factors(n):
    """Return the set of prime factors of n."""
    factors = set()
    temp = n
    for p in range(2, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1):
        while temp % p == 0:
            factors.add(p)
            temp //= p
    if temp > 1:
        factors.add(temp)
    return factors

# Assign answer set
answers = set()

# Check numbers up to 100
for n in range(2, 101):
    divs = divisors(n)
    sum_divs = sum(divs)
    max_prime_factor = max(prime_factors(n))
    if sum_divs == n * max_prime_factor:
        print(f"n = {n}, divisors = {divs}, sum = {sum_divs}, max prime factor = {max_prime_factor}")
        answers.add(n)

# Output the set of answers
abbrev_answer = answers
print("Answer set:", abbrev_answer)
```
