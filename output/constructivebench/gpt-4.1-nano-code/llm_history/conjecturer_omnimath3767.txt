Given the symmetry and the constraints \( p + q + r = 0 \) and \( pqr=1 \), a classic solution is that \(p,q,r\) are the roots of the cubic \(t^3 - at^2 + bt - c=0\), where specific parameters satisfy the relations. Known solutions involve triplets like \((1,1,-2)\) and permutations but considering the conditions, the suitable symmetric form is that \(p,q,r\) are roots of the polynomial \( t^3 - u t^2 + v t - 1 = 0 \) with the relations \( p+q+r= u \), \( pq + pr + qr = v \), and \( pqr=1 \) (fixed). With constraints, the triplet can be any where roots are conjugates of a cube root of unity scaled appropriately, but the key is that the symmetric ratio is formed by roots of unity. Therefore, the answer involves roots satisfying these relations, and the closure form is:
