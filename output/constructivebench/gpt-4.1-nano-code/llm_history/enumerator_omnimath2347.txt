The problem involves analyzing probabilities involving permutations of 26 elements, and specific fractions involving factorials. To explore the answer, we will explicitly generate the fractions and compare them. We avoid hardcoded answers and instead systematically compute and output candidate ratios to assist in conjecturing the value.

The code will:
- Define the factorial function.
- Compute the probabilities p1 and p2 as defined.
- Compute and print the ratio p1 / p2.
- Show intermediate steps for clarity.

```python
import math

# Define factorial function for small numbers
def factorial(n):
    return math.factorial(n)

# Compute p1 and p2 as per the problem
# p1 = (24 * 22! * 3!) / 26!
# p2 = (23 * 23! * 2!) / 26!
# The ratio p1 / p2

# Compute factorials
fact_22 = factorial(22)
fact_23 = factorial(23)
fact_26 = factorial(26)

# Compute p1 and p2
p1 = (24 * fact_22 * factorial(3)) / fact_26
p2 = (23 * fact_23 * factorial(2)) / fact_26

# Compute the ratio
ratio = p1 / p2

# Print intermediate computations to assist in conjecturing
print(f"22! = {fact_22}")
print(f"23! = {fact_23}")
print(f"26! = {fact_26}")
print(f"p1 = (24 * 22! * 3!) / 26! = {p1}")
print(f"p2 = (23 * 23! * 2!) / 26! = {p2}")
print(f"ratio p1 / p2 = {ratio}")

# For completeness, output the answer in simplified fractional form if desired
from fractions import Fraction
frac = Fraction(p1, p2).limit_denominator()
print(f"Fraction form: {frac.numerator}/{frac.denominator}")
```
