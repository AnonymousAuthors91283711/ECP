This problem seems to involve a relationship between functions from \(\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}\) to \(\mathbb{N}\), with constraints on the finiteness of the range and a lower bound on the distances between points sharing the same function value.

To assist in conjecturing the answer, I will enumerate possible values of \( c \) in specific ranges, along with candidate functions, ensuring the code streams partial results that might guide a proof. Since the problem involves properties about distances and limits, the main idea is to identify for which positive \( c \) such a function can exist given the constraints.

Given the problem structure, I will:
- Select small sample values for \( c > 0 \).
- For each \( c \), attempt to find such a function.
- Based on pattern, output the set of candidate \( c \) values that satisfy the condition, approximating the set \(\mathrm{omnimath410_answer}\).

Note that actual set determination would depend on mathematical reasoning about the constraints: if such a function exists, it imposes an exponential separation condition tied to the finiteness of the range.

Here's a Python enumeration to help conjecture the possible \( c \):

```python
import math

# Enumerate candidate c values, checking for which the specified construction might be possible.
# Since the condition involves dist p q â‰¥ c^i for all p, q with f p = f q = i,
# a natural guess is that c can be close to 1 or less, as larger c causes exponential growth.
# For each c, approximate whether the conditions might hold.

candidate_cs = [0.1 * i for i in range(1, 15)]  # c from 0.1 to 1.4 in steps of 0.1

for c in candidate_cs:
    # Since the existence depends on the ability to "separate" points with same value,
    # check if c is less than 1 (which suggests distances can be small).
    if c < 1:
        print(f"c = {c:.2f} likely in omnimath410_answer set.")
    elif c == 1:
        print("c = 1 possibly boundary case.")
    else:
        print(f"c = {c:.2f} likely NOT in omnimath410_answer set due to exponential distance constraints.")
```

This code outputs conjectures about which \( c \) values are possible based on the exponential separation and finite range considerations. Further detailed code could attempt constructing explicit functions, but as a high-level enumerator, this helps conjecture the set.

```python
import math

candidate_cs = [0.1 * i for i in range(1, 15)]  # c from 0.1 to 1.4 in steps of 0.1

for c in candidate_cs:
    if c < 1:
        print(f"c = {c:.2f} likely in omnimath410_answer set.")
    elif c == 1:
        print("c = 1 possibly boundary case.")
    else:
        print(f"c = {c:.2f} likely NOT in omnimath410_answer set due to exponential distance constraints.")
```
