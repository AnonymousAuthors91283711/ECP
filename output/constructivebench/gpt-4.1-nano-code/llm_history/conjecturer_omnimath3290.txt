abbrev omnimath3290_answer : Prop := sorry
theorem omnimath3290 : omnimath3290_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: (1, 9)
(2, 8)
(3, 7)
(4, 6)
(5, 5). Expected Answer Type: Prop
Given the pattern in enumerated answers, where the pairs are symmetric around 5, the conjecture is that the statement holds exactly when the two numbers sum to 10. 

Thus, the final answer, with \(x \in \mathbb{N}\) and \(y \in \mathbb{N}\), is the property that \(x + y = 10\). 

So, the answer is:

<<<∃ x y : ℕ, (x + y = 10)>>>
