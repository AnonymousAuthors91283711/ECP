The problem involves finding natural numbers \( c \) and \( s \) such that:
- \( 3c = 4s \),
- \( c = s + 4 \),
and then calculating \( 3c \) in terms of these solutions.

From the equations:

1. \( 3c = 4s \),
2. \( c = s + 4 \).

Substitute \( c = s + 4 \) into \( 3c = 4s \):

\[ 3(s + 4) = 4s \]
\[ 3s + 12 = 4s \]
\[ 12 = 4s - 3s \]
\[ 12 = s \].

Then, \( c = s + 4 = 12 + 4 = 16 \).

Calculate \( 3c = 3 \times 16 = 48 \).

Since the problem asks for an existential quantification with parameters, the main value for \( 3c \) is 48.

Here's the program that finds this:

```python
# Enumerate possible s (since s must be natural, start from 0)
for s in range(0, 100):  # a reasonable bound to find solutions
    c = s + 4
    if 3 * c == 4 * s:
        answer = 3 * c
        print(answer)
        # Since equations are linear and s is determined uniquely, break after first solution
        break
```

This code systematically searches for solutions fitting the equations, prints each found answer immediately, and stops after the first valid solution, which corresponds to \( 48 \).
