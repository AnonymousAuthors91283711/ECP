Let's analyze the recurrence relation a(n) = 5*a(n−1)+4, with initial a(0)=a₀ > 0, and the divisibility condition 2013 | a(54).

This is a linear recurrence: solution is of form a(n)=A*5^n + B, where A and B are constants based on initial conditions.

Calculating the particular solution:
a(n)=5^n * (a₀−1) + 1.

Divisibility:
2013 | a(54)=5^54*(a₀−1)+1.

Thus:
2013 | 5^54*(a₀−1)+1 
↔ 5^54*(a₀−1) ≡ -1 mod 2013.

Since gcd(5,2013)=1 (2013=3*11*61; 5 coprime), we can find the inverse of 5^54 modulo 2013. Let M=5^54 mod 2013.

The divisibility condition becomes:
a₀−1 ≡ -1 * (1/M) mod 2013,
or
a₀ ≡ 0 mod 2013.

Given this, the set of such a₀ equals all multiples of 2013. Therefore, the necessary and sufficient condition on a₀ is that it is divisible by 2013.

The current proposed answer is attempting to define `omnimath4424_answer` as an existential statement over `k : ℕ`, claiming `a₀ = 2013 * k`. However, `a₀` is a parameter of the theorem `omnimath4424`, not a global constant, so it cannot appear directly in the definition of `omnimath4424_answer` without being included as a parameter in that definition.

Given the statement, the main idea is that the initial term `a₀` must be divisible by 2013 for the sequence's initial value to satisfy the divisibility condition at `a 54`. Since the sequence is defined recursively with initial condition `a 0 = a₀`, the divisibility by 2013 at `a 54` depends solely on whether `a₀` is divisible by 2013, due to the recursive relation involving multiplication by 5 and addition of 4, which do not affect divisibility by 2013 in a way that would introduce or eliminate factors automatically.

Thus, the correct logical statement is that the existence of such a sequence with any starting value `a₀` such that `a 0 = a₀` and the recursion holds, and with `a 54` divisible by 2013, is equivalent to `a₀` being divisible by 2013.

To formalize this, we can define:

```lean
abbrev omnimath4424_answer (a₀ : ℕ) : Prop := 2013 ∣ a₀
```

and the statement of the theorem relates the initial condition to the divisibility.

Therefore, the final answer in Lean, which generalizes from the enumeration and correctly references the parameter `a₀`, is:

The core of the problem involves analyzing the recurrence relation a(n) = 5 * a(n - 1) + 4 with initial value a₀, which is positive, and determining the divisibility of a(54) by 2013. The key insight is that the recurrence relation is linear and can be solved explicitly:

a(n) = c * 5^n + d, where c and d are constants determined by initial conditions.

Given:
a(0) = a₀,
a(1) = 5a₀ + 4,

which leads to the particular solution:
a(n) = A * 5^n + B.

Using initial conditions:
a(0) = A * 5^0 + B = A + B = a₀,
a(1) = 5A + B = 5a₀ + 4.

Subtract the first from the second:
(5A + B) - (A + B) = 5a₀ + 4 - a₀,
which simplifies to:
4A = 4a₀,
so A = a₀.

Then from a(0):
a₀ + B = a₀ => B = 0.

Thus:
a(n) = a₀ * 5^n.

Therefore, the divisibility condition:
2013 ∣ a(54) = a₀ * 5^54.

Since the divisibility depends solely on whether 2013 divides a₀ * 5^54, and 5^54 and 2013 are coprime (as 2013 factors into 3 * 11 * 61, none of which divides 5), it follows that:
2013 ∣ a₀ * 5^54 if and only if 2013 ∣ a₀.

Hence, the final answer sets are characterized as all initial values a₀ that are multiples of 2013.

Final Lean expression:

<<<∀ a₀ : ℕ, 0 < a₀ → (∃ a : ℕ → ℕ, a 0 = a₀ ∧ (∀ n ≥ 1, a n = 5 * a (n - 1) + 4) ∧ 2013 ∣ a 54) ↔ 2013 ∣ a₀>>>
