Ground Truth Answer: (1, 1/2, -1/2, 1/3)
Proposed Answer: (1, 1, 0, 0)
Let's verify the proposed answer (1, 1, 0, 0) against each equation:

1. √1 - 1/1 - 2*0 + 3*0 = 1 - 1 - 0 + 0 = 0 ≠ 1 (should be 1)
2. 1 + 1/1² - 4*0² - 9*0² = 1 + 1 - 0 - 0 = 2 ≠ 3 (should be 3)
3. 1*√1 - 1/1³ - 8*0³ + 27*0³ = 1 - 1 - 0 + 0 = 0 ≠ -5 (should be -5)
4. 1² + 1/1⁴ - 16*0⁴ - 81*0⁴ = 1 + 1 - 0 - 0 = 2 ≠ 15 (should be 15)

The proposed answer fails all four equations, while the ground truth answer (1, 1/2, -1/2, 1/3) satisfies them all. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
