This appears to be a problem involving pairs of natural numbers `(a, b)` with some constraints involving their relations and a certain set. The theorem states an equivalence involving the existence of `(x, y)` satisfying specific equations, under the condition that `b > a > 0`. To assist in conjecturing and proving, I'll write a program to enumerate pairs `(a, b)` with small values, check the conditions, and output the pairs that satisfy the given logical conditions, prioritizing exact solutions. 

Since the problem involves divisibility and algebraic relations, I'll pick small `a` and `b`. I'll limit `a` and `b` to, say, 20, to avoid excessive output but still observe meaningful solutions. I'll test for the existence of `(x, y)` that satisfy the equations and the divisibility condition.

```python
# Enumerate pairs (a,b) with 1 < a < b <= 20
# For each, check if there exist (x,y) satisfying:
# x + 2 = a, y + 2 = b
# and x*y == (a*b)/2
# and 2 divides a*b
# Since x=a-2, y=b-2, check if:
# (a-2)*(b-2) == (a*b)/2
# and 2 divides a*b (which is always true if a or b even)
# We will output all such pairs

for a in range(2, 21):
    for b in range(a+1, 21):
        if (a * b) % 2 == 0:
            x = a - 2
            y = b - 2
            lhs = x * y
            rhs = (a * b) // 2
            if lhs == rhs:
                print(f"a={a}, b={b}, x={x}, y={y}")
```
