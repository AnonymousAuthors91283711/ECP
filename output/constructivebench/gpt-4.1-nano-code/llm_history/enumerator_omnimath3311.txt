This problem involves counting the number of functions \( a: \text{Fin}\,5 \to \mathbb{Z} \) satisfying two conditions:

1. For each \( i \in \text{Fin}\,5 \), \( a(i) \leq i \). Since \( \text{Fin}\,5 \) corresponds to indices 0..4, the possible values for \( a(i) \) are integer numbers less than or equal to \( i \). Theoretically, \( a(i) \) can be any integer \( \leq i \). 

2. The function \( a \) is non-decreasing: for \( i \leq j \), \( a(i) \leq a(j) \). 

The problem asks to determine the cardinality of the set of all such functions, which has been abstracted as `omnimath3311_answer`.

Since \( a(i) \leq i \), and \( a(i) \in \mathbb{Z} \), the constraints are:

- \( a(0) \le 0 \).
- \( a(1) \le 1 \).
- \( a(2) \le 2 \).
- \( a(3) \le 3 \).
- \( a(4) \le 4 \).

And the sequence must be non-decreasing:

- \( a(0) \le a(1) \le a(2) \le a(3) \le a(4) \).

Additionally, each \( a(i) \) must be \( \leq i \). So, for each \( a(i) \), the possible values are:

- \( a(0) \le 0 \)
- \( a(1) \le 1 \)
- \( a(2) \le 2 \)
- \( a(3) \le 3 \)
- \( a(4) \le 4 \)

Since it's about non-decreasing sequences with upper bounds, the problem reduces to counting non-decreasing sequences with:

\[ a(0) \le 0, \]
\[ a(1) \in [a(0), 1], \]
\[ a(2) \in [a(1), 2], \]
\[ a(3) \in [a(2), 3], \]
\[ a(4) \in [a(3), 4]. \]

For each sequence, the initial value \( a(0) \leq 0 \), but \( a(0) \) can only be less than or equal to 0. Since \( a(i) \leq i \), and the sequence is non-decreasing, the minimal \( a(0) \) is at most 0, and the sequence must be non-decreasing with each \( a(i) \leq i \).

Let's enumerate all such sequences algorithmically:

- For \( a(0): \) either \(\), \( a(0) = 0 \) (since it can't be less than -∞, but the only constraint is \( a(0) \leq 0 \), so \( a(0) \) can be any integer \( \leq 0 \). To simplify, we can just choose \( a(0) \) in \(\{-\infty,\dots,0\}\), but since \(\mathbb{Z}\) is unbounded below, only finitely many sequences exist if we note the non-decreasing property, making the sequence necessarily bounded below by \( a(0) \), which must be \(\leq 0 \). 

Actually, because for the sequence to be non-decreasing and each \( a(i) \leq i \), and considering \( a(i) \) can be any integer less than or equal to \( i \). But the sequence is non-decreasing, so:

\[ a(0) \le a(1) \le a(2) \le a(3) \le a(4), \]
and
\[ a(i) \le i. \]

To maximize the count, we can assume \( a(i) \) are integers between their minimal possible values and their maximum \( i \).

Let's set the minimal \(a(i)\) to -∞ for now (assuming the problem is about sequences of integers satisfying these constraints). Since no lower bounds are provided, only an upper bound and monotonicity are imposed. So the set is infinite if no further restriction.

But from the code context, it looks like the problem is only concerned with the sequence of integers satisfying these constraints—most likely, the "set" includes all such functions. Counting such functions is a classical combinatorial problem: counting weakly increasing sequences constrained by upper bounds.

Because \( a(i) \leq i \), and the sequence is non-decreasing, for \( a(0) \), possible values are any integer \( \leq 0 \). Given the step-by-step structure, the minimal possible sequence is when \( a(i) = a(0) \) for all \( i \), where \( a(0) \le 0 \), with \( a(i) \) non-decreasing and each \( a(i) \leq i \).

But because the sequences are functions mapping to \(\mathbb{Z}\), and the upper bounds vary, and there's no lower bound specified explicitly other than the monotonicity, the set of sequences is infinite unless the problem constrains \( a(i) \geq -\infty \)—but that isn't practical.

Given the theorem form, likely the intended interpretation is that \( a(i) \) are integers with the following:

- \( a(i) \leq i \).
- Sequence \( (a(0), a(1), \ldots, a(4)) \) is non-decreasing.

Assuming further that these functions are finite and only consider \( a(i) \) within the bounds \( a(i) \leq i \), with no explicit lower bounds but with the non-decreasing property, the minimal value for \( a(0) \) is unbounded below; but in a typical combinatorial setting, the sequence's values can be any integers satisfying the constraints.

Given the context, probably the intended problem is that \( a(i) \) are integers with:

\[ 0 \leq a(i) \leq i, \]
and \( a(i) \) are non-decreasing.

This is a standard weakly increasing integer sequence with \( a(i) \in [0, i] \). 

Thus, for each \( a(i) \), the choices are in the range from \( a(i-1) \) (because non-decreasing) up to \( i \), with \( a(0) \in [0,0] \Rightarrow a(0) = 0 \).

Now, this simplifies to counting non-decreasing sequences:

\[ a(0) = 0,\]
\[ a(1) \in [a(0), 1] = [0, 1], \]
\[ a(2) \in [a(1), 2], \]
and so on.

Enumerating all sequences:

- \(a(0)=0\),
- \(a(1) \in \{0, 1\}\),
- then for each, \(a(2) \in [a(1), 2]\),
- similarly for \(a(3)\) and \(a(4)\), with upper bounds.

Let's implement:

- Set fixed \(a(0)=0\) (since it must be \( \leq 0 \) and sequence is non-decreasing),
- Iterate over \(a(1)\) in \(\{a(0), \dots, 1\}\),
- For each \(a(1)\), check possible \(a(2)\) in \([a(1), 2]\),
- and so forth.

Here's the enumerator code:

```python
# Enumerate all non-decreasing sequences from a(0)=0 to a(4),
# with each a(i) in [a(i-1), i].

sequence_list = []

for a1 in range(0, 2):  # a(1) in [0,1]
    for a2 in range(a1, 3):  # a(2) in [a(1), 2]
        for a3 in range(a2, 4):  # a(3) in [a(2), 3]
            for a4 in range(a3, 5):  # a(4) in [a(3), 4]
                sequence = (0, a1, a2, a3, a4)
                sequence_list.append(sequence)
                print(sequence)
print(f"Total sequences: {len(sequence_list)}")
```

Counting these sequences:

Number of choices:

- \( a(1) \): 2 options (0,1),
- For each \( a(1) \):

  - \( a(2) \): from \( a(1) \) up to 2,
  
  - For each \( a(2) \):

    - \( a(3) \): from \( a(2) \) up to 3,

    - For each \( a(3) \):

      - \( a(4) \): from \( a(3) \) up to 4.

This yields a finite enumeration, and counting confirms the total. The sequences output are all possible.

Calculating total counts:

- For each \( a(1) \in \{0, 1\} \),
- Number of options for \( a(2) \): \(2 - a(1) + 1\),
- For each \( a(2) \), options for \( a(3) \): \(3 - a(2) + 1\),
- For each \( a(3) \), options for \( a(4) \): \(4 - a(3) + 1\).

Total sequences: sum over all \( a(1) \):

\[
\sum_{a_1} \left[ \sum_{a_2 = a_1}^{2} \left( \sum_{a_3=a_2}^{3} (4 - a_3 + 1) \right) \right]
\]

But since we're asked only for code, we can just run and see the results.

---

**Final code:**

```python
# Enumerate non-decreasing sequences satisfying the constraints
for a1 in range(0, 2):  # a(1) from 0 to 1
    for a2 in range(a1, 3):  # a(2) from a(1) to 2
        for a3 in range(a2, 4):  # a(3) from a(2) to 3
            for a4 in range(a3, 5):  # a(4) from a(3) to 4
                sequence = (0, a1, a2, a3, a4)
                print(sequence)
```

This code streams all valid sequences, counting sums for analysis can be done after execution.
The exact total count can be derived combinatorially or by running the code, but for now, we output all the sequences, which will allow accurate conjecture and verification.

**The number of sequences is the answer:**

```python
# Count total sequences
total = 0
for a1 in range(0, 2):
    for a2 in range(a1, 3):
        for a3 in range(a2, 4):
            for a4 in range(a3, 5):
                total += 1
print("Total sequences:", total)
```

**This enumeration fully captures all solutions, allows precise counting, and adheres to the problem constraints, providing input for the theorem.**
