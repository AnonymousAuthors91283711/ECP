This problem involves solving the system of equations:
1. \( y^3 = x^2 \) (so \( y = \sqrt[3]{x^2} \))
2. \( (y - x)^2 = 4 y^2 \) (which expands to \( y^2 - 2xy + x^2 = 4 y^2 \))

Given the constraints \( x, y > 0 \), we want to find all solutions for \( x \) and \( y \) and then compute \( x + y \).

---

We can proceed as follows:
- Express \( y \) in terms of \( x \) using the first equation.
- Substitute into the second equation, forming a polynomial in \( x \).
- Find all positive solutions \( x \), then compute \( y \), and sum \( x + y \).

To efficiently find solutions, we can numerically scan over small positive \( x \), compute \( y \), check the second equation, and record solutions.

```python
import numpy as np

# Define functions based on the equations
# y = (x^2)^(1/3) = x ** (2/3)

def y_from_x(x):
    return x ** (2/3)

# Equation (y - x)^2 = 4 y^2
# Substitute y:
# (y - x)^2 - 4 y^2 = 0
# Numerically check for solutions

x_values = np.linspace(0.01, 10, 10000)  # Small x starting from 0.01 to avoid x=0
answers = set()

for x in x_values:
    y = y_from_x(x)
    lhs = (y - x) ** 2
    rhs = 4 * y ** 2
    # Allow a small numerical tolerance
    if abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-6:
        answer = x + y
        # Print each answer immediately
        print(f"Found solution: x = {x:.6f}, y = {y:.6f}, x + y = {answer:.6f}")
        answers.add(s := round(answer, 6))  # Store rounded to avoid duplicates

# Since multiple x may approximate the same sum, filter unique sums
print("\nUnique solutions for x + y:")
for ans in sorted(answers):
    print(f"x + y â‰ˆ {ans}")
```
