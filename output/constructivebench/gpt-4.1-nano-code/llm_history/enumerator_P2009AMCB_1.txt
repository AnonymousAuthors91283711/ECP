This problem appears to involve finding all natural numbers \(b\) satisfying the conditions \(b \leq 5\) and that there exists some \(m \in \mathbb{N}\) such that \(50 \times (5-b) + 75 \times b = 100 \times m\). We need to enumerate all such \(b\) and corresponding \(m\) values to conclude the set of solutions, then identify the set matching the problem's set notation.

The key is to iterate over \(b \in \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\), check if \(50(5-b) + 75b\) is divisible by 100, and find \(m\).

```python
# Enumerate b from 0 to 5, find all b with corresponding m such that:
# 50*(5 - b) + 75*b = 100*m
# Check if RHS is divisible by 100 to determine existence of integer m.

for b in range(6):
    value = 50 * (5 - b) + 75 * b
    if value % 100 == 0:
        m = value // 100
        print(f"b = {b}, m = {m}")
```
