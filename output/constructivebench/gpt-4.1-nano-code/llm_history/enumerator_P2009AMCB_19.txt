The problem appears to involve finding all prime numbers `f n` where `f n = n^4 - 360 n^2 + 400` for `n > 0`. First, we need to systematically evaluate `f n` for small `n`, check if `f n` is prime, and then output those prime values. To simplify, we will just test increasing `n` values and check primality.

Since the full task requires enumerating all such prime outputs, we'll stop after some small range, say up to `n=20`, to keep within token limits and covering potentially interesting solutions. We output all prime `f n` values found along with the corresponding `n`.

```python
import sympy

def f(n):
    return n**4 - 360 * n**2 + 400

# Enumerate n from 1 to 20
for n in range(1, 21):
    val = f(n)
    if sympy.isprime(val):
        print(f"n={n}, f(n)={val}")
```
