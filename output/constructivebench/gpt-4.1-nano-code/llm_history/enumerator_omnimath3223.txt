The problem seems to involve summing over n∈[0,2009] the reciprocals of the closest rational approximations to √(n+1). Since the problem appears to involve the 'closest_to_sqrt' function without a direct implementation, and the total sum is to be computed, I'll approximate the possible contributions by considering the values of closest_to_sqrt for each n. 

Assuming 'closest_to_sqrt' finds the rational approximation to √(n+1) with minimal numerator/denominator, the sum likely involves summing over reciprocals of these rational approximations. Without the exact function, a reasonable approach is to examine simplified forms—particularly, the integer parts of √(n+1)—and test the reciprocals accordingly. 

For this enumeration, I'll choose sample n, compute approximate rational close to √(n+1) (for small rational numbers, e.g., mediated by numerator ≈ √(n+1)), and sum the reciprocals. Since the exact function is unknown, I'll simulate the enumeration over small, plausible candidates for 'closest_to_sqrt' and approximate the sum.

Let's implement the enumeration by iterating over n from 0 to 2009, approximate the closest rational as either 1/1, 1/2, 1/3, etc., based on the magnitude of √(n+1), and sum their reciprocals, outputting each partial sum immediately.

Here's the code:

```python
# Enumerate n, approximate closest rational to sqrt(n+1), sum reciprocals
import math

def close_rational_sqrt(x):
    # Approximate closest rational to sqrt(x) with denominators up to 10
    sqrt_x = math.sqrt(x)
    best_num, best_den = 1, 1
    best_error = abs(sqrt_x - best_num / best_den)
    for denom in range(1, 11):
        num = round(sqrt_x * denom)
        error = abs(sqrt_x - num / denom)
        if error < best_error:
            best_error = error
            best_num, best_den = num, denom
    return best_num, best_den

sum_reciprocals = 0.0
for n in range(2010):
    x = n + 1
    num, den = close_rational_sqrt(x)
    approx = num / den
    sum_reciprocals += 1 / approx
    print(f"n={n}, closest rational={num}/{den}, approx={approx:.4f}, cumulative sum={sum_reciprocals:.4f}")
```

This code enumerates over n, approximates √(n+1) to the nearest rational with small denominators, sums their reciprocals, and streams each partial sum for analysis.
