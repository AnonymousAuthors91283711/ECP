The problem defines a set S of natural numbers p derived from positive integer factors (a, b) of 24, where p = 2(a + b). We need to find the value of p for all such pairs and identify the unique answer that fits the given properties.

Approach:
- Generate all pairs of positive integers (a, b) such that a * b = 24.
- For each pair, compute p = 2 * (a + b).
- Determine the set S from these p values.
- Since the problem states that S â‰  universal set and that omnimath3437_answer is not in S but is the only element outside S, we seek the unique value outside S that the theorem indicates.

Let's enumerate all factors of 24 and compute p:

Factors of 24: (1, 24), (2, 12), (3, 8), (4, 6), and their reversals.

```python
# Enumerate all positive integer pairs (a, b) such that a*b=24
pairs = [(a, 24//a) for a in range(1, 25) if 24 % a == 0]

# Calculate p for each pair
p_values = set()
for a, b in pairs:
    p = 2 * (a + b)
    print(f"a={a}, b={b} => p={p}")
    p_values.add(p)

# Now, print all unique p values to analyze
# From these, we can identify the set S
# Find the number that is outside the set of p's that is supposed to be the answer
print("All p values:", sorted(p_values))
```

This approach finds all possible p-values, and based on the above enumeration, the only p outside the existing set can be identified.

```python
# Full program to print all candidate p values and suggest the unique answer
```
