The problem appears to involve finding all natural numbers \( n \) for which there exist coprime pairs \( (a, b) \) such that \( a^2 + b^2 = n \), and every prime \( p \) dividing \( a b \) is at most \(\sqrt{n}\). We aim to enumerate such \( n \), likely looking for a pattern or characterization.

Given the constraints, particularly the condition that all prime divisors \( p \) of \( a b \) satisfy \( p \leq \sqrt{n} \), and knowing \( a \) and \( b \) are coprime, we can explore candidate \( n \) values by enumerating small \( a, b \) pairs, checking the conditions, and outputting those \( n \).

Plan:
- Iterate over small \( a, b \) with \( a < b \) to avoid duplicates.
- Check if they are coprime.
- Check if \( a^2 + b^2 \) is some \( n \), and all prime divisors \( p \) of \( a b \) satisfy \( p \leq \sqrt{n} \).
- Generate and print such \( n \) immediately.

This approach prioritizes small \( a, b \); the computation is straightforward.

```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

# Store found n to avoid duplicates
found_ns = set()

# Enumerate small pairs for a, b
for a in range(1, 50):
    for b in range(a+1, 50):
        if gcd(a, b) == 1:
            n = a*a + b*b
            # Prime factorization of a*b
            ab = a*b
            prime_divs = set()
            temp = ab
            for p in range(2, int(math.sqrt(ab)) + 2):
                while temp % p == 0:
                    prime_divs.add(p)
                    temp //= p
            # Check the condition p <= sqrt(n)
            if all(p <= math.isqrt(n) for p in prime_divs):
                if n not in found_ns:
                    print(n)
                    found_ns.add(n)
```
