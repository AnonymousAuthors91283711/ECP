abbrev omnimath1178_answer : Set ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath1178
: {k : ℝ | {r : ℝ | r ^ 4 + k * r ^ 3 + r ^ 2 + 4 * k * r + 16 = 0}.encard = 1} = omnimath1178_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: No values of k found with exactly one real root in given range.. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
Because the polynomial \(r^4 + k r^3 + r^2 + 4k r + 16 = 0\) must have exactly one real root regardless of the value of \(k\), and the enumeration indicates no such \(k\) exists, the answer set is empty. Thus, the closed form is the empty set.
