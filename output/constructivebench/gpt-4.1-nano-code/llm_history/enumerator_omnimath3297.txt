This problem involves determining whether, over certain intervals, every number can be divisible by some prime in a specific set, or whether there exists at least one interval where some number is not divisible by any prime in a different set. The key is to evaluate the two parts: a universal negation statement and an existential statement over intervals in â„•, with constraints on primes and divisibility.

The first involves checking whether there exists an n such that all numbers from n to n+13 have a prime divisor in {2,...,11}. Its negation asks whether, for every n, some number in that interval lacks such a prime divisor.

The second involves finding an n such that all numbers from n to n+20 have a prime divisor in {2,...,13}.

Our approach:
- For the first part, check for small n whether there's an interval where a number has no prime divisor in {2,...,11}.
- For the second part, find an n where every number in that interval is divisible by some prime in {2,...,13}.

We'll enumerate small n values, check the properties, and conclude whether the equivalence holds.

```python
import math

# Primes in the sets
primes_11 = list(range(2, 12))
primes_13 = list(range(2, 14))

def has_prime_divisor_in_set(k, prime_set):
    for p in prime_set:
        if k % p == 0:
            return True
    return False

# Check the negation part: is there an n such that all k in [n, n+13] lack prime divisors in {2..11}?
def exists_n_all_k_fail():
    # Test small n up to a reasonable limit
    for n in range(0, 50):
        interval = range(n, n + 14)
        if all(not has_prime_divisor_in_set(k, primes_11) for k in interval):
            print(f"Found n = {n} where all k in [{n}, {n+13}] lack prime divisors in {primes_11}")
            return True
    return False

# Check the existential part: exists n with all k in [n, n+20] divisible by some prime in {2..13}
def exists_n_all_k_divisible():
    for n in range(0, 50):
        interval = range(n, n + 21)
        if all(has_prime_divisor_in_set(k, primes_13) for k in interval):
            print(f"Found n = {n} where all k in [{n}, {n+20}] have a prime divisor in {primes_13}")
            return True
    return False

# Run checks
negation_exists = exists_n_all_k_fail()
existence = exists_n_all_k_divisible()

# Output the boolean answer tuple
print(f"omnimath3297_answer = ({negation_exists}, {existence})")
```
