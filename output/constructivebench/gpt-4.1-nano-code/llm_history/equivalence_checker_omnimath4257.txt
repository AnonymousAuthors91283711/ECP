Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {
  (-16, 9, 15),
  (-16, 15, 9),
  (9, -16, 15),
  (9, 15, -16),
  (15, -16, 9),

<<<None>>>
Since the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's intentionally left undefined in Lean), we cannot verify the equivalence of the proposed answer. The proposed answer provides a specific set of solutions, but without knowing the intended ground truth, we cannot determine if they match. Therefore, the answer is None (unsure about equivalence).
