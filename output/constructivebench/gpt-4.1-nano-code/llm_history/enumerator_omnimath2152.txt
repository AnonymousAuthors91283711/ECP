This problem involves finding all pairs of positive integers (a, b) satisfying certain divisibility conditions:

- (2a + 1) divides (3b - 1)
- (2b + 1) divides (3a - 1)

We aim to enumerate some solutions to observe possible patterns.

Strategy:
- Select small positive integers for a and b.
- Check if the conditions hold.
- Output each pair immediately when conditions are met to facilitate conjecture formation.
- Limit enumeration to a reasonable range (say, a, b â‰¤ 20) to keep output manageable.

Here's the Python code:

```python
# Enumerate pairs (a, b) with a, b > 0 up to 20
for a in range(1, 21):
    for b in range(1, 21):
        # Check the divisibility conditions
        cond1 = (2 * a + 1) != 0 and (3 * b - 1) % (2 * a + 1) == 0
        cond2 = (2 * b + 1) != 0 and (3 * a - 1) % (2 * b + 1) == 0
        if cond1 and cond2:
            print((a, b))
```
