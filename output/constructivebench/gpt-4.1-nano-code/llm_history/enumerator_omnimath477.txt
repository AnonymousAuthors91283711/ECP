[write_program]
This problem involves minimizing the sum of four terms of the form x / (y^3 + 4), subject to the non-negativity and sum constraints a + b + c + d = 4. To assist in conjecturing the minimum, I will discretize the variables with small sample values, check the sum constraint, and evaluate the sum for each candidate. The program will output candidates where the sum is minimal and note the corresponding values.

```python
# Since the problem involves four nonnegative real variables summing to 4,
# and the function is symmetric in form, we discretize the domain:
# a, b, c, d in [0, 4], with a + b + c + d = 4.
# We'll generate a grid of possible quadruples and evaluate the sum.

import itertools

min_value = float('inf')
candidates = []

# Step size for discretization
step = 1

# Generate all non-negative quadruples where sum == 4
for a in range(0, 5):  # a in {0,1,2,3,4}
    for b in range(0, 5 - a):
        for c in range(0, 5 - a - b):
            d = 4 - a - b - c
            if d < 0 or d > 4:
                continue
            # Convert counts to actual values, scaled to the original context.
            # For simplicity, assume unit steps correspond to actual values in [0,4].
            a_val, b_val, c_val, d_val = a, b, c, d
            # Evaluate the sum
            def term(x, y):
                return x / (y**3 + 4) if y != 0 else 0  # avoid division by zero
            total = (term(a_val, b_val) + term(b_val, c_val) +
                     term(c_val, d_val) + term(d_val, a_val))
            print(f"a={a_val},b={b_val},c={c_val},d={d_val} -> sum={total}")
            if total < min_value:
                min_value = total
                candidates = [(a_val, b_val, c_val, d_val, total)]

# Output the minimal candidates
print("Candidates with minimal sum found:")
for c in candidates:
    a_val, b_val, c_val, d_val, total = c
    print(f"a={a_val}, b={b_val}, c={c_val}, d={d_val} -> sum={total}")
