The problem involves analyzing the polynomial \( P_m(x) = x^4 - C(2m+4) x^2 + C((m-2)^2) \) over integers \( m \). We want to find all integers \( m \) such that \( P_m(x) \) factors into the product of two non-zero polynomials \( A \) and \( B \) over \(\mathbb{Z}\). The approach is to iterate over a small range of \( m \), check whether \( P_m \) is reducible over \(\mathbb{Z}\), and output all such \( m \).

We prioritize exact factorization checks to identify reducibility precisely. Since the roots depend on binomial coefficients (which are integers), examining whether \( P_m \) factors relates to whether certain derived quadratic factors have integer roots.

```python
from sympy import symbols, Poly, binomial, factor_list

x = symbols('x')
results = []

# Check m in a small range to find reducible polynomials P_m(x)
for m in range(-10, 11):
    C1 = binomial(2*m + 4, 1)  # 2*m + 4
    C2 = binomial((m - 2)**2, 1)  # (m - 2)^2
    P_m = x**4 - C1 * x**2 + C2
    # Use sympy to factor P_m over integers
    factors = factor_list(P_m, x)[1]
    # Check if factorization yields more than one factor with degree > 0
    if len(factors) > 1:
        results.append(m)
        print(f"m = {m}: Factorization of P_m(x):", factor_list(P_m, x)[0])

# Output all reducible m values
print("Values of m where P_m(x) factors over â„¤:", results)
```
