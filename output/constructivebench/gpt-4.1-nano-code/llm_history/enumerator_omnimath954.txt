The problem defines the set of complex pairs (a, b) that satisfy certain equations involving rational expressions, with the primary relation:

a + 10 * b / (a^2 + b^2) = 5  
b + 10 * a / (a^2 + b^2) = 4

We need to find all solutions (a, b) in ℂ² explicitly, avoiding hardcoded answers. For the enumeration approach, we'll consider real solutions (since complex solutions are more involved), focus on small integer or rational candidates, and verify solutions satisfying the equations. We'll look for solutions with small integer values of a and b within a manageable search space.

Here's the Python code to do the enumeration:

```python
# We will search over small real integers for a and b within a reasonable range
# and check which pairs satisfy the equations within a small tolerance.

def main():
    # Define the range for a and b
    candidates = range(-10, 11)
    solutions = []

    for a in candidates:
        for b in candidates:
            denom = a**2 + b**2
            # Skip if denominator is zero (avoid division by zero)
            if denom == 0:
                continue
            # Compute expressions
            expr1 = a + (10 * b) / denom
            expr2 = b + (10 * a) / denom
            # Check if they satisfy the equations
            if abs(expr1 - 5) < 1e-6 and abs(expr2 - 4) < 1e-6:
                solutions.append((a, b))
                print(f"Found solution: a={a}, b={b}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code enumerates small integer candidates for (a,b), filters solutions near the target values, and prints solutions as soon as they are found, helping to conjecture the true solutions.
