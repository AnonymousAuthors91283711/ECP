abbrev omnimath1429_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath1429 :
  let p_H := (1 : ℝ)/4
  let p_M := (1 : ℝ)/2
  let p_T := (1 : ℝ)/4
    let E := 1 + p_H * E + p_M * (1 + p_H * E + p_M * 0 + p_T * E) + p_T * E
  E = omnimath1429_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: E ≈ 6.00 satisfies the equation with residual 0.00000. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests that the total expected value E simplifies to 6, balancing the probabilities and recursive structure. The computed sum converges to 6.
