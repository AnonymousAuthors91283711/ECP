Your code snippet appears to reference Lean (a theorem prover language), but you requested a Python program to enumerate possible answers for a high school competition math problem. Since no explicit problem statement is given, I'll assume the problem involves finding the smallest integer \( n \geq 2 \) such that for all \( a, b \) with \( a + b = n \), if \( a, b > 0 \), then either the sum of digits of \( a \) or of \( b \) is at least 7.

The approach:
- Enumerate \( n \) starting from 2 upwards.
- For each \( n \), check all positive splits \( a, b \) with \( a + b = n \).
- For each split, verify if neither \( a \) nor \( b \) has a digit sum â‰¥ 7.
- If any such split exists, move on to the next \( n \).
- Otherwise, print \( n \) as the answer.

This aligns with the theorem's statement about being "least" and the condition involving sums of digits.

```python
def digit_sum(x):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(x))

n = 2  # start from the smallest possible n
while True:
    valid_for_n = True  # assume n is valid until a counterexample is found
    for a in range(1, n):  # a, b positive with a + b = n
        b = n - a
        if not (digit_sum(a) >= 7 or digit_sum(b) >= 7):
            # Found a split where both digit sums are less than 7
            valid_for_n = False
            break
    if valid_for_n:
        print(n)
        break  # found the least n satisfying the condition
    n += 1
```
