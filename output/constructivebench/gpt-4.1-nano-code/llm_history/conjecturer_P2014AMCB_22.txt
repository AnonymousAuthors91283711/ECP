<<<(1 : ℚ)>>>
This pattern suggests the solution is a constant function: p(n) = 1 for all n, matching boundary conditions p(0)=0 and p(10)=1 through a similar pattern, or the simple linear form scaled to boundary conditions. The only rational satisfying the endpoint and recurrence is p(n) = n/10, but since p(0)=0 and p(10)=1, the consistent constant is 1.
