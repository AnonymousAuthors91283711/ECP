The problem involves permutations of a 5-element set (Fin 5) and subsets of such permutations with certain restrictions. Specifically, S includes permutations where σ 0 ≠ 0, and T is the subset where σ 1 = 1. We need to compute the probability p = |T| / |S|, which reduces to counting permutations with specific fixed points and restrictions, then find coprime integers a and b such that p = a / b, and determine their sum.

Let's analyze:

- Total permutations: 5! = 120
- For S: permutations with σ 0 ≠ 0 → permutations fixing 0 is 4! = 24, total permutations where σ 0 ≠ 0: 120 - 24 = 96
- For T: permutations in S with σ 1 = 1 → fix 1, and σ 0 ≠ 0 (still true). total permutations fixing 1: 4! = 24; among these, σ 0 ≠ 0 excludes permutation where σ 0 = 0. Since fixing 1, σ 0 can be any value except 0? Wait, because of the restriction σ 0 ≠ 0, but fixing 1, how many permutations fix 1 and have σ 0 ≠ 0?

In the total permutations fixing 1 (fixing 1 in place), permutations over remaining 4 elements: 4! = 24. Among these, σ 0 can be 1, so does that violate constraints? No, because fixing 1 at position 1 doesn't restrict σ 0 directly, but the permutation constraints at the start are about the images.

Actually, in permutation terms:

- S: permutations where σ(0) ≠ 0
- T: permutations where σ(0) ≠ 0 and σ(1) = 1

Total permutations fixing 1: 4! = 24. Now, among these, permutations where σ(0) ≠ 0? Since σ(1)=1 is fixed, the remaining elements to permute are {0,2,3,4}.

- Total permutations fixing 1: permutations of {0,2,3,4}, which is 4! = 24.
- Number of permutations fixing 1 and with σ(0) ≠ 0: permutations over {0,2,3,4} where σ(0) ≠ 0. The total permutations over these 4 elements: 24. The permutations where σ(0) ≠ 0 are all permutations with σ(0) ≠ 0.

Because in all permutations over four elements, σ(0) can be any value of {0,2,3,4}:

- Fix σ(1) = 1.
- σ(0) ≠ 0, so σ(0) ∈ {2,3,4}.

Number of arrangements where σ(0) ∈ {2,3,4} and σ(1)=1:

- Fix σ(1)=1
- σ(0) ∈ {2,3,4}
- Remaining positions for remaining elements.

Number of choices for σ(0): 3

Remaining 3 elements to assign to positions 2,3,4:

- For each choice of σ(0), permute remaining 3 elements freely: 3! =6.

Total: 3*6=18 permutations.

Thus,

- |S|: permutations where σ 0 ≠ 0 → 96
- |T|: permutations in S where σ 1=1 → 18

Probability p=|T|/|S|=18/96=3/16.

Answer: 3 / 16; sum: 3+16=19. Both coprime.

Let's validate this numerically in code and output these values accordingly.

```python
# Enumerate the counts
total_perm = 120  # 5! permutations

# Count S: permutations where σ(0) ≠ 0
# Fix σ(0) when σ(0)=0: total permutations fixing 0 = 4! = 24
# So |S| = total - fixing 0 = 120 - 24 = 96
count_S = total_perm - 24

# Count T: permutations where σ(1)=1 and σ(0) ≠ 0
# Fix σ(1)=1 reduces permutations over remaining 4 elements: 4! = 24
# Among these, σ(0) ≠ 0
# Possible σ(0): Since σ(0) ≠ 0, and from {0,2,3,4} because σ(1)=1 fixed
# σ(0) can be 2,3,4 (3 options), remaining 3 positions permuted in 3! =6 ways
count_T = 3 * 6  # 3 choices for σ(0), remaining permutations

# Fraction p
a, b = count_T, count_S
# Simplify fraction
from math import gcd
g = gcd(a, b)
a_simplified, b_simplified = a // g, b // g

print(f"Numerator: {a_simplified}")
print(f"Denominator: {b_simplified}")
print(f"Sum: {a_simplified + b_simplified}")
```
