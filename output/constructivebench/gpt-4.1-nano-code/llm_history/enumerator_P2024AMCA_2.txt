The problem involves a linear combination of variables \(L\) and \(G\) with parameters \(a\) and \(b\). Given specific values for \(L\) and \(G\) with their corresponding \(T\) values, the goal appears to be to determine the value of \(T\) at a new point, or to identify \(a\) and \(b\) that satisfy the given conditions. 

Since the problem provides multiple data points with the same \(T\) value, we suspect \(T\) might be constant or linear with respect to \(L\) and \(G\). The solution involves solving for \(a\) and \(b\) based on the provided points and then computing \(T\) at \((L_3, G_3)\).

Here's a computational approach:
- Use the known points to solve the linear equations for \(a\) and \(b\).
- Then compute \(T\) at \((L_3, G_3)\).
- Since the problem suggests enumeration, we'll verify whether multiple solutions exist, or explore different approximate solutions if needed.

Let's implement that in Python.

```python
# Setting known data points
L1, G1, T1 = 1.5, 800, 69
L2, G2, T2 = 1.2, 1100, 69
L3, G3 = 4.2, 4000

# Known points; T is linear: T = a*L + b*G
# Since T1 = T2, and they have different L,G values, solve for a, b

# Form the system:
# a*L1 + b*G1 = T1
# a*L2 + b*G2 = T2

from fractions import Fraction

# Construct equations
# Using fractions for exactness
A = [[Fraction(L1), G1],
     [Fraction(L2), G2]]
b_vec = [Fraction(T1), Fraction(T2)]

# Solve for a, b
det = A[0][0]*A[1][1] - A[0][1]*A[1][0]
solutions = []

if det != 0:
    a_num = (b_vec[0]*A[1][1] - b_vec[1]*A[0][1])
    b_num = (A[0][0]*b_vec[1] - A[1][0]*b_vec[0])
    a = a_num / det
    b = b_num / det
    # Compute T at (L3, G3)
    T3 = a * L3 + b * G3
    # Since T should be a real number, convert to float
    print(f"Computed parameters: a={float(a)}, b={float(b)}")
    print(f"T at (L3={L3}, G3={G3}) is approximately {float(T3)}")
    solutions.append(T3)
else:
    # If determinant is zero, check for multiple solutions or consistency
    print("No unique solution for a, b; the points may be colinear or insufficient data.")
```

This code:
- Solves the linear equations for \(a\) and \(b\).
- Computes the value of \(T\) at the new point.
- Streams the result immediately.
- Handles the possibility that the points may lead to no unique solution, indicating linear dependence.
