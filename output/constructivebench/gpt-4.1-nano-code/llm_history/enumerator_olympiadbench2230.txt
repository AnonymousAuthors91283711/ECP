The problem appears to involve finding the minimum number \( m \) such that, for any subset \( D \) of the set of configurations, there exist certain functions \( M \) satisfying particular properties related to the size of \( D \). The structure suggests an extremal combinatorial problem, possibly related to covering or matching in bipartite-like structures under constraints.

Given the problem's nature, the key is to approximate or identify the minimal \( m \), which is defined via a least set. Since the formal proof and definitions are complex, we focus on a small sample implementation to explore potential values for small \( k \), brute-force iterating over candidate \( m \). This way, we can conjecture the minimal \( m \) for small \( k \).

The approach:
- For a fixed small \( k \), try increasing \( m \) from 1 upwards.
- For each \( m \), generate all relevant subsets \( D \) (or a representative subset).
- Check feasibility: whether for each \( D \) with size â‰¤ \( m \), there exists an \( M \) satisfying the properties.
- Once the minimal such \( m \) is found, output it.

This is just a heuristic for small \( k \) (e.g., \( k=2 \)), suitable for exploratory purposes.
