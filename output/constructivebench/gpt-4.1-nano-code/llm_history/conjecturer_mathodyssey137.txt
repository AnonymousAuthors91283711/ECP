The problem involves finding the least n such that for any coloring of [n] with 17 colors, there are distinct elements x, y with x > y and some color p, where 118 * x ≤ 119 * y. Given the inequality and the constraints, the critical bound occurs near n=119, because the ratio 118/119≈1. 

The minimal n satisfying this is 119, matching the threshold where such ratios emerge for the largest value of n satisfying the inequalities.

<<<119>>>
