[write_program]
The problem models a probability process where at each step `t` there's a probability of switching (1/(2*t^2)) and staying (the complement). The recursive relation combines the current stay probability times previous `p`, plus the switch probability times the complement of previous `p`.

Our goal: find the value of `p 15`. We will implement a recursive computation with memoization to efficiently enumerate `p t` for `t=1..15`. Since `p 1 = 1`, we can compute successively up to `p 15`.

For the enumeration, to avoid floating-point inaccuracies, we'll approximate with Rational division where possible, but for simplicity, float division is enough here given the small size.

```python
# Python program to compute p(15) based on the recursive probabilistic process
# modeled in the theorem, by enumerating all intermediate probabilities.
# This implementation uses iterative computation for efficiency.

def main():
    # Number of steps
    T = 15

    # Initialize a list to store probabilities p(t)
    p_values = [0.0] * (T + 1)
    p_values[1] = 1.0  # given initial condition p(1)=1

    for t in range(2, T + 1):
        switch_prob = 1 / (2 * t ** 2)
        stay_prob = 1 - switch_prob
        # recursive relation:
        # p(t) = stayProb(t) * p(t-1) + switchProb(t) * (1 - p(t-1))
        p_values[t] = stay_prob * p_values[t - 1] + switch_prob * (1 - p_values[t - 1])
        print(f"p({t}) ≈ {p_values[t]:.8f}")

    # Output the result for p(15)
    print(f"\np(15) ≈ {p_values[15]:.8f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
