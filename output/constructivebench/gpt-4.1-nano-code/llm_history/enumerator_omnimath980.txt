The problem asks for the number of symmetric functions \( r: \text{Fin}_5 \to \text{Fin}_5 \to \text{Fin}_3 \) satisfying certain properties. These properties specify relations among 5 elements, encoding a kind of "friend-enemy-frenemy" relation matrix with rules for composition. We want to enumerate all such matrices.

Approach:
- There are 25 pairs \((a, b)\) with \(a, b \in \{0,1,2,3,4\}\).
- Since \( r \) is symmetric, we only need to consider \(a \leq b\) to avoid double counting.
- \( r a a = 2 \) fixed for all \(a\) (diagonal entries).
- For off-diagonal entries \(a < b\), assign values in \(\{0,1,2\}\) and check conditions:
  - if \(r a b = 0\) (friend)
  - if \(r a b = 1\) (enemy)
  - if \(r a b = 2\) (frenemy)
- The properties impose rules:
  - \( r a a = 2 \) (done)
  - Transitive relations for "friend" and "enemy" interactions, etc.

Since properties impose consistency constraints, I'll generate all symmetric matrices with the fixed diagonals, then check the properties.

To keep within 400 tokens, we'll:
- Generate all possibilities for the upper triangle (including diagonals).
- Check the conditions on the full matrix.
- Count the valid matrices and print each.

```python
# Enumerate all possible symmetric relations r: Fin_5 x Fin_5 -> Fin_3
# respecting the constraints, then count and print each valid configuration.

from itertools import product

def is_valid(matrix):
    # Check the relations according to the rules
    n = 5
    for a in range(n):
        for b in range(a, n):
            r_ab = matrix[a][b]
            r_ba = matrix[b][a]
            # Symmetry
            if r_ab != r_ba:
                return False
            # Diagonal must be 2
            if a == b and r_ab != 2:
                return False
            # For off-diagonals, check rules:
            for c in range(n):
                r_bc = matrix[b][c]
                r_ac = matrix[a][c]
                r_cb = matrix[c][b]
                r_ca = matrix[c][a]
                # Symmetry check for c
                if r_bc != matrix[b][c] or r_cb != matrix[c][b]:
                    return False
                # Transitivity conditions
                if r_ab == 0 and r_bc == 0:
                    if r_ac != 0:
                        return False
                if r_ab == 1 and r_bc == 1:
                    if r_ac != 0:
                        return False
                if r_ab == 0 and r_bc == 1:
                    if r_ac != 1:
                        return False
    return True

# Generate upper triangle entries
values = [0, 1, 2]
count = 0
for entries in product(values, repeat=(5*6)//2):
    # Fill matrix
    matrix = [[2]*5 for _ in range(5)]
    idx = 0
    for i in range(5):
        for j in range(i, 5):
            matrix[i][j] = entries[idx]
            matrix[j][i] = entries[idx]
            idx +=1
    if is_valid(matrix):
        count += 1
        print(f"Valid relation matrix {count}:\n{matrix}")

print(f"Total valid matrices: {count}")
