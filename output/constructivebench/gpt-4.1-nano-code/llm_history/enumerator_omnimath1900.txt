Let's analyze the problem to identify possible solutions. The sequence \(a(n)\) for \(n=0,\dots,10\) satisfies the recurrence:

\[a(n+2) \times a(n) \times a(n+1) = a(n+2) + a(n) + a(n+1)\]

with initial conditions:

- \(a(0)=0\),
- \(a(1)=1\),
- \(a(2)>0\).

We are told that the sequence continues with this recurrence up to index 8, and the value at index 10 is unknown, but we impose the non-existence of a solution at index 10 satisfying:

\[a(10) \times a(8) \times a(7) = a(10) + a(8) + a(7)\]

The goal is to find the least possible value \(a(2)\) (since the sequence depends on the initial conditions and the recurrence), and the problem suggests that the sequence can be generated for various initial \(a(2)\). We can attempt to generate potential sequences with different \(a(2)\), examine their values at index 8 and 10, and check the conditions.

To proceed, I will:

- Pick small rational values for \(a(2)\) starting from a low positive number (say from 0.1 upward).
- Generate the sequence up to index 10 using the recurrence.
- Check if the sequence satisfies the recurrence constraints.
- Note sequences where the final condition (absence of a solution at \(a(10)\)) holds.

**Because of the problem's complexity, I'll limit my search to small positive initial \(a(2)\), compute sequences until index 10, and report those sequences where the conditions are closely met.**

```python
# Enumerate possible a(2) values (from 0.1 to 5 in steps of 0.1)
import numpy as np

# Function to generate sequence based on initial a2
def generate_sequence(a2, max_n=10):
    sequence = [0, 1, a2]
    for n in range(1, max_n):
        a_n, a_n_1 = sequence[n], sequence[n-1]
        # Solve recurrence for a_{n+1}
        # recurrence: a(n+1) * a(n-1) * a(n) = a(n+1) + a(n-1) + a(n)
        # rewrite as: a_{n+1}*(a_{n-1}*a_n - 1) = a_{n-1} + a_n
        denom = a_n_1 * a_n - 1
        if abs(denom) < 1e-12:
            # Avoid division by zero, sequence breaks
            return sequence
        a_next = (a_n_1 + a_n) / denom
        sequence.append(a_next)
    return sequence

# Search over small initial a(2) values
a2_values = np.arange(0.1, 5.1, 0.1)
for a2 in a2_values:
    seq = generate_sequence(a2)
    if len(seq) >= 11:
        a7 = seq[7]
        a8 = seq[8]
        a10 = seq[10]
        # Check the critical condition at index 10
        lhs = a10 * a8 * a7
        rhs = a10 + a8 + a7
        if abs(lhs - rhs) > 1e-6:
            # Print candidate sequences that do not satisfy the condition exactly
            print(f"Initial a2={a2:.2f}: Sequence up to 10: {seq}")
            print(f"At index 7: {a7:.3f}, index 8: {a8:.3f}, index 10: {a10:.3f}")
            print(f"lhs={lhs:.3f}, rhs={rhs:.3f}\n")
```

This script explores initial \(a(2)\) from 0.1 to 5 in steps of 0.1, generating sequences using the recurrence. It outputs sequences where the critical condition does not hold exactly at index 10, helping identify candidate minimal \(a(2)\) for which the non-existence condition applies. This helps in conjecturing the minimal initial value ensuring the problem's assertion.

The approach effectively enumerates solutions, finds approximate solutions, and streams the candidates revealing the underlying structure for further proof or analysis.
[refine_program]
The program enumerates potential sequences based on varying initial a(2) values and checks whether the final terms satisfy a specific multiplicative relation. However, the main issues are:

1. It doesn't explicitly find solutions to the recurrence, which could satisfy the boundary condition (the critical relation at index 10). Instead, it just prints sequences that do not satisfy the relation.
2. The pattern of thresholds and output is not designated to find or output the necessary answer, especially considering that the problem seeks the least value satisfying certain properties.
3. No candidate satisfying the boundary condition is identified or printed, so the program essentially produces no solutions (an empty output).
4. The problem's requirement indicates that answers should be streamed immediately upon identification, and the final answer should be explicitly presented.
5. The code is inefficient and incomplete: it does not attempt to solve for possible `a(2)` values that produce sequences satisfying the boundary condition.

Given these issues, the current program cannot produce correct or meaningful answers as required. It should be rejected.

**Corrected approach:**

- Search for initial `a(2)` within a small domain (e.g., from 0.1 to 5, step 0.01) where the recurrence relation at `n=9` produces `a(10)` satisfying the boundary condition exactly.
- Use numerical methods (like root-finding) to find the specific `a(2)` that satisfy the boundary condition exactly.
- Stream the approximate solution early, then refine if needed.
- Since the problem involves a boundary condition at `a(10)`, it's appropriate to use a root-finding method to solve for `a(2)`.

**Implementation:**

Here's a corrected Python program that searches for initial `a(2)` values, evaluates the sequence, and attempts to find the precise `a(2)` that satisfies the key relation at `a(10)`. To keep tokens within 400, comments are concise, and code is efficient.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import brentq

def generate_sequence(a2):
    seq = [0, 1, a2]
    for n in range(1, 10):
        a_n, a_n_1 = seq[n], seq[n-1]
        denom = a_n_1 * a_n - 1
        if abs(denom) < 1e-14:
            return None
        a_next =
[refine_program]
This problem appears to involve a recursive sequence defined over indices, with certain initial conditions and a recurrence relation. The goal is to identify the least (smallest) value of `a(2)` satisfying complex conditions, including the recurrence and boundary conditions, within constraints on sequences up to index 10.

The provided "program" doesn't contain any code (it's `None`), and the enumerated answers show an error: "Program is empty." Given the code is unavailable or incomplete, there's no way to verify or generate answers. 

**Judgment:**
- The problem is a mathematical challenge involving sequences and inequalities.
- The provided code is empty (`None`), so it cannot be executed or produce outputs.
- According to the program requirements, the code should be executable and produce answers immediately; here, it does not.
- Without any code, no enumeration, no outputs, thus it cannot meet the specified instructions.

**Conclusion:** The original program (which is empty) is rejected.

**Corrected Approach:**

Since the problem asks for a minimal value of `a(2)` satisfying the recurrence, initial conditions, and a non-existence of a certain boundary condition, a practical approach is to try small candidate values for `a(2)`, check whether they satisfy the recursive relations approximately or exactly, and determine the minimal such value.

Because the exact recurrence is complex, and the problem involves `ℝ`, we should discretize a reasonable small search space for `a(2)`.

Here's a sample code that:

- Chooses candidate values of `a(2)` starting from 0 upwards (say, in increments),
- Checks the recurrence relation for each candidate,
- Stops when the conditions are satisfied (or after a threshold),
- Prints each candidate and the corresponding check (allowing early exit for minimal).

This approach is simplified but adheres to the program specifications focusing on minimal `a(2)`.

```python
import math

def check_sequence(a2, tolerance=1e-6, max_n=8):
    # Initial conditions:
    a0 = 0
    a1 = 1
    a = [a0, a1, a2]
    # Attempt to generate sequence up to index 10
    for n in range(2, max_n+1):
        # recurrence: a_{n+2} * a_n * a_{n+1} = a_{n+2} + a_n
