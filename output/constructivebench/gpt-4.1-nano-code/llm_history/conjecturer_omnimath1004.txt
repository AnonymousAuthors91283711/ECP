Number of c values with solutions: 3
c = 1
c = 3
c = 8. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests the set includes small positive integers with solutions to quadratic equations involving p. The enumerated solutions highlight three specific c values: 1, 3, and 8, which are all positive and less than p. Based on the pattern, the answer is a finite set containing these key values.

<<<3>>>

The answer reflects the number of such c, namely 3, which matches the count of specific solutions: c=1, c=3, c=8.
