The problem involves counting integers between 100 and 300 that are divisible by 5 and 7, but not divisible by 10.  
- All multiples of 5 in the range: 100 to 300.  
- Those also divisible by 7.  
- Exclude those divisible by 10 (which are multiples of 2 and 5, but since 10 divides n, and n is divisible by 5, the only check is whether n is divisible by 2).  
- So, effectively, count multiples of 35 (lcm of 5 and 7) in the range that are not divisible by 10 (i.e., not even).  
- Multiples of 35: 105, 140, 175, 210, 245, 280.  
- Among these, remove those divisible by 10 (multiples of 10): 140, 210, 280.  
- Remaining are: 105, 175, 245.  

Let's verify this with a program:

```python
# Enumerate numbers n in [100, 300] that satisfy the conditions directly.
answer_candidates = []

for n in range(100, 301):
    if (n % 5 == 0 and n % 7 == 0 and n % 10 != 0):
        print(n)
        answer_candidates.append(n)

# Count how many are there
print("Count:", len(answer_candidates))
```

The answer is the count of these numbers. Implemented directly:

```python
# Counting the numbers satisfying the given condition
def compute_answer():
    count = 0
    for n in range(100, 301):
        if n % 5 == 0 and n % 7 == 0 and n % 10 != 0:
            print(n)
            count += 1
    return count

ans = compute_answer()
print("Answer:", ans)
```
