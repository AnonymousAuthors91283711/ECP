theorem omnimath3088 :
  let people := ["Aristotle", "David", "Flora", "Munirah", "Pedro"]
  let chairs := Fin 5
  let davidPos : chairs := ⟨2, by decide⟩
  let validSeatings := {f : chairs → String |

  let favorableSeatings := {f ∈ validSeatings | 
    f ⟨1, by decide⟩ = "Pedro" ∨ f ⟨3, by decide⟩ = "Pedro"}
  (ncard favorableSeatings : ℚ) / (ncard validSeatings : ℚ) = omnimath3088_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Total valid seatings: 24
Favorable seatings: 12
Ratio: 12/24 = 0.5
