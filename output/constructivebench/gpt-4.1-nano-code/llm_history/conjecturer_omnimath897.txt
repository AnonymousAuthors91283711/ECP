abbrev omnimath897_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath897 :
  let D := (100 : ℕ).divisors
  let Z := Finset.Icc 1 100
  (∑ d in D, ∑ z in Z, if d ∣ z then (1 : ℚ) else 0) / (D.card * Z.card) = omnimath897_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 0.33435684647302905. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The pattern suggests the average of the indicator over divisors and integers is approximately 1/3. For large n, the expected proportion is near 1/3, reflecting the average divisor density.
