The problem involves three equations with real numbers:

1. \( h \times a \times r \times v \times a \times r \times d = 100 \),
2. \( m \times i \times t = 100 \),
3. \( h \times m \times m \times t = 100 \).

We want to find the value of \( (r \times a \times d) \times (t \times r \times i \times v \times i \times a) \).

Since this is a high-school level problem, the key is to systematically express variables and look for a pattern or factorization that simplifies the expression.

The approach:
- Set \( A = a, R = r, V = v, D = d, M = m, I = i, T = t, H= h \).
- Using the given equations, express some variables in terms of others.
- Guess that the variables are positive reals; then find their relations.

Note the structure:
- The first equation involves \( h, a, r, v, d \).
- The second involves \( m, i, t \).
- The third involves \( h, m, t \).

Observe that:
- From (2): \( m = \dfrac{100}{i t} \),
- From (3): \( h m^2 t = 100 \Rightarrow h = \dfrac{100}{m^2 t} \).

Substitute \( m \):
- \( h = \dfrac{100}{(\frac{100}{i t})^2 t} = \dfrac{100}{(\frac{100^2}{i^2 t^2}) t} = \dfrac{100}{\frac{10000}{i^2 t^2} \times t} = \dfrac{100}{\frac{10000 t}{i^2 t^2}} = \dfrac{100}{\frac{10000}{i^2 t}} = \frac{100 i^2 t}{10000} = \frac{i^2 t}{100} \).

Now use the first equation:
- \( h a r v a r d = 100 \),
- \( h a^2 r^2 v d = 100 \),
- Substitute \( h = \frac{i^2 t}{100} \):
  \( \frac{i^2 t}{100} \times a^2 r^2 v d = 100 \Rightarrow a^2 r^2 v d = \frac{100 \times 100}{i^2 t} = \frac{10000}{i^2 t} \).

Our target:
\[
(r a d) \times (t r i v i a) = r a d \times t r i v i a.
\]
Rearranged as:
\[
(r a d) \times (t r i v i a) = r a d \times t r i v i a.
\]

Note:
- \( r a d \) appears directly,
- \( t r i v i a \) can be regrouped as \( t r i \times v i a \),
- but see that this problem is symmetric; likely the answer simplifies to a constant.

Using the earlier relations, our program will attempt to find specific numeric solutions consistent with the equations by assigning small sample values.

We will enumerate \( i, t \), then compute \( m, h \), then determine \( a, r, v, d \) consistent with the constraints, and compute the target expression assuming minimal positive real solutions.

```python
# Enumerate small positive values for i and t
# Compute corresponding m, h
# Find consistent a, r, v, d satisfying the key equations
# Calculate the target expression for each solution

for i in [1, 2, 4]:
    for t in [1, 2, 4]:
        m = 100 / (i * t)
        h = (i**2 * t) / 100
        # From the first equation: a^2 * r^2 * v * d = 10000 / (i^2 * t)
        sum = 10000 / (i**2 * t)
        # Assign arbitrary positive values to r, a, v, and d to satisfy the above:
        # For simplicity, set a = 1, r = 1
        a = 1
        r = 1
        v_d_product = sum / (a**2 * r**2)  # v * d
        # Choose v = 1, then d = v_d_product
        v = 1
        d = v_d_product
        # Now compute the target expression:
        ra_d = r * a * d
        tiva = t * r * i * v * i * a

        answer = ra_d * tiva
        print(f"i={i}, t={t}, m={m:.2f}, h={h:.2f}, v={v:.2f}, d={d:.2f}")
        print(f"Answer: {answer}")
```
