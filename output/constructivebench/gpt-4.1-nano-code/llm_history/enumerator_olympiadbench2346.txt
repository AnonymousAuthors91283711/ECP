The problem asks for solving the equation \((\log x)^{\log (\log x)} = 10000\) for \(x > 0\). Since the expression involves nested logs, we analyze the structure to find candidate solutions, focusing on when the functions take values that match 10,000.

1. Recognize that for \(x > 1\), \(\log x > 0\).
2. Set \(t = \log x\). The equation becomes \(t^{\log t} = 10,000\).
3. Because \(t > 0\), analyze the behavior of \(t^{\log t}\):
   - For \(t > 1\), \(\log t > 0\), so \(t^{\log t} = e^{(\log t)^2}\).
   - The equation simplifies to \(e^{(\log t)^2} = 10,000\).
4. Take natural logs:
   \((\log t)^2 = \ln 10,000 = \ln(10^4) = 4 \ln 10 \approx 4 \times 2.302585 \approx 9.21034\).

5. Then \(\log t = \pm \sqrt{9.21034} \approx \pm 3.034\).

6. For positive \(t\), both \(\log t = 3.034\) and \(\log t = -3.034\) are valid:
   - \(t = e^{3.034} \approx 20.8\),
   - \(t = e^{-3.034} \approx 0.048\).

7. Recall \(t = \log x\), so:
   - \(x = e^{t} \):
     - When \(t = 20.8\), \(x \approx e^{20.8}\),
     - When \(t = 0.048\), \(x \approx e^{0.048}\).

8. We only consider \(x > 0\) and \(\log x > 0\) for the principal branch, but since \(\log x\) can be negative, both solutions are valid.

Here's the code to generate these solutions:

```python
import math

# Calculate the threshold value ln(10000)
threshold = 4 * math.log(10)

# Candidate solutions for log t
log_t1 = math.sqrt(threshold)
log_t2 = -math.sqrt(threshold)

# Compute corresponding x
x1 = math.exp(log_t1)
x2 = math.exp(log_t2)

# Stream output of solutions
print(f"x ≈ {x1:.2f}")
print(f"x ≈ {x2:.2f}")
```
