This problem models sequences of moves on a 12-hour clock, where each move advances either the hour hand or the minute hand by one position. The total sequence length is 144 steps, starting and ending at the same position, with moves only to adjacent positions, and all positions appearing exactly once.

We want to count the number of such sequences. Since each move increases either the hour or minute coordinate by 1 (mod 12), the total number of moves is 143, with equal increments in the hour and minute components overall, returning to the starting position.

**Key insights:**

- Moves are from `(i, j)` to either `(i+1, j)` or `(i, j+1)` modulo 12.
- The sequence starts and ends at `(0,0)`, and each position appears exactly once.
- The total number of each move is 12 (to cover all 12 positions cyclically).

This reduces to counting the number of sequences consisting of 12 increments in hours and 12 in minutes, totaling 24 moves, with each position visited exactly once (i.e., a path that hits all positions exactly once), which effectively counts lattice paths with constraints.

**Simplification:**
- Since total moves are 144 steps with 12 hour increments and 12 minute increments, and each position visited exactly once, the sequence corresponds to permutations with specific move counts and visiting each position exactly once.

Instead of enumerating all sequences directly, a combinatorial approach is simplest:

- The sequence's moves can be represented as interleavings of 12 right (hour) steps and 12 up (minute) steps, with all positions visited exactly once.
- The count of such sequences without cross restrictions is `binomial coefficient C(24,12)`.

But we need to check which of these sequences satisfy all conditionsâ€”specifically, the sequence must cover all positions exactly once and start/end at `(0,0)`. Given the symmetry and constraints, the count reduces to the number of lattice paths from `(0,0)` to `(12,12)` consisting of 12 East and 12 North steps, which is `C(24,12)`.

**Thus,** the answer is the number of combinations of 12 moves in each direction among 24 total moves: `C(24,12)`.

We will compute `binomial(24, 12)` and output it immediately.

```python
from math import comb

# Count of sequences corresponds to the number of lattice paths from (0,0) to (12,12),
# with steps either East or North, visiting all positions exactly once.
answer = comb(24, 12)
print(answer)
```
