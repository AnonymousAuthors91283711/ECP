theorem omnimath513 :
  tsum (fun (n : {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ (2 * n) ∣ φ n}) => (1 / (n : ℚ))) = omnimath513_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Total sum over small n: 0.0
. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Given that the sum is only over small n, and the total sum from the enumeration is 0.0, the sum over all such n simplifies to zero. The divisor condition (2 * n) | φ n indicates the sum is only non-empty for finitely many n, likely none in the general. Therefore, the sum should be zero in the rational numbers.
