theorem P2006AIMEI_12 : 
  ∃ (sols : Finset ℝ), (∀ x ∈ sols, 100 < x ∧ x < 200 ∧ 
    cos (3 * x * π / 180)^3 + cos (5 * x * π / 180)^3 = 8 * cos (4 * x * π / 180)^3 * cos (x * π / 180)^3) ∧
    sols.sum id = P2006AIMEI_12_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Solution at x = 112.50 degrees
Solution at x = 126.00 degrees
Solution at x = 150.00 degrees
Solution at x = 157.50 degrees
Solution at x = 162.00 degrees
Solution at x = 198.00 degrees
Sum of solutions: 905.9999999999826. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given solutions and sum, the answer is the sum of all solutions: 112.5 + 126 + 150 + 157.5 + 162 + 198 = 905.5. 
∑ solutions = 905.5. In formal Lean, this is restricted to the decimal. 

<<<905.5>>>
