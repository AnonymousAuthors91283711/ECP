This problem involves analyzing the recursive function D(n), which is defined as:
- D(0) = 0
- D(1) = 0
- D(2) = 1
- D(n+3) = D(n+2) + D(n)

Our goal seems to involve understanding the values of D at large arguments (like 2021, 2022, 2023) and formulating a property (P2021AMCA_8_answer). Since the original code has placeholders, I will help explore the pattern of D(n). 

I'll write Python code to generate the first several values of D(n), observe the sequence, and explore possible patterns or formulas, focusing on close samples near 0-20 to infer a closed form or recurrence pattern. 

The program will:
- Compute D(n) for n up to 30 for pattern recognition.
- Print these values as they are computed.
- Use a simple recursive/memoized approach for efficiency.
- Focus on small n to help conjecture.

This will assist in recognizing the sequence pattern, which can be useful in formulating the question's answer or property.

```python
# Explore the recursive sequence D(n) to identify patterns
def compute_D(n, memo={}):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        result = 0
    elif n == 2:
        result = 1
    else:
        result = compute_D(n-1, memo) + compute_D(n-3, memo)
    memo[n] = result
    return result

# Generate and print values of D(n) from n=0 to 30
for i in range(31):
    value = compute_D(i)
    print(f"D({i}) = {value}")
```
