[write_program]
The given code appears to be using a formal proof language (possibly Lean), but you want a Python script to enumerate possible answers to a problem similar in structure. The expression looks like it computes a total from two parts: \(5 \times (5 - 1)\) and \(4 \times (4 - 1)\). 

For demonstration, I will write a Python script that computes this sum exactly, and then enumerates all possible values for similar expressions by varying the parameters around the given ones (like 4 and 5). The goal is to produce possible answers, prioritize exact calculations, and explore small ranges of inputs for conjecture.

```python
# Enumerate possible sums similar to the given expression, varying parameters 4 and 5
# For this example, we'll vary a and b: sum = a * (a - 1) + b * (b - 1)

# Define parameter ranges
range_a = range(3, 7)  # small sample around 4, 5, 6
range_b = range(3, 7)  # small sample around 4, 5, 6

# Enumerate all combinations and print results
for a in range_a:
    for b in range_b:
        sum_value = a * (a - 1) + b * (b - 1)
        print(f"a={a}, b={b} -> sum = {sum_value}")

# As the specific value in the original is (5 * 4) + (4 * 3), compute and print that
exact_value = 5 * (5 - 1) + 4 * (4 - 1)
print(f"Exact answer for a=5, b=4: {exact_value}")
```
