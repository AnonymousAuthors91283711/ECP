theorem P2024HMMTnov_gen_3 :
  IsLeast {s : ℕ | ∃ (a b c : ℕ), a ≠ b ∧ a ≠ c ∧ b ≠ c ∧ 0 < a ∧ 0 < b ∧ 0 < c ∧ a^b * b^c = a^c ∧ s = a + b + c} 
  P2024HMMTnov_gen_3_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found solution: a=8, b=2, c=3, sum=13
Found solution: a=8, b=4, c=12, sum=24
Found solution: a=9, b=3, c=6, sum=18
Found solution: a=16, b=4, c=8, sum=28
Minimum sum among solutions: 13. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the pattern of solutions, the minimal sum occurs at (a, b, c) = (8, 2, 3). Because the solutions seem constrained by the equation a^b * b^c = a^c with distinct positive integers, the minimal sum is 13. 

Therefore, the answer generalized for the minimal sum:

<<<13>>>
