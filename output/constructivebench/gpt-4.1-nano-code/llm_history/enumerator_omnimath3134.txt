The problem involves a sequence of differences between real numbers P, Q, R, S with given relations, and asks to find the difference S - P. 

Given:
- Q - P = 1
- R - Q = 2 * (Q - P) = 2 * 1 = 2
- S - R = 3 * (R - Q) = 3 * 2 = 6

We need to find S - P in terms of these differences.

Let's verify:
- R - P = (Q - P) + (R - Q) = 1 + 2 = 3
- S - P = (S - R) + (R - P) = 6 + 3 = 9

Thus, `S - P = 9`.

Here's a Python script to verify and list possible answers to support conjecture:

```python
# Given the relations:
# Q - P = 1
# R - Q = 2 * (Q - P) = 2
# S - R = 3 * (R - Q) = 6

# Start with P at 0 for simplicity
P = 0
Q = P + 1
R = Q + 2
S = R + 6

# Difference S - P
answer = S - P

# Print the computed answer
print(answer)
```
