This problem asks us to count the number of pairs (a, b) where a and b are natural numbers, with 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 60, satisfying the conditions:

- b is divisible by a (b % a = 0)
- (b + 1) is divisible by a + 1 ((b + 1) % (a + 1) = 0)

We will enumerate all such pairs and count them, then report the total number.

```python
# Enumerate all pairs (a, b) with 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 60
# and satisfying the given divisibility conditions.
# Count how many such pairs exist.

count = 0
for a in range(1, 61):
    for b in range(a, 61):
        if b % a == 0 and (b + 1) % (a + 1) == 0:
            print(f"Pair (a={a}, b={b}) satisfies the conditions.")
            count += 1
print(f"Total count: {count}")
```
