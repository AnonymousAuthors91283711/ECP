theorem P2019AIMEI_14 :
  IsLeast {p : ℕ | Nat.Prime p ∧ Odd p ∧ p ∣ (2019^8 + 1)} P2019AIMEI_14_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 2. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the pattern that the only divisors with the defined properties are related to small primes and the enumeration suggests the smallest prime satisfying the conditions is 2, the answer should be 2.
