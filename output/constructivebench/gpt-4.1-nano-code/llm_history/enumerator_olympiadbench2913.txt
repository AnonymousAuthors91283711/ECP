This problem involves finding digits A, B, C (each less than 10) such that the sum of squares of two 2-digit numbers equals 1313, and then computing their sum A + B + C. The two numbers are (A*10 + B) and (A*10 + C). The key is to find all possible digits A, B, C satisfying the sum of squares condition and then determine their sum.

To efficiently enumerate, we'll iterate over A, B, and C from 0 to 9, check the equation, and print each solution as soon as it's found.

```python
# Enumerate possible digits A, B, C less than 10
for A in range(10):
    for B in range(10):
        for C in range(10):
            # Calculate the squares
            num1 = A * 10 + B
            num2 = A * 10 + C
            sum_squares = num1 ** 2 + num2 ** 2
            if sum_squares == 1313:
                print(f"A={A}, B={B}, C={C}, Sum={A+B+C}")
```
