This problem asks for the greatest natural number \( x \) such that \( 0 < x \) and \( 23^{6 + x} \) divides \( 2000! \). We need to find the highest exponent \( x \) for which the prime factorization of \( 2000! \) contains \( 23^{6+x} \).

Since \( 2000! \) contains many primes raised to certain exponents, we want to compute the exponent of 23 in \( 2000! \). The exponent of a prime \( p \) in \( n! \) is given by Legendre's formula:

\[
\text{exp}_p(n!) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^k} \right\rfloor
\]

For \( p=23 \) and \( n=2000 \), larger powers \( p^k \) will quickly exceed 2000, so only a few terms are needed.

Our task is to find the maximum \( x \) such that:

\[
23^{6 + x} \mid 2000! \quad \Rightarrow \quad \text{exp}_{23}(2000!) \geq 6 + x
\]

Rearranged:

\[
x \leq \text{exp}_{23}(2000!) - 6
\]

The maximum integer \( x \) satisfying this is:

\[
x = \text{exp}_{23}(2000!) - 6
\]

We will compute \(\text{exp}_{23}(2000!)\), then print all candidates from 0 up to the maximum, narrowing down to find the greatest \( x \).

```python
# Compute the exponent of prime p in n!
def prime_exponent_in_factorial(n, p):
    count = 0
    divisor = p
    while divisor <= n:
        count += n // divisor
        divisor *= p
    return count

n = 2000
p = 23

# Compute exponent of p in 2000!
exp_p = prime_exponent_in_factorial(n, p)

# We want all candidate x such that 6 + x <= exp_p
# x <= exp_p - 6
max_x = exp_p - 6

# Print all candidate answers from 0 up to max_x
for x in range(max_x + 1):
    print(x)
```
