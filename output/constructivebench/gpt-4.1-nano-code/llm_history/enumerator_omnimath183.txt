This problem involves summing terms of the form \( \frac{1}{\cos(\frac{\pi k}{180}) \cos(\frac{\pi (k+1)}{180})} \) for \(k\) from 0 to 88, then establishing a closed-form answer or approximation. To assist in conjecturing, we'll enumerate candidate sums with small parameters and look for patterns or potential closed forms.

We'll:
- Use Python to evaluate each term efficiently.
- Sum the entire series.
- Print intermediate results for partial understanding.
- Focus on exact rational approximations when possible, or floating-point for approximation.

Let's implement this:

```python
import math

# Enumerate and sum the series
total_sum = 0.0
for k in range(89):
    angle_k = math.pi * k / 180
    angle_k1 = math.pi * (k + 1) / 180
    cos_k = math.cos(angle_k)
    cos_k1 = math.cos(angle_k1)
    # To avoid division by zero, skip if cosine very close to zero
    if abs(cos_k) < 1e-12 or abs(cos_k1) < 1e-12:
        continue
    term = 1 / (cos_k * cos_k1)
    total_sum += term
    # Print each term to assist conjecture
    print(f"k={k}: term≈{term}")

# Output the total sum as a float approximation
print(f"Total sum≈{total_sum}")
```
