Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Let's analyze the individual rates: Dennis and Edward both mow lawns at 60/48 lawns per hour, simplifying to 5/4, and Shawn at 60/24, simplifying to 5/2. Combined hourly rate = (5/4 + 5/4 + 5/2) = (5/4 + 5/4 + 10/4) = (20/4) = 5 lawns/hour. For 2 hours, total lawns = 5 * 2 = 10. Expressed as an integer, this is 10. 

Final answer: <<<10>>>.
