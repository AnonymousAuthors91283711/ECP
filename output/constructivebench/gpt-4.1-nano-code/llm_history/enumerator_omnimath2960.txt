This problem involves four integers p, q, r, s, with q, r, s consecutive integers following p, and their sum constraints. The key details:
- q = p + 1
- r = q + 1 = p + 2
- s = r + 1 = p + 3
- p + s = 109

Substituting s = p + 3 into the sum, we get:
p + (p + 3) = 109 → 2p + 3 = 109 → 2p = 106 → p = 53

From p = 53:
q = 54
r = 55
s = 56

The goal is to output q + r for these values.

Here's a Python script that computes the solution by brute-force enumeration, considering small ranges around the expected solution:

```python
# Enumerate small ranges around the suggested solution
for p in range(50, 57):
    q = p + 1
    r = q + 1
    s = r + 1
    if p + s == 109:
        print(f"p={p}, q={q}, r={r}, s={s}")
        # Compute q + r
        print(f"q + r = {q + r}")
```
