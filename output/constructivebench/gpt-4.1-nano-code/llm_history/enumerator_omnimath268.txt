This problem involves finding all functions \( n: \mathrm{Fin}~14 \to \mathbb{Z} \) such that each \( n(i) \ge 0 \) and the sum of their fourth powers equals 1599. To assist in conjecturing the possible solutions, we will enumerate all possible combinations of non-negative integers \( n(i) \), within reasonable bounds, because larger values would cause the sum to exceed 1599 rapidly.

Given the sum of four powers, a rough upper bound for each \( n(i) \) can be estimated: since \( 3^4 = 81 \), and \( 81 \times 14 = 1134 < 1599 \), we can consider \( n(i) \le 4 \) or \( 5 \) in some cases, but to be thorough, an initial enumeration up to \( n(i) \le 6 \) is safer for exploratory purposes.

Because we're only interested in functions where all \( n(i) \ge 0 \), a brute-force enumeration over all 14-tuples with values 0 to 6 is feasible and will help identify candidate solutions.

Here's the Python code:

```python
# Enumerate all 14-tuples of non-negative integers up to 6
# such that the sum of their fourth powers equals 1599

from itertools import product

# Set the maximum value each n(i) can take for enumeration
max_val = 6
target_sum = 1599
dim = 14

# Generate all possible candidate tuples
for ans in product(range(max_val + 1), repeat=dim):
    total = sum(x**4 for x in ans)
    if total == target_sum:
        print(ans)
```
