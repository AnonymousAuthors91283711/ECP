The problem involves a system of proportional relationships between four real numbers \(w, x, y, z\), with given formulas:

- \(w = \frac{4}{3} x\)
- \(y = \frac{3}{2} z\)
- \(z = \frac{1}{6} x\)

We need to find the ratio \(\frac{w}{y}\). Since these are proportional relationships, the exact expression should simplify through substitution.

To assist in verifying the answer or exploring related possibilities, I will write a Python program that enumerates potential values for these variables based on small sample parameters, computes \(\frac{w}{y}\), and streams the answers immediately as they are found.

The main goal is to confirm the derived ratio matches the symbolic calculations, but through enumeration, we can explore and verify.

```python
# Enumerate small values of x, z based on the given ratios,
# then compute corresponding w, y, and their ratio w/y.

# To ensure the ratio is exact, use fractions
from fractions import Fraction

# Parameter ranges for small sample values
x_values = [Fraction(n, 10) for n in range(1, 11)]  # x from 0.1 to 1.0 in steps of 0.1
z_values = [Fraction(n, 60) for n in range(1, 11)]  # z from 1/60 to 1/6 in steps

for x in x_values:
    z = Fraction(1, 6) * x
    if z not in z_values:
        continue  # To limit enumeration, but here z is directly derived
    w = (4/3) * x
    y = (3/2) * z
    ratio = w / y
    print(f"x={float(x):.2f}, z={float(z):.2f}, w={float(w):.2f}, y={float(y):.2f}, w/y={float(ratio):.4f}")
```
