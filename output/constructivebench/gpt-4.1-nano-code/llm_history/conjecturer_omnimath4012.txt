The error arises because `<==` is not valid syntax in Lean. The intended answer is probably a `Set` of functions that satisfy the given functional equation. 

Based on the enumeration, the only known solution is the constant zero function. Therefore, the set should be a singleton containing exactly that function: the constant zero function \(f(x) = 0\).

The corrected syntax should be:

```lean
{f : ℝ → ℝ | ∀ x y : ℝ, f x * f y = x * f (f (y - x)) + x * f (2 * x) + f (x ^ 2)}
```

This is a subset of all functions \(f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) satisfying the functional equation.

Final answer:
<<<{λ f : ℝ → ℝ, f = λ x, 0}>>>

This represents the singleton set containing only the constant zero function, which aligns with the known solution.
