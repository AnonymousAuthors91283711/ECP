This problem seems to involve finding the minimal value of c (which is g3) such that the specified relations between a1, a2, a3, g1, g2, and g3 hold, with some conditions involving quadratic relations.

Since it is about the least such c, the key relations are:
- a1 = 9
- a2 = a1 + d
- a3 = a2 + d
- g1 = a1
- g2 = a2 + 2
- g3 = a3 + 20
- The relation: g2^2 = g1 * g3

Given these, to find the minimal c (i.e., minimal g3), we can vary the parameter d over some reasonable small sample (say, from -10 to 10), compute g2, g3, check the relation, and identify the minimal g3 that satisfies the relation. 

Here's a Python program to do this efficiently:

```python
# Enumerate d over a small range and find minimal g3 satisfying g2^2 = g1 * g3
# g1 = 9
# a2 = 9 + d
# a3 = 9 + 2d
# g2 = a2 + 2 = 11 + d
# g3 = a3 + 20 = 29 + 2d
# Relation: g2^2 = g1 * g3 => (11 + d)^2 = 9 * (29 + 2d)
# Solve for d and compute corresponding g3 to find minimal g3

import math

min_g3 = None
result_d = None

# We'll test integer values of d from -10 to 10
for d in range(-10, 11):
    g2 = 11 + d
    g3 = 29 + 2*d
    left = g2 ** 2
    right = 9 * g3
    # Check if the relation holds (allow small floating error if needed)
    if abs(left - right) < 1e-6:
        print(g3)  # Output g3 immediately
        # Track minimal g3
        if (min_g3 is None) or (g3 < min_g3):
            min_g3 = g3
            result_d = d

# After enumeration, output the minimal g3 found
if min_g3 is not None:
    print("Minimal g3:", min_g3)
else:
    print("No solution found in the tested d range.")
```
