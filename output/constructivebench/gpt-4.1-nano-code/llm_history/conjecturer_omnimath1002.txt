abbrev omnimath1002_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath1002 :
  let n := (2021 : ℝ)
  let p := (2 * (n - 2)) / (n * (n - 1))
  ⌊n * p⌋ = omnimath1002_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n = 2021
p = 4038 / 4082420
n * p = 1.999009900990099
Floor(n * p) = 1. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests the calculation involves the floor of \(n \times p\) where \(p = \frac{2(n - 2)}{n(n - 1)}\). Simplifying \(n \times p\), it approaches 2 closely, but remains slightly less than 2 when \(n = 2021\). Because of the limit behavior, the floor should be 1, independent of \(n\). 

Hence, the answer is simply 1 for the given \(n\).

<<<1>>>

This reasoning aligns with the enumerated answer and the limit perspective.
