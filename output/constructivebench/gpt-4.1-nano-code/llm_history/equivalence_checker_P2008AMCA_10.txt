noncomputable abbrev P2008AMCA_10_answer : ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem P2008AMCA_10 (t : ℝ) :
  (1/5 + 1/7) * (t - 1) = 1 ↔ P2008AMCA_10_answer t = 1 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun t => (1/5 + 1/7) * (t - 1)
Proposed Answer: fun t : ℝ => (12/35) * t + 5/7
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

The ground truth answer is: (1/5 + 1/7)*(t - 1)
The proposed answer is: (12/35)*t + 5/7

Let's expand the ground truth answer:
(1/5 + 1/7)*(t - 1) = (7/35 + 5/35)*(t - 1) = (12/35)*(t - 1) = (12/35)t - 12/35

Now compare with proposed answer:
(12/35)t + 5/7 = (12/35)t + 25/35

The constant terms are different (-12/35 vs +25/35), so the functions are not equivalent.
