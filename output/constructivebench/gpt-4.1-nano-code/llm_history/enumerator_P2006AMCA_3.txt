This problem appears to involve a relationship between Alice's age and Mary's age with a ratio of 3/5. The function P2006AMCA_3_answer should generate possible values for Mary's age given Alice's age, based on the ratio. Since Alice's age is fixed at 30, and the ratio (Mary's age / Alice's age) must be 3/5, the most direct exact value for Mary is (3/5) * 30 = 18.

To explore possible answers, we could consider ratios close to 3/5 as approximations and generate candidate ages. However, the likely intended answer is directly 18 based on the ratio, but we can verify nearby integer multiples to see if other candidate ages could satisfy approximate constraints.

Here's a program that enumerates plausible ages for Mary around this ratio and checks the ratio condition:

```python
# Generate candidate ages for Mary based on Alice's age (30) and approximate ratios near 3/5
alice_age = 30
ratio_num = 3
ratio_den = 5

# Generate a range around the exact match
candidates = []

for k in range(1, 50):  # arbitrary upper bound for exploration
    mary_age_exact = (ratio_num * alice_age) / ratio_den
    candidate_age = round(mary_age_exact * k / 1)  # scale to explore nearby integers
    # Check ratio closeness
    ratio = candidate_age / alice_age
    if abs(ratio - (ratio_num / ratio_den)) < 0.1:
        print(candidate_age)
```
