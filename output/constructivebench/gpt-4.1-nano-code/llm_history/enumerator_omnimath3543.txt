The problem involves summing a geometric series: \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{4} + \frac{4}{8} + \frac{8}{16} \).
Notice the pattern: numerator doubles each time, and denominator doubles as well.

The terms are:
- First term: \( \frac{1}{2} \)
- Second term: \( \frac{2}{4} = \frac{2}{2^2} \)
- Third term: \( \frac{4}{8} = \frac{4}{2^3} \)
- Fourth term: \( \frac{8}{16} = \frac{8}{2^4} \)

Expressed generally: \( \frac{2^{k-1}}{2^{k}} = \frac{1}{2} \) for each term, but this is true only if we examine the pattern carefully: numerator doubles and denominator doubles, so the \(k\)-th term is \( \frac{2^{k-1}}{2^{k}} = \frac{1}{2} \) for each \(k\).

However, the sum can be written as:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^n \frac{2^{k-1}}{2^{k}} = \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{2} = n \times \frac{1}{2}
\]

In this case, \(n=4\), so the sum should be \( 4 \times \frac{1}{2} = 2 \).

Let's write a program to verify this and output the sum for these terms directly.

```python
# Summation of the sequence: (1/2) + (2/4) + (4/8) + (8/16)

sum_result = 0
for k in range(1, 5):  # k from 1 to 4
    numerator = 2 ** (k - 1)
    denominator = 2 ** k
    term = numerator / denominator
    print(f"Term {k}: {term}")
    sum_result += term

print("Sum of the series:", sum_result)
```

This code explicitly computes and outputs each term and their sum, helping to conjecture that the total sum is 2.
