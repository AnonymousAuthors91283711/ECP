The problem appears to involve a recurrence relation for the sequence \(a_n\), defined by \(a_{n+1} = 2 \left( a_n + \frac{1}{a_n} \right) - 3\), with initial value \(a_1 = a\). It asks to characterize the set of initial values \(a\) for which \(a_n\) is strictly increasing (\(a_{n+1} > a_n\) for all \(n\)). 

To understand this, we can simulate the recurrence for small \(a\) values and check whether the sequence is increasing. The key is to find the set of initial \(a\) that lead to a monotonically increasing sequence.

Since the relation involves quadratic forms, possible fixed points can be found by solving:

\[ a = 2\left(a + \frac{1}{a}\right) - 3 \]
which simplifies to the quadratic:

\[ a = 2a + \frac{2}{a} - 3 \]

leading to:

\[ 0 = a + \frac{2}{a} - 3 \]
or

\[ a^2 - 3a + 2 = 0 \]

=> roots: \(a = 1\), \(a=2\).

We can test how the sequence behaves near these fixed points by enumerating initial \(a\), say from 0.1 to 3.0 in small steps, and simulate the first few terms to observe whether the sequence is increasing.

Below is the Python code to do this analysis efficiently, streaming the results:

```python
# Enumerate initial values of 'a' to analyze the monotonicity of the sequence
import math

def sequence_a(a, n_terms=10):
    seq = [a]
    for _ in range(n_terms - 1):
        a_curr = seq[-1]
        # To avoid division by zero, skip or handle tiny values
        if abs(a_curr) < 1e-8:
            return seq
        next_a = 2 * (a_curr + 1 / a_curr) - 3
        seq.append(next_a)
    return seq

# Check for monotonicity
for a in [0.1 + 0.05 * i for i in range(60)]:  # from 0.1 to 3.05
    seq = sequence_a(a, 15)
    # Check if strictly increasing throughout
    increasing = all(seq[i+1] > seq[i] for i in range(len(seq)-1))
    if increasing:
        print(f"Initial a={a:.2f} yields an increasing sequence: {seq}")
```
