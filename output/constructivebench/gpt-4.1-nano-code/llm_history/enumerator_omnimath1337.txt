[write_program]
The problem defines a sequence \(S(k)\) with initial condition \(S(0)=0\), and recursive relation involving the sum over \(a(i)\). The sequence \(a(i)\) depends on whether \(S(i-1)<i\). The goal is to find the greatest \(k\leq 2010\) such that \(S(k)=0\).

To explore possible answers:
- We'll simulate the sequence with a small implementation.
- Determine the maximum \(k\) up to 2010 where \(S(k)=0\).

Due to the problem's nature, a direct simulation is effective for small parameters, and the logic hinges on the recursive conditional definition of \(a(i)\).

```python
def simulate_sequence(up_to):
    S = {0: 0}
    # Track maximum k where S(k)=0
    max_zero_k = 0
    
    for i in range(1, up_to + 1):
        prev_S = S[i - 1]
        a_i = 1 if prev_S < i else -1
        S[i] = S[i - 1] + a_i
        if S[i] == 0:
            max_zero_k = i
    return max_zero_k, S

# Enumerate up to 2010
max_k, sequence = simulate_sequence(2010)
print("Maximum k â‰¤ 2010 with S(k)=0:", max_k)
# To assist in conjecture, output some values
for k in range(max_k - 5, max_k + 1):
    if k >= 0:
        print(f"S({k}) = {sequence[k]}")

# Since the sequence alternates based on whether previous sum is less than i,
# and starts at 0, the pattern repeats, likely at regular intervals.
# Conjecture: the maximum k where S(k)=0 is near 2000, possibly 2000 itself.
