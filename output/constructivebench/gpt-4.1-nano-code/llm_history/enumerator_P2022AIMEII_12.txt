The problem involves finding the minimum value of \(a + b\), given the constraints:

- \(a > 4\), \(b > 1\)
- \(x + 4y = a\)
- \(5x + y = b\)
- \(x^2 + y^2 \leq 1\)

From the linear equations, we find \(a\) and \(b\) in terms of \(x\) and \(y\):

\[
a = x + 4y,\quad b = 5x + y
\]

We want to minimize \(a + b = (x + 4y) + (5x + y) = 6x + 5y\)

Given the constraints:

- \(a = x + 4y > 4 \Rightarrow x + 4y > 4\)
- \(b = 5x + y > 1 \Rightarrow 5x + y > 1\)
- \(x^2 + y^2 \leq 1\)

Focus on minimizing \(6x + 5y\) where \((x, y)\) lies within the unit disk (\(x^2 + y^2 \leq 1\)) and the linear inequalities are satisfied.

We can check the boundary \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\):

- Max/min of linear functions over a circle occurs at the boundary in the direction of the gradient.

Since the problem asks for the least \(a + b\), i.e., the minimum of \(6x + 5y\) over the feasible region, we perform an enumeration of candidate points along the unit circle that satisfy the constraints:

```python
import math

# Constraints:
# x^2 + y^2 = 1 (boundary)
# x + 4y > 4
# 5x + y > 1

def candidate_points():
    for angle_deg in range(0, 361, 1):  # sampling angles for better resolution
        angle_rad = math.radians(angle_deg)
        x = math.cos(angle_rad)
        y = math.sin(angle_rad)
        # Check constraints
        if (x + 4*y > 4) and (5*x + y > 1):
            answer = 6*x + 5*y
            print(f"Candidate at angle {angle_deg}Â°: x={x:.4f}, y={y:.4f}, a+x+4y={x+4*y:.4f}, 5x+y={5*x + y:.4f}, sum={answer:.4f}")
            yield answer
        # Also consider points just inside the circle to ensure coverage
        # but given constraints, boundary suffices for extrema

min_answer = None
for val in candidate_points():
    if (min_answer is None) or (val < min_answer):
        min_answer = val
        print(f"New minimum found: {min_answer:.4f}")

if min_answer is not None:
    print(f"Approximate minimal a + b: {min_answer:.4f}")
```

This code samples points around the circle, checks the inequalities, reports candidate solutions, and tracks the minimal \(a + b\). Since the problem is constrained and involves continuous variables, this approximate enumeration helps in conjecturing the minimal value.
