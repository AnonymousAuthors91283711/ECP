Given the constraints, the longest path starting at (0,0) with steps differing by at most 1 in each coordinate, and changing the second coordinate each step, the maximum length corresponds to a path covering all points in a 7×7 grid, moving stepwise without repetition. The longest such path spans all grid points exactly once, totaling 49 nodes. 

<<<49>>>
