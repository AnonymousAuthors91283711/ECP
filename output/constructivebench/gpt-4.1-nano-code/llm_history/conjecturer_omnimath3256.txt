The equations suggest a symmetry involving squares and quartics with positive and negative components. Focusing on the structure, the solutions satisfy the system only when an expression involving \(x^2\) and \(y^2\) holds, eliminating denominators by considering \(x \neq 0\), \(y \neq 0\).

A plausible closed-form is the set of points where \(x^2 = y^2\), capturing symmetry between x and y, and balancing the equations.
