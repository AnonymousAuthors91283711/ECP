theorem olympiadbench2370 :
  {x : ℝ | (x + 8) ^ 4 = (2 * x + 16) ^ 2} = olympiadbench2370_answer :=
sorry
. Enumerated answers: -10
-8
-6. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
The solutions satisfy (x + 8)^4 = (2x + 16)^2, which simplifies to x = -10, -8, -6. These are the roots of the equation. The set of solutions is finite and explicitly given by these roots.
