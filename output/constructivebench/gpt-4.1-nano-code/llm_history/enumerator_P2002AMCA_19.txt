The problem describes a piecewise function \(f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) with specific values on four intervals, and asks for the number of real \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = 6\). The function's behavior is:

- \(f(x) = 6\) for \(x < a\) and \(x > d\)
- \(f(x) = 2\) for \(a \leq x \leq b\) and \(c \leq x \leq d\)
- \(f(x) = 4\) for \(b < x < c\)

The key is to find the number of solutions to \(f(f(x)) = 6\), which involves analyzing the composition \(f(f(x))\).

- For \(f(f(x)) = 6\), \(f(x)\) must be in the preimage of 6, i.e., \(f(x) \in (-\infty, a) \cup (d, \infty)\).
- From the piecewise description, \(f(x)\in \{2,4,6\}\):

  - \(f(x) = 6\) when \(x < a\) or \(x > d\),
  - \(f(x) = 2\) when \(x \in [a, b]\) or \([c, d]\),
  - \(f(x) = 4\) when \(x \in (b, c)\).

To find solutions of \(f(f(x))=6\), we consider cases based on the values of \(f(x)\):

1. \(f(x) = 6\) (then \(f(6)=? \))
2. \(f(x) = 2\) (then check if \(f(2)=6\))
3. \(f(x) = 4\) (then check if \(f(4)=6\))

Since \(f\) takes only these discrete values in subintervals, the nested evaluations are:

- \(f(2)\): in the interval where \(f\) is 2: \(a \leq x \leq b\) or \(c \leq x \leq d\),
- \(f(4)\): in \((b, c)\),
- \(f(6)\): for \(x < a\) or \(x > d\), \(f(x)=6\).

We examine when \(f(f(x))=6\):

- \(f(x) = 6\) \(\Rightarrow\) \(x< a\) or \(x >d\),
- \(f(x) = 2\) \(\Rightarrow\) \(x \in [a, b]\) or \([c, d]\),
- \(f(x) = 4\) \(\Rightarrow\) \(x \in (b, c)\).

Compute:

- For \(f(f(x))=6\):

  - When \(f(x)=6\), then \(f(6)\) is needed. But \(f(6)\) depends on where 6 maps under \(f\), i.e., outside the intervals, so in these regions \(f(6)\) would be 6 again (since \(f(x)=6\) for \(x< a\) or \(x>d\)). Thus **any \(x\) with \(f(x)=6\) satisfies \(f(f(x))=6\)**. So solutions for \(x< a\) or \(x>d\).

  - When \(f(x)=2\), then \(f(2)\):
    - \(f(2) = 2\) if \(2\) is in \([a, b]\) or \([c, d]\),
    - \(f(2) = 4\) if \(2 \in (b, c)\),
    - \(f(2) = 6\) if \(2\) is outside the main intervals, but here \(2\) is the value, so depending on parameter choices, for \(f(2)=6\), need \(2< a\) or \(2> d\). Since \(f(2)=2\) in the main intervals, \(f(2)=6\) only if 2 is outside the active interval regions, i.e., if \(a>2\) or \(d<2\).

  - When \(f(x)=4\), \(f(4)\):
    - \(f(4)=2\) (since 4 in \([a, b]\) or \([c, d]\)) only if \(a \le 4 \le b\) or \(c \le 4 \le d\),
    - Alternatively, \(f(4)=6\) if 4 outside the intervals, which occurs if \(4 < a\) or \(4 > d\), unlikely as 4 is parameter-dependent.

Putting all together, under small sample values:

To keep things simple, set parameters such that \(a < b < c < d\), with some bounds including 2 and 4.

Let's pick sample parameters:

- \(a=1, b=2.5, c=3.5, d=5\)

For these, the mapping:

- \(f(x) = 6\) for \(x<1\) or \(x>5\)
- \(f(x) = 2\) for \(1 \leq x \leq 2.5\)
- \(f(x) = 4\) for \(2.5 < x < 3.5\)
- \(f(x) = 2\) for \(3.5 \leq x \leq 5\)

Now, solutions to \(f(f(x))=6\) are:

- When \(f(x)=6\), then \(x<1\) or \(x>5\)
- When \(f(x)=2\), then \(f(2)=? \):

  - For \(x \in [1,2.5]\), \(f(x)=2\). Need \(f(2)\):
    - \(2 \in [1,2.5]\), so \(f(2)=2\),
    - \(f(2)=2\), then \(f(2)=? \), if \(f(2)=2\), \(f(2)\neq 6\),
    - So \(f(2)\neq 6\), so \(f(2)=2\), thus \(f(f(x))=f(2)=2\neq 6\),
    - For solutions, need \(f(2)=6\). Since it isn't, then no solutions when \(f(x)=2\).

- When \(f(x)=4\), occurs for \(2.5 < x < 3.5\),
  - \(f(4)\): check where 4 maps,
  - \(4 \in [a,b]\) or \([c,d]\)? \(a=1, b=2.5, c=3.5, d=5\)
  - \(4 \in [c,d]\) (since \(3.5 \leq 4 \leq 5\)), so \(f(4)=2\),
  - \(f(4)=2\neq 6\),

Thus, for this parameter choice:

- \(f(x)=6\) when \(x<1\) or \(x>5\) gives solutions \(x<1\) and \(x>5\),
- For \(x\) with \(f(x)=2\), \(f(2)=2\), and \(f(4)=2\) only. Since \(f(2)\neq 6\), no solutions here, as \(f(2)=2\neq 6\).
- For \(f(x)=4\) in \((2.5,3.5)\), \(f(4)=2\neq 6\).

Therefore, the solutions to \(f(f(x))=6\):

- \(x< 1\),
- \(x > 5\).

Number of solutions:

- Infinite on both sides (think of \(x<1\) and \(x>5\)).

But the problem asks for the cardinality of the set \(\{x \mid f(f(x))=6 \}\), which in this case is unbounded but countably infinite, which can't be listed straightforwardly.

Assuming the problem expects a finite count (since it's a high school problem), the critical insight is that solutions are precisely in the regions where \(f(x)=6\), that is, for \(x< a=1\), \(x> d=5\).

The number of solutions:

- For \(x<1\), infinite solutions (all real numbers less than 1); similarly for \(x>5\), infinite solutions.

Counting solutions in the discrete sense (e.g., integer solutions):

- \(x \in (-\infty,1)\): infinitely many
- \(x \in (5,\infty)\): infinitely many.

Since the question is about the cardinality, the total is infinite.

But, since the code must be able to enumerate, sample small parameters, and approximate the finite case, we can simulate a finite set of discretized points and count. Let's choose integer points around the thresholds.

Below is a code that, with small sample parameters, enumerates and counts solutions:

- picks parameters \(a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4\),
- evaluates \(f\) at some discrete points (\(x\in \{-10, ..., 10\}\)),
- counts how many satisfy \(f(f(x))=6\),
- streams each answer and concludes.

```python
# Enumerate sample points to approximate the number of solutions
# for \(f(f(x))=6\) with simplified piecewise parameters.
# These parameters are chosen for clarity.
params = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4}

a = params['a']
b = params['b']
c = params['c']
d = params['d']

def f(x):
    if x < a:
        return 6
    elif a <= x <= b:
        return 2
    elif b < x < c:
        return 4
    elif c <= x <= d:
        return 2
    else:
        return 6

solutions = []
# Sample points covering key regions
for x in range(-10, 11):
    fx = f(x)
    ffx = f(fx)
    if ffx == 6:
        print(f"x={x}")
        solutions.append(x)

# Since solutions are at x< a or x> d, approximate total solutions
# For this discrete sampling, solutions are at x<1 (x=-10..0) and x>4 (x=5..10)
# Total solutions: so total approximate is the count
```

This code enumerates solutions at discrete points, demonstrating solutions occur for \(x<1\) and \(x>4\). The exact count over the infinite reals is infinite, but in this context, the program streams each discrete solution encountered.

---

Final note: Since the problem is complex, the code approximates the answer based on discrete sampling, and highlights the infinite nature of solutions. The key insight is that for large classes of functions fitting the description, solutions are primarily in the regions \(x< a\) and \(x > d\).

Full code below:

```python
# Sample parameters
params = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4}

a = params['a']
b = params['b']
c = params['c']
d = params['d']

def f(x):
    if x < a:
        return 6
    elif a <= x <= b:
        return 2
    elif b < x < c:
        return 4
    elif c <= x <= d:
        return 2
    else:
        return 6

# Enumerate over integer points to approximate solutions
for x in range(-10, 11):
    fx = f(x)
    ffx = f(fx)
    if ffx == 6:
        print(f"x={x}")
```
