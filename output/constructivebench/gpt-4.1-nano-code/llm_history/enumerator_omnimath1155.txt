This problem appears to be about finding all natural numbers `n` with certain divisibility properties related to the function `f(x) = x^2 + x + 1`. The task is to identify such `n` where, for every divisor `k` of `n` with `k > 0`, `f(k)` divides `f(n)`.

Given the structure, the key is to generate candidate `n`, verify the divisibility condition, and eventually determine the set of all such `n`. Since the problem might be about minimal such `n` or all such numbers, we will proceed by enumerating candidate `n` values, checking the condition, and printing those satisfying it.

Based on this, we implement a systematic enumeration with small `n` (e.g., from 1 upwards), checking the divisor condition, and outputting each `n` that satisfies the property.

```python
# Enumerate natural numbers n from 1 to a reasonable threshold
# For each n, check all divisors k, and verify if f(k) divides f(n)
# If the condition holds for all divisors, print n as a candidate answer

def f(x):
    return x * x + x + 1

# Set a reasonable upper limit for enumeration
max_n = 100  # Adjust as needed for completeness

for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
    valid = True
    for k in range(1, n + 1):
        if n % k == 0:
            # For each divisor k, check whether f(k) divides f(n)
            if f(k) == 0:
                continue  # avoid division by zero
            if f(n) % f(k) != 0:
                valid = False
                break
    if valid:
        print(n)
```
