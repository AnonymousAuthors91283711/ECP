open Int

abbrev omnimath4405_answer : Prop := sorry
theorem omnimath4405 : 
    (∃ m n : ℤ, 5 * m^2 - 6 * m * n + 7 * n^2 = 1985) ↔ omnimath4405_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: No solutions found within bounds.. Expected Answer Type: Prop
<<<False>>>

Because the enumeration indicates no solutions exist, I conclude the statement is equivalent to False.
