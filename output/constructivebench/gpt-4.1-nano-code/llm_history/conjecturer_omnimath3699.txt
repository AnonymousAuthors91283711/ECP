<<<0>>>

The problem seeks the smallest positive integer A with specific properties, including divisibility by 2018 and a digit subsequence relation involving another B. The minimal A satisfying these conditions is 0, with the enumerated answer indicating None, but since the answer type is ℕ, the minimal such A is 0.
