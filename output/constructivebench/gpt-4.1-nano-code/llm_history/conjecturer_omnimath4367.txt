. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → Prop
The pattern suggests that residues can be represented as sums of initial squares precisely when N is a perfect square or divides a perfect square with certain properties. Notably, all N that are perfect squares satisfy the condition, while some others do not. The pattern appears to match N being a perfect square or N being 6, which relates to certain quadratic residues. But cumulative evidence indicates the valid N are precisely those where N is a perfect square or N divides some power of 2. Final conjecture simplifies to N is a perfect square or N equals 6.
