The problem involves analyzing the function \(f(x) = 2x^3 - 2x\) and a set involving parameters \(a, b, c, d\) with certain conditions, including equal sums of \(f\)-values and a product relation. To explore this, I'll generate candidate solutions numerically by choosing small sample values for \(a, b, c, d\) to find potential candidates for the set in question.

Since the conditions require \(a > 0\), and the set involves distinct elements with certain symmetric properties, I'll examine sample quadruples, check the conditions, especially the sum condition \(f b + f a = f c + f d\) and the product \(a b = c d\). I will then collect the possible values of \(a\) satisfying these conditions.

The approach:
- Fix small positive \(a\) values (like 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, etc.)
- For each, attempt to find \(b, c, d\) that satisfy the sum and product conditions
- When found, record \(a\)

This will help identify candidate values to estimate the set described in \(\text{omnimath3346_answer}\).

```python
import itertools

def f(x):
    return 2 * x**3 - 2 * x

# Sample small positive values for a
a_values = [0.1 * i for i in range(1, 11)]
candidates = set()

# For efficiency, limit b, c, d to a small range
search_range = [0.1 * i for i in range(1, 21)]

# Attempt to find quadruples satisfying given conditions
for a in a_values:
    for b in search_range:
        # Compute f(a) + f(b)
        sum_ab = f(a) + f(b)
        for c in search_range:
            # Compute f(c) + f(d)
            # For candidate d, check if sum matches and product condition holds
            for d in search_range:
                if abs(f(c) + f(d) - sum_ab) < 1e-5:
                    if abs(a * b - c * d) < 1e-5:
                        # Found a candidate quadruple
                        candidates.add(a)
                        print(f"Found candidate a: {a}")

# Output the candidate set
print("Possible candidate a values:", sorted(candidates))
```
