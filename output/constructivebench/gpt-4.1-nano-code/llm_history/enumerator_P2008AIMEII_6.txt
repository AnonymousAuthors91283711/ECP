This problem defines two sequences \(a(n)\) and \(b(n)\) with initial values and recurrence relations. The goal is to find the ratio \(b(32)/a(32)\). The sequences are recursively defined and involve linear combinations, which suggests that they can be expressed in terms of eigenvalues or solved through matrix methods.

Since the problem size is manageable with small \(n\), and the relation is linear, we can directly simulate the sequences up to \(n=32\). The sequences are defined by:

\[
\begin{cases}
a(n) = a(n-1) + 2b(n-1),\\
b(n) = -a(n-1) + 4b(n-1),
\end{cases}
\]

with initial conditions \(a(1)=1\), \(b(1)=1\).

Before coding, note the matrix form:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
a(n) \\ b(n)
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 \\
-1 & 4
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
a(n-1) \\ b(n-1)
\end{bmatrix}
\]

We can iteratively compute \(a(n), b(n)\) up to 32, then output the ratio.

Since the sequences are linear, just iterate in Python and print each ratio as we go, focusing on the final value.

```python
# Initialize initial values
a, b = 1, 1

# Recursive matrix for the sequences
matrix = [[1, 2],
          [-1, 4]]

# Iterate up to n=32
for n in range(2, 33):
    a_next = matrix[0][0]*a + matrix[0][1]*b
    b_next = matrix[1][0]*a + matrix[1][1]*b
    a, b = a_next, b_next
# Output the ratio b/ a at n=32
print(b / a)
```
