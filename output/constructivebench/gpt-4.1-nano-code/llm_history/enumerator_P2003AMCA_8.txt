This problem involves counting divisors of 60 and then finding the ratio of favorable divisors (less than 7) to all divisors, i.e., the probability that a randomly chosen divisor of 60 is less than 7.

Step 1: Enumerate all positive divisors of 60.
Step 2: Count how many are less than 7.
Step 3: Compute the ratio as a rational number.

Since 60 is small, its divisors are manageable to list explicitly.

```python
# Enumerate all positive divisors of 60
divisors = []
for n in range(1, 61):
    if 60 % n == 0:
        divisors.append(n)

# Count total divisors
total_divisors = len(divisors)

# Count divisors less than 7
favorable_divisors = [n for n in divisors if n < 7]
count_favorable = len(favorable_divisors)

# Compute ratio as a fraction
from fractions import Fraction
ratio = Fraction(count_favorable, total_divisors)

# Print all divisors
print("Divisors of 60:", divisors)
# Print counts
print("Total divisors:", total_divisors)
print("Divisors less than 7:", favorable_divisors)
print("Number of favorable divisors:", count_favorable)
# Print ratio as a fraction
print("Probability:", ratio)
```
