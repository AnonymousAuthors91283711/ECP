The problem appears to revolve around calculating the measure of a set of pairs of points within a pentomino-shaped region where all convex combinations of those pairs also lie within the pentomino. This involves integrating or estimating measures over a subset of ℝ² based on convexity properties. Since the actual measure calculation is complex, and the problem hints at enumeration and approximation, I'll focus on exploring the measure of the set of point pairs satisfying the convexity constraint, comparing it to the total measure of all pairs in the shape. 

For simplicity, I will:
- sample points within the shape
- check the convexity condition for pairs
- estimate the measure of 'good' pairs
- output the ratio as an approximation

Below is a Python code that performs this sampling, estimates the ratio, and streams results, matching the problem constraints.

```python
import numpy as np

# Define the pentomino regions as pixel masks
# For simplicity, approximate the regions in a small grid
grid_size = 100
x = np.linspace(-1, 3, grid_size)
y = np.linspace(0, 3, grid_size)
X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)

# Define characteristic functions for each rectangle
region1 = (0 <= X) & (X <= 1) & (1 <= Y) & (Y <= 2)
region2 = (1 <= X) & (X <= 2) & (0 <= Y) & (Y <= 3)
region3 = (2 <= X) & (X <= 3) & (1 <= Y) & (Y <= 2)
region4 = (-1 <= X) & (X <= 0) & (1 <= Y) & (Y <= 2)

# Combine regions to form the pentomino shape
X_pentomino_mask = region1 | region2 | region3 | region4

# Get sample points inside the shape
points = np.column_stack(np.where(X_pentomino_mask))
# Map pixel indices to coordinates
points_coords = np.column_stack((x[points[:,1]], y[points[:,0]]))

# Sample pairs for estimation
num_samples = 5000
indices = np.random.choice(len(points_coords), size=(num_samples, 2), replace=True)

# Initialize counter for 'good' pairs
good_count = 0

for idx1, idx2 in indices:
    p1 = points_coords[idx1]
    p2 = points_coords[idx2]
    # Check convex combination condition for t in [0,1]
    # Sample t at intervals
    domain_checks = True
    for t in np.linspace(0, 1, 10):
        mid = t * p1 + (1 - t) * p2
        # Verify if mid is inside shape
        xi, yi = mid
        x_idx = int(np.round((xi + 1) / 4 * (grid_size - 1)))
        y_idx = int(np.round((yi) / 3 * (grid_size - 1)))
        if x_idx < 0 or x_idx >= grid_size or y_idx < 0 or y_idx >= grid_size:
            domain_checks = False
            break
        if not X_pentomino_mask[y_idx, x_idx]:
            domain_checks = False
            break
    if domain_checks:
        good_count += 1
    # Stream result occasionally
    if (good_count + 1) % 1000 == 0:
        ratio = good_count / (len(indices))
        print(f"Current ratio of 'good' pairs: {ratio}")

# Estimate ratio
estimated_ratio = good_count / num_samples
print("Estimated ratio:", estimated_ratio)
```

This code:
- approximates the pentomino as pixel masks,
- samples pairs within the shape,
- checks convexity condition via sampling midpoints,
- streams partial ratio estimates,
- provides an approximate ratio of the 'good' pairs.

Note: The actual mathematical measure calculation involves integrals, but this sampling approach gives an enumeration-like heuristic.
