abbrev omnimath3464_answer : ℤ → ℤ := sorry
theorem omnimath3464 (n : ℤ) : Odd (omnimath3464_answer n) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: No solutions found in the range.. Expected Answer Type: ℤ → ℤ
<<<fun n : ℤ => 0>>>
The pattern suggests the answer is always zero to satisfy Odd(omnimath3464_answer n) since "No solutions" likely means the only value is 0, which is always odd.
