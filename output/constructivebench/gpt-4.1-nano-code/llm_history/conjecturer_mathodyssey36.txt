The sum of squares representation relates to the degree of the polynomial and the number of terms n. Since  x^2 + x + 4 cannot be represented with fewer than 3 linear squares, the minimal n for representation is n=3. This pattern suggests the answer always matches the degree + 1, so the answer is 3.
