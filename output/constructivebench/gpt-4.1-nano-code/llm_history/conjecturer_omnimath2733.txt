The given condition is cos 60° = cos 45° * cos θ, with cos 60°= 1/2 and cos 45°= √2/2. Solving for cos θ gives cos θ = (1/2)/(√2/2) = 1/√2 = √2/2, which corresponds to θ = 45°. Since θ is within [0, 90°], θ = 45°. Therefore, the answer in radians is π/4.

. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The error indicates that the identifier 'π' is unknown in Lean's standard library. In mathlib, π is typically defined as `Real.pi`. To fix this, I should replace 'π' with 'Real.pi'. Since the value π/4 is a rational multiple of π, we also need to declare the definition as noncomputable because 'Real.pi' is a noncomputable constant. 

Furthermore, according to the problem, the value of θ satisfying the cosine relationship is 45 degrees, which corresponds to π/4 radians. The answer should be in the form of 'Real.pi / 4'. To make the code compile, I will declare the abbreviation as noncomputable and use `Real.pi`. Also, since the problem expects the answer to be a real number, defining it as `Real.pi / 4` seems appropriate.

Here's my fix:

The error arises because the definition is introduced with `abbrev`, which expects a simple expression, but the attempt to define a noncomputable function is invalid syntax there. Also, the naming conflict shows that `omnimath2733_answer` was previously declared as an `abbrev`. To fix this, I should directly define `omnimath2733_answer` as a noncomputable constant of type ℝ, using `noncomputable def` instead of `abbrev`. The final value, based on the enumerated answer 45 degrees or π/4 radians, is `Real.pi / 4`. This is a closed-form expression in Lean and matches the pattern in the enumerated solutions.

<<<noncomputable def omnimath2733_answer : ℝ := Real.pi / 4>>>

The reasoning: The problem involves a cosine relation `cos 60 = cos 45 * cos θ`. Using known angles, `cos 60` is `1/2`, and `cos 45` is `√2/2`. The equation becomes:

`1/2 = (√2 / 2) * cos θ` ∴ `cos θ = (1/2) / (√2 / 2)` = `1/√2` = `√2/2`. 

Thus, `θ = π/4` radians, matching the enumerated answer. The choice of `Real.pi / 4` as the fixed answer leverages this exact value.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
