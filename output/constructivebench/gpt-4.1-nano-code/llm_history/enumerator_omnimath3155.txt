This problem involves analyzing a characteristic of certain subsets of the integers from 1 to n, related to a recurrence involving set cardinalities. Specifically, the statement encodes a second-order difference condition on the sequence A(n), where A(n) measures the size of a certain "mediocre" subset S within [1, n].

The recurrence:
A(n+2) - 2*A(n+1) + A(n) = 1

resembles a quadratic form, suggesting a sequence quadratic in n. To make conjectures, we can test small values of n, assuming `A(n)` follows a pattern, and investigate values satisfying the recurrence.

Because the problem involves sets and these properties, and we only need the integer sequence satisfying the recurrence, a direct approach is to generate candidate sequences and check which satisfy the recurrence, starting from small n.

Below, the core idea is to:
- Pick small sample values of A(n), for initial small n.
- Generate sequences where possible.
- Check the recurrence for subsequent values.
- Print solutions whenever they meet the recurrence.

This allows us to see potential explicit forms or specific sequence values and generate conjectures for the general formula.

```python
# Enumerate possible small initial values for A(n) to find solutions satisfying the recurrence
# The recurrence is A(n+2) - 2*A(n+1) + A(n) = 1
# Our plan: pick initial A(1), A(2), then generate subsequent A(n) and check the recurrence

# We limit A(1), A(2) to small integer ranges for efficiency
for A1 in range(0, 5):
    for A2 in range(0, 5):
        sequence = [A1, A2]
        # Generate the sequence up to n=15 for testing
        for n in range(1, 14):
            next_A = 2 * sequence[-1] - sequence[-2] + 1
            sequence.append(next_A)
        # Check if the recurrence holds for all n
        # The recurrence test: A(n+2) - 2*A(n+1) + A(n) == 1 for all n
        if all(sequence[i+2] - 2*sequence[i+1] + sequence[i] == 1 for i in range(len(sequence)-2)):
            # Found a candidate sequence, print it
            print(f"Initial A(1)={A1}, A(2)={A2} => sequence: {sequence}")
```
