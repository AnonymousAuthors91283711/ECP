The problem appears to involve a functional equation with positivity conditions, aiming to identify the function \(f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) satisfying a particular relation. To assist in conjecturing the solution, I will enumerate simple candidate functions based on common functional equation solutionsâ€”particularly focusing on specific forms such as affine functions, constants, or power functions. The approach is to:
- fix small values of \(x,y\),
- verify the given functional relation,
- track solutions satisfying the conditions.

Given the constraints, the simplest starting point is to test constant functions \(f(x) = c\), as well as linear functions \(f(x) = a x + b\).

Since the problem involves \(x > 0\), I will evaluate these candidates over small positive samples and check if they satisfy the relation.

Here's the Python program:

```python
# Enumiate candidate functions to conjecture solutions

# Candidate functions:
# 1. Constant function: f(x) = c
# 2. Linear function: f(x) = a*x + b

import math

# List to hold candidate solutions
candidates = []

# Test constant functions f(x) = c for c in positive range
for c in [0.5, 1, 2]:
    def f_const(x, c=c):
        return c
    
    # Test the relation for small positive x,y
    test_passed = True
    for x in [0.1, 1, 10]:
        for y in [0.1, 1, 10]:
            if x <= 0 or y <= 0:
                continue
            left = f_const(x * y + f_const(x))
            right = x * f_const(y) + 2
            if abs(left - right) > 1e-6:
                test_passed = False
                break
        if not test_passed:
            break
    if test_passed:
        print(f"Constant function candidate: f(x) = {c}")
        candidates.append(('constant', c))

# Test linear functions f(x)=a*x + b
for a in [-1, 0, 1]:
    for b in [-1, 0, 1]:
        def f_linear(x, a=a, b=b):
            return a*x + b
        
        test_passed = True
        for x in [0.1, 1, 10]:
            for y in [0.1, 1, 10]:
                if x <=0 or y <=0:
                    continue
                fx = f_linear(x)
                fy = f_linear(y)
                val = x*y + fx
                left = f_linear(val)
                right = x*fy + 2
                if abs(left - right) > 1e-6:
                    test_passed = False
                    break
            if not test_passed:
                break
        if test_passed:
            print(f"Linear function candidate: f(x) = {a}*x + {b}")
            candidates.append(('linear', a, b))
```

This program tests simple candidate functions over small positive values x, y and prints those satisfying the functional relation within a tight tolerance. It provides immediate streaming outputs suitable for conjecturing potential solutions.
