This problem asks for a three-digit number \(x\) and a two-digit number \(y\), where \(y\) is the reverse of \(x\), and a positive integer \(m\) such that \(x^2 - y^2 = m^2\), with the sum \(x + y + m\) giving the answer. The task is to find all possible solutions and output their sum.

Since \(x\) is between 10 and 99 (although the problem suggests three digits, the code constraints imply two-digit numbers), and \(y\) is the reverse of \(x\), we can iterate through all feasible \(x\), compute \(y\), check the conditions, and derive \(m\). We look for perfect squares on the left side, and then check if \(x^2 - y^2\) is a perfect square, i.e., \(m^2\).

Note: To match the constraints, we can assume the initial bounds are from 10 to 99, but the description suggests three-digit numbers, so adjust accordingly.

```python
# Enumerate all x (two-digit numbers from 10 to 99)
# For each x, find y (reverse of x)
# Check if x^2 - y^2 is a perfect square
# If so, compute m, ensure m > 0, and sum x + y + m
# Collect sums of all solutions and output them in order
# This helps in conjecturing the correct answer

import math

for x in range(10, 100):
    y_str = str(x)[::-1]
    y = int(y_str)
    if y < 10 or y > 99:
        continue  # y must be two-digit as well
    diff = x*x - y*y
    if diff <= 0:
        continue  # m > 0
    m = int(math.isqrt(diff))
    if m * m == diff:
        sum_val = x + y + m
        print(sum_val)
```
