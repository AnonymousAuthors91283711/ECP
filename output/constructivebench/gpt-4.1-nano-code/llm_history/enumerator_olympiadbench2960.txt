The problem appears to involve finding a digit `d` (less than 10) such that for all natural numbers `n` between 100 and 400 inclusive, whenever `n` is a perfect square, the digit `d` is not in the decimal representation of `n`. We want to identify all such digits `d` satisfying this condition, and then the theorem asserts this set is a singleton `{d}` for some specific `d`.

Since the condition is about digits not appearing in any perfect squares between 100 and 400, a natural approach is:

- For each digit `d` from 0 to 9:
  - Check all perfect squares between 100 and 400.
  - If `d` appears in any such square, discard `d`.
- The remaining digits are those that do not appear in any perfect square in that range.

This enumeration will efficiently identify the unique digit(s) satisfying the condition, which can be tested directly by the code.

```python
# Program to find the digit d < 10 such that for all perfect squares n between 100 and 400,
# d does not appear in the decimal representation of n.
# The code tests all digits from 0 to 9 and all perfect squares in the range.

def find_digits_without_in_squares():
    result_digits = []
    for d in range(10):
        digit_char = str(d)
        # Check all n in [100, 400] that are perfect squares
        found_in_square = False
        for n in range(10, 21):  # since 10^2=100, 20^2=400
            n_squared = n * n
            if 100 <= n_squared <= 400:
                if digit_char in str(n_squared):
                    found_in_square = True
                    break
        if not found_in_square:
            print(d)
            result_digits.append(d)
    # Return the set of digits satisfying the condition
    return result_digits

# Run the enumeration
find_digits_without_in_squares()
```
