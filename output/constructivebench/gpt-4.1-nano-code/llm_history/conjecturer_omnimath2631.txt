The given ratio simplifies to a fixed constant since the equality implies (x + 6y - 3z) / (-3x + 4w) = 2/3, hence the ratio x/w can be expressed in terms of this constant. 

Conjecture: x/w equals 2/3, which is consistent with the provided equalities and the structure of the ratios.

The problem provides a ratio involving variables \(x, y, z, w\), with a given condition on their relation. The key points are that the ratio \(\frac{x + 6 y - 3 z}{-3 x + 4 w} = \frac{2}{3}\), and this ratio is equal to \(\frac{-2 y + z}{x - w}\). The goal is to find an explicit, simplified formula for \(x/w\), given these conditions.

The logical deduction suggests that since the ratio \(\frac{x + 6 y - 3 z}{-3 x + 4 w}\) is equal to \(\frac{2}{3}\), then \(\frac{x + 6 y - 3 z}{-3 x + 4 w} = 2/3\). And because \(\frac{-2 y + z}{x - w} = 2/3\), these relations link the variables.

To find an explicit closed-form expression for \(x/w\), we note that the numerator and denominator can be manipulated to isolate \(x/w\) based on the proportional relations given, particularly focusing on the ratios being constant \(2/3\).

Based on the pattern in the enumerated answers and the problem structure, the value of \(x/w\) simplifies to a fixed constant, specifically \(2/3\), due to the ratios' equality conditions and the proportionality. This logical step is supported by the symmetry and the structure of the equations.

Therefore, the corrected answer expression, in a fully formalized Lean syntax, is simply the constant \(2/3\).

<<<(2/3)>>>

This answer aligns with the deductions, leverages the proportional relations, and is in the required closed form suitable for formal mathematical proof.
