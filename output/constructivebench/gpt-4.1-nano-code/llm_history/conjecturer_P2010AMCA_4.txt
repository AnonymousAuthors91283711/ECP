Given x < 0, the minimal value maintains all inequalities. The dominant negative behaviors are from x^(1/3), (- (2 : ℝ)^x), and x / |x| which relate to the real cube root and exponential. The simplest consistent positive output respecting all constraints is perhaps \( -x^{1/3} \), as x<0 ensures its negativity, and it dominates the sign conditions.
