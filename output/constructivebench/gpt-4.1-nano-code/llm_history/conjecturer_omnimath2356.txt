theorem omnimath2356 :
  let rec a : ℕ → ℕ
    | 0 => 0  -- dummy value for n=0
    | 1 => 1
    | n + 1 => (a n + (n + 1)) % 2012
  a 2012 = omnimath2356_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 1006. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Since the recursive definition involves adding (n + 1) modulo 2012 up to n=2012, and starting from 1 at n=1, the sum modulo 2012 accumulates as the sum from 1 to 2012 modulo 2012. So the total sum is (2012 * 2013 / 2) % 2012, which simplifies to 1006. 

<<<(2012 * (2012 + 1) / 2) % 2012>>>
