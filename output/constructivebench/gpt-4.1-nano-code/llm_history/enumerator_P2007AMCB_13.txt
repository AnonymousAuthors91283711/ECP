The problem appears to involve finding the ratio or proportion of certain cycle times in a traffic signal or similar timing sequence, with the total cycle and change intervals specified. To assist in conjecturing and verifying the answer, I will enumerate candidate ratios based on various plausible values, especially focusing on their exact fractions or simple approximations. I'll iterate over small integers for the change intervals and cycle, then compute the ratio. When the ratio matches a well-known proportion or simple fraction, that's likely to be the answer sought.

Here's the code to enumerate candidate ratios, outputting exact fractions or close rational approximations:

```python
# Enumerate possible cycle and change intervals, aiming to find the ratio (change_intervals / cycle)
# Focus on small integers to find exact or close rational approximations
# Given cycle = 30 + 3 + 30 = 63 seconds
# Change intervals = 3 + 3 = 6 seconds
# The ratio expected is approximately 6/63 = 2/21 â‰ˆ 0.0952

# Since the problem is about the ratio, we explore small numerator/denominator pairs that approximate 6/63,
# but also check for other plausible ratios.

from fractions import Fraction

# Parameters based on the problem statement
cycle = 30 + 3 + 30  # total cycle time
change_intervals = 3 + 3  # sum of change intervals

# List to hold candidate ratios
candidates = []

# Explore small numerator/denominator pairs up to some limit
limit = 10  # small numbers for simplicity
for numerator in range(1, limit+1):
    for denominator in range(1, limit+1):
        ratio = Fraction(numerator, denominator)
        # Check if ratio is close to the exact ratio (6/63)
        if abs(ratio - Fraction(change_intervals, cycle)) < Fraction(1, 1000):
            print(f"Candidate ratio: {ratio} (approx. {float(ratio):.4f})")
            candidates.append(ratio)

# Additionally, print the exact fraction from known data
exact_ratio = Fraction(change_intervals, cycle)
print(f"Exact ratio: {exact_ratio} (approx. {float(exact_ratio):.4f})")
```
