Ground Truth Answer: [2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 3]
Proposed Answer: [3, 0, 2, 0, 671, 4]
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive formula that builds a number from a list of digits, where each digit is multiplied by (-4) and added to the accumulated value.

2. The ground truth answer [2,0,0,2,0,3] would compute:
   (((((0*(-4)+3)*(-4)+0)*(-4)+2)*(-4)+0)*(-4)+0)*(-4)+2 = -2013

3. The proposed answer [3,0,2,0,671,4] would compute:
   (((((0*(-4)+4)*(-4)+671)*(-4)+0)*(-4)+2)*(-4)+0)*(-4)+3 = a very large number (not -2013)

The proposed answer clearly doesn't satisfy the equation, as it would produce a much larger number due to the 671 term.
