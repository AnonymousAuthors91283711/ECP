    omnimath1092_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Prime factors: [2, 3, 5, 7]
Selected N: 6 with divisors [1, 5, 7, 35]
Mapping: {1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 0, 6: 1}
Number of divisors: 4. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The input N=6 has divisors {1, 2, 3, 6}. The function f maps these to {0, 1, 2, 3}. Constraints prevent mapping equal divisors to same value unless identical, and for gcd 1 it must be a different color, ensuring the function distinguishes divisors with gcd 1. To satisfy the maximality of {c : ℕ | ...}, the second largest divisor's value is maximized under these constraints, and the maximal value assigned to 6 (the largest divisor) is 1, with others 0.
