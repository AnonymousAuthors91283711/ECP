The problem involves computing the ratio of the size of a particular subset \(A\) of 2-element subsets of tickets \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\), where \(A\) includes those subsets containing at least one element less than or equal to 4.

To find this ratio, we can directly enumerate all 2-element subsets, count how many contain at least one of \(\{1, 2, 3, 4\}\), and then compute the ratio.

Here's the Python code to approximate this ratio:

```python
# Enumerate all 2-element subsets and count those containing at least one number ≤ 4
tickets = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
from itertools import combinations

total_subsets = list(combinations(tickets, 2))
count_A = 0
for subset in total_subsets:
    if any(x <= 4 for x in subset):
        print(f"Subset: {subset}")
        count_A += 1

ratio = count_A / len(total_subsets)
print(f"card A: {count_A}")
print(f"card Ω: {len(total_subsets)}")
print(f"Ratio: {ratio}")
```
