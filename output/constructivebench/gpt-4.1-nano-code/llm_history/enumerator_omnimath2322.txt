This problem involves finding the smallest natural number n > 101 such that the rightmost nonzero digit of n! is the same as that of 101!, which is a typical problem about last nonzero digits of factorials.

Since calculating factorials directly for large values is computationally expensive, a common approach is to generate candidates starting from 102 upward and compute their last nonzero digits efficiently until the minimal n matching the condition is found. We focus on small sample values, proceed until we find the minimal such n, and print candidates as we go.

```python
# Enumerate n > 101, compute last nonzero digit of factorial(n), compare with that of 101!
# Stop at the first n that matches and is minimal.

def last_nonzero_digit_factorial(n):
    # Calculate last nonzero digit of n! without full factorial
    # Using the known pattern, or iterative multiplication with factors considering trailing zeros.
    digit = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = i
        # Remove factors of 5 and paired 2s to avoid zeros
        while x % 5 == 0:
            x //= 5
            # account for dividing by 2 later
            # will do after the loop
        digit *= x
        # Remove factors of 2 to match factors of 5
        while digit % 10 == 0:
            digit //= 10
    return digit % 10

# Precompute for 101!
digit_101 = last_nonzero_digit_factorial(101)

n = 102
while True:
    digit_n = last_nonzero_digit_factorial(n)
    print(f"n={n}, last nonzero digit of {n}! = {digit_n}")
    if digit_n == digit_101:
        print(f"Found n={n} matching last nonzero digit of 101!")
        break
    n += 1
```
