  IsLeast {n : ℕ | ∃ (a b c : ℕ), a < b ∧ b < c ∧ c < n ∧ a + b + c + n = 100} omnimath2754_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n=27 with a=22, b=25, c=26
n=27 with a=23, b=24, c=26
Smallest n with such a triple: 27. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Let's analyze the given data points. Both solutions have n=27 with different triples, and the smallest such n is 27. The pattern suggests n=27 is the minimal value fulfilling the condition for some triplet with inequalities and sum. Generalizing from the enumerated solutions, the minimal n remains constant at 27.

Answer: <<<27>>>
