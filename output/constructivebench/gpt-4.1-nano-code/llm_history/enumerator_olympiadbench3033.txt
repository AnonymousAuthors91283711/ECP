The problem seems to involve a physics or geometry context, possibly a motion with initial velocities S and M, and a total distance traveled over time t. To assist in conjecturing the true answer, we need to generate possible values for t such that the combined contributions of S and M, multiplied by t, equal the total distance, and also compute some function `olympiadbench3033_answer S M distance`. Given the example parameters, we can explore various t values.

Given the constraints:
- S = 15
- M = 10
- distance = 100

The key equation:
\[ (S + M) \times t = 100 \]
which simplifies to:
\[ 25 \times t = 100 \Rightarrow t = 4 \]

We can enumerate t values near this, including the exact solution and some nearby approximations for verification.

We will generate t from 0 to, say, 10, step 0.5, check if \((S+M)t\) is close to 100, and output the candidate t's along with the corresponding partial calculations.

Here's the code:

```python
# Enumerate t in the range [0, 10] with step 0.5
# Compute S*M distance (here, just a placeholder: S * t)
# Since S=15, M=10, total sum S+M=25
# For each t, check if (S+M)*t ~= 100

S = 15
M = 10
distance = 100
max_t = 10
step = 0.5

for t in [i * step for i in range(int(max_t / step) + 1)]:
    total_distance = (S + M) * t
    if abs(total_distance - distance) < 1e-6:
        print(f"Exact match at t={t}: (S+M)*t={total_distance}")
    elif abs(total_distance - distance) < 1:
        print(f"Approximate: t={t}, (S+M)*t={total_distance}")
```
