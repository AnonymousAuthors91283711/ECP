theorem omnimath3604 :
  {p : Nat | p.Prime ∧ ∃ k : ℤ, k^3 = p^2 - p + 1} = omnimath3604_answer :=
sorry
. Enumerated answers: Prime p=19, p^2 - p + 1=343 = 7^3. Expected Answer Type: Set Nat
The only prime p satisfying p^2 - p + 1 = k^3 is p=19, where p^2 - p + 1=343=7^3. Generalizing, p=19 is the unique solution.
