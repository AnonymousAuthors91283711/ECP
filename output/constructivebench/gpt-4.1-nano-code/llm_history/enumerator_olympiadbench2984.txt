This problem involves evaluating a sum involving sines of specific angles in degrees, converted to radians for computation. The key is to approximate the value accurately and consider the exact form if possible.

Given the angles are small and related, we can suspect some recurrence or pattern. To assist in conjecturing, we'll implement a Python program that enumerates approximate values of the expression with increased precision, identifies candidate exact values, and attempts to recognize simple rational multiples of π, or at least outputs several candidates for analysis.

Because the expressions involve sine of multiples of 6°, 12°, 24°, 42°, the program will compute the sum over a small range around plausible rational multiples of π, focusing on pinpointing the exact value or pattern.

```python
import math

# Define a function to convert degrees to radians
def deg_to_rad(deg):
    return deg * math.pi / 180

# Function to evaluate the expression for a given scaling factor
def evaluate_expression(scale=1):
    # Compute angles in radians scaled by 'scale' to explore possible exact forms
    angles_deg = [6, 12, 24, 42]
    angles_rad = [deg_to_rad(angle * scale) for angle in angles_deg]
    sin_vals = [math.sin(rad) for rad in angles_rad]
    
    # First term: sin(6°*scale) * sin(12°*scale) * sin(24°*scale) * sin(42°*scale)
    term1 = sin_vals[0] * sin_vals[1] * sin_vals[2] * sin_vals[3]
    # Second term: sin(12°*scale) * sin(24°*scale) * sin(42°*scale)
    term2 = sin_vals[1] * sin_vals[2] * sin_vals[3]
    result = term1 + term2
    return result

# Enumerate over small integer scales to find exact or rational approximations
candidates = []
for s in range(1, 11):  # test scales from 1 to 10
    val = evaluate_expression(s)
    # Convert to a string rounded to high decimal to check for patterns
    s_value = round(val, 10)
    candidates.append((s, s_value))
    print(f"Scale {s}: approximate value = {s_value}")

# Optionally, analyze candidates to identify simple rational multiples of pi
# For further conjecture, approximate ratios to Pi
for s, val in candidates:
    ratio = val / math.pi
    print(f"At scale {s}, value / pi ≈ {ratio:.4f}")
```
