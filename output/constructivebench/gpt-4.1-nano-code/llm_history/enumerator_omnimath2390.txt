The problem appears to concern the set of real numbers `x` satisfying certain bounds and a floor division condition related to the ratio `⌊x⌋ / x = 2015 / 2016`. We are asked to find the greatest such `x` related to some value involving 2015 plus an answer, and determine its fractional part.

Given the structure, the key is to analyze the inequality `⌊x⌋ / x = 2015 / 2016`. We want to find the maximum `x` satisfying:
- `∃ (k : ℕ), k ≤ x < k + 1`
- `k / x = 2015 / 2016`
- the set contains such `x`, and the greatest such.

The main idea:
- For each integer `k`, the equality `k / x = 2015 / 2016` implies `x = (k * 2016) / 2015`.
- Only consider such `x` if it fits into the interval `[k, k+1)` (i.e., the interval for the floor value).
- Find the maximum of all such `x`.

Let's implement this reasoning efficiently over a reasonable range of `k`.

```python
# Enumerate candidate k values, derive corresponding x, and check the interval
# Since for large k, x grows linearly, limit k to a range around the possible maximum

max_k = 10**7  # Large enough to find the maximum within reasonable bounds
best_x = None
best_k = None
for k in range(1, max_k):
    x = (k * 2016) / 2015
    if k <= x < k + 1:
        if (best_x is None) or x > best_x:
            best_x = x
            best_k = k
print("Maximum x satisfying conditions:", best_x)
print("Corresponding k:", best_k)
print("Fractional part of 2015 + answer:", (2015 + best_x) % 1)
```
