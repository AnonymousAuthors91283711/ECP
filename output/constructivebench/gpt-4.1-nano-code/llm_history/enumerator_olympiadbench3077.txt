This problem involves calculating an exponential growth and taking its floor value, specifically: `floor(100000 * (1.002)^10)`. Since the problem is a high-school level Olympiad problem, we will enumerate small candidate answers by approximating the power and then verifying possible integer values to find the exact answer without hardcoding.

The main task is to compute `floor(100000 * (1.002)^10)` accurately. The key is to generate possible answers near the approximate value and confirm the exact floor.

```python
# Enumerate possible answers for floor(100000 * (1.002)^10)
# Approximate the value first
import math

# Parameters
base_rate = 1.002
power = 10
multiplier = 100000

# Approximate the value
approx_value = multiplier * (base_rate ** power)
print(f"Approximate value before floor: {approx_value}")

# Since the answer is an integer, check possible candidates around the approximate value
# Let's consider candidates from floor to ceil
lower_candidate = math.floor(approx_value)
upper_candidate = math.ceil(approx_value)

# Verify which candidate is the true floor
def check(candidate):
    return candidate == math.floor(multiplier * (base_rate ** power))

# Enumerate and print candidates
for candidate in range(lower_candidate, upper_candidate + 2):
    if check(candidate):
        print(f"Answer candidate: {candidate}")
        # The correct answer is when check(candidate) is True
        # Stream the answer immediately
        print(candidate)
        break
```
