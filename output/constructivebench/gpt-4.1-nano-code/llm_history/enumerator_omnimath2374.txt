The problem involves a recurrence relation: \( x(n+2) = 2x(n+1) - x(n) + 2^n \) with initial conditions \( x(1)=1 \) and \( x(2)=2 \). We want to compute \( x(2012) \). To handle the recurrence exactly and efficiently, we'll write Python code that simulates the recurrence up to \( n=2012 \), printing each computed value to observe the behavior and possibly conjecture a closed form.

We'll implement the recurrence with initial values, iterate through from \( n=3 \) to \( 2012 \), and print each result immediately, enabling streaming partial results.

```python
# Initialize initial conditions
x1, x2 = 1, 2

# Starting from n=3 up to 2012, compute x(n)
for n in range(3, 2013):
    # n-2 used for previous step
    x_n = 2 * x2 - x1 + 2 ** (n - 1)
    # Print the current value
    print(f"n={n}: x({n}) = {x_n}")
    # Update for next iteration
    x1, x2 = x2, x_n
```
