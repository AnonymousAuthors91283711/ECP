The problem appears to seek the solution for the equation \( 3n = 6 \times 2 \). To assist in verifying the solution, I'll write a Python script that enumerates possible values of \( n \) over a certain small range and identifies which satisfy the equation exactly, then outputs the solutions accordingly.

Since this is a straightforward linear equation, I'll just check a small range (e.g., from 0 to 10) to find all \( n \) satisfying \( 3n = 12 \). The only solution should be \( n=4 \). This method can help confirm the correct value without hardcoding.

```python
# Enumerate possible integer values of n to find solutions for 3n = 12
for n in range(0, 20):
    lhs = 3 * n
    rhs = 6 * 2
    if lhs == rhs:
        print(f"n = {n} satisfies 3 * n = 6 * 2")
        # Since the equation is linear and unique solution, we can stop here if desired
```

This program checks values from 0 to 19, identifies the value where \( 3n = 12 \), and prints it immediately. It can be adjusted for larger ranges or to confirm uniqueness if needed.
