The problem involves finding the maximum value of c given certain conditions involving variables a, b, c, x, y, z, and a set of equations and inequalities. The constraints suggest a complex nonlinear optimization problem with sets of conditions.

To assist, I will:
- Choose small sample values satisfying the constraints.
- Systematically enumerate candidate solutions within reasonable bounds.
- Record the maximum c that satisfies all constraints.
- Since the problem involves multiple variables with inequalities, we'll limit the ranges for enumeration to small integer or fractional values to keep it tractable.
- The goal is to approximate or identify the maximum possible c satisfying the constraints.

Below is a Python program that:
- Enumerates small values for a, b, c, x, y, z.
- Checks the constraints.
- Tracks the maximum c found.

Note: This is a heuristic approach considering the complexity; for more precise results, more refined numerical methods would be needed, but within the token constraints, this captures the process.

```python
# Enumerate candidates where variables are in small ranges
max_c_found = 0
max_solution = None

# Define small ranges for variables
# a, b, c >= 1
# x, y, z > 0, starting from 0.1 to 2 in steps
for a in [1 + i*0.5 for i in range(4)]:  # 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5
    for b in [1 + i*0.5 for i in range(4)]:
        for c in [1 + i*0.5 for i in range(4, 8)]:  # starting from 1.5 upwards
            for x in [0.1 + i*0.2 for i in range(10)]:
                for y in [0.1 + i*0.2 for i in range(10)]:
                    for z in [0.1 + i*0.2 for i in range(10)]:
                        # Compute the terms
                        A = a ** x
                        B = b ** y
                        C = c ** z
                        sum1 = A + B + C
                        sum2 = x * A + y * B + z * C
                        sum3 = x**2 * A + y**2 * B + z**2 * C
                        # Check inequalities
                        if a >= 1 and b >= 1 and c >= 1 and x > 0 and y > 0 and z > 0:
                            # Check equalities within a tolerance
                            if abs(sum1 - 4) < 0.1 and abs(sum2 - 6) < 0.1 and abs(sum3 - 9) < 0.1:
                                if c > max_c_found:
                                    max_c_found = c
                                    max_solution = (a, b, c, x, y, z)
                                    print(f"Found c: {c:.2f} with solution {max_solution}")
# Output the maximum c found
print(f"Maximum c approximated: {max_c_found:.2f}")
```
