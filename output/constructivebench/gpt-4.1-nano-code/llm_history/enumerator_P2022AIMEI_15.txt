This problem appears to involve symmetric sums of three variables \(x, y, z\) with specific conditions on their sums of powers, and relates the product \((1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z)\) to a rational fraction. The goal is to find integers \(m, n\) (coprime) such that the squared product equals \(m/n\), and to determine their sum.

Given the constraints:
- \(x + y + z = 1\),
- \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2\),
- \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 3\),
and positive \(x, y, z\).

From these, we can:
- Find \(\sigma_1 = x + y + z = 1\),
- \(\sigma_2 = xy + yz + zx\),
- \(\sigma_3 = xyz\).

Using the identities:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx) = 1^2 - 2\sigma_2 = 1 - 2\sigma_2
\]
which leads to:
\[
2 = 1 - 2\sigma_2 \implies \sigma_2 = -\frac{1}{2}
\]

Next, for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = (x + y + z)^3 - 3(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) + 3xyz
\]
or
\[
3 = 1^3 - 3 \cdot 1 \cdot (-\frac{1}{2}) + 3xyz
\]
\[
3 = 1 + \frac{3}{2} + 3xyz
\]
\[
3xyz = 3 - 1 - \frac{3}{2} = 1 - \frac{3}{2} = -\frac{1}{2}
\]
Thus:
\[
xyz = -\frac{1}{6}
\]

Now, consider the polynomial with roots \(x,y,z\):
\[
t^3 - \sigma_1 t^2 + \sigma_2 t - \sigma_3 = 0
\]
which becomes:
\[
t^3 - t^2 - \frac{1}{2} t + \frac{1}{6} = 0
\]

We want \((1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z)\):
\[
(1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z) = 1 - (x + y + z) + (xy + yz + zx) - xyz = 1 - \sigma_1 + \sigma_2 - \sigma_3
\]

Substituting known values:
\[
= 1 - 1 + (-\frac{1}{2}) - (-\frac{1}{6}) = 0 - \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{6} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{6} = -\frac{3}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = -\frac{2}{6} = -\frac{1}{3}
\]

Finally, the square:
\[
\left((1 - x)(1 - y)(1 - z)\right)^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{9}
\]

The fraction \(\frac{1}{9}\) is already in lowest terms (coprime numerator and denominator). Therefore, the answer for \(m/n\) is \(1/9\), with \(m=1\), \(n=9\), which are coprime. The sum:
\[
m + n = 10
\]

```python
# Enumerate the candidate answer for the sum m + n based on reasoning:
# exact fraction: 1/9 which is simplified, giving m=1, n=9
# sum is 1 + 9 = 10
answer_sum = 10
print(answer_sum)
```
