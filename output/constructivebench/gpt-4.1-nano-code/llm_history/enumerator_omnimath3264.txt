The problem appears to involve understanding when, for a given positive integer n, every coprime m mod n can be realized as a permutation π of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1} satisfying π(π(k)) ≡ m * k (mod n). To explore possible n values, let's enumerate small n to observe whether such permutations exist and potentially identify a pattern.

Given the problem's structure, it seems focused on properties related to the multiplicative group modulo n and permutation compositions. We will write a script to test small n, check the condition for all coprime m, and output the set of such n, all while streaming answers.

```python
# Enumerate small n from 1 to 20 to identify values satisfying the property
# For each n, check for all coprime m in [1, n-1] whether there exists a permutation π
# of {0,1,...,n-1} such that π(π(k)) ≡ m*k mod n for all k. If yes, include n in answer set.

def is_valid(n):
    from itertools import permutations
    coprime_ms = [m for m in range(1, n) if gcd(m, n) == 1]
    elements = list(range(n))
    for m in coprime_ms:
        found = False
        for pi in permutations(elements):
            if all((pi[pi[k]] % n) == (m * k) % n for k in elements):
                found = True
                break
        if not found:
            return False
    return True

from math import gcd
result = []

# Enumerate candidate n's
for n in range(1, 21):
    if is_valid(n):
        print(f"n = {n} satisfies the condition.")
        result.append(n)
```
