This problem involves finite functions from a 5-element set to itself where the functions satisfy the condition \(f(f(x)) = f(f(f(x)))\). We want to enumerate such functions to deduce their total count and possibly find the actual number.

The key is analyzing the condition \(f(f(x)) = f(f(f(x)))\). Simplify this:

- The condition always holds if \(f\) idempotent: \(f^2 = f^3\).
- For functions \(f : \{1,2,3,4,5\} \to \{1,2,3,4,5\}\), fix \(f\)'s image points.

In the finite setting, the solutions are functions where the image is stable under \(f\); i.e., \(f\) acts as a projection on the image. These are essentially functions with a particular structure resembling a union of cyclic or idempotent parts.

A practical approach is to analyze all functions by their images and preimages, but enumerating all functions directly (which total \(5^5 = 3125\)) is feasible enough.

We will:
- Iterate over all functions \(f : \{1,2,3,4,5\} \to \{1,2,3,4,5\}\),
- Check if the condition \(f(f(x)) = f(f(f(x)))\) holds for all \(x\),
- If yes, print and count them,
- At the end, output the total.

This ensures each valid function is streamed as found and uses efficient checks.

```python
# Enumerate all functions f: {1,..,5} -> {1,..,5} that satisfy f(f(x)) = f(f(f(x))) for all x
import itertools

def is_valid(f):
    for x in range(1, 6):
        if f[f[x-1]-1] != f[f[f[x-1]-1]-1]:
            return False
    return True

count = 0
# Generate all functions as tuples of length 5, values from 1 to 5
for f_values in itertools.product(range(1, 6), repeat=5):
    if is_valid(f_values):
        count += 1
        print(f_value := f_values)
print(f"Total functions satisfying the condition: {count}")
```
