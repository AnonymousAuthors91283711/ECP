This problem involves finding the greatest `k` where `N` is a three-digit number between 100 and 999, with a special property on its divisors: for any two distinct divisors `a` and `b` of `N`, the difference `(a - b)` is divisible by 3. The value of `k` is determined by `N * (number of divisors of N)`.

The key mathematical insight:
- For the property `(∀ a, b | N, a ≠ b → 3 | (a - b))`, the divisors of `N` are all congruent modulo 3.
- This is true if and only if *all* divisors of `N` are congruent modulo 3, meaning either:
  - All divisors are divisible by 3, or
  - All divisors are not divisible by 3 (but then differences of divisors could differ mod 3, contradicting the property unless trivial).

Since the divisors of `N` are either all congruent to 0 mod 3 (meaning `3 | N`) or all ±1 mod 3 (which is unlikely for divisors of a composite), the most consistent case is when *all divisors* are divisible by 3, which occurs when `N` itself is divisible by 3, and, in particular, when divisors are all multiples of 3.

Thus, likely `N` is divisible by 3, and possibly 3 divides the product of its divisors in a way that all divisors are identical modulo 3.

**Approach:**
- Enumerate `N` from 100 to 999.
- For each `N` divisible by 3, check divisibility conditions.
- Count divisors of `N`.
- Compute `k = N * number_of_divisors(N)`.
- Track the maximum `k`.
- Print each candidate answer immediately when found.

The search space is small enough for enumeration since only 300 numbers are checked (from 100 to 999 divisible by 3).

Here's the implementation:

```python
# Enumerate N between 100 and 999 divisible by 3
max_k = -1
max_N = None
for N in range(102, 1000, 3):
    divisors = []
    for d in range(1, int(N**0.5) + 1):
        if N % d == 0:
            divisors.append(d)
            if d != N // d:
                divisors.append(N // d)
    # Check the divisor difference divisibility condition
    # For all pairs of divisors, their difference should be divisible by 3
    # To optimize, check that all divisors are congruent mod 3
    if all(d % 3 == divisors[0] % 3 for d in divisors):
        k = N * len(divisors)
        print(k)  # stream each answer
        if k > max_k:
            max_k = k
            max_N = N
print("Maximum k:", max_k)
```

This code enumerates over all three-digit multiples of 3, computes their divisors, and verifies the divisibility condition efficiently by checking the divisors' congruence modulo 3. It prints each valid `k` immediately and finally outputs the maximum found.
