The problem appears to involve finding all lists of positive rational numbers of the form 1/n (with n ≥ 1) that sum to 1/4. We want to enumerate possible solutions, likely small-length lists, to help conjecture the exact set. 

Since the problem involves positive fractions 1/n, a typical approach is to start with small n, generate candidate combinations, and check sums.

We will:
- Generate small lists of such fractions
- Check their sums
- Output solutions immediately

Because the sum is 1/4, and each term is at least 1/1 = 1, the list length can't exceed 4 (since sum of four 1's is 4, definitely too large; but for small n, this is manageable).

Let's generate all small lists with elements of the form 1/n, where n ≥ 1, with a manageable maximum length, say 4.

```python
from itertools import combinations_with_replacement, permutations

def generate_fractions(max_length=4):
    # Generate possible fractions 1/n with n from 1 to 10 for simplicity
    fractions = [1 / n for n in range(1, 11)]
    solutions = []

    # Check lists of length 1 to max_length
    for length in range(1, max_length + 1):
        # Generate all combinations with replacement
        for combo in combinations_with_replacement(fractions, length):
            # Check if sum equals 1/4 approximately
            total = sum(combo)
            if abs(total - 0.25) < 1e-9:
                # To avoid duplicates in different orders, sort and unique
                # But itertools combinations_with_replacement generates sorted combos
                solutions.append(list(combo))
                print([float(x) for x in combo])  # Stream solutions
    # No particular minimal or maximal, just all solutions found
    return solutions

# Run the generator
generate_fractions()
```
