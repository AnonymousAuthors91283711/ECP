The problem asks us to find pairs of positive integers (m, n) such that:

\[ m^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n} i! \]

We are to enumerate some solutions for small values of n and compute m accordingly. Since factorials grow rapidly, we only need to consider small n to find potential solutions.

Approach:
- Fix small n (e.g., from 1 up to 10).
- Compute the sum of factorials from 1! to n!.
- Check if the sum is a perfect square.
- If yes, record (m, n) where m = sqrt of the sum, ensuring m is an integer.
- Stream the found solutions immediately.

```python
import math

# Enumerate small n values to find pairs (m, n)
for n in range(1, 20):
    # sum of factorials from 1! to n!
    sum_factorials = sum(math.factorial(i) for i in range(1, n + 1))
    m = int(math.isqrt(sum_factorials))
    # Check if sum_factorials is a perfect square
    if m * m == sum_factorials:
        print((m, n))
```
