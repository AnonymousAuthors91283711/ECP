theorem omnimath2713 :
  ∃! N, 400 < N ∧ N < 600 ∧ Odd N ∧ 5 ∣ N ∧ 11 ∣ N ∧
  (digits 10 N).sum = omnimath2713_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Candidate N: 495
Unique N: 495
Sum of digits: 18. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The number N must be odd, divisible by 5 and 11, and between 400 and 600; the only candidate is 495. The sum of digits of 495 is 4 + 9 + 5 = 18. Therefore, the answer is 18.
