    N = ∑ i in Finset.range 2013, d i * 4^i} (4^2013 - 1) ∧
  (4^2013 - 1) % 210 = omnimath2267_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 51
Proposed Answer: (4^2013 - 1) / 210
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem is asking two things:
1. To verify that 4^2013 - 1 is the greatest number in a certain set
2. To find what (4^2013 - 1) mod 210 equals (this is the omnimath2267_answer)

The ground truth answer gives the direct modulus result: 51
The proposed answer gives an expression: (4^2013 - 1)/210

These are not equivalent because:
1. The modulus operation (mod 210) is different from division by 210
2. The correct answer should be the remainder when 4^2013 - 1 is divided by 210, not the quotient

Therefore, the proposed answer is incorrect.

<<<False>>>
