Ground Truth Answer: 11664
Proposed Answer: 3^6 * 16
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us 2^x = 3 and asks us to find 4^(3x+2)
2. First, let's solve for x from the given equation:
   - 2^x = 3 ⇒ x = log₂3
3. Now compute 4^(3x+2):
   - 4 = 2², so we can rewrite as (2²)^(3x+2) = 2^(6x+4)
   - Substitute x = log₂3: 2^(6*log₂3 + 4) = 2^(6*log₂3) * 2^4 = (2^log₂3)^6 * 16 = 3^6 * 16
4. Calculate 3^6 * 16 = 729 * 16 = 11664

The ground truth answer is 11664, and the proposed answer is 3^6 * 16, which evaluates to exactly 11664. They are mathematically equivalent expressions.
