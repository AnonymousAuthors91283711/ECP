This problem involves computing the expression (m + n)! / (m - n)! for integers m, n with m ≥ n. We want to enumerate possible answers to assist in conjecturing and proving the true answer. Notice that:

(m + n)! / (m - n)! = (m + n) * (m + n - 1) * ... * (m - n + 1)

This is a product of 2n consecutive integers starting from (m - n + 1) up to (m + n). So, the problem reduces to enumerating these products for small m, n satisfying m ≥ n, to observe patterns.

We'll:
- Pick small sample values for n and m satisfying m ≥ n.
- For each pair, compute the product of the integers from (m - n + 1) to (m + n).
- Print each computed answer immediately.

This approach helps to uncover the pattern and conjecture the closed form.

```python
# Enumerate small pairs (m, n) with m >= n
# For each, compute (m + n)! / (m - n)!
for m in range(0, 10):
    for n in range(0, m + 1):
        start = m - n + 1
        end = m + n
        # Compute the product of integers from start to end
        answer = 1
        for k in range(start, end + 1):
            answer *= k
        print(f"m={m}, n={n} -> (m+n)!/(m-n)! = {answer}")
```
