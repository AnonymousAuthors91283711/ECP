This problem involves a set of positive integers satisfying specific multiplicative relations, which resemble conditions similar to Latin squares or mutually consistent multiplicative schemes. To provide insight and assist in conjecturing the answer, I'll write a Python script that exhaustively searches small positive integer tuples satisfying these relations. The search will output each candidate as soon as it finds one, focusing on small numbers to manage complexity. I'll limit the search ranges to small values, print parameters used, and enumerate all solutions accordingly.

```python
# Search small positive integer solutions satisfying the given relations.
# The relations resemble a set of mutually consistent multiplicative conditions.
# We search over small values of a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i starting from 1.

def main():
    solutions = []
    max_val = 10  # limit search to small numbers for efficiency
    for a in range(1, max_val+1):
        for b in range(1, max_val+1):
            for c in range(1, max_val+1):
                for d in range(1, max_val+1):
                    for e in range(1, max_val+1):
                        for f in range(1, max_val+1):
                            for g in range(1, max_val+1):
                                for h in range(1, max_val+1):
                                    for i in range(1, max_val+1):
                                        # Check the relations
                                        if (a*b*c == d*e*f and
                                            d*e*f == g*h*i and
                                            a*d*g == b*e*h and
                                            b*e*h == c*f*i and
                                            a*e*i == c*e*g):
                                            print(f"Found solution: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}, e={e}, f={f}, g={g}, h={h}, i={i}")
                                            solutions.append((a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i))
    # If needed, analyze solutions here
    print(f"\nTotal solutions found: {len(solutions)}")
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python script enumerates possible small positive integer solutions to the system. Each solution is printed immediately upon discovery, aiding in conjecture development regarding the set characterized by the relations.
