The roots are distinct integers, and p1, p2 are symmetric sums: p1 = -(r + s + t), p2 = rs + rt + st. The enumerations suggest (-2,1,3) → p1 = -2, p2 = -5; (-1,2,3) → p1 = -4, p2 = 1; (-1,1,6) → p1 = -6, p2 = -1; (-3,1,2) → p1 = 0, p2 = -7; (-3,-2,-1) → p1 = 6, p2 = 11, illustrating p1 = -(r + s + t), p2 = rs + rt + st. The sum of roots is -p1, and the sum of  
roots pairwise products is p2, and roots are distinct. The number of such triplets corresponds to number of distinct triples of integers with sum ≠ 0 and pairwise products summing accordingly. The pattern yields the total count as 6, the number of such triplets with distinct roots.

The core idea is to count the number of **distinct ordered triples** of integers (r, s, t) with the specified polynomial roots, characterized by the symmetric sums p1 and p2. From the enumerations, the roots are linked to p1= -(r+s+t) and p2= rs + rt + st. Each triple's conditions are characterized by sum and pairwise products.

The enumeration indicates there are 5 specific triplets with distinct roots matching particular p1 and p2 values, totaling 6 solutions; this suggests the answer is the fixed number of solutions under the constraints, regardless of actual p1, p2, as long as roots are distinct and fit the polynomial pattern.

Therefore, the answer is a constant ℕ representing 6 solutions for the set of roots, capturing the total number of such triplets with distinct roots.

**Final corrected answer:**

<<<6>>>

**Explanation:** The answer count is 6 based on enumerations, with roots confirmed to be distinct as per the problem. The answer is a constant natural number, not depending on r, s, t directly, but the total number of solutions that fit the polynomial with those roots.
