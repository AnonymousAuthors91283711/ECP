Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
The pattern suggests for n=1, the largest such subspace has dimension 1; for n=2, it is 2, corresponding to symmetric matrices since A Aᵀ = Aᵀ A is always true for symmetric matrices. Testing higher n shows the largest such subspace dimension equals n, formed by symmetric matrices. Therefore, the answer for any n is n.
