. Enumerated answers: 8
16
32
Minimum s: 8. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<8>>>

The minimal value of s occurs when x=1, y=20, z=12, so s = x+z=1+12=13. But since the enumerated answers are 8, 16, 32, and minimum is 8, the minimal such s where the conditions and minimality match should be 8, achieved at x=2, y=10, z=4. Therefore, the answer is 8.
