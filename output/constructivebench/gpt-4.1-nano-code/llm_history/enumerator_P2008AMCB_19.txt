The problem involves finding the minimal value of \( s = |\alpha| + |\gamma| \) such that the quadratic polynomial \((4 + i)z^2 + \alpha z + \gamma\) has real values at \(z=1\) and \(z=i\). This entails ensuring the imaginary parts of the polynomial at these points are zero, which imposes constraints on \(\alpha\) and \(\gamma\).

To explore solutions, we will:
- Assign small sample complex values for \(\alpha\) and \(\gamma\).
- Check the conditions that make the imaginary parts at \(z=1\) and \(z=i\) zero.
- Calculate \(|\alpha| + |\gamma|\) to find minimal sums among candidates.
- Print each candidate answer as it's found.

This approach uses enumeration of small parameters, truncates at some thresholds, and outputs solutions efficiently to aid conjecture.

```python
import cmath
import math

# Explore small complex parameters for alpha and gamma
range_vals = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]  # Small integer samples
found_solutions = []

for a_real in range_vals:
    for a_imag in range_vals:
        alpha = complex(a_real, a_imag)
        for g_real in range_vals:
            for g_imag in range_vals:
                gamma = complex(g_real, g_imag)
                # Calculate polynomial at z=1
                p1 = (4 + 1j) * 1**2 + alpha * 1 + gamma
                # Calculate polynomial at z=i
                p2 = (4 + 1j) * (1j)**2 + alpha * (1j) + gamma
                # Check if imaginary parts are zero (within a tiny tolerance)
                if abs(p1.imag) < 1e-6 and abs(p2.imag) < 1e-6:
                    s = abs(alpha) + abs(gamma)
                    print(f"alpha={alpha}, gamma={gamma}, |alpha|+|gamma|={s}")
                    found_solutions.append(s)

# Optionally, identify minimal solution found
if found_solutions:
    min_s = min(found_solutions)
    print(f"Minimum approximate sum |alpha|+|gamma| = {min_s}")
```
