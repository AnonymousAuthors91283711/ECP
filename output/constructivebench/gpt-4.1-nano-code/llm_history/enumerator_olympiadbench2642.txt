The problem involves expressing some relations between variables \( x, y \) and a parameter \( k \). We need to find the possible values of \( k \) that satisfy the given logarithmic equations. The goal is to enumerate candidate solutions for \( k \) based on specific sample values of \( x \) and \( y \) within the constraints, and then identify the plausible extremal or exact values.

Since the equations involve logs, and the problem constraints involve \( x, y \neq 1 \), we choose small sample values for \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy the inequalities \( 0 < x, y \neq 1 \).

To discover potential \( k \) values, we systematically plug in sample pairs \( (x, y) \), compute the expressions for \( k \), and record the resulting values.

Here's the Python code implementing this enumeration:

```python
import math

# Define bounds for x and y for sampling; avoid x=1, y=1
x_values = [0.5, 2, 0.25, 4]  # sample x values away from 1
y_values = [0.5, 2, 0.25, 4]  # sample y values away from 1

# Store observed values of k
k_candidates = set()

for x in x_values:
    for y in y_values:
        if x == 1 or y == 1:
            continue  # skip invalid cases
        try:
            # Calculate the logs carefully
            log_x = math.log(x)
            log_y = math.log(y)
            # Avoid log of negative or zero, but since x,y > 0, only check for zero
            if log_x == 0 or log_y == 0:
                continue

            # Compute the two expressions
            term1 = (math.log(y ** 2) / log_x) + (math.log(x ** 5) / log_y)
            term2 = (math.log(y ** 5) / log_x ** 2) - (math.log(x ** 3) / (log_y ** 2))
            # Compute k from the equations:
            # term1 = 2k - 1  => k = (term1 + 1) / 2
            # term2 = k - 3   => k = term2 + 3

            k_from_term1 = (term1 + 1) / 2
            k_from_term2 = term2 + 3

            # Allow some numerical tolerance
            if abs(k_from_term1 - k_from_term2) < 1e-8:
                k_candidates.add(k_from_term1)

                # Print each candidate immediately
                print(f"x={x}, y={y}, kâ‰ˆ{k_from_term1:.5f}")
        except (ValueError, ZeroDivisionError):
            continue  # skip invalid calculations

# After enumeration, print the set of candidate k's
print("Possible k values from samples:", sorted(k_candidates))
```
