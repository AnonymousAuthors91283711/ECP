abbrev omnimath2718_answer : ℤ := sorry
theorem omnimath2718 : 
  3 - 5 + 7 = 6 - x ↔ x = omnimath2718_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: x = 1
Candidate answer: x = 1. Expected Answer Type: ℤ
<<<1>>>

The pattern suggests the answer is simply the computed value of the expression; the equation simplifies to x = 3 - 5 + 7 - 6, which evaluates to 1.
