This problem seems to involve combinatorics, specifically binomial coefficients, and their linear combinations. The goal appears to be determining the value of \( t_2 \) based on the given parameters, which involve choices and sums of terms weighted by coefficients.

Since the problem defines:
- \( n = 40 \),
- \( t_3 = 3 \),
- \( t_4 = 4 \),
- \( t_5 = 5 \),
- \( t_6 = 6 \),
- and \( t_2 \) is expressed as:
\[ t_2 = \binom{40}{2} - (3 \times \binom{3}{2} + 4 \times \binom{4}{2} + 5 \times \binom{5}{2} + 6 \times \binom{6}{2}) \]

We can directly compute the binomial coefficients involved to find \( t_2 \). This isn't an open enumeration problem but a straightforward calculation. Implementing this in Python will produce the exact answer.

```python
from math import comb

# Define parameters
n = 40
t3, t4, t5, t6 = 3, 4, 5, 6

# Compute the total combinations
total = comb(n, 2)

# Compute the weighted sum of combinations
weighted_sum = (3 * comb(t3, 2) +
                4 * comb(t4, 2) +
                5 * comb(t5, 2) +
                6 * comb(t6, 2))

# Calculate t2
t2 = total - weighted_sum

# Output the computed value
print("t2 =", t2)
```

This program computes and streams the precise value of \( t_2 \).
