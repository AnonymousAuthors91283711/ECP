This problem involves solving for a natural number `n` such that `3 * n = 27` (since `9 + 9 + 9 = 27`), and additionally, verifying that `n` is uniquely determined by this equation. To explore potential solutions, we'll enumerate `n` values and check the equality. Since `n` is a natural number, we'll check a reasonable range (say from 0 to 20) to find solutions, then identify the unique solution.

The program will:
- Set a small upper bound like 20 for enumeration
- Find all `n` satisfying `3 * n = 27`
- Print each candidate solution as soon as found
- Confirm if there's a unique solution

```python
# Enumerate n from 0 to 20 to find solutions for 3 * n = 27
for n in range(21):
    if 3 * n == 27:
        print(n)  # Output candidate solutions immediately
```
