This problem involves finding the greatest value of the expression \( z = \frac{x + y}{x} \) over all \( x, y \) satisfying the constraints:

- \(-4 \leq x \leq -2\)
- \(2 \leq y \leq 4\)

Since the ranges are small and straightforward, we can analyze the expression directly. For each fixed \( x \) in \([-4, -2]\), consider \( z = 1 + \frac{y}{x} \). Because \( x < 0 \), \(\frac{y}{x}\) will be negative or positive depending on \( y \) (which is positive here). To maximize \( z \), note:

- \( y \) is positive and at its maximum 4, since \( \frac{y}{x} \) increases as \( y \) increases for negative \( x \).
- \( x \) is negative, so \( 1 + y/x \) becomes larger (less negative or more positive) as \( y \) increases, but since \( x \) is fixed during maximization, larger \( y \) means larger \( z \).

Thus, the maximum occurs at:
- \( y = 4 \), the maximum
- \( x = -2 \), the least negative (closest to zero) for maximum \( z \)

Calculating:
\[ z_{\max} = 1 + \frac{4}{-2} = 1 - 2 = -1 \]

Now, for the minimum \( z \):
- minimizing \( z = 1 + y/x \) over the same ranges would involve the minimal \( y \) (which is 2) and the minimal \( x \) (which is -4):

\[ z_{\min} = 1 + \frac{2}{-4} = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 \]

But the problem asks for the greatest \( z \). From the above, the maximum \( z \) is \(-1\).

Here's the code that performs the enumeration with small sample values and prints the candidate answer:

```python
# Enumerate over discrete samples of x and y within constraints
x_samples = [-4, -3, -2]
y_samples = [2, 3, 4]

max_z = float('-inf')
max_x, max_y = None, None

for x in x_samples:
    for y in y_samples:
        z = (x + y) / x
        print(f"Candidate: x={x}, y={y}, z={z}")
        if z > max_z:
            max_z = z
            max_x, max_y = x, y
            print(f"New maximum found: z={z} at x={x}, y={y}")

print(f"Maximum z: {max_z} at x={max_x}, y={max_y}")
```
