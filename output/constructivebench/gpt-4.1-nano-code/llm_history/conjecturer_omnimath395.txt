abbrev omnimath395_answer : Set ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath395 (m : ℝ) :
    ∃ (x₁ x₂ : ℝ), roots (C 2 * X^2 - C m * X - C 8) = {x₁, x₂} ∧ x₁ ≠ x₂ ∧ |x₁ - x₂| = m - 1 ↔ m ∈ omnimath395_answer := by sorry. Current Proposed Answer: {r : ℝ | r = (m - 1) ∧ (r = 5)}. Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 51, which is at "m - 1) ∧ (r = 5)}" in "abbrev omnimath395_answer : Set ℝ := {r : ℝ | r = (m - 1) ∧ (r = 5)}", there is an error: unknown identifier 'm'.

The primary issue with the proposed answer is the use of 'm' inside the definition of 'omnimath395_answer' which is an abbrev at the top level, outside the scope where 'm' is defined. Since 'm' is a parameter of the theorem, we can't directly reference 'm' in the definition of the set without making the set depend explicitly on 'm'. 

Given the roots are (4.0, -1.0), the differences are |4 - (-1)| = 5, which implies m - 1 = 5 ⇒ m = 6. The conditions are: roots of the quadratic 2X^2 - mX - 8, roots being 4 and -1, and the difference condition |x₁ - x₂| = m - 1. 

To match the enumerated answer, the answer set must consist explicitly of m such that the roots are (4, -1) and |4 - (-1)| = 5, which corresponds to m = 6. This aligns with the example value.

Since 'm' is a free parameter in the theorem, we should define the answer set as containing specific 'm' values that produce roots (4, -1). For the quadratic 2X^2 - mX -8, roots are given by the quadratic formula:

x = [m ± sqrt(m^2 + 32)] / 4.

Plugging roots 4 and -1:

- For x = 4:
      
      4 = (m + sqrt(m^2 + 32))/4
      16 = m + sqrt(m^2 + 32)
      
- For x = -1:
      
      -1 = (m - sqrt(m^2 + 32))/4
      -4 = m - sqrt(m^2 + 32)

Subtract:
      
      20 = 2 sqrt(m^2 + 32)
      sqrt(m^2 + 32) = 10

Then:
      
      m + 10 = 16 ⇒ m = 6
      
and

      m - 10 = -4 ⇒ m = 6


Thus, the only m is 6. The set 'omnimath395_answer' should be the singleton set {6}.

Final compact answer:

<<<{r : ℝ | r = 6}>>>
