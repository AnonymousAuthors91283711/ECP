noncomputable abbrev omnimath3360_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3360 : 
  ∃! x, x * ⌊x * ⌊x * ⌊x * ⌊x⌋⌋⌋⌋ = 122 ∧ x = omnimath3360_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Error: Program outputs empty result. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests the answer is a rational number, likely related to roots of 122. Testing simple rational candidates (like 11), and considering nested flooring, the structure hints at a value where all floor operations are consistent. 11 is a plausible candidate because 11 * 11 * 11 * 11 = 14641, too large; but considering nested floors, the candidate should be close to 11. Computing √122 ≈ 11.045, and since the nested modulates to floor, the candidate solution is near 11. Thus, the answer simplifies to 11.
