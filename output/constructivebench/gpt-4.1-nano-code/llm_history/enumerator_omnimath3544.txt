[write_program]
This is a formal mathematical statement, likely representing a problem about enumerating lists of digits where the sum, weighted by powers of 10, equals a number N, with additional constraints. The problem appears to ask for all such numbers N that satisfy a property expressed via a unique list l with certain conditions, and then defines a set omnimath3544_answer of such N.

To assist in conjecturing, I will write a Python program that:
- Enumerates small lists of digits (max length to limit computation).
- Checks if the conditions hold (list non-empty, elements ≤ 10, first element ≠ 0, and the number formed equals a target N).
- For each valid list, computes the number N, and outputs N.
- Tracks all such N to build a candidate set.

The code will:
- Use small length bounds to keep calculation manageable.
- Immediately output each discovered N.
- Assume the "digit" list represents decimal digits, so the digit value should likely be ≤ 9, and `get` corresponds to list indexing.

```python
# Enumerate small lists of digits with constraints:
# - list not empty
# - each d <= 10 (but for decimal digits, ≤ 9 makes more sense)
# - first digit ≠ 0
# For each list, compute N = sum of d_i * 10^{i}, where i is position from right
# Output each N found

def enumerate_numbers():
    max_length = 4  # limit length for efficiency
    max_digit = 10  # max digit value, but 9 makes more sense
    for length in range(1, max_length + 1):
        # Generate all lists of given length with digits 0..max_digit
        # First digit ≠ 0
        def generate_list(current_list):
            if len(current_list) == length:
                if current_list[0] != 0:
                    N = sum(d * (10 ** i) for i, d in enumerate(current_list))
                    print(N)
            else:
                start = 1 if len(current_list) == 0 else 0
                for d in range(start, max_digit):
                    generate_list(current_list + [d])
        generate_list([])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    enumerate_numbers()
```
