The problem involves defining a function \(f\) on \(\mathbb{R}^2\), iterating it 2017 times starting from \((1, 10^8)\), and then examining the min of the resulting pair. The structure suggests a convergence to some fixed point related to the harmonic and arithmetic means. A common fixed point for such functions is often the \(\textbf{geometric mean}\) or a related value.

Given the recurrence resembles averaging and harmonic mean calculations, and because \(f\) involves arithmetic averaging and reciprocal harmonic mean, the likely limiting value is the geometric mean of the initial inputs \(\sqrt{1 \times 10^8} = 10^4\).

To verify this, I will write Python code that:
- defines the function \(f\),
- starts from \((1, 10^8)\),
- iterates it 2017 times,
- then prints the minimum of the resulting pair.

This will help confirm the expected limit.

```python
# Function f: given (x, y), return ((x + y)/2, 2 / (1/x + 1/y))
def f(x, y):
    return ((x + y) / 2, 2 / (1 / x + 1 / y))

# Initial values
x, y = 1.0, 10**8

# Number of iterations
iterations = 2017

# Iterate f
for _ in range(iterations):
    x, y = f(x, y)

# Output the minimum of the pair after iterations
print("Minimum after iterations:", min(x, y))
# For conjecture, compare with the geometric mean
print("Geometric mean:", (1 * 10**8)**0.5)
```
