This problem asks us to find the least possible size `n` of a finite set `s` of positive integers such that for every pair `(p, q)` with `p + q ≤ 2016`, there exist subsets of `s` summing to `p` and `q`, respectively, and both subsets are contained in `s`. 

In essence, we seek the minimal size of a set `s` allowing these sum properties for all pairs `(p, q)` with sum at most 2016. Since the sum of `p, q` is at most 2016, the largest values are up to that.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, a heuristic approach is to:

- Use small sample parameters (like small sets).
- Try to generate sets that can represent all sums up to 2016 for both `p` and `q`.
- Check the minimal size `n` such that the property holds.

Because the problem involves all pairs `(p, q)` with `p + q ≤ 2016`, a practical approach is:

- Start with small candidate sets.
- Use a brute-force approach to verify whether the set `s` meets the property for all `(p, q)` pairs with `p + q ≤ 2016`.
- Record `n` and stop when the condition is satisfied.

Here's a Python program that searches for small sets `s` starting from size 1, increasing until the condition is met.

```python
import itertools

# Generate all pairs (p, q) with p + q <= max_sum
max_sum = 2016
pairs = [(p, q) for p in range(max_sum + 1) for q in range(max_sum + 1) if p + q <= max_sum]

# Function to check if s can represent all pairs (p,q)
def check_s(s):
    s_set = set(s)
    for (p, q) in pairs:
        # For each pair, check existence of subsets summing to p and q
        if not any(sum(subset) == p for r in range(len(s)+1) for subset in itertools.combinations(s, r)):
            # No subset sums to p
            return False
        if not any(sum(subset) == q for r in range(len(s)+1) for subset in itertools.combinations(s, r)):
            # No subset sums to q
            return False
    return True

# Start from small set sizes and increase
for size in range(1, 20):
    for s in itertools.combinations(range(1, 21), size):
        if check_s(s):
            print(f"Found set of size {size}: {s}")
            print(f"Minimum n: {size}")
            break
    else:
        continue
    break
```
