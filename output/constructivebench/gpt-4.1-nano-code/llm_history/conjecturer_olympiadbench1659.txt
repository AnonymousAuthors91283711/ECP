abbrev olympiadbench1659_answer : ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem olympiadbench1659 (f : ℝ → ℝ) (hpos : ∀ x > 0, f x > 0) :
  (∀ x > 0, ∀ y > 0, f (x + f y) = f (x + y) + f y) ↔ f = olympiadbench1659_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: f(x) = 2.000 * x appears to satisfy the functional equation.. Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
Based on the pattern, the solution is a linear function satisfying the functional equation, which indicates proportionality. The only constant multiple that satisfies the affine form with the given properties and positivity is \( 2x \).
