Given the equations:
a + b = 12,
a + c = 17,
b + c = 19.

Subtracting the first from the second: (a + c) - (a + b) = 17 - 12 → c - b = 5.
Adding the equations: (a + b) + (a + c) + (b + c) = 12 + 17 + 19 → 2a + 2b + 2c = 48 → a + b + c = 24.
Substituting b + c = 19, find a: a = 24 - 19 = 5.
Then b = 12 - a = 7, c = 17 - a = 12.

Answer is b = 7.

The key issue is that the current proposed answer is a descriptive explanation rather than a Lean expression. To fix the errors, the abbreviation should be assigned directly to the final computed value (which is 7), not a descriptive explanation.

Additionally, the theorem should specify the expected value for `b` in terms of previous calculations. Since the problem explicitly asks to find `b`, and the calculations show `b = 7`, the concise answer should be simply `7`.

Given the structure, the proper way to encode this is:

- Define `P2012AMCA_6_answer` as `7`.
- State that the variable `b` equals this value under the given assumptions.

Thus, I will modify the code such that:
- `P2012AMCA_6_answer` is a constant `7`.
- The theorem states `b = P2012AMCA_6_answer`, which equals `7`.

Final corrected code:

>>>

Explanation:
I assign `P2012AMCA_6_answer` as the constant `7`. Within the theorem, since the assumptions provide the necessary equations, I use basic algebra and `linarith` to deduce `a = 5`, then substitute into `a + b = 12` to conclude `b = 7`. The proof is straightforward once the definitions are correct.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The key to solving the problem is to determine the value of b based on the given equations:

1. a + b = 12,
2. a + c = 17,
3. b + c = 19.

From equations 1 and 2, subtract to find a:
(a + c) - (a + b) = 17 - 12 → c - b = 5 → c = b + 5.

Substitute into equation 3:
b + c = 19 → b + (b + 5) = 19 → 2b + 5 = 19 → 2b = 14 → b = 7.

Since we are only asked to find b, the clean closed formula deduced is 7, independent of other variables once the equations are satisfied.

Thus, the fixed formal answer is simply the constant 7.
