abbrev omnimath2931_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath2931 :
  ∃ (a b c : ℕ), 10 ≤ a ∧ a < 100 ∧ 10 ≤ b ∧ b < 100 ∧ 10 ≤ c ∧ c < 100 ∧
    a * b * c = 636405 ∧ a + b + c = omnimath2931_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: a=77, b=87, c=95 -> sum=259
a=77, b=95, c=87 -> sum=259
a=87, b=77, c=95 -> sum=259
a=87, b=95, c=77 -> sum=259
a=95, b=77, c=87 -> sum=259
a=95, b=87, c=77 -> sum=259. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern shows that the permutations of (77, 87, 95) give the same sum 259. Since the problem asks for the sum (a + b + c) over all such solutions with these constraints, the sum is invariant across permutations. Therefore, the closed-form answer is the constant sum 259.
