The problem appears to involve counting the number of specific triples `(t.1, t.2.1, t.2.2)` with set inclusion and union conditions over the set `S = {1, 2, ..., n}`. Assuming it asks for the count of such triples, the key is to understand the possible choices for `t.1`, `t.2.1`, `t.2.2`:

- `t.1` is a subset of `t.2.1`.
- The union of all three sets equals `S`.

Given `t.2.1` and `t.2.2` are arbitrary subsets, and `t.1` is a subset of `t.2.1`, the problem reduces to counting the number of configurations where:

- For each element in `S`, determine whether it is in `t.1`, `t.2.1 \ t.1`, `t.2.2 \ (t.2.1 ∪ t.1)`, or outside all three sets, with the union covering the entire `S`.

We want to enumerate possible counts for the set triple arrangements, and it’s akin to counting set partitions with constraints.

For simplicity, let's consider small `n`, say from 1 to 3, enumerate possibilities, and see the pattern, then define the formula accordingly.

```python
# Enumerate configurations for small n to conjecture the pattern
# For each element in S, there are 4 choices:
# 1. in t.1 only
# 2. in t.2.1 only (not in t.1)
# 3. in t.2.2 only (not in t.2.1 or t.1)
# 4. outside all (initially, to satisfy union, at least one element must be in the union)
# But since the union must be S, and each element must be in at least one of t.1, t.2.1, t.2.2, the options per element are:
# - in t.1
# - in t.2.1 but not t.1
# - in t.2.2 but not t.2.1
# - in all three sets indirectly or directly, considering the subset condition

# Simplify to four options per element:
# 1. in t.1 only
# 2. in t.2.1 only
# 3. in t.2.2 only
# 4. in all three to satisfy union

# For count, the total number of configurations for n elements is 4^n.

# Let's compute for n=1,2,3 and check the count.

for n in range(1, 4):
    total = 0
    from itertools import product
    choices = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
    for pattern in product(choices, repeat=n):
        # Check if union is S: needs at least one element in the union
        # For each element, determine sets it belongs to
        union_elements = set()
        valid = True
        for p in pattern:
            if p == 'a':
                # in t.1 only
                union_elements.add('t.1')
            elif p == 'b':
                # in t.2.1 only
                union_elements.add('t.2.1')
            elif p == 'c':
                # in t.2.2 only
                union_elements.add('t.2.2')
            elif p == 'd':
                # outside all sets
                pass
        # For union to be S = {1,...,n}, union must cover all elements
        # but since sets are over elements, we check per element
            
        # For each element, check if at least one set includes it
        # with the assigned pattern
        elements_cover = True
        for p in pattern:
            # if pattern == 'd', element is outside all -> can't cover all in union
            # but since 'd' means outside all sets, and union must be S, 
            # if any element is assigned 'd', entire union is missing that element
            # so invalid
            if p == 'd':
                elements_cover = False
                break
        if elements_cover:
            total += 1
            print(f"n={n}, pattern={pattern}, total so far={total}")
    print(f"Total configurations for n={n}: {total}")
```
