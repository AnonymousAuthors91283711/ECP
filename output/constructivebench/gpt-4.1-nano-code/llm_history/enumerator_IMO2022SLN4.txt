The problem appears to involve a number theory equation: \(a^p = b! + p\), where \(a, b, p\) are positive integers, with \(p\) prime. To explore solutions, I will choose small primes \(p\) (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7) and small \(b\) (say up to 20), and check whether \(a^p = b! + p\) has solutions, enumerating all feasible \(a\). I will print solutions as soon as they are found.

```python
# Generate solutions to a^p = b! + p for small primes p and small b.
import math

# List of small primes to check
primes = [2, 3, 5, 7]

# Upper bound for b
max_b = 20

# Initialize the result set
solutions = set()

for p in primes:
    for b in range(1, max_b + 1):
        target = math.factorial(b) + p
        # Since a^p = target, a = p-th root of target
        a_float = target ** (1 / p)
        a_candidate = round(a_float)
        # Check if a_candidate^p == target
        if a_candidate > 0 and a_candidate ** p == target:
            # Ensure a > 0, p > 0, b > 0, p prime
            print(f"Found solution: a={a_candidate}, b={b}, p={p}")
            solutions.add((a_candidate, b, p))
```
