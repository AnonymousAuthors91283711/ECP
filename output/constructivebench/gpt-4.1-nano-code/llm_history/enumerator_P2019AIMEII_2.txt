Let's analyze the recurrence relations and behavior of `probVisits7` to enumerate possible answers for `probVisits7 7`. The sequence is defined as follows:

```
probVisits7 0 = 0
probVisits7 1 = 1
probVisits7 2 = 1
For n â‰¥ 3: probVisits7 n = (probVisits7 (n-1) + probVisits7 (n-2)) / 2
```

This recurrence resembles the Fibonacci sequence but with averaging, so let's compute `probVisits7` values step-by-step for n=3 to 7, and then identify the simplified fraction at n=7.

Given the initial values:
probVisits7 0=0
probVisits7 1=1
probVisits7 2=1

Compute further:

probVisits7 3 = (probVisits7 2 + probVisits7 1)/2 = (1 + 1)/2 = 1
probVisits7 4 = (probVisits7 3 + probVisits7 2)/2 = (1 + 1)/2=1
probVisits7 5 = (probVisits7 4 + probVisits7 3)/2 = (1 + 1)/2=1
probVisits7 6 = (probVisits7 5 + probVisits7 4)/2= (1 + 1)/2=1
probVisits7 7 = (probVisits7 6 + probVisits7 5)/2= (1 + 1)/2=1

Hence, the sequence stabilizes at 1 from n=3 onward.

So, probVisits7 7 = 1 = 1/1, and the coprimality is trivial. The answer is (p, q) = (1, 1).

Now, translating this into code that automatically computes and outputs this answer:

```python
# This program computes probVisits7 at n=7 based on the recurrence, and outputs the fraction in lowest terms.
from math import gcd

def prob_visits7(n):
    # Base cases
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n in (1, 2):
        return 1
    # Use iterative approach to avoid recursion overhead
    a, b, c = 0, 1, 1  # probVisits7(0), (1), (2)
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        c = (b + a) / 2
        a, b = b, c
    return c

# Compute at n=7
value = prob_visits7(7)

# Convert to fraction
from fractions import Fraction
frac = Fraction(value).limit_denominator()

p, q = frac.numerator, frac.denominator

# Output numerator and denominator
print(f"({p}, {q})")
# Verify coprimality
assert gcd(p, q) == 1
```
