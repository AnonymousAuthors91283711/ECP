This problem defines a set of functions a: Fin 5 → ℝ, with a constraint involving sums over i with a parameter k in [1,5]. The goal is to evaluate a sum at a particular value (k=37). Since the explicit solution isn't provided, the approach is to consider numerical experimentation for small sample parameters, especially focusing on the dependence of the sum condition and the sum at k=37.

Given the structure, a practical way is to iterate over plausible values of a, satisfying the constraint approximately for small k (like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), then compute the sum at k=37.

In code, we'll:
- Generate candidate vectors a (consider small rational or float values).
- Check if they approximately satisfy the sum conditions for k=1..5.
- For candidates that do, calculate the sum at k=37.
- Print the candidates and their sums for conjecture.
- Limit enumeration to keep output under 400 tokens.

```python
import itertools

# Explore small float values for a_i
candidate_values = [0, 0.1, -0.1, 0.5, -0.5, 1, -1, 2, -2]
results = []

# Generate candidate a vectors with some small combination to keep computation reasonable
for a in itertools.product(candidate_values, repeat=5):
    # Check the sum condition for k=1..5
    satisfies = True
    for k in range(1,6):
        total = 0
        for i, ai in enumerate(a):
            denom = k**2 + i + 1  # i.1 as 1-based index
            total += ai / denom
        # Allow small numerical error
        if abs(total - 1 / k**2) > 0.05:
            satisfies = False
            break
    if satisfies:
        # Compute sum at k=37
        sum_37 = 0
        for i, ai in enumerate(a):
            denom = 37 + i + 1
            sum_37 += ai / denom
        print(f"a={a}, sum at k=37={sum_37}")
        results.append((a, sum_37))
```
