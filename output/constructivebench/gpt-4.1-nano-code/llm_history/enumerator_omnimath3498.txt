The problem appears to involve finding the least natural number `n > 0` such that `SteveMoney n > WayneMoney n`, and for all smaller `k < n`, `SteveMoney k ≤ WayneMoney k`. To assist in conjecturing and proving the exact answer, I will write a Python script that enumerates small sample functions for `SteveMoney` and `WayneMoney`, then searches for the minimal `n` satisfying the property.

The code will:
- Define functions `SteveMoney` and `WayneMoney`.
- Search through small values of `n`.
- For each `n`, check if `n > 0`, `SteveMoney n > WayneMoney n`, and for all `k < n`, `SteveMoney k ≤ WayneMoney k`.
- Stream answers immediately upon discovery.

Note: To maximize generality and efficiency, I will consider simple sample functions (like linear functions), avoiding hardcoded answers or advanced heuristics.

```python
# Enumerate small functions for SteveMoney and WayneMoney
def SteveMoney(n):
    # Example: increasing function
    return n  # linear, could modify for variety

def WayneMoney(n):
    # Example: slightly smaller than SteveMoney
    return n - 1 if n > 0 else 0

# Search parameters
max_n = 50

for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
    if SteveMoney(n) > WayneMoney(n):
        # Check if all k < n satisfy the condition
        if all(SteveMoney(k) <= WayneMoney(k) for k in range(n)):
            print(n)
```

This code:
- Tests for the smallest `n` where `SteveMoney n > WayneMoney n`.
- Validates that prior to `n`, for all `k`, `SteveMoney k ≤ WayneMoney k`.
- Streams each answer as soon as it fulfills the criteria.

You can modify `SteveMoney` and `WayneMoney` functions to explore different scenarios, but this setup is efficient, straightforward, and suitable for high-school level conjecture exploration.
