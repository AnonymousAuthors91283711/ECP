[write_program]
The problem appears to be a mathematical question involving properties of matrices over integers mod 2, particularly about the existence of a set of matrices with specific orthogonality and non-orthogonality conditions. To help form conjectures, I will write a Python program that enumerates small matrices over ℤ/2ℤ (i.e., over {0,1}) and checks the conditions for various matrix sizes n, focusing on small values of n.

Specifically:
- For each n (say 1 to 5), enumerate all possible matrices of size n×n with entries 0 or 1.
- Check if there exists a collection of such matrices satisfying:
  - For each matrix M_i, (M_i @ M_i) % 2 == 0 (rows orthogonal to themselves).
  - For i ≠ j, (M_i @ M_j) % 2 == 1.
- Print each compatible set found immediately to assist in conjectures about the minimal n where such matrices exist.

Because the total number of matrices grows exponentially with n, limit enumeration up to n=4 or 5 for tractability.

```python
import itertools
import numpy as np

def matrix_over_GF2(n, entries):
    """Create an n x n matrix over GF(2) from a list of entries."""
    return np.array(entries, dtype=int).reshape((n, n)) % 2

def check_matrices(matrices):
    """Check if the set of matrices satisfies the conditions."""
    for i, Mi in enumerate(matrices):
        if not np.all((Mi @ Mi) % 2 == 0):
            return False
        for j, Mj in enumerate(matrices):
            if i != j and not np.all((Mi @ Mj) % 2 == 1):
                return False
    return True

# Enumerate small matrices over GF(2)
max_n = 4
for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
    total_matrices = 2 ** (n * n)
    print(f"Checking for n={n}, total matrices: {total_matrices}")
    # Generate all possible matrices
    all_matrices = []
    for entries in itertools.product([0, 1], repeat=n*n):
        M = matrix_over_GF2(n, entries)
        all_matrices.append(M)
    found_sets = []
    # For small n, limit the number of sets checked
    # to manage runtime; pick a subset or small combinations
    for size in range(1, 4):  # attempt sets of size 1 to 3
        for subset in itertools.combinations(all_matrices, size):
            if check_matrices(subset):
                # Immediately print the set of matrices
                print(f"Found compatible set for n={n}, size={size}:")
                for idx, mat in enumerate(subset):
                    print(f"Matrix {idx+1}:\n{mat}")
                print("-" * 20)
                # Store or break based on needs; here, just continue
```
