The problem involves a theorem in Lean related to real numbers x and y, with a hypothesis stating two equalities: 2 + x = x + y and x + y = y + 5. From these, we need to determine the value of x - y.

Since the equalities involve real number addition which is commutative, the main task is to understand the implications of the equalities and then find x - y.

Let's analyze the equations:
1. 2 + x = x + y ⇒ subtract x: 2 = y
2. x + y = y + 5 ⇒ subtract y: x = 5

From these, x = 5 and y = 2, so:
x - y = 5 - 2 = 3

The answer is 3, a straightforward exact value. The code can verify this by enumerating small possible solutions consistent with the equations and then outputting the difference.

```python
# The following program finds the value of x - y based on the equations given.
# Since the equations are straightforward, we derive the solution algebraically,
# but we will also enumerate small sample solutions consistent with the equations.

for y in range(-10, 11):          # small sample of y values
    x = y + 3                      # from x + y = y + 5 => x = 5 (corrected)
    # check if equations hold
    if (2 + x == x + y) and (x + y == y + 5):
        print(f"x = {x}, y = {y}, x - y = {x - y}")
        # Based on the equations, x = 5, y = 2; so this should print x - y = 3
```

This code enumerates small integer solutions, confirms the equations, and immediately outputs the difference; the derived value is 3.
