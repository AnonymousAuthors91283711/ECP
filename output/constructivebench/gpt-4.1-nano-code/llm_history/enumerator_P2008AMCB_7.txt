The given theorem involves an expression where the squared difference terms are symmetric and likely cancel out. To assist in conjecturing the value of `P2008AMCB_7_answer`, we need to examine the expression: `((x - y)^2 - (y - x)^2)^2`.

Note that `(x - y)^2` and `(y - x)^2` are equal since `(x - y)^2 = (y - x)^2`. Thus, their difference should be zero, and squaring zero remains zero.

Our goal: enumerate possible outcomes of `((x - y)^2 - (y - x)^2)^2` for various `(x, y)` pairs.

Following the requirements:

- Stream results immediately.
- Use small sample values.
- Keep output under 400 tokens.

Let's try small integer pairs `(x, y)`.

```python
# Since (x - y)^2 == (y - x)^2, the difference should be 0,
# so ((x - y)^2 - (y - x)^2)^2 should always be 0.
# Let's verify for small integer pairs.

for x in range(-3, 4):
    for y in range(-3, 4):
        diff = ((x - y)**2) - ((y - x)**2)
        result = diff**2
        print(f"x={x}, y={y} => ((x - y)^2 - (y - x)^2)^2 = {result}")
```

This code outputs results for small `(x, y)` pairs. Since `(x - y)^2` always equals `(y - x)^2`, the difference is zero, and thus the squared difference is always zero.

```python
# Final enumerator code:

for x in range(-5, 6):
    for y in range(-5, 6):
        diff = ((x - y)**2) - ((y - x)**2)
        result = diff**2
        print(f"x={x}, y={y} => ((x - y)^2 - (y - x)^2)^2 = {result}")
```
