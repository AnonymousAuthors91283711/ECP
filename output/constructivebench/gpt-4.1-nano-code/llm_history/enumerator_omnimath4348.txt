This problem involves solving a cyclic system of equations of the form:

x + x^{-3} = 2y
y + y^{-3} = 2z
z + z^{-3} = 2w
w + w^{-3} = 2x

with the constraints that none of x, y, z, w are zero.

The key insight is the symmetry and the cyclic nature, suggesting that solutions might repeat or be symmetric, i.e., x = y = z = w. In particular, consider the case where all variables are equal, say x = y = z = w = t ≠ 0.

Substituting into any one of the equations:
t + t^{-3} = 2t
=> t + t^{-3} - 2t = 0
=> -t + t^{-3} = 0
=> t^{-3} = t
=> 1 / t^3 = t
=> 1 = t^4
=> t^4 = 1
=> t = ±1 (since real solutions)

Check these solutions:
- For t = 1:
  Left side: 1 + 1^{-3} = 1 + 1 = 2
  Right side: 2 * 1 = 2
  Conditions satisfied.

- For t = -1:
  Left side: -1 + (-1)^{-3} = -1 + (-1)^{-3} = -1 + -1 = -2
  Right side: 2 * -1 = -2
  Conditions satisfied.

Because of the symmetry, these should extend to all variables, giving (x,y,z,w) = (1, 1, 1, 1) and (-1, -1, -1, -1).

Next, check for other solutions with different values:
- For non-equal solutions, more complex algebra or numerical approximation could be used, but the symmetry and constraints mainly suggest the solutions are these, considering the cyclic structure.

We'll enumerate these solutions directly, considering both ±1, and verify the constraints.

```python
# Enumerate solutions with symmetric assumptions: all variables equal ±1
solutions = [(1, 1, 1, 1), (-1, -1, -1, -1)]

for sol in solutions:
    print(sol)
```
