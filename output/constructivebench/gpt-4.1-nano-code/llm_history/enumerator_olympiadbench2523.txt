The problem involves finding the set of points (x, y) in ℝ² satisfying:
- x * (1/2 + y - 2x²) = 0
- y * (5/2 + x - y) = 0

Analyze each factor:
- For the first: either x = 0 or 1/2 + y - 2x² = 0
- For the second: either y = 0 or 5/2 + x - y = 0

We will enumerate all cases combinations:
1) x=0, y=0
2) x=0, y satisfying 5/2 + x - y=0
3) x satisfying 1/2 + y - 2x²=0, y=0
4) x satisfying 1/2 + y - 2x²=0, y satisfying 5/2 + x - y=0

We will iterate over small sample x, y values for the case where variables are defined by equations.

```python
# Enumerate solutions for the specified equations
def main():
    solutions = set()

    # 1) x=0, y=0
    solutions.add((0, 0))
    print((0, 0))

    # 2) x=0, y from y=5/2 + 0 - y => y=5/2 + 0 - y => 2y=5/2 => y=5/4
    y_case = 5/4
    solutions.add((0, y_case))
    print((0, y_case))

    # 3) y=0, from 1/2 + y - 2x^2=0 => 1/2 + 0 - 2x^2=0 => 2x^2=1/2 => x^2=1/4 => x=±1/2
    for x_val in [0.5, -0.5]:
        solutions.add((x_val, 0))
        print((x_val, 0))

    # 4) For 1/2 + y - 2x^2=0 => y=2x^2 - 1/2
    # and y=5/2 + x - y => 2y=5/2 + x => y=(5/4 + x/2)

    # Let's approximate solutions for x in small range and compute y from both equations
    for x in [i/10 for i in range(-20, 21)]:  # x in [-2, 2]
        y1 = 2 * x**2 - 0.5
        y2 = 2 * (5/4 + x/2)
        # For solutions, they must satisfy both equations (within a small tolerance)
        if abs(y1 - y2) < 1e-6:
            solutions.add((x, y1))
            print((x, y1))
        # Also check the possibility that y=0 already covered, skip to avoid duplicates

main()
```
