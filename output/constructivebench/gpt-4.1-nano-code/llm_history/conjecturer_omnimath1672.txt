. Enumerated answers: Exponent of 3 in 2007!: 1000
Exponent of 223 in 2007!: 9
The greatest n such that 2007^n divides 2007! is: 9. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The maximum n for which 2007^n divides 2007! is limited by the smallest prime exponent in its factorization, which is 223 with an exponent of 9. Therefore, the answer is 9.
