This problem involves evaluating the expression `(1000 / 2) * 1 - (1000 / 5) * 2`. To assist with verification, I'll write a Python script that enumerates possible answers (exact rational or decimal). Since the expression involves straightforward arithmetic, I'll perform the calculations directly, but I will generate all possible candidates for the values involved (if parameters involved or rounding were more complex). Here, parameters are fixed, so enumeration is trivial, but I'll demonstrate the approach by computing all candidates and printing results as they are found.

```python
# This script calculates the expression and prints the exact result.
# As the problem involves fixed parameters, it simply evaluates the expression.
# For demonstration, suppose we consider some small parameter variations,
# but here, parameters are fixed, so the enumeration is straightforward.

# Parameters
a1_values = [1000 / 2]
a2_values = [1000 / 5]

# Enumerate all possible candidates for the answer if parameters vary.
# In this case, parameters are fixed, but we simulate enumeration over small variations (for demonstration).
for a1 in a1_values:
    for a2 in a2_values:
        candidate = a1 * 1 - a2 * 2
        print(candidate)
```
