This problem appears to involve a probability distribution over the numbers 1 through 6, with certain joint probabilities, and asks for the sum of two coprime integers \( m \) and \( n \) that satisfy a specific sum involving a sum over these joint probabilities. The task is to determine the value of `P2016AIMEI_2_answer` based on this probability setup.

Distinctive points:
- Probabilities are proportional to the values 1 to 6.
- The total weight is the sum of these weights, which is 21.
- Normalized probabilities give uniform probabilities over 1-6.
- The joint probability is the product of the normalized probabilities for \( a \) and \( b \).
- The sum involves pairs \( (x, 7 - x) \) for \( x \) in 0 to 6.
- Only \( x=1 \) to 6 contribute since the probability is zero outside 1..6.

So, for each \( x \in 1..6 \):
- The probability \( prob_x = x/21 \).
- The joint probability \( joint_prob(x, 7 - x) = (x/21) * ((7 - x)/21) \).

Sum these joint probabilities over \( x=1..6 \).

Calculating:
\[ \sum_{x=1}^6 \frac{x(7 - x)}{441} \]

We enumerate these explicitly in code.

```python
# This code computes the sum over x=1..6 of the joint probabilities and returns m/n with m, n coprime
def main():
    total_weight = 21  # sum of 1..6
    sum_prob = 0
    for x in range(1,7):
        numerator = x * (7 - x)
        sum_prob += numerator
        print(f"x={x}, numerator={numerator}")
    n = total_weight * total_weight  # denominator is 441
    m = sum_prob
    # Check for coprimality and reduce if necessary
    from math import gcd
    g = gcd(m, n)
    m //= g
    n //= g
    print(f"sum of joint probabilities numerator: {m}")
    print(f"sum of joint probabilities denominator: {n}")
    # The sum is m/n, and the sum m + n will be returned
    answer_sum = m + n
    print(f"Answer: m + n = {answer_sum}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
