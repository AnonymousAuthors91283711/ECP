The problem appears to relate to combinatorics and bijections between functions with certain difference properties. To support conjecture, I will enumerate small N and explicitly construct functions T with the stated properties. I'll test for the maximum N such that the conditions can hold, and keep track of the greatest N encountered where the properties are satisfied. Since a maximum N is asked, I will check increasing N until the properties fail or reach a threshold, then output the maximum N found.

```python
# Enumerate possible N values to find the greatest N satisfying the conditions
# Note: The conditions involve a bijective T for each r, and a certain difference property.

# Since direct validation of such a complex property might be non-trivial,
# we make heuristic assumptions and rely on small sample enumerations.

# The key points:
# - For each N, attempt to construct T: Fin N -> Fin 100 -> Fin 100
# - T(r) must be bijective (a permutation)
# - For all r â‰  s, there must exist c such that the values at c differ by more than 1

# Approach:
# - For small N, generate permutations of length N (since T(r) is a permutation)
# - For each set of permutations for r in [0..N-1], check the difference condition

import itertools
from math import prod

max_N_tested = 0
max_N_found = 0

# Set a max N to test up to, say 15 for computational feasibility
for N in range(1, 16):
    # Generate all permutations of size N from 0..99
    perms = list(itertools.permutations(range(100), N))
    success = False

    # For small N, try some combinations (not all permutations to limit runtime)
    # Randomly sample a subset of permutations for testing
    sample_perms = perms[:min(20, len(perms))]
    # Generate all combinations of T(r)
    for T_combination in itertools.product(sample_perms, repeat=N):
        # T(r): permutation of size N
        # Check conditions:
        # 1) T(r) are permutations: guaranteed since permutations sampled from perms
        # 2) For all r != s, check if there exists a c with difference > 1
        valid = True
        for r in range(N):
            for s in range(r+1, N):
                # Check if exists c with difference > 1
                if not any(abs(T_combination[r][c] - T_combination[s][c]) > 1 for c in range(N)):
                    valid = False
                    break
            if not valid:
                break
        if valid:
            max_N_found = N
            print(f"Found suitable T for N={N}")
            success = True
            break
    if not success:
        # No configuration found for this N, stop searching higher N
        break

print(f"Maximum N satisfying the conditions: {max_N_found}")
```
