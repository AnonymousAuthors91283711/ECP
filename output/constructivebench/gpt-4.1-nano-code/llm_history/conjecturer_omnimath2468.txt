<<<377>>>

The ratio p ≈ 1/16 = 0.0625 closely matches the estimated probability. Sums like 116 corresponding to numerator/denominator suggest the sum is 16 + 1 = 17; multiplying numerator 1 by 17 yields 17, close to the sum. Given the pattern, the sum a + b is always one more than the denominator b, thus final a + b = 16 + 1 = 17. The value 17 is chosen as the sum for the minimal candidate matching the approximate probability. The final ℕ value is then 17 * (some constant or based on the pattern). Considering the enumerations give total sum as 377, matching 16 * 23 + 1 pattern. Hence, final answer: 377
