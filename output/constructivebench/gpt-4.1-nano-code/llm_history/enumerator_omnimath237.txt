This problem appears to involve finding integer solutions (a, b, c) satisfying the equation:

a² + b² + c² = a² * b²

We want to enumerate solutions of this equation for small integers, possibly to understand the structure of solutions and conjecture the set `omnimath237_answer`.

Let's analyze the equation:
a² + b² + c² = a² * b²

Rearranged:
a² * b² - a² - b² = c²

Or:
c² = a² b² - a² - b²

To find integer solutions, we can:
- Iterate over small integer values of a and b
- Compute c² and check if it's a perfect square
- Store solutions where c is integer

---

We will set small bounds, e.g., |a|, |b| ≤ 10, and generate solutions accordingly. For each valid triplet, we'll immediately print and store in a set.

Here's the code:

```python
import math

# Initialize set for solutions
solutions = set()

# Enumerate over small integer ranges
for a in range(-10, 11):
    for b in range(-10, 11):
        # Avoid zero in denominator to prevent division by zero if needed
        # But here, no division, just plug in values
        lhs = a * a * b * b - a * a - b * b
        if lhs < 0:
            continue  # c² can't be negative
        c = math.isqrt(lhs)
        if c * c == lhs:
            # Store the solution tuple with sorted order for consistency
            triplet = (a, b, c)
            print(f"Found solution: {triplet}")
            solutions.add(triplet)
```

This code will output solutions as soon as they are found, enumerates all small candidate solutions efficiently, and prints them immediately to assist in formulating conjectures.
