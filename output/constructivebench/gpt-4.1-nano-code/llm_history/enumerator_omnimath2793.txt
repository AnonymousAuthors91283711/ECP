The problem involves solving for \(\frac{a}{b}\) given the equation \(\frac{a+b}{a-b} = 3\), with the condition \(a \neq b\). The goal is to find all possible values of \(\frac{a}{b}\) satisfying this relation without hardcoding the answer, streaming solutions, and ensuring we test plausible values.

We analyze the equation:

\[
\frac{a + b}{a - b} = 3 \Rightarrow a + b = 3(a - b) \Rightarrow a + b = 3a - 3b
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
a + b = 3a - 3b \Rightarrow a + b - 3a + 3b = 0 \Rightarrow -2a + 4b = 0 \Rightarrow 2a = 4b \Rightarrow a = 2b
\]

Thus, for any \(b \neq 0\), \(a = 2b\), and the ratio:

\[
\frac{a}{b} = 2
\]

Since the relation holds for any \(b \neq 0\), the only candidate is \(\boxed{2}\).

The code will verify this by enumerating sample pairs \((a, b)\) with \(b \neq 0\), checking the relation, and printing the resulting ratios.

```python
# Enumerate candidate (a, b) pairs with small sample values
# and verify the relation to find all possible a/b ratio.
for b in range(-10, 11):
    if b == 0:
        continue
    for a_factor in [1, 2, 3, -1, -2, -3]:
        a = a_factor * b
        # Check the condition (a + b) / (a - b) = 3
        numerator = a + b
        denominator = a - b
        if denominator != 0:
            ratio = a / b
            value = numerator / denominator
            if abs(value - 3) < 1e-8:
                print(f"a={a}, b={b}, a/b={ratio}")
                # The ratio should be 2 for valid solutions
```
