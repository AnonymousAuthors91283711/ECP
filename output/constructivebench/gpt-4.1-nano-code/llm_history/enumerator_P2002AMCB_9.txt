This problem appears to involve establishing a relationship between four positive real numbers \(a, b, c, d\) under arithmetic and geometric progression constraints. The goal is to find the value of \(\frac{a}{d}\).

Given the constraints:
- \(b - a = c - b\) (arithmetic progression)
- \(b / a = d / b\) (geometric progression)

We want to generate candidate values that satisfy these conditions, perhaps by fixing some parameters and computing corresponding values.

Here's a simplified approach:
- Let \(a = 1\) (small sample value), then
- From the arithmetic progression: \(c = 2b - a = 2b - 1\)
- From the geometric progression: \(b / a = d / b \Rightarrow d = b^2 / a = b^2\)

Since \(a=1\):
- \(c = 2b - 1\)
- \(d = b^2\)

We need all these to be positive, so \(b > 0\) and \(2b - 1 > 0 \Rightarrow b > 0.5\).

Let's enumerate over a range of \(b\) values greater than 0.5, and compute \(a, c, d, \frac{a}{d}\). We will output each result as soon as it's computed.

```python
# Enumeration for parameters satisfying the constraints
# Fix a small range of b > 0.5 to generate candidate solutions
for b in [0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5]:
    a = 1.0  # fixed small sample value
    c = 2 * b - a  # from arithmetic progression
    d = b ** 2       # from geometric progression
    # If all are positive, output the ratio a/d
    if a > 0 and c > 0 and d > 0:
        ratio = a / d
        print(f"b={b:.2f}, a={a:.2f}, c={c:.2f}, d={d:.2f}, a/d={ratio:.4f}")
```
