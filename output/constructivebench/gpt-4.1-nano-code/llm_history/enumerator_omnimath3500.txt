This problem involves reasoning about relationships between Janice's age at different times, given constraints:

- `Janice_now` is her current age.
- `Janice_2yearsago` is her age two years ago.
- `Janice_12years` is her age twelve years from now.
- The relation `Janice_12years = 8 * Janice_2yearsago` must hold.

From the provided equalities:
- `hJanice_2yearsago : Janice_2yearsago = Janice_now - 2`
- `hJanice_12years : Janice_12years = Janice_now + 12`

Substituting these:
`Janice_now + 12 = 8 * (Janice_now - 2)`

Expanding:
`Janice_now + 12 = 8 * Janice_now - 16`

Rearranged:
`8 * Janice_now - Janice_now = 12 + 16`
`7 * Janice_now = 28`
`Janice_now = 4`

Given that, the age 2 years ago:
`Janice_2yearsago = 4 - 2 = 2`

And
`Janice_12years = 4 + 12 = 16`

The relation (`Janice_12years = 8 * Janice_2yearsago`) is verified:
`16 = 8 * 2` â†’ true

We see that the solution is unique for `Janice_now = 4`.

Now, I will write a Python script to explore similar relationships and verify this solution, especially to find the `omnimath3500_answer` if multiple solutions or bounds are involved.

```python
# Exploring the age relationship:
# Janice_12years = 8 * Janice_2yearsago
# with Janice_2yearsago = Janice_now - 2
# and Janice_12years = Janice_now + 12
# We solve for Janice_now: Janice_now + 12 = 8 * (Janice_now - 2)

solutions = []

for Janice_now in range(0, 101):  # arbitrary age range for exploration
    Janice_2yearsago = Janice_now - 2
    Janice_12years = Janice_now + 12
    if Janice_12years == 8 * Janice_2yearsago:
        solutions.append(Janice_now)
        print(f"Found solution: Janice_now = {Janice_now}")

# The program outputs the solution(s), which should be Janice_now=4.

# Determine the answer for the theorem:
if solutions:
    omnimath3500_answer_value = solutions[0]  # unique solution
else:
    # If no solutions, set to None or some indicator
    omnimath3500_answer_value = None

print(f"omnimath3500_answer = {omnimath3500_answer_value}")
```
