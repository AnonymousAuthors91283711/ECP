Total count of valid patterns: 6. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The patterns repeat every 7, with specific positions fixed as 0 or 1, allowing for 3 positions free per pattern. Counting the free positions: each pattern has 4 positions with 2 choices each, leading to 2⁴ options. Therefore, total solutions: 6 patterns × 2⁴ = 96. The count is constant and independent of n, so:

<<<96>>>
