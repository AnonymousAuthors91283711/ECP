Considering the recurrence relations and initial conditions, both sequences involve terms that grow or decay exponentially based on the relations. The differences in reciprocal terms suggest telescoping, leading to a constant sum, which aligns with a specific finite value. The pattern and initial values imply the total sum converges to 4.
