The problem appears to be a formal mathematical theorem involving functions on natural numbers, factorials, and divisibility conditions. To assist in conjecturing or proving the theorem, I will generate candidate functions \(f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}\) that satisfy the specified properties:

1. \(f(n!) = (f(n))!\),
2. For all \(m \neq n\), \(m - n \mid f(m) - f(n)\).

A natural approach is to explore simple functions such as linear functions \(f(n) = a n + b\) or constant functions, check the divisibility conditions, and see which functions satisfy the recursive factorial condition.

Given the code constraints, I'll generate small candidate functions with small parameters and check their compliance with the properties. Since the problem seeks a set of functions, I will enumerate:

- Constant functions \(f(n) = c\),
- Linear functions \(f(n) = a n + b\) for small \(a, b\),
- Possibly other simple functions derived from the properties.

Because the problem involves factorials, notice that:

- The factorial growth and the divisibility conditions can significantly restrict candidate functions,
- Constant and linear functions are good starting points.

I will code these checks efficiently, generate candidate functions, and print those satisfying the recursive factorial condition and divisibility condition.

```python
# Program to enumerate small candidate functions f: ℕ→ℕ that satisfy the given properties.

# Check if f satisfies f(n!) = (f n)!
def factorial_property(f, n):
    from math import factorial
    return f(factorial(n)) == factorial(f(n))

# Check if for all m ≠ n, m - n divides f(m) - f(n)
def divisibility_property(f, max_check=10):
    for m in range(1, max_check):
        for n in range(1, max_check):
            if m != n:
                diff = f(m) - f(n)
                diff_mn = m - n
                if diff % diff_mn != 0:
                    return False
    return True

# Candidate functions: constants and linear
functions = []

# Constant functions c
for c in range(0, 5):
    def f_const(n, c=c):
        return c
    if factorial_property(f_const, 1) and divisibility_property(f_const):
        print(f"Constant function: f(n) = {c}")
        functions.append(f_const)

# Linear functions a n + b
for a in range(0, 3):
    for b in range(0, 5):
        def f_linear(n, a=a, b=b):
            return a * n + b
        if factorial_property(f_linear, 1) and divisibility_property(f_linear):
            print(f"Linear function: f(n) = {a}*n + {b}")
            functions.append(f_linear)
```
