theorem P2016AMCB_5 : 
  (4 + 919) % 7 = P2016AMCB_5_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 6. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern in enumerated answers suggests testing small values. Since the expression is (4 + 919) % 7, compute directly: 923 % 7 = 6. The answer is a constant, satisfying the modular relation.
