Ground Truth Answer: 246
Proposed Answer: 3
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the minimal value of f(1) + f(2) where f is a function from integers to integers satisfying:
   - A specific functional equation
   - Positivity condition (f(n) > 0 for n > 0)
   - A condition about f(2015)*f(2016) being a perfect square

2. The ground truth answer is 246, which suggests the function has relatively large values at f(1) and f(2).

3. The proposed answer is 3, which would imply very small function values (like f(1)=1 and f(2)=2).

4. The functional equation is quite complex, but the proposed answer of 3 seems too small given the constraints, especially considering the condition about f(2015)*f(2016) being a perfect square.

5. There's no obvious simple linear function that would satisfy all conditions and give such small values.
