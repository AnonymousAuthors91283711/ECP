The given problem appears to involve solving a system of equations parameterized by z, with variables x and y. The equations are symmetric and polynomial in form, and the task is to determine x explicitly in terms of the parameter z. Due to the symmetry between x and y, it might be useful to consider particular values of z or specific candidate solutions.

Given the constraints:
1. \((1 + z)(x + y) = (1 - z + z^2)(x^2 - xy + y^2)\)
2. \((3 - z)(x - y) = (9 + 3z + z^2)(x^2 + xy + y^2)\)

We can attempt to eliminate y or analyze particular cases like \(y = x\) or \(y = -x\), then look for consistent solutions.

Below is a Python script that:
- Chooses fixed small sample values for z.
- Enumerates candidate values of x and y within a small range.
- Checks if these candidates satisfy both equations within a tolerance.
- Prints solution candidates immediately as found, focussing on solutions that satisfy the equations.

This approach can help observe patterns, approximate solutions, or conjecture the closed-form answer.

```python
# Enumerate small candidate solutions for (x, y) given specific parameter z
import math

# Define a small tolerance for floating point comparison
TOL = 1e-6

# Sample z-values to analyze
z_values = [0, 1, -1, 0.5, -0.5]

# Range for candidate x, y
candidate_range = [i * 0.25 for i in range(-20, 21)]  # from -5 to 5 in steps of 0.25

for z in z_values:
    print(f"Analyzing for z = {z}")
    for x in candidate_range:
        for y in candidate_range:
            # Compute both sides of the first equation
            lhs1 = (1 + z) * (x + y)
            rhs1 = (1 - z + z**2) * (x**2 - x*y + y**2)
            # Compute both sides of the second equation
            lhs2 = (3 - z) * (x - y)
            rhs2 = (9 + 3*z + z**2) * (x**2 + x*y + y**2)

            if (abs(lhs1 - rhs1) < TOL) and (abs(lhs2 - rhs2) < TOL):
                print(f"Solution candidate: x = {x:.2f}, y = {y:.2f} for z = {z}")
```

This code systematically searches for approximate solutions (since exact symbolic solutions can be complicated). It can be extended or refined later for more precise algebraic insight. The immediate feedback of candidate solutions greatly aids in conjecture.
