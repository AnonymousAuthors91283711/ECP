theorem omnimath2798 (x y : ℕ) (hxy : x * y = 24) (hdiff : x - y = 5) : x + y = omnimath2798_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found pair (x=8, y=3) with sum 11. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the enumerated pair, where (x=8, y=3) and their sum is 11, and given the equations x * y = 24 and x - y = 5, the sum x + y is constant at 11. Therefore, the answer in closed form, independent of variables, is 11.
