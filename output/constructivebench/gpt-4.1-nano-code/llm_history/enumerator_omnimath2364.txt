The problem involves analyzing a quadratic equation in r depending on θ: \( (\sin \theta) r^2 + (\cos \theta + \tan \theta) r + 1 = 0 \). The question asks when there exists a unique solution for r, i.e., when the quadratic has exactly one root, implying the discriminant is zero. We need to characterize \(\sin \theta\) such that the quadratic has a unique root, and then collect all such \(\sin \theta\).

Approach:
1. For given \(\theta\), the quadratic has a unique root iff its discriminant \( D = b^2 - 4ac \) is zero.
2. The coefficients are \(a = \sin \theta\), \(b = \cos \theta + \tan \theta\), \(c = 1\).
3. Compute discriminant \(D\) in terms of \(\theta\), then find the set of \(\sin \theta\) where \(D=0\).

Let's implement a numerical approach:
- Sample small angles \(\theta\) in \([0, 2\pi)\).
- For each \(\theta\), check if the discriminant is close to zero.
- Find the corresponding \(\sin \theta\). 
- Collect these \(\sin \theta\) values to form an approximation of \(\omnimath2364_answer\).

```python
import math

# Set parameters for sampling
num_samples = 1000
theta_values = [2 * math.pi * i / num_samples for i in range(num_samples)]
answer_set = set()

for theta in theta_values:
    sin_t = math.sin(theta)
    cos_t = math.cos(theta)
    # Compute tan(θ), handle potential division by zero
    tan_t = math.tan(theta)
    b = cos_t + tan_t
    a = sin_t
    c = 1
    discriminant = b ** 2 - 4 * a * c
    # Check if discriminant is close to zero
    if abs(discriminant) < 1e-8:
        answer_set.add(round(sin_t, 8))
        print(f"Theta: {theta:.4f}, sin(θ): {sin_t:.4f}, discriminant: {discriminant:.2e}")

# Output the collected sin θ values
print("Approximate answers for sin θ where quadratic has exactly one solution:")
for val in sorted(answer_set):
    print(f"sin θ ≈ {val}")
```
