[write_program]
This problem involves verifying or exploring the value of a simple rational expression. The expression is (8 : â„š) / (5 + 7 + 8). To help conjecture and verify the answer, we can write a Python program that enumerates the exact rational result of this expression, printing it immediately when found.

Since the calculation is straightforward, the key is to demonstrate how the exact value of this rational number can be computed and confirmed.

```python
# Program to verify the rational expression (8/1) / (5 + 7 + 8)

# Calculate numerator and denominator separately
numerator = 8
denominator_sum = 5 + 7 + 8

# Compute the quotient as a float for approximation
approx_value = numerator / denominator_sum
print(f"Approximate value: {approx_value}")

# Compute the exact rational as a tuple (numerator, denominator)
# to avoid floating point inaccuracies
from fractions import Fraction
exact_fraction = Fraction(numerator, denominator_sum)
print(f"Exact rational: {exact_fraction.numerator}/{exact_fraction.denominator}")
```
