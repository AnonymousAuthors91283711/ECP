[write_program]
This problem appears to involve an infinite sum with probabilities, possibly a mixture or convolution involving exponential and logarithmic functions. To explore such sums numerically, especially given the sum over â„•, I will implement a program to approximate partial sums for small parameter values, particularly when \(p = \log 2\), as specified. 

Since the goal is to produce possible answers rather than prove a specific result, I will generate partial sums for increasing k, and approximate the sum numerically up to a certain threshold (say 100 terms). I will print each partial sum as I go, focusing on getting accurate, approximate values, and stopping when the sum stabilizes or reaches a cutoff. 

I'll select small, manageable t values, and compute the sum for each, enumerating candidates to observe their behavior.

```python
import math

def partial_sum(t, log2, max_terms=100, tolerance=1e-6):
    p = log2
    sum_result = 0.0
    for k in range(1, max_terms + 1):
        term_sum_n = 0.0
        # sum over n=0..k-1 for the inner sum
        for n in range(k):
            term_sum_n += (math.exp(-t) * t**n) / math.factorial(n)
        term = (1 - term_sum_n) * (1 - p)**(k - 1) * p
        sum_result += term
        print(f"k={k}, partial_sum={sum_result:.6f}")
        # Optional: break if change is small
        if abs(term) < tolerance:
            break
    return sum_result

# Select sample t values
sample_ts = [0.1, 0.5, 1.0]
log2_value = math.log(2)

for t in sample_ts:
    print(f"\nApproximations for t={t}, p=log(2):")
    partial_sum(t, log2_value)
```
