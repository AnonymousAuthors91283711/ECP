Ground Truth Answer: 990
Proposed Answer: 9 * (11 - 10) * (11 - 1) - 9 * (11 - 10) * (11 + 1)
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer step by step.

1. The problem is asking for the greatest value of the difference between the infimums of two quadratic functions f and g, where a, b, c are distinct integers from 1 to 11.

2. The ground truth answer is 990, which comes from the case where:
   - a = 11
   - b = 1
   - c = 10 (or vice versa)
   The calculation would be:
   f(x) = 11(x-1)(x-10) → infimum at x=5.5 → f(5.5) = -272.25
   g(x) = 11(x-1)(x+10) → infimum at x=-4.5 → g(-4.5) = -1262.25
   Difference: -272.25 - (-1262.25) = 990

3. The proposed answer is calculating:
   9*(11-10)*(11-1) - 9*(11-10)*(11+1) = 9*1*10 - 9*1*12 = 90 - 108 = -18

The proposed answer:
- Uses different values (a=9, b=10, c=1)
- Doesn't calculate infimums, just evaluates at x=11
- Gets a completely different (and much smaller) result
