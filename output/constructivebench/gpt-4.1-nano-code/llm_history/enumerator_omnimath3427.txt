This is a high-school level problem involving inequalities and the greatest element among a set of five numbers related by certain equations and inequalities. We want to identify the maximum element among the set {a, b, c, d, e} given the constraints.

Based on the constraints:
- h1: b + d > a + d simplifies to b > a.
- h2: c + e > b + e simplifies to c > b.
- h3: b + d = c.
- h4: a + c = b + e.

From these, we can derive relationships:
- b > a.
- c > b.
- c = b + d.
- a + c = b + e ⇒ a + c = b + e.

Given the relations, the maximum element among {a, b, c, d, e} is likely to be c or e depending on the values.

Let's pick small sample values following constraints:
- a = 1, b = 2, c = 4 (since c = b + d, choose d=2 → c= b + d = 2 + 2 = 4).
- From h4: a + c = b + e ⇒ 1 + 4 = 2 + e ⇒ 5 = 2 + e ⇒ e=3.
- Check h2: c + e = 4 + 3=7 > b + e = 2 + 3=5, satisfied.
- Check h1: b + d = 2 + 2=4 > a + d=1 + 2=3, satisfied.

Set: a=1, b=2, c=4, d=2, e=3.

Maximum among these is c=4.

Now, enumerate small variations to confirm: 
- Increasing a, b, c, d, e under constraints up to 10 to find other possible maxima.

Here's the Python code to enumerate all such possible tuples under small bounds:

```python
# Enumerate all small tuples satisfying the constraints to find possible maximums
for a in range(1, 10):
    for b in range(a+1, 10):  # b > a
        for d in range(1, 10):
            c = b + d  # c = b + d
            for e in range(1, 10):
                # check constraints
                if (b + d > a + d) and (c + e > b + e) and (a + c == b + e):
                    # collect or print maximum
                    max_value = max(a, b, c, d, e)
                    print(f"Tuple: (a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}, e={e}) Max: {max_value}")
```

This code finds all tuples with small parameters satisfying the constraints and reports their maximum values.

```python
# Enumerate all small tuples satisfying the constraints to find possible maximums
for a in range(1, 10):
    for b in range(a+1, 10):  # b > a
        for d in range(1, 10):
            c = b + d  # c = b + d
            for e in range(1, 10):
                if (b + d > a + d) and (c + e > b + e) and (a + c == b + e):
                    max_value = max(a, b, c, d, e)
                    print(f"Tuple: (a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}, e={e}) Max: {max_value}")
```
