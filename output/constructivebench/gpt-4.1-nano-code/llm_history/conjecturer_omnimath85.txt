The pattern suggests selecting the largest number in the set satisfying the properties. The set's elements are in the range 1 to 108, with various gcd and coprimality constraints, implying composite numbers with common divisors. Since the properties require the presence of elements with gcd > 1 and an element with gcd 1 with any other, the maximum number fitting these constraints is 108.  
Final answer: <<<108>>>
