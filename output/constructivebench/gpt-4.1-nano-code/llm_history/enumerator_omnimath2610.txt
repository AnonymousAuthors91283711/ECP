This problem defines concepts related to multiple functions over a 3-element finite set, with criteria involving positivity, sum to 1, and a custom comparison. To assist in conjecturing the answer, we can systematically enumerate all "special" functions \( t : \text{Fin} 3 \to \mathbb{R} \) satisfying the conditions: non-negativity and sum of 1. Then, for each pair, check if the "IsBetter" relation holds, focusing on those functions where two entries are greater than the corresponding entries of others, which aligns with the "encard = 2" condition.

The minimal set of such functions can be generated by discretizing the simplex \( \{ (t_0, t_1, t_2) \mid t_i \ge 0, t_0 + t_1 + t_2 = 1 \} \), for example, with increments of 0.1. For each generated point, check the "IsSpecial" conditions and simulate the "IsBetter" relation based on the problem's description.

Here's a Python program that enumerates these functions, filters those satisfying "IsSpecial", and then checks the "IsBetter" relation among pairs. It prints each relevant candidate immediately as it is found:

```python
# Enumerate all special functions t: Fin 3 -> [0,1] with steps of 0.1
# Conditions:
# - t_i >= 0
# - sum(t) = 1
# For each pair, check if an IsBetter relation exists based on the criteria:
# - Both t and s are non-negative
# - The set of indices where t_i > s_i has size 2

def enumerate_functions(step=0.1):
    # Generate all triples (t0, t1, t2) with sum = 1 within the step
    for t0 in [i*step for i in range(int(1/step)+1)]:
        for t1 in [i*step for i in range(int((1 - t0)/step)+1)]:
            t2 = 1 - t0 - t1
            if t2 < -1e-9 or t2 > 1 + 1e-9:
                continue
            yield (round(t0,10), round(t1,10), round(t2,10))

def is_special(t):
    # Check non-negativity
    return all(x >= -1e-9 for x in t) and abs(sum(t) - 1) < 1e-9

def is_better(a, b):
    # Check if all a_i >= 0 and b_i >= 0
    if any(x < -1e-9 for x in a) or any(x < -1e-9 for x in b):
        return False
    # Count indices where a_i > b_i
    greater_indices = [i for i in range(3) if a[i] > b[i] + 1e-9]
    # IsBetter iff exactly 2 indices satisfy a_i > b_i
    return len(greater_indices) == 2

# Collect special functions
special_functions = []
for t in enumerate_functions():
    if is_special(t):
        special_functions.append(t)
        print(f"Special function: {t}")

# For each pair, check IsBetter
for s in special_functions:
    for t in special_functions:
        if s != t and is_better(s, t):
            print(f"Function {s} is better than {t}")
```

This enumerator:
- Creates a discretization of the 3D simplex.
- Checks special conditions (non-negativity, sum to 1).
- Tests the comparison relation.
- Prints all valid functions and their "IsBetter" relationships immediately, aiding in conjecture formulation.
