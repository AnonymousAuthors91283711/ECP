This problem asks us to find all natural numbers `n > 0` such that `(n^2 + n + 15) % n = 0`. We can analyze the expression algebraically: `(n^2 + n + 15) % n = 0` if and only if `n` divides `n^2 + n + 15`. Since `n` divides `n^2` and `n` divides `n`, it follows that `n` must divide the constant term `15` in the sum (because `n` divides `n^2 + n` automatically).

So, the solutions are the positive divisors of 15: 1, 3, 5, 15.

We'll programmatically verify them (though for small numbers it's straightforward) and enumerate all candidates. We seek to list all `n > 0` such that `n` divides 15.

```python
# Find all positive divisors of 15 and verify the condition
divisors = []
for n in range(1, 16):
    if 15 % n == 0:
        # Check if (n^2 + n + 15) % n == 0
        # Simplify: (n^2 + n + 15) % n == (0 + 0 + 15 % n) % n
        # Since 15 % n is 0 only if n divides 15
        if (n**2 + n + 15) % n == 0:
            print(n)  # Stream the results
            divisors.append(n)
```
