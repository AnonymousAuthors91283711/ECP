This problem involves exploring a specific Markov chain with a 6x6 transition matrix T, where certain off-diagonal elements are 1/4, and others are 0, with initial distribution p uniform over the states. We want to analyze (T^5) * p, particularly its first component, to identify a pattern or exact value.

To assist, I will:
- Generate all possible arrangements of T's off-diagonal entries matching the given pattern.
- Enforce the row sums to 1, i.e., diagonal entries ensure row-sum=1.
- For each candidate T, compute (T^5)*p, which involves matrix exponentiation and vector multiplication.
- Print each resulting first component immediately as we find it.
- Since the problem describes a specific pattern, I will focus on enumerating all small integer/double configurations matching the pattern, and then perform calculations to extract the value.

Given the complexity, I will:
- Use small sample parameters (possible off-diagonal values 1/4 and 0) matching the pattern.
- Implement efficient enumeration and computation.
- Output answers right away, streaming the results.

Here's the code to achieve this:

```python
import itertools
import numpy as np

# Define the pattern of edges (the adjacency pattern for off-diagonal entries)
edge_pairs = [(0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4),
              (1,2), (1,3), (1,5),
              (2,4), (2,5),
              (3,4), (3,5),
              (4,5)]

# Generate all matrices matching the pattern: off-diagonal edges can be 1/4 or 0
# Diagonal entries are determined so each row sums to 1
off_value = 1/4
zero = 0

# Create all combinations for the presence (1/4) or absence (0) of each edge
for pattern in itertools.product([off_value, zero], repeat=len(edge_pairs)):
    T = np.zeros((6,6))
    # Set off-diagonal entries
    for (val, (i,j)) in zip(pattern, edge_pairs):
        T[i,j] = val
        T[j,i] = val  # symmetric
    # Set diagonal entries to make row sum to 1
    for i in range(6):
        T[i,i] = 1 - np.sum(T[i,:])
    # Verify rows sum to 1 (numerical stability)
    if not np.allclose(np.sum(T, axis=1), np.ones(6)):
        continue  # skip invalid
    # Initial distribution p: all 1/6
    p = np.ones(6)/6
    # Compute T^5 * p
    T_pow_5 = np.linalg.matrix_power(T, 5)
    result = T_pow_5 @ p
    # Print the first component immediately
    print(result[0])
```

This enumerates all adjacency configurations, computes the fifth-step distribution starting from uniform, and streams the first component of the result as they are found.
