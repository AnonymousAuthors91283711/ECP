The problem is to find three distinct primes p, q, r such that p < q < r and p * q * r = 989 * 1001 * 1007 + 320. It also states that these are the unique such primes, and asks us to enumerate all possible answers to assist in conjecturing and proving the true answer.

First, observe:
- Calculate the target product: `989 * 1001 * 1007 + 320`.
- Factor the product 989 * 1001 * 1007 into primes or parts, then find triples of primes with the specified multiplication.
- Since the numbers are large, we attempt to factor them quickly.

Given the constraints, the approach:
- Compute the target product.
- Let's find factors of the target, especially focusing on primes.
- For computational efficiency, only enumerate candidate triples of primes where p, q, r are small or within a manageable range, because we don't want excess computation.

Note: Since the problem is structured around small sample computation and enumeration, the code will:
- Compute the product.
- Generate candidate primes up to a certain limit.
- Check combinations that multiply to the target.
- Immediately print each valid (p, q, r).

Below is the code to perform this enumeration:

```python
import math

# Compute the target product
target = 989 * 1001 * 1007 + 320

# Generate a list of prime numbers up to a certain limit for candidate factors
# For efficiency, limit the search to primes up to, say, 2000
LIMIT = 2000

# Simple sieve to generate primes up to LIMIT
def sieve(n):
    sieve = [True]*(n+1)
    sieve[0] = sieve[1] = False
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n))+1):
        if sieve[i]:
            for j in range(i*i, n+1, i):
                sieve[j] = False
    return [i for i in range(2, n+1) if sieve[i]]

primes = sieve(LIMIT)

# Store found solutions, avoid duplicates
found = set()

# Enumerate all triplets (p, q, r) with p < q < r
for i in range(len(primes)):
    p = primes[i]
    # If p^3 > target, no need to continue
    if p**3 > target:
        break
    for j in range(i+1, len(primes)):
        q = primes[j]
        if p * q * q > target:
            break
        for k in range(j+1, len(primes)):
            r = primes[k]
            prod = p * q * r
            if prod == target:
                # Found a valid triplet
                print(f"Found primes: p={p}, q={q}, r={r}")
                found.add((p, q, r))
            elif prod > target:
                break
```
