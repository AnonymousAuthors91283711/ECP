theorem omnimath3055 : 
  ∃ k, k ∈ {k : ℕ | let total := 4 + 5 + 7;
                    let new_total := total - k;
                    2 * (4 / total) = 4 / new_total ∧ new_total > 0} ∧ k = omnimath3055_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 8. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the pattern and the structure of the conditions, the value of k that satisfies the equations simplifies to 8. The solution aligns with the elimination of the existential quantifier, giving a fixed answer in terms of the initial total. Therefore, the answer is 8.
