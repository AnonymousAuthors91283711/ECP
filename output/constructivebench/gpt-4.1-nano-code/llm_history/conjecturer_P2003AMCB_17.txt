Given the equations:
log(x y^3) = 1 and log(x^2 y) = 1,
we find:
log x + 3 log y = 1,
2 log x + log y = 1.

Solving simultaneously:
let a = log x, b = log y,
then:
a + 3b = 1,
2a + b = 1.

Express b from the second:
b = 1 - 2a,
substitute into the first:
a + 3(1 - 2a) = 1,
a + 3 - 6a = 1,
-5a = -2,
a = 2/5 = 0.4,
b = 1 - 2*(0.4) = 0.2.

Thus, log(x y) = a + b = 0.4 + 0.2 = 0.6.

Final answer:
<<<0.6>>>
