abbrev olympiadbench2352_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem olympiadbench2352 (x : ℚ) (h : x + 1/x = 13/6) :
    x^2 + 1/x^2 = olympiadbench2352_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 2.694444444444444
2.694444444444444
. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The value given is approximately 2.694444444444444, which simplifies to the exact fraction 25/9. Recognizing that \( x + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{13}{6} \) implies \( (x + \frac{1}{x})^2 = \frac{169}{36} \). Hence, \( x^2 + 2 + \frac{1}{x^2} = \frac{169}{36} \) leading to \( x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} = \frac{169}{36} - 2 = \frac{169}{36} - \frac{72}{36} = \frac{97}{36} \). But the approximate matches \( 25/9 \). Considering the pattern and calculations, the exact answer is:

<<<(25 : ℚ) / 9>>>
