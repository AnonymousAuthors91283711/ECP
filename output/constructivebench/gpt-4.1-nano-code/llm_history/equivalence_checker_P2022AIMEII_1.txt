Ground Truth Answer: 154
Proposed Answer: 550
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest natural number n such that:
   - There exist natural numbers k and m satisfying:
     * 5m = 12k
     * 11(m + 50) = 25(k + 50)
   - And n = k + 50

2. Let's solve the equations:
   From the first equation: m = (12/5)k
   Substituting into the second equation:
   11((12/5)k + 50) = 25(k + 50)
   (132/5)k + 550 = 25k + 1250
   (132/5)k - 25k = 700
   (132/5 - 125/5)k = 700
   (7/5)k = 700
   k = 500

3. Then n = k + 50 = 500 + 50 = 550

However, the ground truth answer is 154. This suggests there might be a different interpretation or constraint in the problem that we're missing. The proposed answer 550 follows directly from solving the equations as written, but contradicts the ground truth.
