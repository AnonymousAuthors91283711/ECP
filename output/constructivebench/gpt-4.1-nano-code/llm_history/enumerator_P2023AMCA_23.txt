The problem appears to be asking for the size of the set of all real pairs (a, b) satisfying the condition \( (1 + 2a)(1 + b)(2a + b) = 16ab \) with \( a > 0, b > 0 \). To analyze this set, we can attempt to parametrize or analyze the equation symbolically, considering possible solutions or particular values.

Since directly solving analytically is complex in code, I can implement a numerical search over small ranges of positive \(a, b\) to estimate the number of solutions.

The approach:
- Sample \(a\) and \(b\) over a small grid in positive ranges.
- Check the equation within a small tolerance.
- Count the solutions and print each candidate quickly.
- As the number of solutions might be small, an enumeration over these points can give us the approximate card.

Let's implement this in code, with small ranges and step sizes to stay efficient.

```python
# Enumerate solutions to the equation (1 + 2a)(1 + b)(2a + b) = 16ab for a, b > 0.
# Use small grids for parameters to estimate solutions.
import math

def is_solution(a, b, tol=1e-4):
    lhs = (1 + 2*a)*(1 + b)*(2*a + b)
    rhs = 16 * a * b
    return abs(lhs - rhs) < tol

answer = 0
solutions = []

# Sample a, b in small ranges
for a_int in range(1, 50):
    a = a_int / 10  # a in (0.1, 5.0)
    for b_int in range(1, 50):
        b = b_int / 10
        if is_solution(a, b):
            solutions.append((a, b))
            print(f"Solution found at a={a:.2f}, b={b:.2f}")
answer = len(solutions)
print(f"The estimated number of solutions is: {answer}")

# Assign to the required abbrev
P2023AMCA_23_answer = answer
