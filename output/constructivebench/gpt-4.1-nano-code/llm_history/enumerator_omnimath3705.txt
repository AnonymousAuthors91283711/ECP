The problem appears to involve analyzing natural numbers \( n \) where \( n = k^3 \) for some positive integer \( k \), and the number \( n \) is not divisible by 10, with the additional condition that some \( m \) exists with \( m^3 = n/1000 \). To assist in this, we will enumerate small positive cubes \( k^3 \), check the conditions, and look for such \( m \).

We'll consider small \( k \) values, compute \( n = k^3 \), check if \( 10 \nmid n \), and if \( n/1000 \) is a perfect cube for some integer \( m \). We stop after some threshold for \( k \) (say 50), suggesting the possible solutions.

```python
# Enumerate k from 1 to 50
for k in range(1, 51):
    n = k**3
    # Check if n is divisible by 10
    if n % 10 != 0:
        # Check if n/1000 is a perfect cube
        if n % 1000 == 0:
            n_div = n // 1000
            # Check for some integer m with m^3 = n/1000
            m = round(n_div ** (1/3))
            if m**3 == n_div:
                print(f"k={k}, n={n}, m={m}")

# The output lists all such n, m pairs satisfying the conditions within the threshold.

The program correctly enumerates values of n = k^3 for k from 1 to 50, then filters for those where n is not divisible by 10 and n/1000 is a perfect cube. Since the code only considers k up to 50, it may miss larger solutions if they exist. Moreover, the code's approach to checking perfect cubes via rounding may produce errors for larger values or more precise cube roots. 

Given the problem's structure, possible solutions (n, m) meet the criteria:
- n = k^3 for some positive integer k
- n not divisible by 10
- n divisible by 1000 (so that n/1000 is an integer)
- n/1000 is a perfect cube, i.e., (n/1000) = m^3 for some integer m

Since n=k^3, and n divisible by 1000, then k^3 divisible by 1000. For small k, this requires that k^3 is divisible by 1000. Recall 1000 = 2^3 * 5^3, so k^3 divisible by 2^3*5^3 implies k divisible by 2 and 5. To satisfy all conditions, k must be divisible by 10 (since lcm of 2 and 5 is 10). For k ≤ 50, k=10,20,30,40,50 are candidates.

Check k=10: n=1000, n%10=0, so fails the ¬(10|n) condition. So discard k=10.

k=20: n=8000, n%10=0, discard.

k=30: n=27000, n%10=0, discard.

k=40: n=64000, n%10=0, discard.

k=50: n=125000, n%10=0, discard.

None of these satisfy the "n not divisible by 10" condition.

Thus, no solutions occur for k ≤50; solutions might exist for larger k, but the program only enumerates up to k=50, and it finds no solutions. The problem's original note indicates the output is empty. Hence, if the problem asks for solutions, answer, and the code is consistent with that.

**Judgment:**
- The code's structure is correct, but the small range misses potential larger

The problem's statement involves identifying natural numbers \( n \) such that:
- There exists a positive integer \( k \) with \( k^3 = n \).
- \( n \) is not divisible by 10.
- There exists an integer \( m \) with \( m^3 = n/1000 \).

In essence:
- \( n \) is a perfect cube: \( n = k^3 \), with \( k > 0 \).
- \( n \) is not divisible by 10, so \( n \not\equiv 0 \pmod{10} \).
- \( n/1000 \) is a perfect cube, so \( n/1000 = m^3 \Rightarrow n = 1000 m^3 \).

Since \( 1000 = 10^3 \), \( n = 10^3 m^3 = (10 m)^3 \). But \( n = k^3 \), so \( k^3 = (10 m)^3 \Rightarrow k = 10 m \).

Given \( k > 0 \), and \( n = k^3 \):

- \( n = (10 m)^3 = 1000 m^3 \).
- \( n \) is divisible by 10 because \( 10 m \) is an integer, so \( n \) divisible by 1000, which is divisible by 10, contradicting the "not divisible by 10" condition.

But wait, since \( n = (10 m)^3 \), \( n \) is always divisible by 10, unless \( m = 0 \), but \( m \) can be zero or negative? Let's check the cube condition:

- \( n \) is a perfect cube: \( n = k^3 \).
- We want \( n / 1000 = m^3 \Rightarrow n = 1000 m^3 \).

Therefore:

- \( n = 1000 m^3 \).
- For \( n \) to be a perfect cube: is \( 1000 m^3 \) a perfect cube? Yes, because \( 1000 = 10^3 \), so:

\[ n = 10^3 m^3 = (10 m)^3. \]

- For \( n \) to not be divisible by 10, \( n \) should not be divisible by
