. Enumerated answers: 9. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the problem constraints and pattern of the enumerated answers, the expression simplifies to the product minus the first variable:  xy - x = (3 * 4) - 3 = 12 - 3 = 9. Similarly, in Lean, this can be expressed generically as x * y - x with substitutions hx and hy.

<<<(x * y) - x>>>

which, after substituting hx and hy, evaluates to 9.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

. Enumerated Answers: 9. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The error occurs because in Lean, an abbreviation declared with `abbrev` cannot directly depend on variables x and y, which are only introduced as parameters in the theorem statement, not in the global environment. To fix this, the answer should be defined as a function of x and y or use a lambda expression with explicitly bounded parameters. The goal is to create a closed form value: given that x=3 and y=4, the simplified expression is (3*4) - 3 = 12 - 3 = 9. Since the answer is supposed to be a constant real number, the simplest form is 9. 

Given the context, the correct answer should be a fixed real number value, which equals 9.

Thus, the corrected answer in Lean should be:

<<<9>>>
