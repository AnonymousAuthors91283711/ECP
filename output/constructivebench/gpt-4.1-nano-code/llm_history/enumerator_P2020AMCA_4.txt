This problem appears to involve counting four-digit numbers (from 1000 to 9999) that satisfy certain digit conditions: all digits are even, and the number is divisible by 5.

Key observations:
- Since the number is divisible by 5, its last digit must be 0 or 5.
- All digits are even, so the last digit being 5 is impossible.
- Hence, the last digit must be 0.
- The first three digits (thousands, hundreds, tens) are even digits from {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}. Since the number is four-digit, the first digit (thousands place) cannot be 0.
- So, first digit choices: 2, 4, 6, 8.
- For each of these, the remaining two digits (hundreds and tens) can be any even digit (0, 2, 4, 6, 8).

We will enumerate all such numbers:
- first digit: 4 options (2, 4, 6, 8)
- each of next two digits: 5 options (0, 2, 4, 6, 8)
- last digit: fixed at 0 to ensure divisibility by 5

Counting: 4 * 5 * 5 = 100 numbers.

Let's generate all such numbers explicitly for verification and then find the count.

```python
# Program to enumerate four-digit numbers with all even digits, last digit 0, first digit non-zero
answers = []

even_digits = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
# First digit: 2,4,6,8 (non-zero)
for d1 in [2, 4, 6, 8]:
    for d2 in even_digits:
        for d3 in even_digits:
            n = d1 * 1000 + d2 * 100 + d3 * 10 + 0
            print(n)
            answers.append(n)

print("Total count:", len(answers))
```
