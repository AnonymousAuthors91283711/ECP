abbrev omnimath3697_answer : Set (ℝ → ℝ) := sorry
theorem omnimath3697 (f : ℝ → ℝ) :
  (∀ x y, f (x^2 + f x * f y) = x * f (x + y)) ↔ f ∈ omnimath3697_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Constant solution: f(x) = 0
Linear solution: f(x) = 0 * x + 0. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ → ℝ)
<<<{f | f = 0}>>>

This set includes only the zero function, matching the provided solutions and expected linear form.
