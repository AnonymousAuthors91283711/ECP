[write_program]
This problem asks to analyze triples of powers of 3 within a certain finite set, with specific divisibility and ordering constraints. Given the small and manageable sizes involved, the program will generate all such triples and filter according to the conditions, then find the maximum or relevant extremal value as needed.

The key points:
- Generate `powers`, the set of `3^i` for `i` in 1..8.
- Generate all triples `(a, b, c)` with `a ≤ b ≤ c`.
- Check the divisibility conditions `(a * b) % c = 0`, `(a * c) % b = 0`, `(b * c) % a = 0`.
- Count these triples or find a particular answer.

The code will:
- Generate the powers.
- Generate all triples.
- Filter triples based on conditions.
- Print each valid triple as it's found.
- Count the total number of such triples to compute the answer.

This approach stays efficient due to small set sizes, and ensures streaming of answers.

```python
# Generate powers of 3 from 3^1 to 3^8
powers = [3**i for i in range(1, 9)]

# Generate all triples (a, b, c) with a ≤ b ≤ c
triples = []
for a in powers:
    for b in powers:
        if b < a:
            continue
        for c in powers:
            if c < b:
                continue
            # Check divisibility conditions
            if (a * b) % c == 0 and (a * c) % b == 0 and (b * c) % a == 0:
                print((a, b, c))
                triples.append((a, b, c))
# Output the total count as the answer
print("Total triples:", len(triples))
```
