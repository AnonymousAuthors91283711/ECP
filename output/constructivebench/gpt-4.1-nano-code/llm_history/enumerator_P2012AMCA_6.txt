The problem involves solving a system of equations:
a + b = 12  
a + c = 17  
b + c = 19

From these, we can derive individual values for a, b, c. The goal is to enumerate possible solutions for b (or other variables) based on the constraints.

To do this efficiently, I'll:
- Compute the implied value of a, then c, from the equations.
- Verify if the solutions satisfy all equations.
- Since the equations are linear, the solution should be unique, but I will enumerate potential candidate solutions around the computed values for validation.

Here's the enumeration:

```python
# Enumerate candidate solutions for b within a small range:
# since the given sums suggest approximate values,
# we use the derived equations to find the exact values.

# From the equations:
# a + b = 12  =>  b = 12 - a
# a + c = 17  =>  c = 17 - a
# b + c = 19  =>  (12 - a) + (17 - a) = 19

# Simplify the last:
# 29 - 2a = 19
# 2a = 10
# a = 5

# Compute b and c:
# b = 12 - 5 = 7
# c = 17 - 5 = 12

# Verify all equations:
# a + b = 5 + 7 = 12 ✔
# a + c = 5 + 12 = 17 ✔
# b + c = 7 + 12 = 19 ✔

# The solution is unique:
# b = 7

# For demonstration, enumerate candidate b near this solution
for candidate_b in range(0, 15):
    # compute a from a + b = 12
    a_candidate = 12 - candidate_b
    # compute c from a + c = 17
    c_candidate = 17 - a_candidate
    # verify b + c
    if candidate_b + c_candidate == 19:
        print(candidate_b)
```
