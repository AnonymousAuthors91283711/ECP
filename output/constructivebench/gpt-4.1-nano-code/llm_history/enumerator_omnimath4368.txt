The problem involves finding whether there's a bijection \( f: \text{Fin } 20 \to \text{Fin } 20 \) satisfying certain constraints related to a finite set and inequalities. The goal is to determine if the number of such bijections equals 2010, which leads to exploring permutations with constrained orderings.

Since the problem is complex, and the constraints depend on functions \( constraints : Fin 20 â†’ Finset (Fin 20) \), a practical approach is to consider small sample constraints and count permutations satisfying certain inequalities. The code will enumerate permutations of 20 elements and check if they meet the simplified constraints. Due to the large search space, we'll test a subset with manageable constraints to analyze the counts.

This approach helps in conjecturing the possible existence of such functions and approximating the count.

```python
import itertools

# Small sample constraints: For each position, restrict certain elements to be less than
# For demonstration, we impose dummy constraints for positions 0..3
sample_constraints = {
    0: {1, 2},
    1: {0},
    2: {0, 1},
    3: set()
}

def meets_constraints(perm, constraints):
    # Check if for each position i, all j in constraints[i], f(j) < f(i)
    for i, j_set in constraints.items():
        for j in j_set:
            if perm[j] >= perm[i]:
                return False
    return True

count = 0
# Limit enumeration to permutations of first 4 elements for tractability
for perm in itertools.permutations(range(4)):
    if meets_constraints(perm, sample_constraints):
        count += 1
        print(f"Found permutation meeting constraints: {perm}")

print(f"Total permutations satisfying constraints (first 4): {count}")
```
