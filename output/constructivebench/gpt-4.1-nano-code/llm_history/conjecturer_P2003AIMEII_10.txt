  IsGreatest {s : ℕ | ∃ (a b : ℕ), a + b = s ∧ a - b = 60 ∧ ∃ (k : ℕ), Real.sqrt a + Real.sqrt b = Real.sqrt k ∧ ¬IsSquare k} 
  P2003AIMEII_10_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: s = 156, a = 108.0, b = 48.0, sqrt sum = 17.320508, k = 300. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The largest s satisfying the constraints is obtained when a and b are approximately 108 and 48, making a + b = 156. The difference 60 is fixed, and the sum of square roots is about 17.32, corresponding to k ≈ 300, which is not a perfect square. The key is that increasing s beyond 156 would violate the conditions. Hence, the maximal s is 156.
