This problem seems to involve combinatorics and number theory, focusing on sums of powers with distinct elements. Since the provided code uses Lean syntax and the goal is to find potential answers (such as possible values of y or z, or to verify existence), a Python enumeration approach can help explore possible small solutions.

Given the constraints and that the problem specifies the sum of squares equals a perfect cube and the sum of cubes equals a perfect square, a straightforward approach is to:
- Generate small sequences of distinct non-negative integers
- Compute their sums of squares and cubes
- Check whether these sums satisfy the perfect power conditions

The code will brute-force small sequences to find any possible solutions, printing each candidate that satisfies the conditions.

```python
# Enumerate small sequences of distinct non-negative integers, check the conditions.
# Goal: Find sequences where sum of squares is a perfect cube and sum of cubes is a perfect square.
import math

MAX_LEN = 5  # Limit sequence length for efficiency
MAX_NUM = 20  # Limit maximum number for enumeration

def is_perfect_cube(n):
    c = round(n ** (1/3))
    return c ** 3 == n

def is_perfect_square(n):
    s = int(math.isqrt(n))
    return s * s == n

for length in range(1, MAX_LEN + 1):
    # Generate all combinations without repetition
    from itertools import combinations
    for sequence in combinations(range(MAX_NUM + 1), length):
        sum_sq = sum(x ** 2 for x in sequence)
        sum_cu = sum(x ** 3 for x in sequence)
        if is_perfect_cube(sum_sq) and is_perfect_square(sum_cu):
            print(f"Sequence: {sequence}, sum of squares: {sum_sq} (cube), sum of cubes: {sum_cu} (square)")
```
