The problem asks for the least integer \( n > 1 \) for which there exists a string \( s \) of length \( n \) (i.e., \( s.length = n \)) where each position from 1 to \( n \) (indices \( i \) with \( 0 \leq i < n \)) is contained in \( s \) (i.e., \( i + 1 \in s \)), and \( s \) is palindromic (\( s = s.reverse \)). 

Since the contributions of the `isString` predicate are that \( s \) has length \( n \) and contains all integers from 1 up to \( n \), the primary constraint becomes finding the smallest \( n > 1 \) for which there's a palindromic list \( s \) satisfying this property.

Note:
- The string \( s \) is over â„•, with each element corresponding to its index (since all integers from 1..n must appear).
- For such a list to satisfy the `isString` predicate, it must contain all integers from 1..n, possibly interleaved.

The minimal such \( n \) where a palindromic sequence containing all integers from 1..n exists is at least \( n \), because the sequence must include all numbers 1..n. For small values:
- For \( n = 2 \), possible palindromic sequences are [x, x], but contains only one unique number. So it can't contain both 1 and 2 simultaneously.
- For \( n = 3 \), palindromic sequences are of the form [a, b, a]. For it to contain 1, 2, and 3, the sequence must contain all three. But the first and last elements are equal, so the sequence must contain at least two occurrences of the same number. For the sequence to contain 1, 2, 3, it must include all three numbers.
- Checking \( n=3 \), can such a sequence be palindromic and contain 1, 2, 3? For example, [1, 2, 3], it's not a palindrome; [1, 3, 1], it contains 1 and 3, but not 2.

For the sequence to contain all integers 1..n in a palindrome, the sequence must be symmetric, containing pairs of matching elements, possibly with a middle element in case of odd length.

Generally:
- For even \( n \), the sequence looks like [a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n/2}, a_{n/2}, ..., a_2, a_1]
- For odd \( n \), it looks like [a_1, a_2, ..., a_{(n-1)/2}, c, a_{(n-1)/2}, ..., a_2, a_1]

Given the requirement of containing all integers from 1..n, the maximum possible distinct elements in the sequence is \( n \). However, with palindrome symmetry, elements at symmetric positions must be equal, which limits the number of distinct elements in the sequence to at most \( \lceil n/2 \rceil \).

Therefore:
- For \( n=3 \), the sequence can have at most 2 unique elements; it cannot contain 1, 2, and 3 simultaneously, so impossible.
- For \( n=4 \), sequence of length 4, at most 2 unique elements, so can't contain 1, 2, 3, and 4 all at once.
- For \( n=5 \), sequence length 5, at most 3 unique elements, so can include 1, 2, and 3, but not all 1..5.
- For larger \( n \), to contain all numbers 1..n, \( n \) must be less than or equal to the number of distinct elements: which is at most \( \lceil n/2 \rceil \). So, to contain all numbers from 1..n in the sequence, the number of distinct elements should be at least \( n \), which is impossible for sequences that are palindromic because the max number of distinct elements is roughly \( n/2 + 1 \).

Thus, the minimal sequence length \( n \) for which it is possible is when \( n = 2 \), but since 1 < n, and sequence must contain all 1..n, the minimal \( n \) satisfying the constraints appears to be **n=3**:

In case of \( n=3 \), the sequence length is 3, symmetric, containing all elements 1, 2, 3? Let's check:
- It's impossible as it needs to contain 1, 2, and 3, but the palindrome sequence of length 3:
  - [a, b, a], contains only 2 unique elements. to contain all 1, 2, 3, that would require 3 distinct elements, which can't fit into only 2 positions for the unique elements. So impossible.

Similarly, the minimal \( n \) needs to be bigger:
- At \( n=4 \), maximum of 2 distinct elements, can't contain 1, 2, 3, 4
- At \( n=5 \), maximum of 3 distinct elements, progress.

Eventually, for \( n=7 \), the sequence length 7, maximum of 4 or  library, could contain 1..7? Let's check:

- Length 7, palindrome sequence of the form: [a, b, c, d, c, b, a], which can contain 4 distinct elements, but not 7. So impossible.

Similarly, for \( n=15 \):

- Sequence length 15, it can have at most 8 unique elements (since symmetric pairs only), again less than 15, so impossible.

Thus, to contain all 1..n, with the edge of palindrome symmetry, the minimal \( n \) is when the maximum number of distinct elements \( \lceil n/2 \rceil \geq n \), but impossible unless \( n \leq 1 \), which contradicts \( 1 < n \).

Hence, what is the minimal \( n > 1 \) for which such a sequence can exist?

Alternatively, since the sequence must include all integers from 1..n, and symmetry limits the number of unique elements to at most \( \lceil n/2 \rceil \), the only chance is for \( n \leq 2 \).

But with \( n=2 \), sequence length 2, symmetric, can only contain one unique element, which can't be 1 and 2 both. Therefore, **such a sequence cannot exist** for \( n \geq 2 \).

However, the problem seems to be theoretical, expecting the minimal such \( n \) possibly being very high or impossible, but per the constraints, the minimal \( n \) for such repeating conditions is **none**. Still, perhaps in an example, length 1, trivial, but \( n>1 \) required.

Therefore, **no such \( n \) exists**.

But within the context of the code, to formalize this, I will implement a small enumeration: for \( n \) from 2 up to 20, check whether any palindromic sequence exists containing all integers 1..n. The sequence must contain each number 1..n; the sequence is palindromic; such sequences are symmetric with at most \( \lceil n/2 \rceil \) distinct elements.

Given that, for each candidate \( n \), check all sequences with at most \( \lceil n/2 \rceil \) distinct elements, using recursive generation, and see whether all 1..n are present.

The code below searches for the minimal \( n > 1 \) where such a sequence exists, testing small \( n \) up to 20.

```python
# Enumerate possible palindrome sequences for small n to find minimal n > 1
from itertools import combinations, product

def contains_all(s, n):
    return all(i in s for i in range(1, n+1))

def generate_palindromes(n):
    half_length = (n +1)//2
    max_distinct = (n + 1)//2
    for num_distinct in range(1, max_distinct+1):
        for pattern in combinations(range(1, n+1), num_distinct):
            # Generate all sequences over pattern for the half
            for half in product(pattern, repeat=half_length):
                if n % 2 == 0:
                    seq = list(half) + list(reversed(half))
                else:
                    seq = list(half) + list(reversed(half[:-1]))
                yield seq

# Find minimal n > 1 where such a sequence exists
for n in range(2, 21):
    found = False
    for seq in generate_palindromes(n):
        if contains_all(seq, n):
            print(f"n = {n}, sequence = {seq}")
            found = True
            break
    if found:
        break
# Output the minimal such n and sequence
```

This code searches for the minimal \( n > 1 \) up to 20 where a palindromic sequence contains all integers from 1..n. It outputs immediately upon finding the first such sequence.

This approach respects constraints and streams results as soon as a candidate is found.
