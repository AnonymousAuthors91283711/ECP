This problem involves analyzing a function \(f:\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{N}\) with given recursive properties, and evaluating \(f(50)\). To assist in conjecturing the exact value, I'll generate possible candidate values for \(f(n)\) based on the rules, starting from base cases and applying the given conditions efficiently. 

The rules:
- \(f(1) = 1\)
- For even \(n > 0\): \(f(n) = f(n/2)\)
- For odd \(n > 1\): \(f(n) = f(n - 1) + 1\)

We use these rules recursively, compute \(f(n)\) for each \(n\) up to 50, and print each computed value immediately to help analyze the pattern.

```python
# We implement a memoized recursive function to compute f(n) based on the rules.
def compute_f(n, memo={}):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    if n == 1:
        result = 1
    elif n % 2 == 0:
        result = compute_f(n // 2, memo)
    else:
        result = compute_f(n - 1, memo) + 1
    print(f"f({n}) = {result}")
    memo[n] = result
    return result

# Compute and print f(50) and intermediate values.
compute_f(50)
```
