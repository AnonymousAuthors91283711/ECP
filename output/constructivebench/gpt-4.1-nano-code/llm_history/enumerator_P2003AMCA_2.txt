This appears to be a mathematical problem involving finding the least natural number n such that 0 < n and 2 * n * 4 + 2 * n * (4 + 5) = 2366. Simplify the equation to find candidates for n, then implement a Python script to enumerate possible n values, check the condition, and identify the least n that satisfies it.

```python
# We want to find the least n > 0 satisfying:
# 2 * n * 4 + 2 * n * (4 + 5) = 2366
# Simplify the expression:
# 2 * n * 4 + 2 * n * 9 = 2366
# 8 * n + 18 * n = 2366
# 26 * n = 2366
# n = 2366 / 26 = 91

# To confirm, we can check for n in range around 91 to verify minimality

for n in range(1, 200):  # arbitrary upper bound for search
    left_side = 2 * n * 4 + 2 * n * (4 + 5)
    if left_side == 2366:
        print(n)
        break
```
