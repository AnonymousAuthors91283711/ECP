This problem involves analyzing the function S(n) = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} number_of_divisors(k+1) and counting how many n in [0, 2004] yield an odd or even value for S(n+1). Our goal is to find the absolute difference between the count of n with odd S(n+1) and even S(n+1).

Since the original problem doesn't specify the exact answer, our approach is:
- Compute S(n) for n from 1 to 2005.
- Determine the parity of S(n) for each.
- Count how many are odd/even.
- Output the absolute difference.

We will sample small cases to verify patterns, and then implement the full enumeration for n in [1..2005].

```python
# Import required modules
import math
from collections import Counter

# Function to compute number_of_divisors efficiently
def num_divisors(k):
    count = 0
    sqrt_k = int(math.isqrt(k))
    for d in range(1, sqrt_k + 1):
        if k % d == 0:
            count += 2 if d * d != k else 1
    return count

# Precompute S(n): sum of number_of_divisors for k=1 to n
def compute_S(n):
    total = 0
    for k in range(1, n + 1):
        total += num_divisors(k)
    return total

# Count parities for n in [1..2005]
odd_count = 0
even_count = 0
for n in range(1, 2006):
    s_value = compute_S(n)
    if s_value % 2 == 1:
        odd_count += 1
    else:
        even_count += 1

print(f"Number of n with odd S(n): {odd_count}")
print(f"Number of n with even S(n): {even_count}")
print(f"Absolute difference: {abs(odd_count - even_count)}")
```
