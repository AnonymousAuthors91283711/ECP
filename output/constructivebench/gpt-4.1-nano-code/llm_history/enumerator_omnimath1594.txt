This problem asks us to find all natural numbers n less than 100 that satisfy the divisibility condition: n divides 2^n + 2. To assist in conjecture, let's code a simple enumeration that checks each n from 1 to 99, and outputs all such n immediately when found.

The key points:
- Check n in 1..99
- For each n, verify if n divides 2^n + 2
- Print n immediately if it satisfies
- Do not hardcode any answers; generate and enumerate systematically
- Keep output concise within 400 tokens

```python
# Enumerate n from 1 to 99
for n in range(1, 100):
    # Check if n divides 2^n + 2
    if (2 ** n + 2) % n == 0:
        print(n)
```
