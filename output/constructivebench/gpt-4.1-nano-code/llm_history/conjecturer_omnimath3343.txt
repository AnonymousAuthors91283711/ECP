The solutions are symmetric around zero with pairs summing to zero, including a zero in the solutions. This indicates the solutions are all pairs where x and y are either opposites or zero, covering all options with |x| ≤ 5 and |y| ≤ 5, such that the pair is in the set of solutions. Therefore, the proposition states: "x and y are integers where each is in {−5, −4, −3, 0, 3, 4, 5} and either equal or opposite." 

Since the solutions include pairs like (−5,0), (−4,−3), etc., and are symmetric, the general form is:

The key is to define the set of solutions as all pairs (x, y) where x and y are integers with |x|, |y| ≤ 5, and the pairs match the given enumerated solutions which exhibit symmetry and specific opposites. As the enumerations show, solutions are characterized by pairs where either x = y = 0, or x = -y, or x = 0, or y = 0, with some specific pairs across the boundary of [-5, 5]. 

The correct formalization is to state that the solutions are pairs (x, y) with these properties, which I will express as: 
- Both x and y are in {-5, -4, -3, 0, 3, 4, 5}
- The pairs are among those listed: either x = y = 0, or y = 0 and x in {-5, -4, -3, 3, 4, 5}, or x = 0 and y in {-5, -4, -3, 3, 4, 5}, or x = -y with x, y in the sets. 

From the enumeration, the pattern matches pairs where one coordinate is zero, or they are opposites within that set. 

Thus, I combine all these conditions into a propositional statement with conjunctions and disjunctions matching these patterns. 

The key is also to generalize the description to a complete set of solutions matching the enumeration, which is symmetric, and captures all options.

Final formal answer:

<<<
(∃ x y : ℤ, (x = -5 ∧ y = 0) ∨ (x = -4 ∧ y = -3) ∨ (x = -4 ∧ y = 3) ∨ (x = -3 ∧ y = -4) ∨ (x = -3 ∧ y = 4) ∨ (x = 0 ∧ y = -5) ∨ (x = 0 ∧ y = 5) ∨ (x = 3 ∧ y = -4) ∨ (x = 3 ∧ y = 4) ∨ (x = 4 ∧ y = -3) ∨ (x = 4 ∧ y = 3) ∨ (x = 5 ∧ y = 0))
>>>

This finite enumeration models all listed solutions, respecting symmetry, zero pairs, and opposites, and is suitable as a prop.
