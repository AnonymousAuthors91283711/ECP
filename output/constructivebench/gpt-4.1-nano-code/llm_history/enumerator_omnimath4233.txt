The given code appears to be a formal statement involving polynomials over the real numbers ‚Ñù, specifically evaluating a polynomial at different points and relating these evaluations.

The problem asks to find all polynomials \(f \in \mathbb{R}[X]\) such that for all \(x \in \mathbb{R}\):

\[
\text{eval}_x(f) \times \text{eval}_{2x^2}(f) = \text{eval}_{2x^3 + x}(f),
\]

where \(\text{eval}_a(f) = f(a)\).

This is a functional equation for polynomials; typically such equations are analyzed by comparing degrees and coefficients.

Key ideas:

- For all real \(x\), the polynomial expression must hold.
- The degrees suggest considering the leading terms: if \(f\) is degree \(n\), then the degree of \(f(a)\) as a polynomial in \(a\) is \(n\).
- To understand all solutions, analyze the degrees and special cases, such as constant, linear, quadratic, etc.

I'll implement a program that:

- Tests polynomials of increasing degree from 0 up (say up to degree 3 for feasibility).
- Checks whether the polynomial satisfies the given condition for various sample \(x\) values.
- Uses symbolic computations for an efficient, exact approach.
- Since the problem wants a streaming approach, it will print each polynomial candidate as it confirms they satisfy the condition for tested points and then check more points for certainty.

Below is a Python program to perform this search using SymPy, which allows symbolic polynomial manipulation.

```python
from sympy import symbols, Poly, expand, Eq, solve, srepr
x = symbols('x')

# Function to evaluate polynomial at a point
def evaluate_poly(poly, val):
    return poly.subs(x, val)

# Function to check the equation for specific sample points
def check_polynomial(poly, sample_points):
    for pt in sample_points:
        left = evaluate_poly(poly, pt) * evaluate_poly(poly, 2 * pt**2)
        right = evaluate_poly(poly, 2 * pt**3 + pt)
        if left != right:
            return False
    return True

# Generate candidate polynomials up to degree 3
# For efficiency, fix leading coefficients and test systematically
solutions = []

# Degrees to consider
for degree in range(0, 4):
    # Coefficients as symbolic variables
    coeffs = symbols(f'a0:{degree+1}')
    # Polynomial with symbolic coefficients
    poly = sum(c * x**i for i, c in enumerate(coeffs))
    # Generate sample points
    sample_pts = [0, 1, -1, 2]
    # Build equations that must hold at sample points
    eqs = []
    for pt in sample_pts:
        left = evaluate_poly(poly, pt) * evaluate_poly(poly, 2 * pt**2)
        right = evaluate_poly(poly, 2 * pt**3 + pt)
        eqs.append(Eq(left, right))
    # Solve the system
    sol = solve(eqs, coeffs, dict=True)
    if sol:
        for s in sol:
            # Construct the polynomial from solution
            candidate = sum(s[c] * x**i for i, c in enumerate(coeffs))
            print(f"Candidate polynomial: {candidate}")
            # Verify over more points for certainty
            if check_polynomial(candidate, [3, -2, 0.5]):
                print(f"Valid solution: {candidate}")
                solutions.append(candidate)

# Since the code is not meant to be run here, the above process is illustrative.
# To execute, save as enumerator.py and run 'python enumerator.py'.
