This problem involves counting matrices with specific bounds and summation divisibility properties. To assist in conjecturing the exact value, I will enumerate small matrices that satisfy these constraints, focusing on the potential minimum, maximum, and pattern-based solutions. The constraints are:

- Each entry is between 1 and 2^10, inclusive.
- For each row n, the sum of its entries modulo 2^n is 0.
- For each column n, the sum of its entries modulo 2^n is 0.

Given the complexity, I'll test small matrices (e.g., 3x3) with small entries to find possible candidates. I'll prioritize enumerating patterns that satisfy the divisibility, starting with minimal entries.

```python
# Enumerate matrices of size 3x3 with entries between 1 and 2^4 = 16 for manageability
import itertools

# Parameters
size = 3
max_entry = 16

answers = set()

# Helper function to check divisibility conditions
def valid_matrix(matrix):
    for n in range(size):
        row_sum = sum(matrix[n]) 
        col_sum = sum(matrix[i][n] for i in range(size))
        if row_sum % (2 ** n) != 0 or col_sum % (2 ** n) != 0:
            return False
    return True

# Generate all matrices with entries in 1..16
for entries in itertools.product(range(1, max_entry + 1), repeat=size*size):
    matrix = [list(entries[i*size:(i+1)*size]) for i in range(size)]
    if valid_matrix(matrix):
        # Convert matrix to tuple form for uniqueness
        matrix_tuple = tuple(tuple(row) for row in matrix)
        if matrix_tuple not in answers:
            answers.add(matrix_tuple)
            # Print the matrix
            print("Found valid matrix:")
            for row in matrix:
                print(row)
            print()

# Output total count at end
print(f"Total valid matrices found: {len(answers)}")
```
