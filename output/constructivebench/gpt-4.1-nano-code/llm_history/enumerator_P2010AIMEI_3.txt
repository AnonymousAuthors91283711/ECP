This problem asks for the value of \( P2010AIMEI_3 \) characterized by the existence of positive real numbers \( x, y \) satisfying the relations \( y = \tfrac{3}{4} x \) and \( x^y = y^x \), along with natural numbers \( r, s \) such that \( x + y = \frac{r}{s} \), \( r \) and \( s \) are coprime, and \( r + s \) equals the value of \( P2010AIMEI_3 \).

To approach this, I will:

- Parameterize \( y \) as \( y = \frac{3}{4} x \).
- Search for \( x \) and \( y \) satisfying \( x^y = y^x \).
- For each candidate \( x \), compute \( y \), then verify the equation \( x^y = y^x \). 
- Then, compute \( x + y \), find a rational approximation \( \frac{r}{s} \), check if \( r, s \in \mathbb{N} \), \( \gcd(r, s) = 1 \), and record \( r + s \).
- Only keep the smallest such sum or all within a small search range for clarity, since the exact symbolic solutions may be complicated.
- All computations will be approximate but sufficiently precise to identify candidate solutions.

Here's the code implementing this approach:

```python
import math
from fractions import Fraction
from math import gcd

# Search parameters
max_x = 4.0  # upper bound for x
step = 0.01  # incremental step for x

found_solutions = set()

x = 0.01
while x <= max_x:
    y = (3/4) * x
    # Compute x^y and y^x
    try:
        val1 = x ** y
        val2 = y ** x
    except:
        x += step
        continue
    # Check if they are close enough
    if abs(val1 - val2) < 1e-5:
        total = x + y
        # Approximate as a fraction
        frac = Fraction(total).limit_denominator(1000)
        r, s = frac.numerator, frac.denominator
        if gcd(r, s) == 1:
            sum_rs = r + s
            print(f"Found candidate with x={x:.2f}, y={y:.2f}, sum r+s={sum_rs}")
            found_solutions.add(sum_rs)
    x += step

# Output candidate sums
print("Candidate sums r + s:", sorted(found_solutions))
```
