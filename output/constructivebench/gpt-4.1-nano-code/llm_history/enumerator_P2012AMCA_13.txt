This problem appears to involve finding the least integer \( t \) such that there exist positive rational numbers \( p, h_1, h_2 \) satisfying certain equations linked to work times over three days (Monday to Wednesday). The equations relate to a typical optimization approach—probably to minimize \( t \) given these constraints.

Given the structure, we can:
- Choose small sample values for \( t \).
- For each \( t \), derive \( p, h_1, h_2 \) based on the given constraints.
- Check if the derived values satisfy the conditions.
- Since the constraints involve the work hours:
  - Monday: \( (p + h_1 + h_2)(480 - t) = 1/2 \)
  - Tuesday: \( (h_1 + h_2)(372 - t) = 24/100 = 0.24 \)
  - Wednesday: \( p(672 - t) = 1/2 \)

We will iterate over small \( t \) values, compute \( p, h_1, h_2 \), verify positivity and rationality conditions, and report solutions as we find them.

```python
# Enumerate t from a small range to find solutions satisfying the equations
# and positivity constraints. For each t, derive p, h1, h2 based on the equations. 
# Stop at first found solutions for each t and print them.

for t in range(0, 100):  # small sample of t values
    workTimeMon = 480 - t
    workTimeTue = 372 - t
    workTimeWed = 672 - t
    
    # To find p from the Wednesday equation: p * workTimeWed = 1/2
    if workTimeWed == 0:
        continue
    p = (1/2) / workTimeWed
    
    # Now, from the Tuesday equation: (h1 + h2) * workTimeTue = 0.24
    if workTimeTue == 0:
        continue
    h1_plus_h2 = 0.24 / workTimeTue
    
    # Using the Monday equation: (p + h1 + h2) * workTimeMon = 0.5
    sum_p_h1_h2 = 0.5 / workTimeMon
    
    # Derive h1 + h2 in terms of p
    # p + h1 + h2 = sum_p_h1_h2
    # h1 + h2 = sum_p_h1_h2 - p
    
    # Check if these are positive and consistent
    if p <= 0:
        continue
    h1_h2 = sum_p_h1_h2 - p
    
    # We need h1, h2 > 0 and h1 ≠ h2
    # Since h1 + h2 = known value, possible h1 and h2 satisfy:
    # h1 > 0, h2 > 0, h1 ≠ h2, and h1 + h2 = h1_h2
    
    # To enumerate h1, try values in a small rational range
    # For simplicity, test h1 in [0.001, h1_h2 - 0.001]
    # Let's consider h1 in steps
    step = 0.01
    found_solution = False
    h1_start = 0.001
    max_h1 = h1_h2 - 0.001
    if max_h1 <= h1_start:
        continue
    h1 = h1_start
    while h1 < max_h1:
        h2 = h1_h2 - h1
        if h2 > 0.001 and h2 != h1:
            # Check if (p, h1, h2) satisfy all constraints
            # p, h1, h2 are positive by construction
            # Also check h2 > 0
            print(f"t={t}, p={p:.4f}, h1={h1:.4f}, h2={h2:.4f}")
            found_solution = True
        h1 += step
    if not found_solution:
        # No solutions found for this t
        continue

The problem involves finding the minimum value of t (or similar extremal value) satisfying a set of equations and positivity constraints. The provided code attempts to enumerate t in a small range, derive p, h1, h2 for each t, and output solutions if any exist. It prints solutions as it finds them, which aligns with the requirement to stream partial results. However, it does not explicitly identify the minimal t or the extremal solution, nor does it check all t in a way to guarantee that the first found solutions include the minimal t.

Furthermore, the code's enumeration is limited to t in [0, 99], which might be insufficient if the actual minimal t exceeds this range. Also, it prints multiple solutions for each t but does not keep track of the minimal t overall, nor does it output an explicit answer per the problem statement. The output from the current program is empty because perhaps no solutions are found within this small t range, or due to floating-point issues.

Per Problem Requirements:
- The code should output the minimal t satisfying the conditions.
- It should do so by examining all candidate values up to a threshold, then output that minimal t explicitly.
- The code structure should be adjusted to find and print the minimal t rather than just solutions per t.

Given the above, I consider this program as not fully compliant because it does not identify nor output the minimal t solution explicitly, nor does it handle the full automatic enumeration as intended. Therefore, I reject it and provide a corrected, more robust version.

**Corrected Program:**

```python
# Enumerate t from 0 to 200 to find valid solutions, tracking the minimal t
min_t = None
min_solution = None

for t in range(0, 201):
    workTimeMon = 480 - t
    workTimeTue = 372 - t
    workTimeWed = 672 - t
    
    # Skip if any work time is zero or negative (no longer meaningful)
    if workTimeMon <= 0 or workTimeTue <= 0 or workTimeWed <= 0:
        continue
    
    # Compute p from Wednesday equation: p * workTimeWed = 1/2
    p = (1/2) / workTimeWed
    
    if p <= 0:
        continue
    
    # From Tuesday: (h1 + h2) * workTimeTue = 0.24
    h1_plus_h2

The problem statement appears to be a formal representation involving a least element in a set of tuples satisfying certain equations related to work or time constraints. The provided code does not include any implementation, only an import statement, some theorem statements with `sorry`, and an indication that the enumeration resulted in an error (since no code was provided).

**Judgement:**
- The original program is empty and contains only formal Lean theorem placeholders without any executable code or enumeration logic.
- The enumeration results in an error, indicating the code does not produce any answers.
- Given the problem's nature (finding least `t` satisfying some algebraic conditions), a proper program should attempt to explore candidate `t` values, check the equations' validity, and identify the minimal `t`.

**Conclusion:**
The program, as provided, does not meet the requirements: it is empty, unexecutable, and does not compute or enumerate answers.

**Therefore: <<<False>>>**

```python
# Corrected program: enumerate candidate t values and check the equations
# We choose a small range for t, say from 0 to 150, based on the problem context.

        # To avoid division by zero, skip if any work time is zero or negative
        if workTimeMon <= 0 or workTimeTue <= 0 or workTimeWed <= 0:
            continue

        # Solve for p, h1, h2 if possible
        # From first equation:
        # (p + h1 + h2) * workTimeMon = 1/2 => p + h1 + h2 = 1/(2 * workTimeMon)

        sum_ph1h2 = 1 / (2 * workTimeMon)

        # From second equation:
        # (h1 + h2) * workTimeTue = 24/100 = 0.24
        sum_h1h2 = 0.24 / workTimeTue

        # From third:
        # p * workTimeWed = 1/2 => p = 0.5 / workTimeWed

        p = 0.5 / workTimeWed
        h1_h2 = sum_ph1h2
