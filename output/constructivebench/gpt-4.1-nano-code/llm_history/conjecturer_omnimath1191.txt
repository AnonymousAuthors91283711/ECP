noncomputable abbrev omnimath1191_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath1191
    (x y z w : ℝ)
    (h : 2 * x + y + z + w = 1 ∧ x + 3 * y + z + w = 2 ∧ x + y + 4 * z + w = 3 ∧ x + y + z + 5 * w = 25) :
    w = omnimath1191_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 5.500000000000001
. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the linear system, the solution for \(w\) is consistent with the average of the right-hand sides, weighted inversely by the coefficients. From enumeration, the value is approximately 5.5.  
Final answer: <<<5.5>>>
