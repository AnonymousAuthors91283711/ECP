[write_program]
This is a formal theorem in Lean, involving a combinatorial or number-theoretic problem about functions `s : Fin 6 → ℕ` with certain properties, and sums equal to 79. The problem asks for the greatest element satisfying the constraints, which include strict monotonicity, divisibility conditions, and a sum. Since the task is to enumerate solutions to help conjecture or prove the result, we will generate candidate functions satisfying the constraints, then identify the maximum.

Key points:
- `s` is a strictly increasing function from a 6-element finite set to ℕ
- For all `i` in `Fin 5`, `s (i+1) % s i = 0`
- Sum of `s` over all elements is 79
- Find the greatest such `s`

To simplify, we'll:
- Represent `s` as a list `[s0, s1, s2, s3, s4, s5]` with `s0 < s1 < ... < s5`
- Given sum constraints, and conditions involving divisibility
- For efficiency, limit the search space to manageable small numbers

Below is a Python program enumerating candidate sequences satisfying constraints, tracking the maximum `s`.

```python
# Enumerate all strictly increasing sequences s of length 6 with sum 79
# where for each i in 0..4, s[i+1] % s[i] == 0

max_sequence = None
max_sum = 0

# To limit computation, set upper bounds for s0 based on sum constraints
for s0 in range(1, 80):  # s0 >=1
    for s1 in range(s0+1, 80):
        if s1 % s0 != 0:
            continue
        for s2 in range(s1+1, 80):
            if s2 % s1 != 0:
                continue
            for s3 in range(s2+1, 80):
                if s3 % s2 != 0:
                    continue
                for s4 in range(s3+1, 80):
                    if s4 % s3 != 0:
                        continue
                    # Compute s5 as the remaining to reach sum 79
                    s5 = 79 - (s0 + s1 + s2 + s3 + s4)
                    if s5 > s4 and s5 < 80:
                        # Check divisibility condition
                        if s5 % s4 == 0:
                            current_sum = s0 + s1 + s2 + s3 + s4 + s5
                            if current_sum == 79:
                                sequence = [s0, s1, s2, s3, s4, s5]
                                print(sequence)
                                # Track maximum sequence based on total sum or lex order
                                if sum(sequence) > max_sum:
                                    max_sum = sum(sequence)
                                    max_sequence = sequence

print("Maximum sequence:", max_sequence)
```
