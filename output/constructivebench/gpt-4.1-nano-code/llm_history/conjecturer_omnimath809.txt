The pattern suggests that for specific positive parameters, the function value aligns with a quadratic form. Since the given values include positive, negative, and fractional values, and considering the function's symmetry around certain points, the simplest closed-form answer consistent with the pattern is a constant. The enumerated choices and symmetry imply that 75 is a plausible constant value fitting the observed data.
