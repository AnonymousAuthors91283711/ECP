This problem appears to be a simple algebraic equation involving a parameter \( k \). The goal is to find the value of \( k \) satisfying the equation \( 2k + 1 = 4k - 5 \), and then formalize this in Lean. To assist in conjecturing and verifying, we'll write a Python program that enumerates candidate solutions for \(k\) over some small set, checks the exact equation, and prints solutions immediately when they satisfy the equation.

Since \( k \) is a real number, but we cannot enumerate all reals, we'll choose a small range with rational or integer candidates to find solutions. To maximize efficiency, we'll evaluate only a small set of candidate \(k\) values, say from -10 to 10, with step 0.1. We will use exact string matching for the equation.

Here's the Python code:

```python
# Enumerate candidate k values over a small range with step 0.1
import math

# Define the equation function
def equation(k):
    return abs(2 * k + 1 - (4 * k - 5)) < 1e-9

# Enumerate and print solutions
for i in range(-100, 101):
    k = i / 10.0
    if equation(k):
        print(f"Solution candidate: k = {k}")
```

This code tests values in [-10, 10] in steps of 0.1, checks if they satisfy the algebraic equation (within a small tolerance), and immediately prints solutions that are exact or close enough. It assists in conjecturing the exact solution which we expect to find algebraically.
