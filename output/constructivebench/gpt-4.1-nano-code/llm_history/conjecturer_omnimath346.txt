Given the pattern, the solutions correspond to specific real values where quadratic factors coincide. Enumerated values suggest the set of solutions is {-1, 0, 2}.

. Enumerated Answers: A = 6.000, x1 = (-3+0j), x2 = (2+0j)
A = 2.000, x1 = (-2+0j), x2 = (1+0j)
A = -0.000, x1 = (-1+0j), x2 = 0j. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
The error arises because in Lean, sets of real numbers are specified as `Set ℝ`, and elements are enclosed in curly braces `{}` without escape sequences like `\!`. The set \{-1, 0, 2\} should be written simply as `{ -1, 0, 2 }`.

Furthermore, the enumerated solution suggests the possible values of \(A\) are \(-0, 2, 6\); the corresponding \(x_1, x_2\) are complex roots of quadratic equations derived from these values, but for the answer set, only the \(A\) values matter here.

To match the pattern, the answer set should be explicitly:

```lean
{ -1, 0, 2 } -- but the enumeration indicates the actual solutions are A = -0, 2, 6
```

Given the enumeration, the core problem is that the set of \(A\) includes \(-0\) (which is just 0), 2, and 6.

Thus, the correct set in Lean syntax is:

```lean
{ -0, 2, 6 }
```

which simplifies to:

```lean
{ 0, 2, 6 }
```

The set notation should be:

```lean
{ 0, 2, 6 }
```

Final answer enclosed with delimiters as per instructions:

<<<{ 0, 2, 6 }>>>
