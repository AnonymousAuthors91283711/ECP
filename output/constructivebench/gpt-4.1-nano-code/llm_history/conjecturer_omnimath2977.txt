nabala(2,3) = 72. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The main issue is the misuse of an equality expression within an `abbrev` which expects an ℕ value, but was written as a Prop statement. The expression `3^3 * 3^2 = 3^5 = 243` is a Prop, not a value, and also contains chained equalities which are not valid for defining a constant.

From the enumeration, the value of `nabla 2 3` is 72. According to the definition of `nabla a b := a^b * b^a`, plugging in `a=2, b=3`, it evaluates to `2^3 * 3^2 = 8 * 9 = 72`. 

Thus, the correct answer should be a direct natural number representing this calculation: 72.

**Final fixed answer:**

<<<72>>>

This is the direct computation based on the definition, matching the enumerated value and ensuring the code compiles without type errors.
