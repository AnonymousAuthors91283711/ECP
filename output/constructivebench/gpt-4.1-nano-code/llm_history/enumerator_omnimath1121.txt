The problem code involves calculating the expected number of coins after 100 rounds, assuming each round increases coins by a factor of (1 + 1/100).

To approximate expected coins, the calculation is:
initial_coins * (1 + 1/100)^rounds
which numerically equals 1 * (1.01)^100.

Let's write a Python program that enumerates possible values of (1.01)^n for n up to 100, printing approximate and exact calculations for typical small samples, aiding in conjecture and proof.

```python
# Program to enumerate (1 + 1/100)^n for n up to 100
# Helps in understanding the expected coins after 100 rounds

import math

initial_coins = 1
rounds = 100
base = 1 + 1/100  # 1.01

for n in range(1, rounds + 1):
    expected_value = initial_coins * base ** n
    # Print both the exact float approximation and its integer base
    # including the exponent, to observe growth
    print(f"n={n}: (1 + 1/100)^{n} â‰ˆ {expected_value:.4f} (approximate), exact base={base}")
```

This code efficiently enumerates the expected outcome for each number of rounds, with precise information at each step, helping to identify the approximate value after 100 rounds.
