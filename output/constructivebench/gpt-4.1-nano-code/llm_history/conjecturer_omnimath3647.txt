201. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
Based on the pattern in enumerations, the set includes specific values related to the prime factorization or special values associated with the range constraints. Since 100, 101, and 201 are listed, and considering their distinct properties (like 101 being prime and 201 being composite), the set seems to contain these particular numbers, possibly indicating critical points where the summation behaves differently or hits the half value. Generalizing from these, the answer likely includes:

- 100 (boundary case),
- 101 (prime near boundary),
- 201 (beyond range, possibly a key point).

Thus, the closed form set uniting these points over ℕ is:

101
201. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The current proposed answer attempts to define a set using a comment inside the set declaration, which is invalid syntax in Lean. Additionally, from the enumeration, the set appears to include only the values 100, 101, and 201. To achieve a correct and closed-form answer matching the enumerations and generalizing from the pattern, I will define the set explicitly using set notation with these three elements.

Since the enumeration suggests specific critical values related to the particular sum behavior, and the problem asks for a set of natural numbers, the simplest correct closed-form is to directly define the set containing these points.

Final answer:

<<<{100, 101, 201}>>>

This set is a concrete, closed-form solution derived from the enumerations, and it is general enough to match the pattern observed.
