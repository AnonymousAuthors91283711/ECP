. Enumerated answers: Total sample cases satisfying the divisibility: 0. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests the sequence's exponential nature and divisibility condition lead to `a n 1000 - a n 1` being divisible by 100 only when certain parameters align. Since the pattern of a iterated power of 2 often relates to `2^{a n 1}`, and the divisibility constraint limits solutions, the total satisfying cases seem to depend on whether the initial `a n 1` divides the difference after iterated exponentials. Given the total cases satisfying the divisibility are 0, the only plausible general answer is 0.
