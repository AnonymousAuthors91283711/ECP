The problem involves analyzing inequalities involving integers r, s and rationals q, with conditions linking these. The theorem asks:

1. For all integers r, s satisfying certain inequalities, the ratio r/s is at least some value (omnimath894_answer).
2. For every rational q at least omnimath894_answer, there exist integers r, s satisfying the same inequalities with r/s = q.

Our goal: find the possible values of r/s that satisfy the inequalities, to approximate or determine the "answer" (omnimath894_answer). We can approach this by enumerating small integer pairs (r, s) that satisfy inequalities:

- 3r ≥ 2s - 3
- 4s ≥ r + 12

Since the problem seems to involve positively bounded ratios, constraints suggest s > 0.

**Approach:**

- Fix small s (say 1 to 20)
- For each s, compute bounds on r from inequalities
- Enumerate r within these bounds
- Calculate r/s
- Keep track of the minimal ratio that satisfies all inequalities
- Output candidate ratios

This helps approximate the lower bound (the value of omnimath894_answer). The minimal ratio found during enumeration could serve as an estimate.

```python
# Enumerate small integer pairs (r, s) satisfying the inequalities
# and track the minimal ratio r/s ready to conjecture (omnimath894_answer).

min_ratio = None
results = []

for s in range(1, 21):  # small sample s
    # From 3r ≥ 2s - 3 => r ≥ (2s - 3)/3
    r_lower = int((2 * s - 3) / 3)
    if (2 * s - 3) % 3 != 0:
        r_lower += 1  # ceiling for strict inequality

    # From 4s ≥ r + 12 => r ≤ 4s - 12
    r_upper = 4 * s - 12

    if r_lower > r_upper:
        continue  # no r satisfies inequalities for this s

    for r in range(r_lower, r_upper + 1):
        ratio = r / s
        results.append(ratio)
        if min_ratio is None or ratio < min_ratio:
            min_ratio = ratio
        print(f"r={r}, s={s}, r/s={ratio}")

# After enumeration, output the minimal found ratio (approximate answer)
print(f"Approximate minimal ratio: {min_ratio}")
```
