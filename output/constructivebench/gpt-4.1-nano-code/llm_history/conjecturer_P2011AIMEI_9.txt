Based on the given equation log_b(24 sin x) = 3/2 with base b = 24 cos x, and the bounds 0 ≤ x ≤ π/2, the problem reduces to algebraic manipulation relating sin, cos, and cot x. Since log_b(a) = c implies a = b^c, then 24 sin x = (24 cos x)^{3/2}. Substituting cot x = cos x / sin x and simplifying yields an explicit formula involving only constants and cot x. 

The expression simplifies to 288, consistent with the exponential form and algebraic manipulation.
