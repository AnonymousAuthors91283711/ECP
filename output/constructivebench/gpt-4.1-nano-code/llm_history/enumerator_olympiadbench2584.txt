The problem involves solving a logarithmic equation with parameters, which simplifies to examining when the logs are equal:

log_b(2x) (48 * 3^(1/3)) = log_b(3x) (162 * 2^(1/3))

Given the properties of logarithms, equality holds when the arguments and bases relate appropriately, but since the bases are different, we convert to common logs to analyze possible solutions.

To assist a conjecture, I'll test small sample values for x satisfying given inequalities, then check if the logs are equal or approximate equality, and identify candidate solutions. We'll scope x in a small range (e.g., positive values > 0) respecting the conditions.

```python
import math

# Conditions:
# 2*x > 0 => x > 0
# 2*x ≠ 1
# 3*x > 0 => x > 0
# 3*x ≠ 1

# We search x > 0, avoiding x=0, x=1/2, x=1/3

test_values = [i/10 for i in range(1, 100)]  # x in (0.1, 10)
for x in test_values:
    if abs(2 * x - 1) < 1e-8 or abs(3 * x - 1) < 1e-8:
        continue  # skip values where base arguments would be 1, invalid for log
    try:
        # compute logs
        lhs = math.log(48 * 3**(1/3), 2 * x)
        rhs = math.log(162 * 2**(1/3), 3 * x)
        # print approximate equality
        if abs(lhs - rhs) < 0.01:
            print(f"x = {x:.2f} makes logs approximately equal: {lhs:.3f} ≈ {rhs:.3f}")
            # check for exact equality
            if abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-8:
                print(f"Exact solution candidate at x = {x:.8f}")
    except ValueError:
        continue  # skip invalid log operations
```
