  Coprime P2018AMCA_19_answer.1 P2018AMCA_19_answer.2 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: (15, 4). Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ
The sum is over positive integers with prime factors only 2, 3, or 5, i.e., "smooth" numbers with 5 as the largest prime factor. It resembles the sum of reciprocals of all powerful or "5-smooth" numbers. The pattern suggests the sum equals 15/4, and the coprimality indicates numerator and denominator are coprime. Therefore, the simplified exact answer is <<<(15, 4)>>>.
