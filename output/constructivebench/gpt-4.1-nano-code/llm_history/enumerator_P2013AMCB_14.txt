The problem involves two recursively defined sequences \(a(n)\) and \(b(n)\) with initial conditions and recursive relations similar to Fibonacci sequences. We're asked to identify the least \(N\) such that at \(n=6\), both sequences equal \(N\) with the condition \(a_1 < b_1\).

To solve this, we'll:
- Generate all pairs \((a_1, a_2)\) and \((b_1, b_2)\) within small bounds (say 0 to 5) to keep the search space manageable.
- For each pair, compute \(a(6)\) and \(b(6)\).
- Find those pairs where \(a(6) = b(6) = N\), with \(a_1 < b_1\).
- Track the minimum such \(N\) across all candidates.

The code will print each candidate \(N\) immediately as discovered, and finally print the least \(N\) satisfying the conditions.

```python
# Enumerate sequences with small initial values and compare their 6th term.
def sequence_a(a1, a2, n):
    if n == 0:
        return a1
    elif n == 1:
        return a2
    else:
        return sequence_a(a1, a2, n-1) + sequence_a(a1, a2, n-2)

def sequence_b(b1, b2, n):
    if n == 0:
        return b1
    elif n == 1:
        return b2
    else:
        return sequence_b(b1, b2, n-1) + sequence_b(b1, b2, n-2)

min_N = None
# Search over small initial values to find minimal N
for a1 in range(6):
    for a2 in range(6):
        seq_a_6 = sequence_a(a1, a2, 6)
        for b1 in range(6):
            if b1 <= a1:
                continue  # enforce a1 < b1
            for b2 in range(6):
                seq_b_6 = sequence_b(b1, b2, 6)
                if seq_a_6 == seq_b_6:
                    N = seq_a_6
                    print(N)
                    if (min_N is None) or (N < min_N):
                        min_N = N

print("Least N:", min_N)
```
