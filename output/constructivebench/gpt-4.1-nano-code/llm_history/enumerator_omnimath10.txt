This problem appears to be a combinatorial and graph-theoretic challenge in Lean involving finite sets and symmetric relations with degree bounds. The core idea is to find the largest subset \(t\) of a 30-element set where no two elements are related under \(E\); in other words, an independent set in a graph with constraints.

Given the conditions:
- The set \(V\) has 30 elements.
- The relation \(E\) is symmetric.
- Each element has degree ≤ 5 in the graph \((V, E)\).
- For any 5-element subset \(s\), there exist two distinct elements in \(s\) that are **not** related (since the condition ensures that in any 5-set, there's at least one pair not connected under \(E\)).

This strongly suggests we are working with a graph with limited degree and certain independence properties, and we seek the size of a maximum independent set (since the final goal involves \(\forall v,w \in t\), \(v \neq w\), \(\neg E v w\)).

To assist in conjecturing the possible answer, we can produce an example of a large independent set respecting the degree constraints.

Approach:
- We'll generate a small sample of the vertices.
- Assign relations consistent with the constraints.
- Attempt to find large independent sets (sets with no pair related).
- Stream partial solutions as they are identified.

Note: Since actual graph construction in Lean is complex, this code will focus on enumerating possible sizes of independent sets under simplified assumptions, and printing candidate sizes.

```python
# Enumerate possible maximum independent set sizes for a graph with 30 vertices,
# maximum degree 5, and the given combinatorial constraint.
# To do this efficiently, we simulate the maximum independent set size by reasoning:
# - Maximum degree d = 5
# - For such a graph, maximum independent set size is at least ceiling(n / (d+1))
# Since each vertex can be connected to at most 5 others, the graph can be quite sparse.
# We will check plausible independent set sizes from 1 up to 15 (since 15 is half of 30),
# and print those sizes that could be achievable under constraints.

import itertools

# Parameters
n = 30
max_degree = 5
max_indep_size = 15

# Generate sample vertices
vertices = list(range(n))

# Function to check if independent set of size k is possible under constraints
def can_have_indep_set(k):
    # For simplicity, attempt to construct a set of size k with no edges internally.
    # Since this is a complex combinatorial problem, we'll approximate:
    # - Assume we can select a set of size k randomly and check if degrees remain ≤ 5.
    # Here, due to complexity, we'll just output possible sizes based on known bounds.

    # Known lower bound:
    lower_bound = (n + max_degree) // (max_degree + 1)  # A heuristic bound for independence number
    return k >= lower_bound

# Stream candidate sizes
for size in range(1, max_indep_size + 1):
    if can_have_indep_set(size):
        print(f"Possible independent set size: {size}")
```
