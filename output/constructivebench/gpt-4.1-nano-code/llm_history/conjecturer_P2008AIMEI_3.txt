theorem P2008AIMEI_3 :
  ∃ (b j s : ℕ),
    2 * b + 3 * j + 4 * s = 74 ∧
    4 * b + 2 * j + 3 * s = 91 ∧
    b^2 + j^2 + s^2 = P2008AIMEI_3_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 314
. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The system of equations can be solved to express b, j, s in terms of the parameters. The pattern indicates the sum of squares approaches the sum of the solutions related to these equations. By analyzing the patterns, the sum appears to be a quadratic expression in terms of coefficients, leading to the final sum. 

Thus, the sum of squares is a specific value inferred from the pattern and the given answer.

<<<(74^2 + 91^2 + 84^2) / 2>>>
