The problem involves analyzing a second-order linear recurrence relation defined by parameters \( x, y \), and identifying the set of \( y \)-values that satisfy a certain equality involving terms of the recurrence. The recurrence is:

\[
a_{n+2} = x a_{n+1} + y a_n,
\]
with initial conditions \( a_0 = a_0 \), \( a_1 = a_1 \). The statement involves finding a natural number \( m \) such that:

\[
a_{m+3} - a_{m+1} = a_{m+1} - a_m,
\]
or equivalently,

\[
a_{m+3} - 2 a_{m+1} + a_m = 0.
\]

Given the recurrence, we aim to find possible \( y \) values for which such an \( m \) exists that satisfies this relation for *some* initial conditions \( a_0, a_1 \).

To probe solutions, I will select small samples for initial conditions, and for a fixed \( x \), I will iterate over plausible \( y \) values, checking the relation for small \( m \) (say, up to 3 to keep the enumeration sparse and efficient). We'll print each candidate \( y \) as soon as it satisfies the relation for some initial conditions and \( m \).

Here's a Python program to check such \( y \) values over a small grid, assuming randomly chosen initial conditions, for \( m=0,1,2,3 \). It will print all such \( y \) that *could possibly* satisfy the condition.

```python
import numpy as np

# Parameters: Fix x for simplicity; choose x=1 for illustration
x = 1.0

# We will treat y in the range -10 to 10 with a step of 0.5
y_values = np.arange(-10, 10.5, 0.5)

# For each y, we test multiple initial conditions
initial_conditions = [
    (0, 1),
    (1, 0),
    (1, 1),
    (-1, 2),
    (0.5, -0.5)
]

# max m to check
max_m = 3

# Record answers in a set to avoid duplicates
answers_found = set()

for y in y_values:
    for a0, a1 in initial_conditions:
        # Generate sequence up to m+3
        a = [a0, a1]
        for n in range(2, max_m+4):
            a_next = x * a[n-1] + y * a[n-2]
            a.append(a_next)
        # Check for each m if the relation holds
        for m in range(max_m+1):
            lhs = a[m+3] - 2 * a[m+1] + a[m]
            if abs(lhs) < 1e-6:
                print(f"y = {y:.2f} satisfies for m={m} with init ({a0},{a1})")
                answers_found.add(y)
                # Once found for one initial condition, no need to check more for this (y,m)
                break
print("Candidate y-values:")
for y in sorted(answers_found):
    print(f"{y:.2f}")
```
