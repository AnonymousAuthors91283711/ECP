The problem involves finding parameters \( a, b \) such that the quadratic equations \( a x + b = x^2 \) have two distinct solutions \( x_1, x_2 \), and the averages align with given conditions. The goal is to determine \( a + b \) for the specific point \((5, 101)\). 

Given the conditions:
- There exist two distinct solutions \( x_1, x_2 \) to the quadratic equations.
- For two distinct solutions \( A = (A_1, A_2) \) and \( B = (B_1, B_2) \), if they satisfy the parabola conditions and \( A_1 \neq B_1 \), then their averages are \( 5 \) and \( 101 \) respectively.

By analyzing the problem, it reduces to:
- The parabola \( y = a x + b \) intersects the quadratic \( y = x^2 \) at two points \( x_1, x_2 \) for some \( a, b \).
- These solutions satisfy the quadratic: \( x^2 - a x - b = 0 \).

Suppose that for the point \((5, 101)\), the parabola passes through \((5, 101)\):
\[ 101 = 5a + b \Rightarrow b = 101 - 5a \]

Now, the quadratic equation becomes:
\[ x^2 - a x - (101 - 5a) = 0 \]

We want two distinct solutions:
\[ \Delta = a^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-101 + 5a) \]
\[ \Delta = a^2 + 4(101 - 5a) \]
\[ \Delta = a^2 + 404 - 20a \]

To have real and distinct solutions, \( \Delta > 0 \):
\[ a^2 - 20a + 404 > 0 \]

Factor or analyze this quadratic inequality:
\[ a^2 - 20a + 404 > 0 \]
Discriminant of the quadratic in \(a\):
\[ D_a = (-20)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times 404 = 400 - 1616 = -1216 < 0 \]

Since the quadratic \(a^2 - 20a + 404\) has a negative discriminant, it is always positive for all real \(a\). Therefore, the quadratic in \(a\) is always positive, meaning:

- For all real \(a\), the quadratic equation has two distinct real solutions.

From the quadratic, the solutions for \(x\) are:
\[ x_{1,2} = \frac{a \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{2} \]

The sum of the solutions:
\[ x_1 + x_2 = a \]

The product of the solutions:
\[ x_1 x_2 = -101 + 5a \]

Since the problem involves the average of \(\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} = 5\), and the mean of the two solutions:
\[ \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} = 5 \Rightarrow x_1 + x_2 = 10 \]
\[ \Rightarrow a = 10 \]

Correspondingly:
\[ b = 101 - 5a = 101 - 50 = 51 \]

Finally, the sum \( a + b \):
\[ a + b = 10 + 51 = 61 \]

Below is a brute-force enumeration program for verifying and exploring potential solutions over small parameter ranges:

```python
# Program to enumerate small integer candidates for a, b and verify the conditions
# derived from the problem to check for the value of a + b consistent with conditions

for a in range(-100, 101):
    for b in range(-100, 101):
        # The specific point (5, 101) on the line a*x + b
        if a * 5 + b != 101:
            continue
        # Quadratic: x^2 - a x - b = 0
        discriminant = a**2 + 4*(101 - 5*a)
        if discriminant < 0:
            continue
        root_disc = discriminant**0.5
        # Solutions
        x1 = (a + root_disc) / 2
        x2 = (a - root_disc) / 2
        # Check distinct roots
        if abs(x1 - x2) < 1e-6:
            continue
        # Check if solutions are real
        if not (x1 != x2):
            continue
        # Check the midpoint condition:
        # (A.1 + B.1)/2 = 5
        mid_x = (x1 + x2) / 2
        if abs(mid_x - 5) > 1e-6:
            continue
        # The corresponding y-values:
        y1 = a * x1 + b
        y2 = a * x2 + b
        # Verify they satisfy y = x^2
        if abs(y1 - x1**2) > 1e-6 or abs(y2 - x2**2) > 1e-6:
            continue
        # Output the candidate solutions and the sum a + b
        print(f"a={a}, b={b}, a+b={a+b}")
```
