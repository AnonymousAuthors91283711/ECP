This problem involves finding natural numbers `k` such that the product of their digits equals a specific linear expression involving `k`. The expression `(25 * k) / 8 - 211` suggests the values are likely integers, so I will check integers `k` within a reasonable range, verify whether the digit product matches the expression, and collect all such `k`. Since the problem involves a sum over these `k`, I will output all solutions within a certain range. This approach is efficient because we only check candidate `k` up to a small limit determined through reasoning.

```python
# Enumerate k values where digit product might match (25 * k) / 8 - 211
# Since (25 * k) / 8 - 211 should be an integer, check only such k
# Determine an appropriate range by solving for when RHS is non-negative
# We check k from 0 up to a certain limit to find all solutions.

def digit_product(n):
    product = 1
    while n > 0:
        d = n % 10
        if d == 0:
            return 0
        product *= d
        n //= 10
    return product

solutions = []

for k in range(0, 10000):  # Chosen upper limit; can be adjusted based on problem context
    rhs = (25 * k) / 8 - 211
    if rhs.is_integer() and rhs >= 0:
        rhs_int = int(rhs)
        if digit_product(k) == rhs_int:
            print(k)  # Stream results
            solutions.append(k)

# Sum of all k satisfying the condition
answer = sum(solutions)
print("Answer:", answer)
```
