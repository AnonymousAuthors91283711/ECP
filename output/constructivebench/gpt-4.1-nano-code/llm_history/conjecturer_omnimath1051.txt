. Enumerated answers: W 555 2 mod 1000 = 875. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the recurrence W n k and the pattern from the enumerated answer, I observe that W 555 2 mod 1000 = 875, likely implying a pattern involving powers and composition. Generalizing this, when k=2, W n 2 simplifies to n^{n^{n-1}} mod 1000. Therefore, the final answer should reflect this power tower pattern.

<<<875>>>
