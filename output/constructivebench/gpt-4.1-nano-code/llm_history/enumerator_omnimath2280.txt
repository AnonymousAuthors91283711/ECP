This problem involves analyzing the set \( S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2 \) defined by the simultaneous equations:

\[
\begin{cases}
p_2^4 - p_2^2 = 0 \\
p_1 p_2^3 - p_1 p_2 = 0 \\
p_1^3 p_2 - p_1 p_2 = 0 \\
p_1^4 - p_1^2 = 0
\end{cases}
\]

We want to find the number of solutions in \( S \) (the cardinality). The equations can be factorized:

- \( p_2^4 - p_2^2 = p_2^2(p_2^2 - 1) = 0 \Rightarrow p_2 = 0 \text{ or } p_2^2 = 1 \Rightarrow p_2 = 0, \pm 1 \).
- \( p_1^4 - p_1^2 = p_1^2 (p_1^2 - 1) = 0 \Rightarrow p_1 = 0, \pm 1 \).

The other two equations:

- \( p_1 p_2^3 - p_1 p_2 = p_1 p_2 (p_2^2 - 1) = 0 \), which is satisfied if:

  (a) \( p_1=0 \),

  (b) \( p_2=0 \),

  (c) \( p_2^2=1 \Rightarrow p_2 = \pm 1 \).

- \( p_1^3 p_2 - p_1 p_2 = p_1 p_2 (p_1^2 - 1) = 0 \), satisfied if:

  (a) \( p_1=0 \),

  (b) \( p_2=0 \),

  (c) \( p_1^2=1 \Rightarrow p_1=\pm1 \).

Hence, to find solutions:

- Generate combinations where \( p_1 \in \{0, \pm 1\} \),
- and \( p_2 \in \{0, \pm 1\} \),
- and check if they satisfy the equations, but since the equations' factorizations cover all solutions completely, any combination of \( p_1 \) and \( p_2 \) in these sets that satisfy all equations is a solution.

Now, enumerate all combinations:

Total candidates: \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \),
but some might be extraneous which we verify based on the equations.

It is evident that all combinations with these values satisfy the equations due to the factorizations, hence solutions are all 9 pairs:

\[
\{ (-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1) \}
\]

The total cardinality is 9.

Here's a Python enumeration code that verifies the solutions explicitly and counts them:

```python
# Enumerate all candidate solutions based on factorization:
possible_p1 = [-1, 0, 1]
possible_p2 = [-1, 0, 1]
solutions = []

for p1 in possible_p1:
    for p2 in possible_p2:
        # Check the equations:
        eq1 = p2**4 - p2**2 == 0
        eq2 = p1 * p2**3 - p1 * p2 == 0
        eq3 = p1**3 * p2 - p1 * p2 == 0
        eq4 = p1**4 - p1**2 == 0
        if eq1 and eq2 and eq3 and eq4:
            print((p1, p2))
            solutions.append((p1, p2))

# Output the total number of solutions
print("Total solutions:", len(solutions))
```

This code will list all solutions immediately and count them, confirming the total solutions are 9, consistent with the algebraic analysis.
