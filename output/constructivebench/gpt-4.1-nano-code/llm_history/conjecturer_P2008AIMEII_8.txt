theorem P2008AIMEII_8 : 
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ ∃ (k : ℤ), sin (n * (n + 1) * (π / 2008)) = k} P2008AIMEII_8_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n=251 yields sin=±1; condition 63252/2008 ≈ 31.500 ≈ 31.5
n=752 yields sin( n(n+1)(π/2008) )=0; since 566256 divisible by 2008. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The given data suggests the sine function hits ±1 when the argument is an odd multiple of π/2, i.e., when n(n+1)(π/2008) = (2m + 1) * π/2. Solving for n, the minimal positive integer n satisfying this relates to n(n+1) ≈ 2008(2m+1)/2, especially for m=0 to find minimal n, which gives n=251. Sorting the infinitely many solutions, the least n where such sin hits ±1 is n=251.
