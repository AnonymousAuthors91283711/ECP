This problem involves analyzing a family of quartic equations parametrized by \(k\), specifically those quartic equations \(r^4 + k r^3 + r^2 + 4k r + 16 = 0\), and counting the number of solutions for each \(k\). The goal appears to be to identify the set of all \(k \in \mathbb{R}\) such that the equation has exactly one real solution. 

To approach this computationally:
- For small \(k\), I will enumerate \(k\) over a small range.
- For each \(k\), find the roots of the polynomial.
- Count the real roots.
- Identify the set of \(k\) where exactly one real root exists.
- Report the extremal \(k\) values with this property.

Due to the complexity of symbolic solutions in Python, we will use a numerical approach with a root-finding primitive suitable for polynomials, such as numpy's `np.roots`, which computes polynomial roots exactly (but complex roots may be complex). We then filter for real roots, considering roots with negligible imaginary parts as real.

Here's an efficient approach:

```python
import numpy as np

# Define range of k to explore
k_values = np.linspace(-10, 10, 200)  # small range with finer sampling
results = []

for k in k_values:
    # Polynomial coefficients for r^4 + k r^3 + r^2 + 4k r + 16
    coeffs = [1, k, 1, 4 * k, 16]
    roots = np.roots(coeffs)
    # Consider roots with small imaginary part as real
    real_roots = [r.real for r in roots if abs(r.imag) < 1e-8]
    # Count unique real roots (considering numerical tolerance)
    unique_real_roots = []
    for r in real_roots:
        if not any(abs(r - ur) < 1e-6 for ur in unique_real_roots):
            unique_real_roots.append(r)
    n_real = len(unique_real_roots)
    # Record k if exactly one real root
    if n_real == 1:
        print(f"k = {k:.3f} yields exactly one real solution.")
        results.append(k)

# Output the minimum and maximum such k
if results:
    print(f"Minimum k with exactly one real root: {min(results):.3f}")
    print(f"Maximum k with exactly one real root: {max(results):.3f}")
else:
    print("No values of k found with exactly one real root in given range.")
```
