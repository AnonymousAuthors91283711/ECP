This problem appears to involve summations related to factorials, rational numbers, and an inequality involving exponential functions. To assist in conjecturing, we'll systematically explore small values of `n` to compute `e`, and then check whether the inequality `g > n^( (999/1000) * n )` holds, where `g` is the denominator of the sum `e`. Since factorials grow quickly, we'll limit `n` to small values and evaluate the sum and the inequality to gather evidence.

```python
import math
from fractions import Fraction

# Function to compute the sum e = sum_{k=0}^n 1/(k!)
def compute_e(n):
    total = 0.0
    for k in range(n + 1):
        total += 1 / math.factorial(k)
    return total

# Enumerate small n values to observe behavior
max_n = 20
results = []

print("n, sum_e, numerator, denominator, denominator as int, n^( (999/1000)*n )")
for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
    e_value = compute_e(n)
    # Approximate numerator and denominator of e as a fraction
    # To get the approximate fraction, use the continued fraction or approximation
    # but for simplicity, we use fractions with limited denominator
    frac = Fraction(e_value).limit_denominator(10**6)
    f_num = frac.numerator
    f_den = frac.denominator
    # Compute the RHS: n^((999/1000)*n)
    rhs = n ** ((999/1000) * n)
    # Check whether the inequality g > rhs
    inequality_holds = f_den > rhs
    print(f"{n}, {e_value:.8f}, {f_num}, {f_den}, {f_den}, {rhs:.4f}")
    results.append((n, e_value, f_num, f_den, rhs, inequality_holds))
```
