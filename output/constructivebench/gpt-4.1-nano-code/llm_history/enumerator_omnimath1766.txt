This problem involves finding the greatest natural number \( n \) such that there exists a finite set of points \( s \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2 \) with \( |s| = n \), and the property that **every** 3-element subset of \( s \) contains two points exactly distance 1 apart. To approach this efficiently, I will:
- Construct candidate sets with increasing size.
- Check if such sets satisfy the property.
- Once I find the maximum \( n \) for which the property holds, I output that \( n \).

A key insight:
- The property that in **every** 3-point subset, two are at distance 1 suggests a strong rigidity. For small sets, configurations like equilateral triangles of side 1, or points arranged in a way preventing larger groups without violating the property, are typical.

Because the problem asks for enumeration and maximum size, I will:
- Choose small sample configurations covering common patterns.
- Check systematically up to a threshold (say, \(n \leq 10\))
- Print any valid sets found, and finally, the maximum \(n\).

Here's an efficient enumeration:

```python
import itertools
import math

def dist(p, q):
    return math.hypot(p[0] - q[0], p[1] - q[1])

# Generate points with possible configurations
# For efficiency, limit candidates to a small grid or known patterns
def check_property(s):
    for t in itertools.combinations(s, 3):
        if not any(dist(p, q) == 1 for p, q in itertools.combinations(t, 2)):
            return False
    return True

max_card = 0
max_set = None

# Sample candidate sets:
# 1. Equilateral triangle of side 1 (size 3)
triangle = [(0,0), (1,0), (0.5, math.sqrt(3)/2)]
if check_property(triangle):
    print(f"Found set of size 3: {triangle}")
    max_card = 3
    max_set = triangle

# 2. Square of side 1 (size 4), check if property holds
square = [(0,0), (1,0), (1,1), (0,1)]
if check_property(square):
    print(f"Found set of size 4: {square}")
    max_card = 4
    max_set = square

# 3. Larger configurations: try adding points at distance 1 from existing points
# Attempt to build larger sets, e.g., the vertices of a regular hexagon
hexagon = [(math.cos(k * math.pi/3), math.sin(k * math.pi/3)) for k in range(6)]
if check_property(hexagon):
    print(f"Found set of size 6: {hexagon}")
    if 6 > max_card:
        max_card = 6
        max_set = hexagon

# 4. Combine points to increase size cautiously
# For simplicity, test union of known structures
candidate_points = [
    (0,0),(1,0),(0.5, math.sqrt(3)/2),
    (1.5, math.sqrt(3)/2),
    (0.5, -math.sqrt(3)/2),
]

if check_property(candidate_points):
    print(f"Found set of size {len(candidate_points)}: {candidate_points}")
    if len(candidate_points) > max_card:
        max_card = len(candidate_points)
        max_set = candidate_points

# Final answer: maximum found
print(f"Maximum size n: {max_card}")
print(f"Corresponding set: {max_set}")
```
