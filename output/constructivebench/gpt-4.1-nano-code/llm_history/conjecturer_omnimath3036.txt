. Enumerated answers: 17. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern of enumerated answers suggests the total sum K + L + M + N equals 17, fitting the problem’s constraints and ensuring the algebraic equality holds. Confirming the simplified constant sum provides the consistent answer across cases. Thus, the closed-form solution is 17.
