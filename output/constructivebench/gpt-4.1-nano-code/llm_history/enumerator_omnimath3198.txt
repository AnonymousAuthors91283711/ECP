The problem asks to find a unique natural number \( x \leq 10 \) satisfying the equation \( 3x + 2(10 - x) = 26 \). We need to enumerate possible solutions to verify the answer.

The solution involves solving the linear equation for \( x \) within the specified range. I will generate all \( x \) from 0 to 10, check which satisfy the equation, and identify the unique solution.

```python
# Enumerate all x from 0 to 10
for x in range(11):
    # Check if x satisfies the equation 3x + 2(10 - x) == 26
    if 3 * x + 2 * (10 - x) == 26:
        print(x)
        # Once found, since the solution is unique, stop the enumeration
        break
```
