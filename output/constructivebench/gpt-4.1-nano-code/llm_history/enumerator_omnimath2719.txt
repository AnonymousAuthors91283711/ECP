This problem appears to involve counting integer pairs (i, j) within a bounded set such that their product equals 12, then taking the ratio of the number of such pairs over 36, and examining this ratio as a real number. 

Since \( S \) is explicitly given as all pairs (i, j) with 1 ≤ i,j ≤ 6 and i * j = 12, we need to enumerate all such pairs to find the count, then compute their ratio over 36.

Let's enumerate all pairs:
- i divides 12, and 1 ≤ i ≤ 6
- For each i, check if j = 12 / i is an integer within 1 ≤ j ≤ 6

Possible i values are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 (since 1 ≤ i ≤ 6 and i divides 12)
- i=1: j=12/1=12 (outside 1..6) → discard
- i=2: j=12/2=6 (valid)
- i=3: j=12/3=4 (valid)
- i=4: j=12/4=3 (valid)
- i=6: j=12/6=2 (valid)

Pairs: (2,6), (3,4), (4,3), (6,2); total = 4.

Thus, S.ncard = 4.

The ratio is 4/36 = 1/9.

The program will enumerate these pairs explicitly, compute the count, and then the ratio.

```python
# Enumerate all pairs within the specified bounds where i * j = 12
pairs = []
for i in range(1, 7):
    for j in range(1, 7):
        if i * j == 12:
            pairs.append((i, j))
            print(f"Pair found: ({i}, {j})")  # Stream partial results

count = len(pairs)  # Total pairs
ratio = count / 36  # Compute ratio

print(f"Total pairs: {count}")
print(f"Ratio: {ratio}")
```
