The problem involves finding quadruples of integers \((a, b, c, d)\) satisfying the four equations:

1. \(a^2 - b^2 - c^2 - d^2 = c - b - 2\)
2. \(2ab = a - d - 32\)
3. \(2ac = 28 - a - d\)
4. \(2ad = b + c + 31\)

Given the difficulty of solving these equations directly, a practical approach is to pick a small range for the variables and enumerate all quadruples satisfying the equations within that range. This will help in forming conjectures or bounds about the solution set.

```python
# Enumerate solutions for small integer ranges
# Variables in range -20 to 20 for feasible computation
for a in range(-20, 21):
    for b in range(-20, 21):
        for c in range(-20, 21):
            for d in range(-20, 21):
                # Check all four equations
                eq1 = a**2 - b**2 - c**2 - d**2 == c - b - 2
                eq2 = 2 * a * b == a - d - 32
                eq3 = 2 * a * c == 28 - a - d
                eq4 = 2 * a * d == b + c + 31
                if eq1 and eq2 and eq3 and eq4:
                    print((a, b, c, d))
```
