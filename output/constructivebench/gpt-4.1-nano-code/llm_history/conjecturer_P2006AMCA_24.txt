Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests summing over all \( a \) such that \( a \) is even, with the sum involving sums over \( b, c \). The partial sums indicate a quadratic pattern with respect to \( a \). Given the pattern, the total sum can be expressed as \(\boxed{ \frac{(n/2+1)(n+2)}{2} }\) for \( n=2006 \). This fits the pattern of cumulative sums and the structure of the partial sums.

<<<(2006 / 2 + 1) * (2006 + 2) / 2>>>
