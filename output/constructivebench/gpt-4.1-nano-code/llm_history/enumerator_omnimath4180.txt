The given code references `Mathlib`, which is a Lean theorem-proving library, and an incomplete theorem involving natural numbers, divisibility, and binomial coefficients. To translate this into a Python enumeration task, we need to understand the core conditions: for each `m` ≥ 2, the condition involves checking for all `n` with `m/3 ≤ n ≤ m/2` whether `(m - 2n)` divides `choose n (m - 2n)`.

Our goal: Enumerate the `m` that satisfy this condition for small values, demonstrating the possible answers.

Approach:
- For small `m` (say 2 to 20), iterate through suitable `n` in `[ceil(m/3), floor(m/2)]`.
- For each `n`, check if `(m - 2n)` divides `choose n (m - 2n)`.
- If the condition holds for all such `n`, collect `m`.
- Print each candidate `m` immediately.

Note: To verify divisibility, Python's `math.comb` can compute binomial coefficients, and divisibility check is straightforward. This helps us approximate the set of `m` satisfying the condition.

```python
import math
from math import ceil, floor

# Function to check the condition for a given m
def check_m(m):
    start = ceil(m / 3)
    end = floor(m / 2)
    for n in range(start, end + 1):
        a = m - 2 * n
        if a <= 0:
            continue
        try:
            binom = math.comb(n, a)
        except ValueError:
            # binom undefined for invalid n, a
            return False
        if binom % a != 0:
            return False
    return True

# Enumerate m from 2 to 20
for m in range(2, 21):
    if check_m(m):
        print(m)
```
