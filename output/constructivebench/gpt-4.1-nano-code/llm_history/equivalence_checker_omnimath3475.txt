theorem omnimath3475 (x : ℝ) (hx : x < -2) :
  IsLeast {y : ℝ | y = x ∨ y = x + 2 ∨ y = (1/2) * x ∨ y = x - 2 ∨ y = 2 * x} (omnimath3475_answer x) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun x => 2 * x
Proposed Answer: fun x => -2 * (x + 2)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the least element in the set {x, x+2, (1/2)x, x-2, 2x} when x < -2.

2. Ground truth answer claims the least element is 2x.

3. Proposed answer claims the least element is -2*(x+2).

Let's evaluate for x = -3 (which satisfies x < -2):
- Set elements: -3, -1, -1.5, -5, -6
- Least element is -6 (which is 2x)
- Proposed answer gives -2*(-3+2) = -2*(-1) = 2, which is not in the set and certainly not the least element.

The proposed answer doesn't even produce a value from the given set, and is clearly incorrect compared to the ground truth.
