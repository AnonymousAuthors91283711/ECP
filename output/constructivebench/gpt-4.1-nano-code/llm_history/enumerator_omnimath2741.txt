[write_program]
The problem appears to be the computation of the expression \((-2)^3 - (-3)^2\), and your goal is to find the exact answer and set it as `omnimath2741_answer`. 

We will write a simple Python script that evaluates this expression exactly and prints the result. Since the problem is straightforward, the code will directly compute the value and print it immediately, fulfilling the requirements.

```python
# Compute the expression (-2)^3 - (-3)^2
result = (-2)**3 - (-3)**2

# Immediately print the exact answer
print(result)
```
