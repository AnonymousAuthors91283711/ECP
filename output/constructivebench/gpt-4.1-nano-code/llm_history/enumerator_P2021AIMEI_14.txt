This problem appears to involve understanding the divisors of powers of integers, prime factors, and a minimal n satisfying certain divisibility conditions. To analyze and conjecture the answer, I will:

- Fix small values for n and a to enumerate the sum of divisors of a^n.
- Check the divisibility condition: whether 2021 divides (sum of divisors minus 1).
- Collect all candidate minimal n, then identify the least such n.
- Verify the sum of prime factors of that n.

Since 2021 = 43 * 47, it's a key divisor. We'll write code to iterate over small n and a, compute the sum of divisors, check divisibility, and find the minimal n satisfying the property.

```python
import math

# Function to compute all divisors of a number
def get_divisors(num):
    divisors = set()
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(num)) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            divisors.add(i)
            divisors.add(num // i)
    return divisors

# Function to check the divisor sum condition
def check_condition(a, n):
    num = a ** n
    divisors_sum = sum(get_divisors(num))
    return (divisors_sum - 1) % 2021 == 0

# Search for minimal n satisfying the condition for small a
candidate_ns = []
max_a = 50  # limit to keep computation reasonable
max_n = 50  # limit for n

for a in range(1, max_a + 1):
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        if check_condition(a, n):
            candidate_ns.append((n, a))
            print(f"n={n}, a={a}")

# Find minimal n among candidates
if candidate_ns:
    min_n, min_a = min(candidate_ns, key=lambda x: x[0])
    # Compute sum of prime factors of min_n
    def prime_factors(x):
        factors = set()
        for p in range(2, int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1):
            while x % p == 0:
                factors.add(p)
                x //= p
        if x > 1:
            factors.add(x)
        return factors

    total_prime_sum = sum(prime_factors(min_n))
    print(f"\nAnswer candidate: n={min_n}")
    print(f"Sum of prime factors of {min_n} is {total_prime_sum}")
```

This code systematically searches small n and a to find the minimal n that satisfies the divisibility property, then reports the candidate. It helps conjecture the true answer without hardcoding or direct assumptions.
