The problem appears to be asking for the product \( e \times f \) given the conditions:

1. \( \frac{e}{f} = \frac{3}{4} \),
2. \( \sqrt{e^2 + f^2} = 15 \).

From the first, \( e = \frac{3}{4}f \).

Substitute into the second:
\[
\sqrt{\left(\frac{3}{4}f\right)^2 + f^2} = 15,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
\sqrt{\frac{9}{16}f^2 + f^2} = 15,
\]
\[
\sqrt{\frac{9}{16}f^2 + \frac{16}{16}f^2} = 15,
\]
\[
\sqrt{\frac{25}{16}f^2} = 15,
\]
\[
\frac{5}{4}|f| = 15,
\]

so
\[
|f| = \frac{15 \times 4}{5} = 12,
\]

and thus \( f = \pm 12 \).

Correspondingly:

- When \( f=12 \), \( e = \frac{3}{4} \times 12=9 \),
- When \( f=-12 \), \( e= \frac{3}{4} \times (-12) = -9 \).

The products:

- \( e \times f = 9 \times 12=108 \),
- \( e \times f = -9 \times -12=108 \).

In both cases, the product is 108.

```python
# Enumerate the solutions based on the computed values.
# Given the constraints, the product e*f always equals 108.
# We verify that both solutions produce the same product.

# Possible f values based on the second condition.
f_values = [12, -12]
products = []

for f in f_values:
    e = (3/4) * f
    product = e * f
    print(product)  # immediate output
    products.append(product)

# Confirm that solutions yield the same product.
# The output will be 108 for both, confirming the answer.
```
