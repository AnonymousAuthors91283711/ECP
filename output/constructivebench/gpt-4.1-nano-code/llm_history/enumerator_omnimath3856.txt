The problem appears to involve analyzing all pairs (m, n) within the interval [1, k], where k ≥ 2, to determine whether the divisibility condition \( k \mid (n^{n-1} - m^{m-1}) \) holds only when m = n.

To assist with conjecturing, I will write a Python script that:

- Fixes small values of k starting from 2 upwards.
- Checks all pairs (m, n) with 1 ≤ m, n ≤ k, m ≠ n.
- Determines whether \(k \mid n^{n-1} - m^{m-1}\).
- Reports any counterexamples where the divisibility condition fails.

This script will seek the smallest k for which no such counterexamples exist, suggesting the property might hold for that k.

```python
# Enumerate k starting from 2 upwards to find the minimal k satisfying the property.
# For each k, check all pairs (m, n) in [1, k], m != n, for divisibility condition.
# If a counterexample is found, quickly report and continue to next k.
# Stop after a certain threshold or upon finding the smallest k with the property.

MAX_K = 50  # limit search up to k=50 for efficiency
for k in range(2, MAX_K + 1):
    counterexample_found = False
    for m in range(1, k + 1):
        for n in range(1, k + 1):
            if m == n:
                continue
            diff = pow(n, n - 1, k) - pow(m, m - 1, k)
            if diff % k == 0:
                print(f"Counterexample for k={k}: m={m}, n={n}")
                counterexample_found = True
                break
        if counterexample_found:
            break
    if not counterexample_found:
        print(f"All pairs in [1,{k}] satisfy the property.")
        break
```
