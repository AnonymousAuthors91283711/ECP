The problem appears to involve finding a list of 4 rational numbers that are all of the form 1/(n+1), are distinct, sum to 1, and satisfy the properties given. 

Since each term is of the form 1/(n+1), to make the sum 1, we need to find four distinct positive integers n+1 such that the sum of their reciprocals is exactly 1. The sequence is strictly decreasing as n increases. To contain manageable computations, we choose small integers for n+1.

Let's iterate over small integers n+1 in a range, generate the reciprocals, check the sum equals 1, and enumerate such solutions.

Here's the code implementing this idea:

```python
# Enumerate all combinations of 4 distinct positive integers n+1 in range 2 to 20
import itertools
from fractions import Fraction

results = []
max_n = 20

# Generate list of possible terms: 1/(n+1)
terms = [Fraction(1, n+1) for n in range(1, max_n)]

# Iterate over all combinations of 4 distinct terms
for combo in itertools.combinations(terms, 4):
    if sum(combo) == 1:
        # Check if all are of the form 1/(n+1) (which they are)
        # Convert to float for the list
        answer_list = [float(q) for q in combo]
        # Ensure pairwise distinct
        if len(set(answer_list)) == 4:
            print(answer_list)
```

This code searches for all quadruples of distinct reciprocals with denominators from 2 to 21 whose sum is exactly 1, and prints each valid list immediately.
