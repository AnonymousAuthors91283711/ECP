The pattern suggests the sum of squares is 1989, and the maximum is a perfect square \( n^2 \). To satisfy these, the maximum \(\max(a, b, c, d)\) likely equals \( 44^2 \), as the sum of four positive squares approximates 1989. The total sum \( m^2 \) should then be \( 12^2 \), matching the sum distribution. So, the solution must be \( (m, n) = (12, 44) \).

<<<(12, 44)>>>
