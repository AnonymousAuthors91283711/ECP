This problem appears to be about analyzing the expression \((x+1)^2 - x^2\). Algebraically, \((x+1)^2 - x^2 = (x^2 + 2x +1) - x^2 = 2x + 1\). To assist in conjecturing and verifying this, I'll write a Python script that enumerates several values of \(x\) over a small range and outputs the differences, focusing on exact expressions rather than approximations.

Given the problem, the answer for any real \(x\) should be \(2x + 1\). Since the task emphasizes streaming partial results, I'll generate outputs for a few sample points. Also, I will print the function's sample parameters (sample inputs) and their corresponding outputs to help see the pattern.

```python
# Enumerate sample values of x and compute (x+1)^2 - x^2 to identify the pattern
sample_points = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 10]

for x in sample_points:
    answer = (x + 1)**2 - x**2
    # Based on algebra, answer should equal 2*x + 1
    print(f"x={x}: (x+1)^2 - x^2 = {answer}")
```
