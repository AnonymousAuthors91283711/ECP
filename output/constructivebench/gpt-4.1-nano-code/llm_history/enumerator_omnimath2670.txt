The problem involves solving the equation sqrt(100 - x) = 9 for x. Since sqrt(100 - x) = 9 implies 100 - x = 81, we get x = 19. To help verify and explore solutions, I'll implement a Python program that enumerates possible values of x around the plausible solution, considering the domain constraints, and displays exact solutions or close approximations.

```python
# Enumerate possible x values to find solutions to sqrt(100 - x) = 9
# The equation is valid for 100 - x >= 0 => x <= 100
# Exact solution: 100 - x = 81 => x = 19
# We will check values around 19 for clarity.

import math

# Define a small step for enumeration
step = 0.1
# Define the search range around the expected solution
start = 15
end = 25

# Enumerate and print solutions
x = start
while x <= end:
    try:
        lhs = math.sqrt(100 - x)
        # Check if the lhs is close to 9 within a small tolerance
        if abs(lhs - 9) < 1e-6:
            print(f"x = {x} (approximate solution)")
        # Also check for exact solution within floating point tolerance
        if abs(lhs - 9) < 1e-12:
            print(f"Exact solution: x = {x}")
    except ValueError:
        # Skip invalid sqrt computations
        pass
    x += step
```
