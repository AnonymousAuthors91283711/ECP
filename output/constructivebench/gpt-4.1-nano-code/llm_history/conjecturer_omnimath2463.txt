The constraints prevent consecutive zeros and three consecutive ones at overlapping positions; the sequence has length 10. This problem effectively counts binary sequences of length 10 with no two consecutive zeros and no triple consecutive ones. Such sequences correspond to the Fibonacci-like recurrence, with initial conditions adjusted accordingly. The resulting count for length 10 is the 11th Fibonacci number, which is 89, but considering constraints, the suitable total count is 28.
