The pattern indicates that each S i is based on gcd operations; the sum over 10 terms with specific gcd relations suggests a fixed total. Since each S i > 0 and is composed via gcd + 1, and the gcd cycle with 10 elements sums to 110, the total sum is 110, reinforcing the pattern of consistent gcd-based sums.

<<<110>>>
