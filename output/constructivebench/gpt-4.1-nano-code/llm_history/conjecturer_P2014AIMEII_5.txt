    eval (r + 4) (X ^ 3 + C a * X + C (b + 240)) = 0 ∧
    eval (s - 3) (X ^ 3 + C a * X + C (b + 240)) = 0 ∧

  S = {P2014AIMEII_5_answer} := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Candidates for b': []. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests b' is derived from b considering the transformations with shifts of 240. The conditions involve roots of cubic polynomials and their shifted versions. It appears that the absolute value of b captures a constant related to these shifts, likely leading to a simple expression involving 240's absolute value. Based on typical form and symmetry, the answer deduces to |240|.
