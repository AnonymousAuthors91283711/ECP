abbrev omnimath3456_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3456 :
  Real.sqrt (3 ^ 3 + 3 ^ 3 + 3 ^ 3) = omnimath3456_answer :=
sorry
. Enumerated answers: Calculated answer: 9.0
Exact answer: 9
Integer answer: 9. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Because \(\sqrt{3^3 + 3^3 + 3^3} = \sqrt{3 \times 27} = \sqrt{81} = 9\), the closed form is simply 9, which should be expressed as a real number. 

<<<9.0>>>
