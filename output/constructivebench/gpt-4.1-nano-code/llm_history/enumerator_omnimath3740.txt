This problem is about counting how many integers `k` in the range `1` to `332` satisfy that the most significant digit of `2^k` in base 10 is 4. By directly enumerating `k`, computing `2^k`, extracting its leading digit, and counting matches, we can find the exact answer.

Here's the approach:
- Loop `k` from 1 to 332.
- Compute `2^k`.
- Convert `2^k` to string to check the first character.
- Count how many have leading '4'.

This straightforward method is efficient for this range and will provide the exact count for the theorem.

```python
# Enumerate k from 1 to 332, compute 2^k, check if its first digit is '4'
count = 0
for k in range(1, 333):
    val = 2 ** k
    leading_digit = str(val)[0]
    if leading_digit == '4':
        print(f"k={k}, 2^{k}={val}")
        count += 1
print("Total count:", count)
```
