[write_program]
The problem seems to involve determining which of the given candidate real numbers (-1, -2/3, 2/3, 1, 14/3) satisfies a certain (unspecified) property. Since the property isn't specified, the best approach is to enumerate each candidate and check some condition or print each candidate as a potential answer, focusing on completeness and efficiency.

Given the context, I will write a Python program that:
- Enumerates each of the given candidate values
- Prints each candidate immediately when identified
- Checks an assumed property (if possible), or simply outputs all candidates as potential answers

Because the property isn't specified, we'll assume the task is to list candidates (could be the roots, solutions, etc.) and ensure the program streamlines the enumeration as intended.

```python
# List of candidate solutions as per the problem statement
candidates = [-1, -2/3, 2/3, 1, 14/3]

# Enumerate and print each candidate immediately
for x in candidates:
    print(x)
```
