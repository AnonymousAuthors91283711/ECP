The main issue with the proposed expression is the syntax of the if-then-else structure in Lean, which requires the full form `(if cond then a else b)`. The original expression incorrectly uses `then` immediately following a parenthesis without wrapping it into `if ... then ... else ...`. Additionally, the logic suggests that the answer is the average of the combined sums, which can be expressed directly with algebra based on the given sums. 

Given the enumerated answers, the combined average seems to depend on the sum of ys and the fixed sum of xs (which is 590 or 591). The pattern indicates that as `\(\sum y_i\)` increases, the overall average slightly increases beyond 23.6, reaching up to 24.0 when `\(\sum y_i = 610\). 

Since `∑ xs i / 20 = 30` implies `∑ xs i = 600`, and similarly for ys, the total sum of the combined arrays is `(∑ xs) + (∑ ys)`. The combined average is:

\[
\frac{\sum xs + \sum ys}{50} 
= \frac{600 + S_{y}}{50}
\]

If we look at the enumerated answers, they approximate:

\[
\frac{600 + S_{y}}{50}
\]

with `S_{y}` around 590 to 610.

Thus, a closed-form expression for the combined average in terms of `∑ y_i` is:

\[
\frac{600 + \sum y_i}{50}
\]

which matches the observed pattern and is free from complex branching.

**Final proposed answer in Lean:**

<<<
(600 + (∑ i, ys i : ℝ)) / 50
>>>

This expression precisely captures the combined average, aligns with the enumerated data, and avoids syntax errors in Lean.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The problem involves combining two sums with known averages:

- (∑ xs i)/20 = 30 → ∑ xs i = 600
- (∑ ys i)/30 = 20 → ∑ ys i = 600

Given these, the total sum:

∑ xs i + ∑ ys i = 600 + 600 = 1200

The combined average:

(∑ xs i + ∑ ys i) / 50 = 1200 / 50 = 24

The existing code attempted to define the answer as `(600 + (∑ ys i : ℝ)) / 50`, but `ys` is a variable, not a known sum at this point, which causes the error.

Since the sum of `ys` can vary, but is constrained only by the average (20), then the total sum ranges over all `∑ ys i` such that:

`∑ ys i ∈ ℝ` with `(∑ ys i)/30 = 20` (fixed value 600).

Thus, the total sum is always 1200, and the combined average:

(600 + ∑ ys i)/50 = (1200) / 50 = 24

Therefore, the answer is a constant 24, independent of the particular ys (since their sum is fixed by the average).

**Final answer:**

<<<24>>>

**Explanation:** Because the sums of `xs` and `ys` are fixed at 600 each due to their average constraints, the total sum over 50 elements is fixed at 1200, making their combined average always 24. This statement is fully independent of the specific `ys`, thus the answer should be the constant 24.
