This problem involves evaluating a infinite sum: \(\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (n+1) \left(\frac{1}{1998}\right)^n\). Recognizing this as a geometric series with a derivative component, we know the sum converges for \(|r| < 1\).

The series can be expressed in closed form:
\[
\sum_{n=0}^\infty (n+1) r^n = \frac{1}{(1 - r)^2}
\]
for \(|r| < 1\).

Choosing \(r = \frac{1}{1998}\), which is small enough for convergence:

Exact answer: \(\frac{1}{(1 - 1/1998)^2} = \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1997}{1998}\right)^2} = \left(\frac{1998}{1997}\right)^2\).

Below is a Python program that enumerates approximate values near this result for verification, including the exact form in symbolic form:

```python
# This program computes and enumerates the sum of the series:
# sum_{n=0}^âˆž (n+1)*(1/1998)^n
# The sum converges to (1 / (1 - 1/1998))^2 = (1998/1997)^2
# It prints the exact symbolic answer and some decimal approximations for verification.

from fractions import Fraction

# Parameters
r = Fraction(1, 1998)
# Exact sum
exact_sum = (Fraction(1998, 1997)) ** 2
print(f"Exact sum: {exact_sum} ({float(exact_sum)})")

# Approximate values for verification
# Enumerate partial sums up to n=50
sum_partial = 0
for n in range(51):
    term = (n + 1) * (r ** n)
    sum_partial += float(term)
    print(f"Partial sum up to n={n}: {sum_partial}")

# Since the series converges quickly, the partial sum at n=50 should be close to exact
```
