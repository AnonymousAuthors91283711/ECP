The problem is to find the greatest real number c such that for all sequences satisfying certain conditions, the average sum of the b_i's divided by n^(3/2) is at least c. Essentially, we want to identify the minimal possible value of the expression:

\[
\frac{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} b_i}{n^{3/2}}
\]

given the constraints on a_i and b_i.

Since the exact sequence structure is complex, we can try small values of n and examine minimal configurations to estimate the lower bound of this ratio.

- The key is that for fixed n, minimizing the sum of b_i (with the constraints) will give the lowest possible value of the ratio.
- As constraints require certain inequalities, the minimal sum of b_i occurs when b_i are as small as possible (b_i > 0 and even).

Let's consider minimal b_i, which are 2 (the smallest positive even number). To minimize the sum, choose all b_i = 2, then:

\[
\frac{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 2}{n^{3/2}} = \frac{2n}{n^{3/2}} = 2 \frac{n}{n^{3/2}} = 2 n^{1 - 3/2} = 2 n^{-1/2}
\]

which approaches 0 as n grows large. But for small n, let's compute explicitly for n=1, 2, 3, 4...

```python
# The goal is to approximate the minimal ratio for small n, choosing minimal b_i=2
import math

# List to store candidate ratios for small n
candidates = []

# Consider small n from 1 to 10
for n in range(1, 11):
    min_b_sum = 2 * n  # minimal total sum with b_i=2
    ratio = min_b_sum / (n ** 1.5)
    print(f"n={n}, sum_b={min_b_sum}, ratio={ratio}")
    candidates.append(ratio)

# The greatest lower bound c is the infimum of these ratios as n→∞, approaching 0
# But since the problem asks for the greatest c satisfying the inequality universally,
# and the ratios approach 0 as n grows, the greatest such c is 0.
# Here, we confirm ratios for small n and observe they decrease towards 0.
```

This script helps approximate the minimal value of the ratio; since ratios tend toward 0 as n increases, the greatest c satisfying the given inequality over all sequences is 0. Therefore, the answer is that the supremum of such c is 0, but since the ratios get arbitrarily close to 0, the greatest such c is exactly zero.

```python
# The estimated greatest lower bound c is 0.
print("The greatest c satisfying the conditions is approximately 0.")
```
