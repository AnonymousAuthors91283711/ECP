The problem asks to determine the number of pairs \((r, s)\) with \(r, s \in \{1, 2, \ldots, 100\}\) such that \(\mathrm{I} \cdot w^r = z^s\), where \(w = \frac{\sqrt{3} + i}{2}\) and \(z = \frac{-1 + i \sqrt{3}}{2}\).

Analyzing:
- Both \(w\) and \(z\) are roots of unity.
- Specifically, \(w = e^{i \pi/6}\), a 12th root of unity: \(w^{12} = 1\).
- And \(z = e^{i 2 \pi/3}\), a 3rd root of unity: \(z^3 = 1\).

The condition becomes:
\[
i \cdot w^r = z^s
\]
which simplifies to looking when the complex numbers are equal. Since \(w\) and \(z\) are roots of unity, and multiplying by \(i\) corresponds to a rotation by \(\pi/2\), the problem reduces to examining their powers and phases.

We can convert this into an equation involving exponents:
\[
i w^r = z^s
\]

Expressed in exponential form:
\[
i w^r = e^{i \pi/2} \cdot e^{i r \pi/6} = e^{i (\pi/2 + r \pi/6)} 
\]
and
\[
z^s = e^{i 2 s \pi/3}
\]

Equality requires:
\[
\pi/2 + r \pi/6 \equiv 2 s \pi/3 \pmod{2\pi}
\]
Divide through by \(\pi\):
\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{r}{6} \equiv \frac{2 s}{3} \pmod{2}
\]

Since the left and right are rational multiples of \(\pi\), focus on their equivalence modulo 2, which corresponds to multiples of \(2\pi\). We only need to check for \(r, s \in \{1,\dots,100\}\).

Below is a Python script that enumerates all such \((r, s)\) pairs, counts them, and prints each matching pair immediately as found:

```python
# Enum rather than hardcoding any answer, directly search for pairs
count = 0
for r in range(1, 101):
    # Left side: (1/2) + (r/6)
    left = (1/2) + (r/6)
    for s in range(1, 101):
        # Right side: (2/3) * s
        right = (2/3) * s
        # Check if they are congruent modulo 2
        if abs((left - right) % 2) < 1e-9:
            print(f"r={r}, s={s}")
            count += 1
print(f"Total pairs: {count}")
```

This code systematically checks all \(r, s\) pairs for the congruence condition, immediately prints each matching pair, and at the end outputs the total count.
