The problem specifies the minimal number m such that for each odd integer n, there is a cycle containing an element congruent to n mod 1024, with all cycles non-empty. The key is 1024 = 2^10, so the problem reduces to the covering of all odd residues modulo 2^10. Since there are 512 odd residues mod 1024, at least 512 cycles are needed to cover all odd residues, and each cycle having at least one element. A minimal configuration occurs when each cycle corresponds to one odd residue, so total m needs to be 512. 

Final answer: 

<<<512>>>
