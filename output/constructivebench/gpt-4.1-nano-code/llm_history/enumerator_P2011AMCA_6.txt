This problem involves solving a system of equations:  
1. \(3t + 2w + (w + 1) = 61\)  
2. \(2w = 3t\)

From the second equation, \(w = \frac{3t}{2}\). For \(w\) to be an integer, \(t\) must be even. Let's set \(t = 2k\) for some integer \(k\). Then \(w = 3k\).

Substitute into the first equation:  
\(3(2k) + 2(3k) + (3k + 1) = 61\)  
Simplify:  
\(6k + 6k + 3k + 1 = 61\)  
\(15k + 1 = 61\)  
\(15k = 60\)  
\(k = 4\)

Now find \(t, w, P2011AMCA_6_answer\):  
\(t = 2k = 8\)  
\(w = 3k = 12\)  
\(P2011AMCA_6_answer = w + 1 = 13\)

In code, we'll enumerate potential \(k\) values near the solution to verify and print answers.  

```python
# Enumerate values of k around the solution for validation
for k in range(0, 10):
    t = 2 * k
    w = 3 * k
    # Check if equations hold
    if 3 * t + 2 * w + (w + 1) == 61 and 2 * w == 3 * t:
        answer = w + 1
        print(answer)
```
