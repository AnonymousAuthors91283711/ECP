The problem appears to involve summing the reciprocals of quadratic expressions over a large range and approximating the sum's value. To investigate, we can approximate the sum numerically for small m values, especially focusing on key estimates, and look for potential closed-form approximations.

Our plan:
- For a small sample range (e.g., `n = 0..50`), compute the sum (which is a partial sum approximation).
- Use those partial sums to conjecture the exact value.
- Stream each approximation as it is computed to assist in evaluating the sum.

Since the problem shows a sum involving `1 / ((n+3)^2 - 4)`, note that:
`(n+3)^2 - 4 = (n+3-2)(n+3+2) = (n+1)(n+5)`.

Thus, the sum simplifies to summing over:
`1 / [(n+1)(n+5)]`.

We can further decompose using partial fractions:
`1 / [(n+1)(n+5)] = A / (n+1) + B / (n+5)`.

Solve for A and B:
`1 = A(n+5) + B(n+1)`,
`1 = (A + B)n + 5A + B`.

Matching coefficients:
- For n: `A + B = 0` → `B = -A`.
- Constant term: `5A + B = 1`.

Substitute B:
`5A - A = 1` → `4A = 1` → `A = 1/4`,
then `B = -1/4`.

Therefore,
`1 / [(n+1)(n+5)] = 1/4 [1/(n+1) - 1/(n+5)]`.

Sum over n=0..k:
`sum_{n=0}^{k} 1/4 [1/(n+1) - 1/(n+5)] = 1/4 [ (sum_{n=0}^{k} 1/(n+1)) - (sum_{n=0}^{k} 1/(n+5)) ]`.

This is telescoping:
- `sum_{n=0}^{k} 1/(n+1) = H_{k+1}` (the harmonic number).
- `sum_{n=0}^{k} 1/(n+5) = H_{k+4} - H_4` (since the sum from n=4 to n=k+4).

Thus, sum from n=0..k:
`(1/4)[H_{k+1} - (H_{k+4} - H_4)] = (1/4)[H_{k+1} - H_{k+4} + H_4]`.

Approximate harmonic numbers for small k, e.g., k=50.

Let's code this calculation, approximating the sum for n=0..50, and print the exact value for a small sample range.

```python
import math

# Function to compute harmonic number approximation
def harmonic(n):
    return math.log(n) + 0.5772156649 if n >= 1 else 0.0

# Range to compute sum over
k = 50

# Compute harmonic numbers
H_k1 = harmonic(k+1)
H_k4 = harmonic(k+4)
H_4 = harmonic(4)

# Sum approximation
sum_value = (H_k1 - H_k4 + H_4)/4
print(f"Sum over n=0..{k}: {sum_value}")

# For smaller range n=0..10
k_small = 10
H_k1_small = harmonic(k_small+1)
H_k4_small = harmonic(k_small+4)
sum_small = (H_k1_small - H_k4_small + H_4)/4
print(f"Sum over n=0..{k_small}: {sum_small}")

# Additional: Print partial sum explicitly for n=0..10 via direct sum
total = 0.0
for n in range(11):
    total += 1.0 / ((n+1)*(n+5))
print(f"Direct sum n=0..10: {total}")
```

This code estimates the sum and shows how it converges rapidly. The approximate sums suggest the sum approaches a constant, likely related to harmonic numbers, aiding in conjecturing the exact sum value.

---

**Note:** For larger `n`, the sum approaches `H_{k+1} - H_{k+4} + H_4` scaled by 1/4, and as `k` → ∞, the sum converges to a finite value, which can be approximated or proved analytically.

**This code helps decide the approximate value of the sum and can help in deducing the exact answer.**
