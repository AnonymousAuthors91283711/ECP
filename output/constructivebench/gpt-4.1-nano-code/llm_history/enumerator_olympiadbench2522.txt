This problem involves finding two time points \( t_1, t_2 \) within a total time constraint, such that certain linear relations involving paddle and swim speeds hold. The key equations reduce to a system of linear equations, and we're asked to find \( t_1, t_2 \) satisfying them. Given the parameters, it's straightforward to analyze and enumerate possible solutions for \( t_1, t_2 \), especially since the speeds and total time are fixed.

Let's analyze the equations:
- \( p \cdot t_1 + s \cdot (T - t_1) = s \cdot t_2 + p \cdot (T - t_2) \)
- \( p \cdot t_1 = s \cdot t_2 \)

Substituting the second into the first should produce explicit solutions:
- From \( p t_1 = s t_2 \Rightarrow t_2 = (p / s) t_1 \)
- Plug into the first:
  \[
  p t_1 + s (T - t_1) = s \left( \frac{p}{s} t_1 \right) + p (T - t_2)
  \]
  Simplify:
  \[
  p t_1 + s T - s t_1 = p t_1 + p (T - t_2)
  \]
  Notice \( p t_1 \) cancels on both sides:
  \[
  s T - s t_1 = p (T - t_2)
  \]
  But \( t_2 = (p / s) t_1 \), so:
  \[
  s T - s t_1 = p \left(T - \frac{p}{s} t_1 \right) = p T - \frac{p^2}{s} t_1
  \]
  Bring all terms to one side:
  \[
  s T - s t_1 - p T + \frac{p^2}{s} t_1 = 0
  \]
  Group terms:
  \[
  (s T - p T) + \left( -s t_1 + \frac{p^2}{s} t_1 \right) = 0
  \]
  \[
  (s - p) T + t_1 \left( -s + \frac{p^2}{s} \right) = 0
  \]
  Multiply through by \( s \) to clear denominator:
  \[
  (s - p) T s + t_1 (-s^2 + p^2) = 0
  \]
  \[
  (s - p) T s + t_1 (p^2 - s^2) = 0
  \]
  Then:
  \[
  t_1 = \frac{(s - p) T s}{p^2 - s^2}
  \]

Given \( p = 7 \), \( s = 2 \), \( T = 1.5 \):

- \( p^2 - s^2 = 49 - 4 = 45 \)
- \( (s - p) T s = (2 - 7) \times 1.5 \times 2 = (-5) \times 1.5 \times 2 = -15 \)

Thus:

```python
t1 = (-15) / 45 = -1/3 ≈ -0.333...
```

Since \( t_1 \) is negative, it's outside the feasible range \( [0, T] \). In particular, because \( t_1 \) is negative, the solution is invalid within the constraints.

Because of the symmetry, and for completeness, check \( t_2 = (p / s) t_1 = (7/2) \times (-1/3) = -7/6 ≈ -1.166...\), also outside the feasible interval.

Given the parameter values, no solutions exist with both times in the interval \( [0, T] \).

**In the code**, we will enumerate candidate \( t_1 \) and \( t_2 \) in small steps within the interval \( [0, T] \), check whether they satisfy the equations approximately (for robustness), and print solutions found.

```python
# Enumerate possible t1, t2 in [0, total_time] with small steps
# and check the equations.

def main():
    p = 7
    s = 2
    T = 1.5
    delta = 0.05
    solutions_found = []

    for t1 in [i * delta for i in range(int(T / delta) + 1)]:
        # t2 from equation p*t1 = s*t2 => t2 = (p/s)*t1
        t2 = (p / s) * t1

        # check if t2 within [0, T]
        if 0 <= t2 <= T:
            # Verify the first equation approximately
            lhs = p * t1 + s * (T - t1)
            rhs = s * t2 + p * (T - t2)
            # Second equation: p*t1 == s*t2
            eq2 = abs(p * t1 - s * t2) < 1e-6

            if abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-6 and eq2:
                answers = {
                    't1': t1,
                    't2': t2,
                    'total_time': T,
                    'condition': 'satisfied'
                }
                # Check if answer is within total_time and print
                print(f"Solution: t1={t1:.3f}, t2={t2:.3f}")
                solutions_found.append(answers)

main()
```
[refine_program]
The problem is about finding parameters \( t_1, t_2 \) satisfying certain conditions involving given speeds and total time. The original program appears to be a formal proof statement (in Lean) rather than an executable computational script. Our provided code snippet is only a snippet of proof logic, not an enumeration tool.

The sentence "Program outputs empty result" suggests that the program intended to search for solutions but produces none, possibly because of incorrect constraints or a lack of implementation.

Given the problem's requirements:

- We want to find specific candidate values for \( t_1, t_2 \).

- Since the code snippet uses specific parameter values (paddle_speed=7, swim_speed=2, total_time=1.5), but with no explicit enumeration or calculation in Python, the current code is non-executable and does not produce answers.

- The example "t1 = (-15)/45 = -1/3" indicates some calculation attempt but is outside the current code.

- The instructions say the code should be able to run with no input, print answers as soon as they are found, and enumerate possible solutions to find the extremal ones.

Therefore, **the original program is rejected** because it is not an executable enumeration script; it is a formal proof stub.

---

### Corrected approach:

- Write a Python program that explicitly enumerates candidate \( t_1, t_2 \) within the logical bounds (0 to total_time).

- Check the constraints analytically or numerically.

- Print each candidate solution as soon as it satisfies the equations, or approximate solutions if necessary.

- Use small sample values: since the problem fixes paddle_speed=7, swim_speed=2, total_time=1.5, we fix these.

- For efficiency, iterate over \( t_1, t_2 \) in small steps within [0, total_time].

- The problem involves equations:

\[
\begin{cases}
paddle_speed \times t_1 + swim_speed \times (total_time - t_1) = \text{some total} \\
swim_speed \times t_2 + paddle_speed \times (total_time - t_2) = \text{some total}
\end{cases}
\]

But the key is to find all \( t_1, t_2 \) satisfying the existing constraints, especially:

- \( p_s * t_1 = swim_speed * t_2 \
[refine_program]
The provided program contains only a Lean theorem stub with several assumptions and an 'sorry' placeholder for the proof. There is no executable code, no enumeration of candidate solutions, and no outputs. Because the problem asks for a Python program that can be run directly and enumerates candidate answers, this code does not meet the requirements at all. The problem statement is about a scenario involving swimming and paddle speeds, total time, and variables, which suggests there is a concrete solution or set of solutions that can be found with algebraic reasoning or enumeration.

My judgment is that the program should be accepted only if it actively enumerates candidate solutions and prints answers inline, which it does not. Therefore, it should be rejected.

Rejected.  
Below is a corrected Python program that:
- Uses specific sample values for the parameters,
- Solves the problem's equations,
- Enumerates candidate solutions for t₁ and t₂ within the bounds,
- Prints partial answers when found, and
- Outputs the extremal answer as per problem requirements.

```python
import math

# Given fixed speeds and total_time
paddle_speed = 7
swim_speed = 2
total_time = 1.5

# Parameters for enumeration
num_steps = 100  # number of subdivisions for t1 and t2
dt = total_time / num_steps

answers = []

for i in range(num_steps + 1):
    t1 = i * dt
    for j in range(num_steps + 1):
        t2 = j * dt
        # Check constraints
        if 0 <= t1 <= total_time and 0 <= t2 <= total_time:
            # Compute equations
            left_side = paddle_speed * t1 + swim_speed * (total_time - t1)
            right_side = swim_speed * t2 + paddle_speed * (total_time - t2)
            eq1 = math.isclose(left_side, right_side, rel_tol=1e-9)
            eq2 = math.isclose(paddle_speed * t1, swim_speed * t2, rel_tol=1e-9)
            if eq1 and eq2:
                # Compute the answer
                answer_value = total_time - (t1 + (total_time - t2))
                print(f"Found solution with t1={t1:.3f}, t2={t2:.3f}")
                answers.append(answer_value)

# Output the minimal and maximal
