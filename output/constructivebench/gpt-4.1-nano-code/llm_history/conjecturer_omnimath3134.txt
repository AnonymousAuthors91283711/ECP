theorem omnimath3134
(P Q R S : ℝ)
(hPQ : Q - P = 1)
(hQR : R - Q = 2 * (Q - P))
(hRS : S - R = 3 * (R - Q))
: S - P = omnimath3134_answer :=
sorry
. Enumerated answers: 9. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The differences are: Q - P = 1; R - Q = 2, so R - P = 3; S - R = 3 * 2 = 6, thus S - P = R - P + S - R = 3 + 6 = 9. 

Final answer:
<<<9>>>
