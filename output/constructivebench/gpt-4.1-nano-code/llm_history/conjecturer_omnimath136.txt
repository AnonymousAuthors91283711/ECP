Based on the pattern in enumerated answers, and considering the conditions on p, x, y, the final set contains primes p for which there exist positive integers x, y satisfying the given algebraic relation. The set of candidates appears to be {2, 3, 7}, as these primes fit typical solutions involving small positive x, y.

The set is exactly those primes p for which there exist positive x, y solving x*(y^2 - p) + y*(x^2 - p) = 5*p. Commonly, small primes p (2, 3, 7) satisfy such relations with small positive solutions.

Thus, the closed-form set is {2, 3, 7}.

Answer:
<<<{2, 3, 7}>>>
