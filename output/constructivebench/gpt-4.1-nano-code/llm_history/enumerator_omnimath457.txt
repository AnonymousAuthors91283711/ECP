This problem involves analyzing a graph formed over the set of pairs `(Fin 2 Ã— Fin 8)`, where adjacency is defined by steps in a grid. The goal is to determine the size of a specific set, likely related to the enumeration of certain permutations or paths under adjacency and move constraints.

To assist, I will enumerate all potential solutions satisfying the `moves` and adjacency rules, focusing on the structure of permutations or spanning sets, and output possible candidate sizes, asserting the count of such functions.

Since the problem seems to involve counting compatible permutations or functions with moves, I will:
- Use the parameters given to build the grid structure.
- Enumerate possible functions `m` that satisfy the given constraints.
- Count the number of such functions.

Given the small size of the grid (`Fin 2` and `Fin 8`), total grid points are `2*8=16`. The number of functions from 16 points to 16 points is enormous, so I narrow to specific candidates matching the properties, likely trying to find the total number of involutions or shift mappings under adjacency.

Here's a Python script to explore candidate counts (permutations that move each point to an adjacent point, covering all points, with certain move constraints). It will:
- Generate all functions (permutations) satisfying the move conditions.
- Count those that match the criteria.

```python
import itertools

# Define grid size
rows = 2
cols = 8

# Generate all points in the grid
points = list(itertools.product(range(rows), range(cols)))

# Define adjacency according to given rules
def is_adjacent(r1, r2):
    r1_i, r1_j = r1
    r2_i, r2_j = r2
    return (
        (r1_i == r2_i and abs(r1_j - r2_j) == 1) or
        (r1_j == r2_j and abs(r1_i - r2_i) == 1)
    )

# Generate all possible move functions: permutations moving each point to an adjacent point
candidate_movers = []
for perm in itertools.permutations(points):
    if all(is_adjacent(points[i], perm[i]) for i in range(len(points))):
        candidate_movers.append(perm)

# Count how many such permutations exist
print(f"Total move functions satisfying adjacency constraints: {len(candidate_movers)}")

# For the particular problem, count the fixed points or special properties if needed
# For now, just output the total number of candidates

# To match the set described, the set of functions where each point moves along the adjacency graph
# and the transformation is bijective (permutation), we output their count
```
