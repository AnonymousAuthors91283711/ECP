This problem asks to find natural numbers \(k\) and a finite index \(j\) (where \(j\) is in \(\{0,1,2,3,4,5\}\)) such that:
- The sum over \(i=0\) to 5 of \(\text{if } i = j \text{ then } 0 \text{ else } k + i\) equals 2012.
- The sum of the decimal digits of \(k + j\) (where \(j\) is the value of the finite index) equals the answer we seek.

To solve this, we iterate over all possible \(j\) in 0 to 5, then for each \(j\), find \(k\) such that the sum condition holds:
\[
\sum_{i=0, i \neq j}^5 (k + i) = 2012
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
\left(\sum_{i=0}^5 (k + i)\right) - (k + j) = 2012
\]
or
\[
6k + \sum_{i=0}^5 i - (k + j) = 2012
\]
\[
(6k - k) + 15 - j = 2012
\]
\[
5k + 15 - j = 2012
\]
\[
5k = 2012 - 15 + j = 1997 + j
\]
\[
k = \frac{1997 + j}{5}
\]

Since \(k\) must be an integer, only cases where \(1997 + j\) is divisible by 5 should be considered.

Then, for valid \(k\), compute the sum of digits of \(k + j\), and output all possibilities.

Here's the program:

```python
# Enumerate all j in 0..5 and compute corresponding k values
# Only consider k if (1997 + j) is divisible by 5
# For each valid (j, k), compute sum of digits of (k + j)

def digit_sum(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

for j in range(6):
    total = 1997 + j
    if total % 5 == 0:
        k = total // 5
        answer = digit_sum(k + j)
        # Output the found answer immediately
        print(answer)
```
