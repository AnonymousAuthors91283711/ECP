This problem involves enumerating all ways to insert plus signs between digits in a sequence to satisfy a divisibility condition. We'll choose a small example with 15 digits (all 1's) and generate all possible insertion patterns. For each pattern, we'll evaluate the sum and check divisibility by 30, then enumerate answers.

Given the problem's structure, we break it down:
- Generate all 2^14 possible insertion patterns (since there are 14 gaps).
- For each pattern, evaluate the sum of the concatenated digits with pluses.
- Count how many such sums are divisible by 30.

The implementation prioritizes efficiency by:
- Using binary patterns to generate insertion points.
- Evaluating sums efficiently.
- Immediately printing each sum that meets the divisibility condition.

Here is the Python code:

```python
# Enumerates all insertion patterns for 15 digits (all 1's)
# Evaluates sums with pluses inserted
# Prints sums divisible by 30
def evaluate_with_pluses(digits, pattern):
    total = 0
    current_number = digits[0]
    for i in range(len(pattern)):
        if pattern[i]:
            total += current_number
            current_number = digits[i + 1]
        else:
            current_number = current_number * 10 + digits[i + 1]
    total += current_number
    return total

digits = [1] * 15  # All digits are 1 for simplicity
n = len(digits)
divisible_sums = set()

# Generate all patterns (bitmask from 0 to 2^14 - 1)
for pattern_mask in range(1 << (n - 1)):
    pattern = [(pattern_mask & (1 << i)) != 0 for i in range(n - 1)]
    sum_value = evaluate_with_pluses(digits, pattern)
    if sum_value % 30 == 0:
        print(f"Sum: {sum_value} with pattern: {pattern}")
        divisible_sums.add(sum_value)
```
