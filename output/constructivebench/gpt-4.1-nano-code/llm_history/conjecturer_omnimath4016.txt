990. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The pattern suggests looking for three-digit numbers between 100 and 999 where the sum of the number and its digit reversal is a perfect square. All candidates are the sum of n and reverse(n). Based on enumeration, these sums correspond to perfect squares, e.g., 110+011=121=11^2, 143+341=484=22^2, etc. This pattern indicates that the answer set comprises numbers n between 100 and 999 where n + reverse(n) equals a perfect square. Final answer: <<< { n : ℕ | 100 ≤ n ∧ n ≤ 999 ∧ ∃ k, n + (n % 10 * 100 + (n / 10 % 10) * 10 + n / 100) = k * k } >>>
