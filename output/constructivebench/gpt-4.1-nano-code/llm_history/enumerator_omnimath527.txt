This problem appears to involve recursive sequences \( a(n) \) and \( b(n) \), with initial conditions and recurrences, and asks to determine the sum of a certain infinite series involving those sequences. To aid in conjecturing the sum, we'll implement an enumerator that simulates the sequences numerically, computes partial terms, and sums the series up to a certain cutoff. Since the problem likely involves seeking a special pattern or a closed-form, we'll generate values for small \( n \), approximate the series to identify convergence, and possibly detect simplified forms.

Given the initial conditions, we focus on computing sequences \( a(n) \) and \( b(n) \) for small \( n \), then calculate terms of the series \( b(n) \times (1 / a(n + 1) - 1 / a(n + 3)) \).

```python
# Enumerate sequences a(n), b(n), and partial series sums for small n.
# We select small n up to a cutoff, e.g., 50, for the series sum approximation.

def enumerate_sequences_and_series():
    # Initial conditions
    a = {1: 2015.0, 2: 2015.0}
    b = {1: 2013.0, 2: 2013.0}
    max_n = 50  # Limit for enumeration

    series_terms = []

    # Generate sequences up to max_n + 3 to evaluate the series terms
    for n in range(2, max_n + 3):
        # Compute a(n+1)
        if n + 1 not in a:
            a[n + 1] = (a[n - 1] - 1) * (b[n] + 1)
        # Compute b(n+1)
        if n + 1 not in b:
            b[n + 1] = a[n] * b[n - 1] - 1

        # Compute the series term if the indices are valid
        if n + 3 <= max_n + 3:
            denom1 = a[n + 1]
            denom2 = a[n + 3]
            # To avoid division by zero, skip or handle
            if denom1 != 0 and denom2 != 0:
                term = b[n] * (1 / denom1 - 1 / denom2)
                print(f"n={n}, a(n)={a[n]}, b(n)={b[n]}, term={term}")
                series_terms.append(term)

    # Sum the series terms to approximate the total
    total_sum = sum(series_terms)
    print(f"Approximate sum of series up to n={max_n}: {total_sum}")

[refine_program]
The original program attempts to generate sequences and series terms up to n=50, but it may encounter division by zero or fail to produce any terms if the denominators `a[n+1]` or `a[n+3]` become zero or if the sequence does not generate sufficient terms. It also only prints terms and the sum, not an answer as specified in the problem. Additionally, it does not print parameter values explicitly, nor does it determine the sum's limit or extremal values.

Given the problem's context—probably a sum involving sequences defined recursively, with an emphasis on streaming answers—I think the code's output is empty because the sequences may not produce valid terms, or the code doesn't handle zeros properly, leading to no printed series terms.

Therefore, the program should be rejected because it does not produce any partial results, and it does not follow the outlined requirements for answer streaming, parameter presentation, or correct enumeration.

### Corrected Program

```python
# Enumerate sequences a(n), b(n) with small n, and approximate the series sum.
# We will track the sequences and print all partial terms as they are computed.

def enumerate_sequences_and_series():
    # Initial conditions
    a = {1: 2015.0, 2: 2015.0}
    b = {1: 2013.0, 2: 2013.0}
    max_n = 50  # Set limit for n
    series_terms = []

    # Generate sequences up to n + 3 to evaluate series
    for n in range(2, max_n + 3):
        # Compute a(n+1) if not already computed
        if n + 1 not in a:
            a_prev = a[n - 1]
            b_curr = b[n]
            a[n + 1] = (a_prev - 1) * (b_curr + 1)
        # Compute b(n+1)
        if n + 1 not in b:
            a_curr = a[n]
            b_prev = b[n - 1]
            b[n + 1] = a_curr * b_prev - 1

        # Compute series term if possible
        denom1 = a[n + 1]
        denom2 = a[n + 3] if (n + 3) in a else None
        if denom2 is None:
            # Compute a(n+

The problem as provided involves a recursive sequence definition with initial values, and a sum over an infinite series. The existing code is incomplete (contains only a placeholder `sorry`), and the answer outputs an error message indicating no enumerable answers are produced.

**Analysis:**

- The problem involves sequences \(a_n, b_n\) defined recursively with initial values.  
- The series involves the terms \(b_n \left(\frac{1}{a_{n+1}} - \frac{1}{a_{n+3}}\right)\).  
- Typically, such problems are designed to have a telescoping sum or a closed-form solution that can be deduced by analyzing the recursion.

Given the current program is empty and outputs an error, **it must be rejected** because it does not enumerate or approximate any values.

**What the correction should do:**

- Implement an approach to analyze the recursion pattern, possibly find closed-form expressions or identify telescoping behavior.
- Enumerate partial sums for increasing \(N\), at least for small \(N\).
- Recognize the sum's behavior: only approximate or output an estimate.
- Provide serial outputs to match the problem (stream answers over execution).

Since the original code is missing and the answer is not provided, the minimal correction is to:

- Implement an enumeration over small \(N\) (say up to 10 or 20),
- Approximate the sum for each \(N\),
- Recognize the telescoping pattern, or directly compute the partial sum,
- Then, output the possible limit (which, if telescoping, might be the difference of the first and last terms).

Given this is a high-school level problem, the sum probably telescopes to a simple expression.

### Verdict:

- The original program is empty and produces no answers.  
- It must be rejected.

**Acceptance:** <<<False>>>

### Corrected Program:

```python
# Implement an approximation of the sum based on the recursive sequences
import math

def a(n):
    if n == 1 or n == 2:
        return 2015
    # For modeling, assume sequences stabilize; for small N, we compute directly
    # Here, we attempt to approximate recursively or, better, simulate the sequence
    
    # Since the recursion is complex, approximate using initial values and small iterations
    # For simplicity, assume a sequence that remains constant at 2015 as initial guess
    return
