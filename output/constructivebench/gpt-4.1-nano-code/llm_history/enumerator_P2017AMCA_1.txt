This problem involves finding the greatest natural number n of the form n = x + 3*y + 5*z, where x, y, z ∈ ℕ, and subject to the constraint x + 2*y + 3*z ≤ 8. The goal is to enumerate all possible values according to the given constraints and find the maximum n.

To do this efficiently, we can iterate over all possible non-negative values of x, y, z that satisfy the inequality x + 2*y + 3*z ≤ 8, then compute n = x + 3*y + 5*z for each valid triplet. Among these, we find the greatest value of n, and print each candidate as we go.

```python
# Enumerate all non-negative integer solutions for x, y, z
# satisfying the inequality x + 2*y + 3*z ≤ 8
# For each, compute n = x + 3*y + 5*z
# Keep track of the maximum n found

max_n = -1
for z in range(0, 3):  # 3*z ≤ 8 → z ≤ 2
    for y in range(0, (8 - 3*z) // 2 + 1):
        for x in range(0, 8 - 2*y - 3*z + 1):
            if x + 2*y + 3*z <= 8:
                n = x + 3*y + 5*z
                print(n)
                if n > max_n:
                    max_n = n
print("Maximum n:", max_n)
```
