[write_program]
The problem asks to count integers between 4 and 2014 (inclusive) such that:
- n ≡ 4 (mod 5)
- The sum of the digits of n (base 10) is even

To enumerate candidate answers, I will:
- Fix a small sample of n’s satisfying the conditions
- Search over all relevant n, to find the exact count

Let's write a Python program that iterates through 4 ≤ n ≤ 2014, checks the conditions, and prints each candidate n when the criteria are met. It will also count total such n, then output the total count at the end.

```python
# Enumerate all integers n from 4 to 2014 inclusive
# Conditions:
# 1. n mod 5 == 4
# 2. sum of digits of n is even

def digit_sum(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

count = 0
for n in range(4, 2015):
    if n % 5 == 4:
        if digit_sum(n) % 2 == 0:
            print(n)
            count += 1
print("Total count:", count)
```
