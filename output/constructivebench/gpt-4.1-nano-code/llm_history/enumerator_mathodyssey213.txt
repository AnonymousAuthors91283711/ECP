[write_program]
The problem appears to involve verifying or constructing an answer that relates an input to a specified exponential expression, possibly representing compound interest or exponential growth. Since the code mentions a noncomputable answer and a theorem equating it to `2658 * exp(0.09 * 15)`, and given the restriction to produce an enumerated list of potential answers, I will generate candidate values over certain ranges and print them immediately.

Here's a plan:
- Since the expression is `2658 * exp(0.09 * 15)`, we know the exponent part is fixed.
- To assist in conjecture, I will compute and print approximate values over small ranges of possible parameters (e.g., varying the input parameters or estimated exponent).

The code will:
- Iterate over small sample points (e.g., different interest rates or time periods).
- Compute the corresponding exponential expression.
- Print each candidate value immediately for analysis.

```python
import math

# Parameters to vary: rate and time, for illustration
rates = [0.08, 0.09, 0.10]     # small sample interest rates
times = [10, 15, 20]           # small sample periods

for r in rates:
    for t in times:
        answer = 2658 * math.exp(r * t)
        print(f"Rate: {r}, Time: {t}, Computed: {answer}")
```
