theorem olympiadbench2257 (i j : ℕ) (hi : i ≥ 1) (hj : j ≥ 1) :
  olympiadbench2257_answer (i, j) = 4 + 3 * (i - 1) + (3 + 4 * (i - 1)) * (j - 1) := by sorry

-- Example usage for 50th row and 40th column:
example : olympiadbench2257_answer (50, 40) = 4090 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun (i, j) => 4 + 3 * (i - 1) + (3 + 4 * (i - 1)) * (j - 1)
Proposed Answer: fun p => 4 + 3 * (p.1 - 1) + (3 + 4 * (p.1 - 1)) * (p.2 - 1)
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. Both answers compute the same mathematical expression, just with different variable naming (using a pair `p` vs individual components `i` and `j`). The structure of the formula is identical in both cases.
