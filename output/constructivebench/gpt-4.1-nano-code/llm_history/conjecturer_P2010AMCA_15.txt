Based on the structure of the equation, set `(Nat.choose 4 2) * p^2 * (1 - p)^2 = 1/6`, with `Nat.choose 4 2 = 6`, leads to `6 p^2 (1 - p)^2 = 1/6`. Simplify to find the roots: `p^2 (1 - p)^2 = 1/36`. Taking square root yields `p(1 - p) = ± 1/6`. Since `p` in `(0, 1/2)`, negative is invalid, so `p(1 - p) = 1/6`. Solving quadratic gives `p = (1 ± √5) / 2`, and the only valid in `(0, 1/2)` is `p = (3 - √5)/2`.

The goal is to find a value of p such that (choose 4 2) * p^2 * (1 - p)^2 = 1/6. We know choose 4 2 = 6, so the equation reduces to 6 * p^2 * (1 - p)^2 = 1/6, or p^2 * (1 - p)^2 = 1/36. 

This simplifies to the quadratic in p,:
p^2 (1 - p)^2 = (p(1 - p))^2 = 1/36.
So p(1 - p) = ± 1/6. Since p is in (0, 1/2), only the positive solution makes sense.

Set p(1 - p) = 1/6. Then we solve:
p - p^2 = 1/6,
p^2 - p + 1/6 = 0.

Quadratic formula gives:
p = [1 ± sqrt(1 - 4 * (1/6))]/2 = [1 ± sqrt(1 - 2/3)]/2 = [1 ± sqrt(1/3)]/2.

Thus, p = (1 ± 1/√3)/2. Since p < 1/2, select the smaller root:
p = (1 - 1/√3)/2.

Expressing this algebraically:

p = (1 - 1/√3)/2 = (√3 - 1)/(2√3).

Rationalize denominator to keep it in surd form:

p = (√3 - 1)/(2√3).

In Lean, we can write the value as (√3 - 1)/(2 * √3). Since we prefer a simplified surd form, the approximate value is about 0.2113, which is less than 1/2, consistent with the assumption p < 1/2.

The error in the user-provided answer stems from attempting to define the value as a fun p → ... function, but the abbreviation's type is ℝ (a constant), not a function. The correct way is to define P2010AMCA_15_answer as a specific constant.

**Final Fixed Answer:**

<<<(√3 - 1)/(2 * √3)>>>
