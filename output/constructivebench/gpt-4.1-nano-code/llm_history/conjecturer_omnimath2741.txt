. Current Proposed Answer: fun _ => -17. Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 34, which is at "fun _ => -17" in "abbrev omnimath2741_answer : ℤ := fun _ => -17", there is an error: type mismatch
  fun x => -17
has type
  (x : ?m.4) → ?m.286 x : Sort (max ?u.3 (?u.6 + 1))
but is expected to have type
  ℤ : Type
Possible Fix: Check if the expected type aligns with the provided type..
. Enumerated Answers: -17. Expected Answer Type: ℤ
The current definition attempts to assign `omnimath2741_answer` a function `fun _ => -17`, which has type `(x : ?m.4) → ℤ`, i.e., a function from some argument to an integer, but the expected type is simply an integer `ℤ`. Therefore, the fix is to replace the function with the concrete integer `-17`.

Since the enumeration confirms the answer is `-17`, the corrected answer should be:

<<<-17>>>

This fixes the type mismatch by directly assigning an integer of type ℤ, matching the expected answer type.
