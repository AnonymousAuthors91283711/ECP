This problem asks us to find all natural numbers \( N \) with \( 0 < N < 1000 \) for which there exists a real number \( x \) satisfying \( x^{\lfloor x \rfloor} = N \). The approach involves enumerating candidate \( N \) values between 1 and 999, and for each, checking if a real \( x \) exists such that \( x^{\lfloor x \rfloor} = N \). Typically, the key insight is to analyze the structure:

- For \( N \), find possible integer \( k = \lfloor x \rfloor \) with \( k \geq 1 \), since \( N \) is positive.
- For each \( k \), solve \( x^k = N \), which yields \( x = N^{1/k} \).
- Verify if this \( x \) has the floor \( k \), i.e., check whether \( \lfloor N^{1/k} \rfloor = k \).

Because \( \lfloor x \rfloor = k \), \( x \) must be in the interval \([k, k+1)\). 

Enumerate \( N \) from 1 to 999. For each \( N \), test candidate \( k \) from 1 up to, say, 10 (since higher \( k \) would produce very small \( N \)). For each case, check if \( N^{1/k} \in [k, k+1) \) to confirm the existence of such \( x \).

```python
# Enumerate N from 1 to 999, check for existence of x with x^{floor x} = N
answers = set()
for N in range(1, 1000):
    for k in range(1, 11):  # reasonable upper limit for k
        x = N ** (1 / k)
        if k <= x < k + 1:
            answers.add(N)
            print(N)  # immediate output upon finding a suitable N
            break  # no need to check larger k for this N

# Print total count of such N
print("Total such N:", len(answers))
```
