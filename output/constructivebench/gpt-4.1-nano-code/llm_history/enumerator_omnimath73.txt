The problem appears to relate to properties of a simple graph on 100 vertices, involving adjacency and the intersection of neighbor sets, and asks for an upper bound on the number of edges.

To assist, we can check all possible graphs with a number of edges up to a threshold (say 0 to 4950, since thatâ€™s the maximum for 100 vertices), testing the given condition, and recording the maximum number of edges satisfying the property.

Since the problem is at the high school competition level, a practical approach is to test small graphs and known extremal cases, especially since enumerating all graphs on 100 vertices is infeasible. Instead, select small samples or known bounds and look for patterns or extremal configurations.

Here's a sample code that:
- Sets a small sample size for graphs with edges.
- Checks the condition for each graph.
- Keeps track of the maximum number of edges where the condition holds.
- Prints candidate edge counts satisfying the property, streaming partial results.

```python
import itertools

# Simplify: consider graphs with vertices 0..9 for manageable enumeration
vertices = range(10)

# Generate all possible edges
all_edges = list(itertools.combinations(vertices, 2))

max_edges = 0
# Try all edge counts from 0 to maximum
for edge_count in range(len(all_edges)+1):
    found_for_this_count = False
    # For small graphs, enumerate all subsets of edges of size edge_count
    for edges_subset in itertools.combinations(all_edges, edge_count):
        adj = {v: set() for v in vertices}
        for u, v in edges_subset:
            adj[u].add(v)
            adj[v].add(u)
        # Check the property:
        # For all u, exists v s.t. G.adj(u,v) and neighbor sets disjoint
        satisfies = True
        for u in vertices:
            # Find neighbors of u
            for v in adj[u]:
                # Check disjoint neighbor sets
                if adj[u].isdisjoint(adj[v]):
                    break
            else:
                # No neighbor v found for u with disjoint neighbor sets
                satisfies = False
                break
        if satisfies:
            print(f"Edge count {edge_count} with edges: {edges_subset}")
            max_edges = max(max_edges, edge_count)
            found_for_this_count = True
    # Optional: break early if some large number of edges satisfies the condition
print("Maximum edges satisfying property (approximate):", max_edges)
```

This code:
- Only considers small graphs (vertices 0..9) for manageability.
- Enumerates all graphs with varying edge counts.
- Checks the property inside the problem.
- Streams answers whenever a graph satisfies the property, along with its edge count.

You can adapt the `vertices` range or the maximum `edge_count` for larger cases, respecting computational limits. The code finds candidate extremal graphs where the property holds, guiding conjecture or proof.
