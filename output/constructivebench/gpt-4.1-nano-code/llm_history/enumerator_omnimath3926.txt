This problem involves defining a recursive function `fn` that applies a digit sum squared operation repeatedly. Specifically:
- `f1(k)` computes the sum of the decimal digits of `k`, then squares that sum.
- `fn(n, k)` applies `f1` to the result of `fn(n-1, k)`, starting at `fn(0, k) = k`.
- The goal is to evaluate `fn(1991, 2^1990)`.

Given the large parameters, it is computationally infeasible to directly compute `fn(1991, 2^1990)` by brute force. Instead, I will focus on understanding the behavior of the iteration on the number's digital root and the effect of repeatedly applying the digit sum squared operation, which tends to converge very quickly.

I'll write an enumeration program that:
- Computes the sequence of repeated `f1` applications starting from the initial value `2^1990`.
- Since the behavior of repeated digit sum operations often stabilizes to a small number, I will empirically consider small powers and observe convergence.

The key insight is:
- Applying a digit sum reduces the size of the number drastically.
- Repeated application (over many iterations) will reach a fixed point or a small cycle.

Here's a program that:
- Sets parameters for small bases (`k`) and small powers (`n`).
- For each, computes the iterative process until convergence.
- When applicable, will demonstrate the behavior to facilitate conjecture.

```python
# This program explores the iterative behavior of the function f1 and fn for manageable inputs
# to conjecture the value of fn(1991, 2^1990).

def digits_sum(n, base=10):
    s = 0
    while n > 0:
        s += n % base
        n //= base
    return s

def f1(k):
    s = digits_sum(k)
    return s * s

def iterate_fn(n, k):
    result = k
    for _ in range(n):
        result = f1(result)
        # Detect small or stable results
        if result < 100:
            # Print intermediate results for small values
            print(f"Iteration result: {result}")
        # Convergence check (optional)
        # For large n, we can break early if stabilized
        if result == 1:
            break
    return result

# Test with small powers and initial values to observe convergence
# Initial value is 2^10 = 1024, a manageable example
initial = 2 ** 10
print("Starting iteration for n=10, initial=1024")
res = iterate_fn(10, initial)
print(f"Result after 10 iterations: {res}")

# Now, for a larger initial value 2^20
initial = 2 ** 20
print("Starting iteration for n=20, initial=2^20")
res = iterate_fn(20, initial)
print(f"Result after 20 iterations: {res}")

# To probe the behavior for very large powers, we can simulate the effect
# of repeated digit sums: digital root concept
def digital_root(n):
    while n > 9:
        n = digits_sum(n)
    return n

# For 2^1990, the digital root is (2^1990 mod 9)
# Because 2^k mod 9 cycles with period 6:
# 2^1=2, 2^2=4, 2^3=8, 2^4=7, 2^5=5, 2^6=1, then repeats.
# So, 1990 mod 6 = 2, thus 2^1990 mod 9 = 2^2 mod 9=4
print("Digital root of 2^1990:", digital_root(2 ** 1990))

# As the digit sum operation reduces the number towards its digital root,
# and repeatedly squaring the sum tends to stabilize rapidly,
# the final value of fn(1991, 2^1990) should stabilize at a small number,
# likely related to the digital root.

# Final conjecture printed for clarity:
print("Conjecture: The value of fn(1991, 2^1990) converges to the fixed point related to the digital root, likely 1 or 4.")
```
