# The problem defines a recurrence relation  a(n + 2) = 2 * a(n) + a(n + 1)  with initial conditions  a(1)=1, a(2)=0 .
# Our goal is to compute a(2004). To assist with conjecture and proof, we'll generate possible values for the sequence.
# Since the sequence is linear, the recurrence relationship suggests an exponential form, but here we enumerate small n.
# We'll compute the sequence iteratively for values up to n=2004, printing intermediate terms for exploration.
# To optimize, we will use simple iteration and store only necessary variables.
# We only need to print each computed answer immediately upon calculation.

```python
def main():
    # Initial conditions
    a1 = 1
    a2 = 0
    # Store previous two terms for recurrence
    prev_prev = a1
    prev = a2
    # We want a(2004), so iterate from 3 to 2004
    for n in range(3, 2005):
        a_next = 2 * prev + prev_prev
        print(f"a({n}) = {a_next}")
        prev_prev, prev = prev, a_next
    # Final answer
    print(f"Answer a(2004) = {prev}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
