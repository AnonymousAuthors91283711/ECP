The problem involves analyzing relationships between different match counts with parameters. Given the formulas for total matches, girls, and boys matches, and the ratio condition, we aim to find all `n` fulfilling these equations.

To aid conjecturing, we'll extract small sample `n` values, compute the respective values, and verify the ratio condition. Since the ratio involves fractional equality, we'll test for exact rational equality by cross-multiplying, avoiding floating-point inaccuracies. The code will explicitly check for integer solutions to the ratio condition (7/5 * girls_matches = boys_matches).

```python
# This program enumerates small values of n to find solutions for the ratio condition
# It prints parameters and matches counts, both exact and approximate ratios
# to assist in conjecture and eventual proof.

for n in range(1, 21):  # small sample size
    total_matches = 3 * n * (3 * n - 1) // 2
    girls_matches = n * (n - 1) // 2 + 2 * n * n
    boys_matches = total_matches - girls_matches

    # To check the ratio: boys_matches == (7/5) * girls_matches
    # Cross-multiplied: 5 * boys_matches == 7 * girls_matches
    lhs = 5 * boys_matches
    rhs = 7 * girls_matches

    print(f"n={n}: total={total_matches}, girls={girls_matches}, boys={boys_matches}")
    print(f"Checking ratio: 5*boys={lhs}, 7*girls={rhs}")
    if lhs == rhs:
        print(f"Solution found: n={n}")
```
