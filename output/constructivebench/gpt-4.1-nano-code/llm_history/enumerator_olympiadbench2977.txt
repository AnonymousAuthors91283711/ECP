This problem asks us to find the least natural number n > 1 such that the product of all divisors of n equals n^4. 

Key observations:
- The product of divisors of n equals n^{d(n)/2}, where d(n) is the number of divisors of n.
- The condition becomes n^{d(n)/2} = n^4, which implies d(n)/2 = 4, so d(n) = 8.
- Therefore, n must have exactly 8 divisors and be greater than 1.

We'll generate numbers starting from the smallest > 1, check their divisor counts, and find the first with exactly 8 divisors.

```python
def divisors(n):
    divs = []
    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divs.append(i)
            if i != n // i:
                divs.append(n // i)
    return divs

n = 2
while True:
    d = len(divisors(n))
    # Check if number of divisors is 8
    if d == 8:
        print(n)
        break
    n += 1
```
