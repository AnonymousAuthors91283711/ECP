The problem asks us to find the least real number \( n \) such that \( 0 < n \) and \( n + \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor + \lfloor n^{1/3} \rfloor = 2014 \). We should explore candidates for \( n \), considering the behavior of the terms.

Key observations:
- \( n \), \( \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor \), and \( \lfloor n^{1/3} \rfloor \) are integers or close to integers when \( n \) is large.
- For the sum to be exactly 2014, \( n \) should be near 2014 minus the sum of the floors of its square root and cube root, which are smaller than \( n \).

Approach:
- Assign sample values for the floors and then compute \( n = 2014 - \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor - \lfloor n^{1/3} \rfloor \).
- Iterate over plausible integer values for \( \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor \) and \( \lfloor n^{1/3} \rfloor \).

Below code enumerates candidates efficiently.

```python
# Enumerate possible floor values for sqrt(n) and cbrt(n) to find minimal n
# for which n + floor(sqrt(n)) + floor(n^(1/3)) = 2014.

import math

# Set bounds for the searches
max_floor_sqrt = int(math.sqrt(2014)) + 2
max_floor_cbrt = int(round(2014 ** (1/3))) + 2

# Initialize list to store candidates
candidates = []

for s in range(1, max_floor_sqrt + 1):  # Floor of sqrt(n)
    for c in range(1, max_floor_cbrt + 1):  # Floor of cbrt(n)
        n_candidate = 2014 - s - c
        if n_candidate <= 0:
            continue
        n = n_candidate
        sqrt_floor = math.isqrt(int(n))  # integer sqrt
        cbrt_floor = int(round(n ** (1/3)))
        # Adjust cbrt_floor for accuracy
        if (cbrt_floor + 1) ** 3 <= n:
            cbrt_floor += 1
        elif cbrt_floor ** 3 > n:
            cbrt_floor -= 1
        # Check the sum condition
        total = n + sqrt_floor + cbrt_floor
        if abs(total - 2014) < 1e-9:
            # Found an exact match, record n
            print(n)
            candidates.append(n)

# Output the minimal candidate found
if candidates:
    print("Minimum n:", min(candidates))
```
