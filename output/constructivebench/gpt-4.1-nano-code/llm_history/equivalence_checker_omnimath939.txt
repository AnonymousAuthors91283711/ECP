theorem omnimath939 (n : ℕ) (hn : 2 ≤ n) :
  ∏ k in Finset.range (n - 1), logb (n - k) (1 / (k + 2 : ℝ)) = omnimath939_answer n := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (-1) ^ (n - 1)
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => if n % 2 = 0 then -1 else 1
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

The ground truth answer is `(-1)^(n-1)`, which means:
- When n is odd: exponent is even, result is 1
- When n is even: exponent is odd, result is -1

The proposed answer is `if n % 2 = 0 then -1 else 1`, which means:
- When n is even: -1
- When n is odd: 1

These are exactly the same behaviors for all natural numbers n ≥ 2. The two expressions are equivalent ways of writing the same function.
