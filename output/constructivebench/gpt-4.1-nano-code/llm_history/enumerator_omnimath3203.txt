This problem involves analyzing the given 3x3 matrix M and expressing its entries as sums involving row and column operations. We need to find natural numbers a, b, row operations, and column operations such that each matrix element M(i,j) equals row_ops(i) + 2 * col_ops(j). The key is to solve these equations systematically, given that M is explicitly specified.

The approach:
- Assign variables to row and column operations.
- Use the equations for the known matrix entries.
- Solve for row_ops and col_ops.
- Find candidates for a, b satisfying the sum conditions.

Let's implement an enumeration of possible row_ops and col_ops values within small bounds (say from 0 to 20), then check whether the equations match and the sums satisfy the constraints.

The enumeration:
- Iterate over small possible values for row_ops and col_ops.
- For each, verify the matrix element constraints.
- Count sums and check for the conditions.

Here's the code:

```python
# We analyze the matrix M and find row and column operations that satisfy M[i,j] = row_ops[i] + 2 * col_ops[j]
# Given the known matrix:
# M = [[7, 1, 5],
#      [9, 3, 7],
#      [8, 2, 6]]
# We search for small non-negative integer solutions within bounds, then estimate sums a, b.

def is_valid(row_ops, col_ops):
    # Check if the candidate row and col operations satisfy the matrix entries
    M_entries = [
        [7, 1, 5],
        [9, 3, 7],
        [8, 2, 6]
    ]
    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(3):
            if M_entries[i][j] != row_ops[i] + 2 * col_ops[j]:
                return False
    return True

# Range for enumeration
max_val = 20
solutions = []

for r0 in range(max_val+1):
    for r1 in range(max_val+1):
        for r2 in range(max_val+1):
            for c0 in range(max_val+1):
                for c1 in range(max_val+1):
                    for c2 in range(max_val+1):
                        row_ops = [r0, r1, r2]
                        col_ops = [c0, c1, c2]
                        if is_valid(row_ops, col_ops):
                            # Compute a = sum of row_ops
                            a = sum(row_ops)
                            # Compute b = sum of col_ops
                            b = sum(col_ops)
                            solutions.append((a, b, row_ops, col_ops))
                            print(f"Found candidate: a={a}, b={b}, row_ops={row_ops}, col_ops={col_ops}")

# Find minimal a + b as the answer
if solutions:
    min_sum = min(s[0] + s[1] for s in solutions)
    print(f"Minimum sum a + b: {min_sum}")
```
