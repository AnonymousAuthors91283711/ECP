Given the sum of the logs equals between 56 and 57 and each x n equals 3^k with increasing k, the total sum ∑ x n is between 3^56 and 3^57. Since the sequence is strictly increasing, x 14 corresponds to 3^{k}, where k ≥ 14. The sum over 8 terms suggests a geometric progression with roughly the median's index. Therefore, the value at index 14 aligns with the geometric mean near 3^{56.5}.  
Answer:
<<<3^14>>>
