The problem appears to be a formal proof involving a rate, a relation between T and K, and some calculations based on these. The core task seems to involve expressing an answer (possibly a rational number) for a given K, related via the rate and other factors.

To assist in conjecturing the true answer, we can write a Python program that, given a small range of K (based on the relation K = T - 2), enumerates possible values for K and computes the corresponding "requiredWorkers" for each K. We will print each candidate as we proceed.

This approach helps in identifying a pattern or candidate for the function olympiadbench2842_answer, which in the formal proof might be some rational function of K.

```python
# Enumerate values of K around small small positive and negative numbers
# Assume T is sufficiently large to produce interesting K in a small range
# Since K = T - 2, pick small T values to generate K

# Range of T values to consider
T_values = range(1, 11)

for T in T_values:
    K = T - 2
    if K == 0:
        # skip division by zero
        continue
    rate = 9 / K  # widgets per worker per hour
    required_workers = (720 / K) / (4 * rate)
    # Compute the required_workers as simplified rational
    # rational: (720 / K) / (4 * (9 / K)) = (720 / K) * (K / (4 * 9))
    # simplifies to: (720 / K) * (K / 36) = 720 / 36 = 20
    # Actually, algebraically, it simplifies to 20 regardless of K:
    # Because the K cancels out
    # Let's verify:
    # required_workers = (720 / K) / (4 * (9 / K))
    # = (720 / K) * (K / (4 * 9))
    # = 720 / 36 = 20
    # So for all K ≠ 0, required_workers is exactly 20
    print(f"T={T}, K={K}, required_workers={required_workers}")
```

This code shows that the required workers are constant (equal to 20) for all K ≠ 0, confirming the rational calculation. The detailed algebra indicates that the answer is always 20 for valid K.

(Note: Since the formal proof states "requiredWorkers = olympiadbench2842_answer K", the apparent constant suggests the answer function is simply 20 for all K ≠ 0. Hence, this code can help verify that pattern empirically.)
