[write_program]
This problem involves identifying the smallest positive integer `n` with exactly 11 adjacent digit pairs that are prime when combined, and the first digit is non-zero. To efficiently find this, we will:
- Generate candidates with increasing digit lengths,
- For each candidate, compute the count of prime-digit pairs,
- Check the conditions, and stop when the minimum is found,
- Stream answers as soon as they are identified.

We'll limit the search to reasonable sizes for demonstration, and since the problem asks for the least such `n`, we'll keep track of minimal candidates. We won't hardcode the answer, but demonstrate an enumeration approach.

```python
# Python code to enumerate candidates with increasing number of digits,
# check when exactly 11 prime pairs occur, and if the first digit is non-zero.
# Stops when the smallest such n is found.

from itertools import product
import math

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    if n in (2, 3):
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Generate all digit sequences of length `length` with first digit != 0
def generate_candidates(length):
    for digits in product(range(1, 10), *([range(10)] * (length - 1))):
        yield digits

def count_prime_pairs(digits):
    count = 0
    for a, b in zip(digits, digits[1:]):
        if is_prime(a * 10 + b):
            count += 1
    return count

# Search for minimum n satisfying conditions
found_n = None
min_n = None

# Increase length gradually; limit to avoid excessive runtime.
for length in range(2, 15):  # Arbitrary upper bound
    for digits in generate_candidates(length):
        c = count_prime_pairs(digits)
        # Check conditions:
        # 1) count of prime pairs = 11
        # 2) first digit != 0 (guaranteed by generation)
        if c == 11:
            n = int(''.join(map(str, digits)))
            print(f"Found candidate n = {n} with {c} prime pairs and length {length}")
            if (min_n is None) or (n < min_n):
                min_n = n
                found_n = n
    if found_n is not None:
        break  # Found the minimal candidate

# Output the minimum answer found
print(f"Enumerated smallest n with 11 prime pairs: {min_n}")
```
