Let's analyze the problem: we need to find the least natural number \(k\) such that there exist positive integers \(m, n\) with

- \(3 \cdot m^3 = 5 \cdot n^5\),
- and \(k = m + n\).

Our goal is to find or approximate the minimal \(k\) that satisfies this, by enumerating small candidates for \(m\) and \(n\).

Since \(3m^3 = 5n^5\), rearranged as \(m^3 = \frac{5}{3} n^5\). To ensure \(m\) is integer, \(\frac{5}{3} n^5\) must be a perfect cube. Thus, \(n^5\) must make \(\frac{5}{3} n^5\) integral and perfect cube.

```python
# Enumerate small positive integers n and m satisfying the relation
# 3 * m^3 = 5 * n^5 => m^3 = (5/3) * n^5
# To have m integer, (5/3)*n^5 must be a perfect cube.

import math

# Function to check if a number is perfect cube
def is_perfect_cube(x):
    c = round(x ** (1/3))
    return c ** 3 == x

# Store solutions as (k = m + n)
solutions = []

# Set an upper limit for enumeration
max_n = 100

for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
    numerator = 5 * n ** 5
    denominator = 3
    # Check if numerator is divisible by denominator
    if numerator % denominator != 0:
        continue
    val = numerator // denominator  # m^3
    # Check if val is perfect cube
    if is_perfect_cube(val):
        m = round(val ** (1/3))
        # Confirm integer m
        if m ** 3 == val:
            k = m + n
            print(f"Found: n={n}, m={m}, m^3={m**3}, n^5={n**5}, k={k}")
            solutions.append(k)

if solutions:
    answer = min(solutions)
    print(f"Least k = {answer}")
else:
    print("No solutions found within the range.")
```
