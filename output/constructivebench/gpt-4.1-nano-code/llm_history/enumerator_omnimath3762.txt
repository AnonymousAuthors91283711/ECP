This problem appears fairly complex, involving functional equations with positivity conditions and a goal of identifying the functions `f` and `g` satisfying certain equations. To explore solutions, I will:

- Assume simple, algebraically manageable forms for `f` and `g`, such as linear functions.
- Define sample functions `f(x) = A x + B` and `g(x) = C x + D`.
- Enumerate constants A, B, C, D over small integer ranges to find potential candidates satisfying the given equations.  
- Immediately output candidate solutions while iterating, focusing on exact matches to the equations at sampled points.

This approach can hint at the nature of `f` and `g`, aiding in conjecturing the true solutions.

```python
# Enumerate small integer coefficients for candidate linear functions f(x)=A*x+B, g(x)=C*x+D
# Check the equations at a selection of small positive x and y (e.g., 0.1, 1, 2)
import itertools

# Sample x, y values for testing
sample_points = [0.1, 1, 2]

# Ranges for coefficients A, B, C, D
coeff_range = range(-3, 4)  # small integers from -3 to 3

for A, B, C, D in itertools.product(coeff_range, repeat=4):
    # Define functions
    def f(x): return A * x + B
    def g(x): return C * x + D

    valid_for_all = True
    for x in sample_points:
        for y in sample_points:
            if x <= 0 or y <= 0:
                continue
            # Compute left sides of equations
            left1 = (f(x) + y - 1) * (g(y) + x - 1)
            left2 = (-f(x) + y) * (g(y) + x)
            # Compute right sides
            right = (x + y) ** 2
            right2 = (x + y + 1) * (y - x - 1)
            # Check equations
            if not (abs(left1 - right) < 1e-6 and abs(left2 - right2) < 1e-6):
                valid_for_all = False
                break
        if not valid_for_all:
            break
    if valid_for_all:
        print(f"Candidate linear functions:")
        print(f"f(x) = {A}*x + {B}")
        print(f"g(x) = {C}*x + {D}")
```
