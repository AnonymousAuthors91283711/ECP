Ground Truth Answer: {(2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (5, 2), (5, 5), (5, 313), (313, 5)}
Proposed Answer: {(2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (5, 2), (5, 5)}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is mostly correct but missing the pairs (5, 313) and (313, 5) which are part of the ground truth solution. These pairs satisfy the condition since 5^5 + 5^313 is divisible by 5*313 (as 5^312 ≡ 1 mod 313 by Fermat's Little Theorem). Therefore, the proposed answer is incomplete.
