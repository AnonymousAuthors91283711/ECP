abbrev P2006AMCA_7_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2006AMCA_7 :
  ∃ (m s d : ℝ), m = 1.2 * s ∧ s = 0.6 * d ∧ m + s + d = 23.2 ∧ m = P2006AMCA_7_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Candidate solution:
d = 10
s = 6
m = 7.2
Sum check (should be 23.2): 23.2
P2006AMCA_7_answer: 7.2. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<7.2>>>
