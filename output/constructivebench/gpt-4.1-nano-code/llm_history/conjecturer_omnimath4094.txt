The candidate T(1) = 20. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
Given the enumeration, the candidates for T(1) include all integers from 1 to 20. The conditions imply T is bounded below by itself, and from the pattern, the minimal T(1) that satisfies all conditions is 1, which is consistent with the set containing all natural numbers greater than or equal to T(m). To generalize the set of all such T(m), the answer is all m where m ≥ 1.
