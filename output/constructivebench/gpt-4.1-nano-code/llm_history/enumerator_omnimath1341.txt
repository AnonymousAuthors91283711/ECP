The problem involves finding the greatest value of the sum `a + b` under certain constraints involving positive integers `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, with all different, with specific GCD and LCM restrictions, and a relation between their sums. To explore possible solutions, I will focus on enumerating tuples `(a, b, c, d)` satisfying these conditions, particularly emphasizing the constraints involving positive integers, distinctness, and the LCM condition, then compute `s = a + b`.

The key points:
- `a, b, c, d > 0`
- All are pairwise distinct
- `a + b = c + d`
- `lcm(lcm(a, b), c, d) < 1000` (probably meant to be `lcm(lcm(a, b), lcm(c, d))`)
- We need to find the maximum `a + b`.

Given the constraints, I'll select small values for `a, b, c, d`, checking the greatest possible sum while satisfying the conditions, and printing each candidate as soon as found.

The enumeration will prioritize:
- increasing `a`, `b` to find larger sums
- ensuring distinctness
- computing LCMs to verify the constraint
- printing each `a + b` when a valid tuple is found

Here's the Python program:

```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

max_sum = 0
best_results = []

# Limit search to small values to keep runtime manageable
limit = 50  

for a in range(1, limit):
    for b in range(a + 1, limit):
        s = a + b
        # For each sum, try to find c, d satisfying all constraints
        for c in range(1, limit):
            if c in (a, b):
                continue
            for d in range(c + 1, limit):
                if d in (a, b):
                    continue
                if a + b != c + d:
                    continue
                # Ensure all are distinct
                if len({a, b, c, d}) < 4:
                    continue
                # Compute LCM of a, b
                lcm_ab = lcm(a, b)
                # Compute LCM of c, d
                lcm_cd = lcm(c, d)
                total_lcm = lcm(lcm_ab, lcm_cd)
                if total_lcm < 1000:
                    # Valid candidate
                    print(f"Found: {a + b} with ({a}, {b}, {c}, {d})")
                    if s > max_sum:
                        max_sum = s
                    best_results.append((a, b, c, d))
# After enumeration, print maximum sum found
print(f"Maximum sum: {max_sum}")
```
