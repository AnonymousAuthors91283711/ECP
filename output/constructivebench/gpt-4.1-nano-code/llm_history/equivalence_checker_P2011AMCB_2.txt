Ground Truth Answer: 90
Proposed Answer: 95
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest natural number x such that when added to the given scores (90,80,70,60,85), the average of all 6 scores is at least 3 points higher than the average of the original 5 scores.

2. First, calculate the average of the original 5 scores:
   (90 + 80 + 70 + 60 + 85)/5 = 385/5 = 77

3. The new average requirement is 77 + 3 = 80

4. The inequality becomes:
   (385 + x)/6 ≥ 80
   385 + x ≥ 480
   x ≥ 95

5. The smallest natural number satisfying this is indeed 95.

The ground truth answer of 90 is incorrect because:
(385 + 90)/6 ≈ 79.17 which is less than 80
While the proposed answer of 95 is correct:
(385 + 95)/6 = 480/6 = 80 exactly meets the requirement

<<<False>>>
