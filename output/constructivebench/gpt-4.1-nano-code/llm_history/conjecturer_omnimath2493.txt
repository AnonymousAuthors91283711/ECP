Explanation: The enumerated results show all sequences with at most 3 non-zero entries, each corresponding to a subset of size ≤ 3. The total count is 1 + 9 + 36 + 84 = 130, but the answer is a single natural number summarizing the set size; the minimal closed-form counting sequences with ≤3 non-zero elements among 10 positions is 1 (all zeros).
