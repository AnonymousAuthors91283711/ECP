Ground Truth Answer: {f | ∃ (c k : ℝ), (StrictMono f ∨ StrictAnti f) ∧ 
    (∀ x > 0, f x = c * log x) ∨ (∀ x > 0, f x = c * x ^ k)}
Proposed Answer: {f : ℝ → ℝ | (StrictMono f ∨ StrictAnti f) ∧ ∃ c : ℝ, ∀ x y : ℝ, x > 0 → y > 0 → f (x * y) = f x * f y / c}
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

1. The ground truth answer specifies two possible forms for f:
   - Logarithmic: f(x) = c * log x
   - Power law: f(x) = c * x^k

2. The proposed answer suggests a multiplicative property: f(x*y) = f(x)*f(y)/c

For the logarithmic case:
f(x*y) = c*log(x*y) = c*(log x + log y) = f(x) + f(y)
This doesn't match the proposed form f(x)*f(y)/c

For the power law case:
f(x*y) = c*(x*y)^k = c*x^k*y^k = f(x)*f(y)/c
This matches exactly the proposed form.

Therefore, the proposed answer correctly captures the power law functions but misses the logarithmic functions. The strict monotonicity condition is present in both answers.
