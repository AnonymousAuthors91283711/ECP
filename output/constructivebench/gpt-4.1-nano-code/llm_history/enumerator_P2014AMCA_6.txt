This problem asks us to find a two-digit number `x` (between 10 and 99), expressed as `10*a + b` with digits `a` and `b`, satisfying the conditions:

- `(10 * a + b) - (10 * b + a) = 5 * (a + b)`
- `(10 * a + b) + (10 * b + a)` equals some number, which we are to compute.

Let's analyze the conditions algebraically:

\[
(10a + b) - (10b + a) = 5(a + b)
\]

Simplify the left side:

\[
10a + b - 10b - a = 5(a + b)
\]
\[
(10a - a) + (b - 10b) = 5a + 5b
\]
\[
9a - 9b = 5a + 5b
\]

Bring all to one side:

\[
9a - 9b - 5a - 5b = 0
\]
\[
(9a - 5a) + (-9b - 5b) = 0
\]
\[
4a - 14b = 0
\]

Thus:

\[
4a = 14b
\]

Simplify:

\[
2a = 7b
\]

Since `a` and `b` are digits:

\[
a = \frac{7b}{2}
\]

For `a` to be integer, `7b` must be divisible by 2. Since 7 is odd, `b` must be even for the numerator to be divisible by 2.

Possible values for `b` (0 to 9):

- `b = 0`, then `a = 0`, but `a` must be between 1 and 9; zero is invalid for a leading digit in a two-digit number.

- For `b` even and between 1 and 9:

  - `b = 2`:

    \[
    a = \frac{7 \times 2}{2} = 7
    \]
    Valid, as `a = 7` (1 <= 7 <= 9).

  - `b = 4`:

    \[
    a = \frac{7 \times 4}{2} = 14
    \]
    But `a` must be â‰¤ 9, so discard.

  - `b = 6`:

    \[
    a = \frac{7 \times 6}{2} = 21
    \]
    Too large, discard.

  - `b = 8`:

    \[
    a = \frac{7 \times 8}{2} = 28
    \]
    Too large, discard.

Only the pair `(a, b) = (7, 2)` satisfies the constraints and the divisibility condition.

Now, compute the value of `x = 10*a + b = 70 + 2 = 72`.

Check the conditions:

\[
(10a + b) - (10b + a) = 72 - 27 = 45
\]
\[
5(a + b) = 5(7 + 2) = 5 \times 9 = 45
\]

Confirmed.

Calculate the second sum:

\[
(10a + b) + (10b + a) = 72 + 27 = 99
\]

Hence, the answer:

```python
# Final answer for the value of x
print(99)
```

Now, let's generate a complete python script that searches systematically based on the above analysis:

```python
# Enumerate a and b in their bounds and find solutions satisfying the derived conditions
for a in range(1, 10):
    for b in range(0, 10):
        if 2 * a == 7 * b:
            x = 10 * a + b
            # Check if x is within [10, 99]
            if 10 <= x <= 99:
                sum_ab = (10 * a + b) + (10 * b + a)
                print(sum_ab)
```
