theorem IMO2012SLN7 (n : ℕ) :
  (∃ (a : ℕ → ℕ), (∑ i in Finset.range n, (1 / 2 ^ (a i)) = 1 ∧ ∑ i in Finset.range n, ((i + 1) / 3 ^ (a i)) = 1)) ↔ n ∈ IMO2012SLN7_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: timeout triggered. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The pattern suggests for the sums to be exactly 1 with the fractions, the exponents must be in the form of zeros and ones, fitting the case where each a i is either 0 or 1, and the total sum of (i+1)/3^{a i} equals 1. Typically, the values of n that satisfy this are 1 and 2, since for larger n the sum exceeds 1. Therefore, the set is {1, 2}.
