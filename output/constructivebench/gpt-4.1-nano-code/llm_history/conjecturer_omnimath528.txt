  omnimath528_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: k = 1, number of valid sequences = 16
For k=1, possible N=16, max 2^n dividing N is at least n=4
k = 2, number of valid sequences = 80
For k=2, possible N=80, max 2^n dividing N is at least n=4
k = 3, number of valid sequences = 576
For k=3, possible N=576, max 2^n dividing N is at least n=6. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
