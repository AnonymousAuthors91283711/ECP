Ground Truth Answer: fun (x, y, z) => x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2 * x * y * z
Proposed Answer:  fun (x, y, z) => (x + y + z)^2
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

The ground truth answer is: x² + y² + z² + 2xyz
The proposed answer is: (x + y + z)²

Let's expand the proposed answer:
(x + y + z)² = x² + y² + z² + 2xy + 2xz + 2yz

Now compare with the ground truth:
x² + y² + z² + 2xyz vs x² + y² + z² + 2xy + 2xz + 2yz

These are clearly different expressions. The ground truth has a term 2xyz while the proposed answer has terms 2xy + 2xz + 2yz.
