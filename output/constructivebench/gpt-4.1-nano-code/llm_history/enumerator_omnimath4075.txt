[write_program]
This problem seems to involve partitioning a range of integers into disjoint subsets ("boxes") with equal sums, and relates to prime numbers. To enumerate possible answers, I will:
- pick small values for n and p,
- generate all possible partitions of the range into p disjoint subsets,
- check if they meet the sum condition,
- stream any solutions found.

For efficiency, I'll restrict n to small values, e.g., n â‰¤ 10, and p to small primes (2, 3, 5). The code will:
- generate all candidate partitions,
- verify disjointness and sum conditions,
- print each candidate answer as soon as found.

```python
import itertools
from functools import reduce
from math import gcd

def is_prime(p):
    if p <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(p ** 0.5) + 1):
        if p % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def generate_partitions(range_list, p):
    # Generate all ways to partition range_list into p non-empty disjoint subsets
    # Using recursive approach and itertools
    if p == 1:
        yield [set(range_list)]
        return
    for indices in itertools.combinations(range(len(range_list)), p - 1):
        splits = [0] + list(indices) + [len(range_list)]
        parts = []
        for i in range(len(splits) - 1):
            part = set(range_list[splits[i]:splits[i+1]])
            parts.append(part)
        yield parts

def test_partition(n, p):
    total_sum = sum(range(n))
    if total_sum % p != 0:
        return
    target = total_sum // p
    range_list = list(range(n))
    for partition in generate_partitions(range_list, p):
        # Check sums
        if all(sum(subset) == target for subset in partition):
            # Check disjointness (already ensured by partition generation)
            # Print each partition as answer
            print(f"n={n}, p={p}, partition={partition}")

# Enumerate small n and p (p prime)
for n in range(1, 11):
    for p in [2, 3, 5]:
        if is_prime(p) and n >= p:
            test_partition(n, p)
```
