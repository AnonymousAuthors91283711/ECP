2.501. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern shows values approaching 2.5 as terms refine. Given the function otimes(n, m) = (a / b + b / a) with a=4, b=8, the value simplifies to 4/8 + 8/4 = 0.5 + 2= 2.5. The sequence suggests the limit or the exact value is 2.5, corresponding to the enumerated answer.
