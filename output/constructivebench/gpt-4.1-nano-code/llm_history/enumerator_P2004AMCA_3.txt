To solve the problem, we need to find all positive integer pairs (x, y) such that x + 2y = 100, with both x and y greater than zero. Since x = 100 - 2y, y must be a positive integer less than 50 (because x > 0 implies 100 - 2y > 0 ⇒ 2y < 100 ⇒ y < 50). For each y in 1 to 49, x = 100 - 2y will be positive if x > 0.

We need to enumerate all such pairs and count their total number (the encard). The total number is the size of the set of all solutions.

Let's write the Python code to do that efficiently, printing each pair as we go and calculating the total count at the end.

```python
# Enumerate solutions for x + 2y = 100 with x > 0, y > 0
solutions = []
for y in range(1, 50):
    x = 100 - 2 * y
    if x > 0:
        print((x, y))
        solutions.append((x, y))
print("Total solutions:", len(solutions))
```

This code will list all pairs (x, y) satisfying the conditions and then output their count, which corresponds to `encard` of the set.
