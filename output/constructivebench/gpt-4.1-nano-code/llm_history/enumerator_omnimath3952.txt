This problem appears to be a functional equation involving positive real numbers and a function \( f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) with strict positivity constraints. The goal is to find all functions satisfying the given properties.

Let's analyze the key parts:

- \( \forall x > 0,\, f(x) > 0 \)
- The functional equation:
  \[
  f(x + f(x y)) + y = f(x) f(y) + 1,
  \]
  for all \( x, y > 0 \).

We want to analyze possible solutions, and to assist, we will:

- Test some specific values (e.g., constant functions, linear functions).
- Attempt to find candidates for \( f \) that satisfy the equation.
- Enumerate solutions iteratively or check for parametric forms.

Given the constraints and structure, one candidate is a constant function, but positivity constraints and the equation probably exclude that unless very specific constants work.

Next, common functional forms such as linear functions \( f(x) = k x + c \), reciprocal functions, or multiplicative forms will be tested.

Since the problem asks for generating possible solutions to help with conjectures, the code structure will:

- Test candidate forms with small parameters.
- Check if they satisfy the equation.
- Print all solutions found.
