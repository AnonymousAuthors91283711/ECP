Alpha satisfying condition: 2. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
The pattern suggests that α must make the sum divisible by n for all n. Since S α n sums over floor((i+1)α), for α=0, each floor is 0, sum is 0, divisible by any n. For α=2, the floor values are integer multiples of n, sum divisible. Pattern indicates solutions are α=0 and α=2. Eliminating other options, the set becomes {0, 2}. Final form: {0, 2}.
