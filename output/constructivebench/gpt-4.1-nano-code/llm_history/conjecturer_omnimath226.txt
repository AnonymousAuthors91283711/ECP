abbrev omnimath226_answer : ℚ → ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath226 (f : ℚ → ℚ) (hpos : ∀ x : ℚ, 0 < x → 0 < f x) :
  (∀ x y : ℚ, 0 < x → 0 < y → f x + f y + 2 * x * y * f (x * y) = f (x * y) / f (x + y)) ↔ f = omnimath226_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Error: Program is empty. Expected Answer Type: ℚ → ℚ
The pattern suggests a quadratic-like functional form satisfying the given relation; the condition resembles a multiplicative-additive equation hinting at proportionality involving reciprocals or squares. Based on the structure, a plausible closed form for f is a quadratic reciprocal function.
