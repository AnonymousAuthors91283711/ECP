  (∃ (x : Fin 1985 → ℕ) (y z : ℕ), 
    (∀ i j, i ≠ j → x i ≠ x j) ∧

    omnimath152_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Sequence: (0,), sum of squares: 0 (cube), sum of cubes: 0 (square)
Sequence: (1,), sum of squares: 1 (cube), sum of cubes: 1 (square)
Sequence: (0, 1), sum of squares: 1 (cube), sum of cubes: 1 (square)
Sequence: (4, 5, 9, 10, 11), sum of squares: 343 (cube), sum of cubes: 3249 (square). Expected Answer Type: Bool
<<<False>>>

This reflects that only the trivial solutions where all x i are zero satisfy the constraints, leading to the only true case being when the sums are zero, hence the answer is false.
