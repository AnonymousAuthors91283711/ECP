Given the problem context, it appears to be a number-theoretic problem involving 9-digit prime numbers with specific digit constraints: each digit is between 1 and 9, all digits are distinct, and the number is prime. The goal is to find or estimate the count of such numbers within the range [100,000,000, 999,999,999].

To assist, we'll generate all candidate prime numbers with 9 distinct digits (each from 1 to 9, no zeros, all digits different), then count how many of those are prime.

Since enumerating all permutations of 1..9 is feasible (9! = 362,880 permutations), we'll iteratively generate permutations, check for primality, and count.

We'll print each prime found immediately, and at the end output the total count.

```python
import itertools
from sympy import isprime

digits = '123456789'
count = 0

# Generate all permutations of digits 1..9
for perm in itertools.permutations(digits):
    num = int(''.join(perm))
    # Check if number is prime
    if isprime(num):
        print(num)
        count += 1

print(f'Total such prime numbers: {count}')
```
