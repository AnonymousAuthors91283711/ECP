The problem involves analyzing an equation involving logarithms:

\[
\frac{\log x}{\log 4} - \frac{\log 16}{\log x} = \frac{7}{6} - \frac{\log 8}{\log x}
\]

for \( x > 0 \) and \( x \neq 1 \). We want to find the set of all solutions \( x \) that satisfy this equation.

To assist in conjecturing the solutions, I'll write a Python program that:
- Selects some sample values for \( x \) (avoiding \( x=1 \))
- Checks whether these values satisfy or approximately satisfy the equation
- Rounds solutions, prints precise candidates, and filters for solutions near 0, 1, or other notable points.

**Note:** The code will use logarithm base change (natural log) for simplicity, as \(\log_b a = \frac{\ln a}{\ln b}\). We focus on small sample points because the problem is known at high-school competition level, and that should suffice for conjecture.

```python
import math

# Function to evaluate the given equation at x
def equation(x):
    if x <= 0 or x == 1:
        return None  # not considered
    log_x = math.log(x)
    log_4 = math.log(4)
    log_8 = math.log(8)
    log_16 = math.log(16)

    lhs = (log_x / log_4) - (log_16 / log_x)
    rhs = 7/6 - (log_8 / log_x)
    return lhs - rhs

# Sample x values to test, avoiding 1
sample_points = [0.1, 0.5, 0.8, 1.2, 2, 4, 8]

print("Testing sample points for approximate solutions:")
for x in sample_points:
    val = equation(x)
    if val is not None:
        # Show the value with some precision
        print(f"x = {x}: equation difference ≈ {val:.6f}")

# Search for solutions near the points, with small delta
tolerance = 1e-4
possible_solutions = []

print("\nCandidates with solutions close to zero difference:")
for x in sample_points:
    val = equation(x)
    if val is not None and abs(val) < tolerance:
        print(f"Potential solution at x ≈ {x} (difference ≈ {val:.6f})")
        possible_solutions.append(x)

print("\nFull list of candidate solutions:")
for x in possible_solutions:
    print(f"x ≈ {x}")
```
