The problem asks for the cardinality of the set of Finsets \( S \subseteq (\text{Fin } 2014 \times \text{Fin } 4) \) such that the number of unique first components of elements of \( S \) is odd. We need to enumerate possible answers to derive a conjecture.

Key insight:
- For each subset \( S \), the set of first components \( \text{image}(\text{Prod.fst } S) \) is a subset of \(\text{Fin } 2014\), specifically, the set of distinct first entries in \( S \).
- The property depends only on the number of distinct first elements, and whether it's odd.

Approach:
- For each possible subset \( T \subseteq \text{Fin } 2014 \), the size of the image is \(|T|\).
- For each such \( T \), the number of \( S \) with \( \text{image}(\text{Prod.fst } S) = T \) is \( 2^{|T| \times 4} \), because once the set of first elements is fixed, the second coordinates can be any subset of \( T \times \text{Fin } 4 \).

The total number of \( S \) with the first components in subset \( T \) is all subsets of \( T \times \text{Fin } 4 \), i.e., \( 2^{|T| \times 4} \). The sum over all \( T \subseteq \text{Fin } 2014 \) with \(|T|\) odd.

Implementation:
- For small sample, consider \( n = 3 \) (or smaller) due to resource constraints.
- Sum over all subsets of \(\text{Fin } n\) with odd cardinality.

```python
# Program enumerates possible counts based on subset size parity
def main():
    n = 10  # small sample size for feasibility
    total_counts = 0
    for size in range(1, n + 1, 2):  # only odd sizes
        from math import comb
        num_subsets = comb(n, size)
        count_for_size = num_subsets * (2 ** (size * 4))
        print(f"Size {size}: {num_subsets} subsets, contributes {count_for_size}")
        total_counts += count_for_size
    print(f"Total number of S with odd numbered first-components: {total_counts}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
