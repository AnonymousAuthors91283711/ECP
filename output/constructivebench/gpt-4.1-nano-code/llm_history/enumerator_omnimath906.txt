The problem asks to find the number of quadruples (a, b, c, d) of positive divisors of 30 such that their product exceeds 900. Since 30's divisors are limited, we can enumerate all possible quadruples and count those with product > 900, prioritizing efficiency and streaming results.

Divisors of 30 are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30.  
Total number of quadruples: 8^4 = 4096.  
We will iterate through all, check the product, and print each qualifying quadruple. At the end, we'll print the total count.

```python
# List of all divisors of 30
divisors = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30]

count = 0
for a in divisors:
    for b in divisors:
        for c in divisors:
            for d in divisors:
                product = a * b * c * d
                if product > 900:
                    print(f"({a}, {b}, {c}, {d}) with product {product}")
                    count += 1
print("Total quadruples with product > 900:", count)
```
