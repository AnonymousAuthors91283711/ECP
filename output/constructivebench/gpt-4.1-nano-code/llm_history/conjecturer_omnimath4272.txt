. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → Prop
Based on enumerated answers, the sum of divisors is a power of 2 only for n where the divisors sum to 2^(m+1). For n=2^k - 1 with divisors sum=2^k. The pattern suggests that n is either 1 or of form 2^k - 1 with the sum of divisors equal to 2^k. For n=1, the sum is 1=2^0. For primes p>1, divisors sum to p+1, which is 2^k only when p=2^k-1. 

Thus, the general statement is: n=1 or n=2^k-1, and sum of divisors equals 2^{k}.

. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → Prop
The main issue in the current proposed answer is the use of "n" inside the definition of omnimath4272_answer without explicitly binding it as a parameter in the abbrev. In Lean, to create a propositional property depending on n, the definition should be a function from ℕ to Prop, explicitly parameterized by n.

From the enumerated answers, it appears that for each n > 0, the sum of divisors equals a power of two, and the pattern involves either n=1 (single divisor) or n=2^k−1 for some k, with the divisors summing to 2^k.

The conjecture based on this pattern is that the property holds precisely for n=1 or n=2^k−1, where the sum of divisors is 2^k.

Therefore, the correct fixed version would be:

<<<fun n => n = 1 ∨ (∃ k : ℕ, n = 2^k - 1 ∧ ∑ d ∈ divisors n, d = 2^k)>>>
