This problem appears to relate to finding the value of a certain expression involving variables \( x \) and \( y \), given the constraint \( x + 2y = 30 \). The goal is to enumerate possible solutions for the expression:

\[
\frac{x}{5} + \frac{2y}{3} + \frac{2y}{5} + \frac{x}{3}
\]

Given the linear constraint, we can parametrize \( x \) in terms of \( y \):
\[
x = 30 - 2y
\]

Substitute into the expression to find its value in terms of \( y \):

\[
\frac{30 - 2y}{5} + \frac{2y}{3} + \frac{2y}{5} + \frac{30 - 2y}{3}
\]

We can then evaluate this expression over a small range of \( y \) values to find possible answer candidates.

```python
# Enumerate candidate solutions for y in a small range
# For each y, compute x and evaluate the expression
# Print each exact computed result
for y_int in range(0, 16):  # y from 0 to 15
    y = y_int
    x = 30 - 2 * y
    # Calculate expression
    expr = (x / 5) + (2 * y / 3) + (2 * y / 5) + (x / 3)
    # Try to simplify numerator-wise to avoid floating point inaccuracies
    # Alternatively, print as float for approximation
    print(f'y = {y}, x = {x}, expression = {expr}')
```
