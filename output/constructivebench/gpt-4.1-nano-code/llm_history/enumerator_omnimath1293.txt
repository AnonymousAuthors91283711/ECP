This problem involves summing i^i for i from 1 to 100 and then finding the last digit of the sum. To approach this computationally without relying on the closed-form, we will enumerate each term, compute i^i, and sum these up, then take the last digit of the total.

We will:
- Use a small computational sample for i in 1..100
- Compute i^i efficiently using modular exponentiation to avoid large number issues
- Accumulate the sum modulo 10
- Print each computation result for transparency
- Finally, output the last digit of the sum

```python
# Compute sum of i^i for i from 1 to 100, modulo 10, printing each step
total_mod_10 = 0
for i in range(1, 101):
    # Compute i^i modulo 10 for efficiency
    last_digit = pow(i, i, 10)
    total_mod_10 = (total_mod_10 + last_digit) % 10
    print(f"{i}^{i} mod 10 = {last_digit}, cumulative sum mod 10 = {total_mod_10}")

# The last digit of the sum is:
omnimath1293_answer = total_mod_10
print(f"Final answer (last digit of sum): {omnimath1293_answer}")
```
