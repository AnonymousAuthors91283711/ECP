abbrev omnimath3518_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath3518 (input : ℕ) : 
  ((input - 8) / 2) + 16 = 32 ↔ input = omnimath3518_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Possible input: 40. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The condition ((input - 8) / 2) + 16 = 32 simplifies to input = 40, since (input - 8)/2 = 16 ⇒ input - 8 = 32 ⇒ input = 40. 

Answer:

<<<40>>>

This matches the pattern observed in enumeration and the algebra.
