The problem seems to involve a specific equation involving sqrt functions, with a parameter T which is given as T = 11 in the theorem. Our goal is to find all x satisfying the equation sqrt(20 + sqrt(T + x)) = 5 and relate x to T via a function, potentially defined as an answer function. To assist, we want to find possible values of x, especially for T = 11, and establish the equivalence.

Since T is given as 11 in the theorem and we are not told otherwise, we'll focus on evaluating the equation with T=11 and explore solutions for x that satisfy sqrt(20 + sqrt(11 + x)) = 5. To do so:

- We can isolate the inner radicals step by step.
- Because sqrt(...) = 5, the inner expression must be 25.
- Set 20 + sqrt(11 + x) = 25 → sqrt(11 + x) = 5
- Now, 11 + x = 25 → x = 14

This reasoning suggests that when T=11, x=14 satisfies the equation.  
For the purposes of enumerating solutions or conjecturing a general function, let's generalize for T and define our answer accordingly.

```python
# For a given T, find x satisfying sqrt(20 + sqrt(T + x)) = 5
# Rearranged: sqrt(T + x) = 25 - 20 = 5
# Therefore: T + x = 25, so x = 25 - T

def olympiadbench3101_answer(T):
    # Based on algebraic manipulation, for T where the radical makes sense
    # the solution is x = 25 - T
    return 25 - T

# Testing with T = 11
T_test = 11
x_solution = olympiadbench3101_answer(T_test)
print(f"For T = {T_test}, x = {x_solution}")
```

This code computes the specific answer x in terms of T and confirms the particular solution for T=11.
