This problem asks for the greatest integer \(k\) such that there exists a set \(s\) of 10 positive real numbers with certain properties. We need to understand the constraints involving the sums and products of pairs from \(s\), and find the maximum \(k\) for which such a set exists.

Given the constraints:
- \(s\) has 10 elements, all positive.
- The sums and products of pairs are limited: the number of sums less than some value and similarly for products.
- The set \(s\) is injective as a function (so all elements are distinct).

To find such a maximum, consider small sample values and enumerate options systematically:
- Use small positive real numbers, e.g., integers 1..10.
- Calculate pairwise sums and products.
- Count how many are below certain thresholds.
- Increase the threshold \(k\) until the constraints cannot be met anymore.

We will implement an enumeration over candidate \(k\) values (starting from small values upwards), check if the set meets the constraints, and select the greatest satisfying \(k\).

Because of efficiency needs, we avoid unnecessary computation: precompute pair sums and products for each candidate set; stop early when constraints are violated.

Here's the Python code to do that:

```python
import itertools

# Generate candidate sets - small positive integers for simplicity
candidate_sets = []
for s in itertools.combinations(range(1, 15), 10):  # small range to keep search feasible
    candidate_sets.append(s)

max_k_found = None
# We try increasing k from 1 upwards
for k in range(1, 50):  # upper bound for k, can adjust if needed
    found_for_this_k = False
    for s in candidate_sets:
        pairs = list(itertools.combinations(s, 2))
        # Count sums less than threshold; threshold for sums (simulate an upper limit)
        sums = [a + b for a, b in pairs]
        prods = [a * b for a, b in pairs]
        # For simplicity, assume sums and products are sorted
        sums_sorted = sorted(sums)
        prods_sorted = sorted(prods)
        # Limits based on the problem: sums card ≤ 45 - 5 + 1 = 41, so ≤ 41
        # for products, similar limit, but problem states: card ≤ 45 - k + 1
        sums_limit = 41
        prods_limit = 45 - k + 1
        # Count how many sums and products are below their respective limits
        count_sums = sum(1 for s in sums if s <= sums_limit)
        count_prods = sum(1 for p in prods if p <= prods_limit)
        # Check constraints
        if count_sums <= sums_limit and count_prods <= prods_limit:
            # Found a set for this k, record and break to try larger k
            print(f'k={k}, set={s}')
            max_k_found = k
            found_for_this_k = True
    if not found_for_this_k:
        # No set found for this k, so maximum is previous
        break

print(f'Maximum k satisfying constraints: {max_k_found}')
```
