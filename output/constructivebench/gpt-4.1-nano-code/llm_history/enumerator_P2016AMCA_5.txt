The problem appears to involve number theory, specifically about even numbers greater than 2 and their representations as sums of two primes (related to Goldbach's conjecture). To assist conjecturing the answer, let's enumerate even numbers greater than 2, check their prime sums, and listing out cases up to a small threshold (say, 50). We will generate possible candidates for such even numbers and verify whether they can be written as the sum of two primes.

Our goal:
- List even n > 2
- Check if n can be expressed as p + q with p and q primes
- For each n, output the result.

Since the problem is to find all such even numbers, no hardcoded answer, but to enumerate systematically. We will keep the implementation efficient by generating primes with a sieve up to our threshold.

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

limit = 50  # Small sample for illustration
valid_numbers = []

print("Checking even numbers > 2 up to", limit)
for n in range(4, limit + 1, 2):
    # Check if n can be written as sum of two primes
    can_be_expressed = False
    for p in range(2, n):
        if is_prime(p):
            q = n - p
            if is_prime(q):
                can_be_expressed = True
                print(f"{n} = {p} + {q}")
                break
    if can_be_expressed:
        valid_numbers.append(n)

print("\nEven numbers > 2 up to", limit, "that are sum of two primes:")
for n in valid_numbers:
    print(n)
```
