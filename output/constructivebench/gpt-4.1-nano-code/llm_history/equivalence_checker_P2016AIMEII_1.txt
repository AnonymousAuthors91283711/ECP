Ground Truth Answer: 108
Proposed Answer: 12
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem describes a system of equations involving four variables (b, c, r, d) with constraints on their relationships to P2016AIMEII_1_answer.

2. The ground truth answer is 108, which satisfies all the given conditions when plugged into the equations.

3. The proposed answer is 12. Let's test if this could work:
   - From b = 12 * r and c = 12 * r², and 12 + b + c = 444, we'd get 12 + 12r + 12r² = 444 ⇒ r² + r - 36 = 0
   - The positive solution is r = (-1 + √145)/2 ≈ 5.52 (not an integer)
   - The problem requires all variables to be natural numbers

4. The proposed answer 12 fails to satisfy the integer requirement for r and the exact sum condition of 444.
