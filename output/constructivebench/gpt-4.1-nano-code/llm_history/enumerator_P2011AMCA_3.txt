The problem appears to ask for the smallest natural number `n` such that there exists a function `k : Fin n → ℕ` with sum `(∑ i, k i * 35) ≥ 500`. To find this smallest `n`, we need to find the minimal number of elements `n` where the maximum sum `(∑ i, k i * 35)` can reach at least 500 by choosing appropriate `k i`.

Since each `k i` is a natural number, the maximum sum for a fixed `n` occurs when all `k i` are as large as possible. To reach at least 500, the minimal total `n` must satisfy:

`n * max_k(i) * 35 ≥ 500`.

Maximizing `k i` means choosing large `k i`. For a given `n`, the sum can be made up to `(n * max_k) * 35`. To reach at least 500, the minimum total `n` with maximum `k_i` of 1 (since increasing `k_i` would only increase sum) is:

`n * 1 * 35 ≥ 500` → `n ≥ 500 / 35` ≈ 14.28.

Therefore, checking `n` from 14 upwards:

- For `n=14`, maximum sum: `14 * 35 = 490`, which is less than 500 → not possible.
- For `n=15`, maximum sum: `15 * 35 = 525`, which exceeds 500 → possible.

Hence, the smallest such `n` is 15.

Let's implement a program to verify this.

```python
# Enumerate n from small to large, checking if sum can reach at least 500
# under the constraint k_i ≥ 0 (natural numbers). Max sum with all k_i=highest possible.

max_value = 0
for n in range(1, 20):
    max_sum = n * 35  # assuming k_i=1 for maximum sum
    print(f"n={n}, max sum with k_i=1: {max_sum}")
    if max_sum >= 500:
        print(f"Smallest n with sum ≥ 500 is: {n}")
        break
```
