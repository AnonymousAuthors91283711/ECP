This problem involves finding pairs of positive integers \((m, n)\) such that \((m \times n - 1)\) divides \((m^2 + n^2)\). To help conjecture and explore solutions, I will generate pairs for small \(m, n\). I'll iterate through small positive values (e.g., 1 to 20), check the divisibility condition, output pairs when the condition holds, and identify any patterns. The goal is to produce all solutions up to these bounds.

```python
# Enumerate pairs of positive integers (m, n) to find all solutions where
# (m * n - 1) divides (m^2 + n^2).
# Limit m, n to small bounds for efficiency and potential pattern recognition.

max_value = 20
for m in range(1, max_value + 1):
    for n in range(1, max_value + 1):
        denom = m * n - 1
        if denom != 0 and (m * m + n * n) % denom == 0:
            print(f"(m, n) = ({m}, {n}) satisfies: ({m}*{n}-1) divides ({m}^2 + {n}^2)")
```
