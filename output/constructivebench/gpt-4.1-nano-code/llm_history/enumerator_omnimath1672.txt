This problem asks to find the greatest natural number \( n \) such that \( 2007^n \) divides \( 2007! \). In other words, we need to find the largest \( n \) for which \( 2007^n \mid 2007! \).

Since \( 2007 = 3^2 \times 223 \), the prime factorization involves primes 3 and 223. The maximum \( n \) is limited by the smaller of the exponents of 3 and 223 in the factorization of \( 2007! \), because:

\[
n \leq \min \left( \left\lfloor \frac{v_3(2007!)}{2} \right\rfloor , v_{223}(2007!) \right)
\]

where \( v_p(m!) \) is the exponent of prime \( p \) in \( m! \). We can compute these exponents and find the maximum \( n \).

Let's write code to compute exponents of prime factors of 2007 in 2007!:

```python
import math

# Prime factors of 2007
primes = [3, 223]

# Function to compute exponent of prime p in n!
def prime_exponent_in_factorial(n, p):
    count = 0
    power = p
    while power <= n:
        count += n // power
        power *= p
    return count

factorization_counts = {}
n = 2007
for p in primes:
    count = prime_exponent_in_factorial(n, p)
    factorization_counts[p] = count
    print(f"Exponent of {p} in {n}!: {count}")

# Compute maximum n
max_n = min(factorization_counts[3] // 2, factorization_counts[223])
print(f"The greatest n such that 2007^n divides 2007! is: {max_n}")
```

This code calculates exponents of 3 and 223 in 2007!, then finds the maximum \( n \).
