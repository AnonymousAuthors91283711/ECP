abbrev omnimath2826_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2826 :
  2 * (2 : ℝ) ^ 2 + 3 * (2 : ℝ) ^ 2 = omnimath2826_answer :=
sorry
. Enumerated answers: 20. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the pattern of the enumerated answers and the calculations, the expression simplifies to the sum of basic powers and coefficients: 2*2^2 + 3*2^2 = 4*2 + 3*4 = 8 + 12 = 20. The general form, independent of specific values, is the sum of scaled powers of 2 with coefficients.  
Final answer: <<<2 * (2 : ℝ) ^ 2 + 3 * (2 : ℝ) ^ 2>>>
