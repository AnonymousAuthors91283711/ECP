This problem is essentially asking for the number of 8-element matchings in an 8x8 grid where each row and column has exactly one chosen element, and the partition of chosen elements by their parity of sum (even or odd) is exactly four each. That is, it's describing a set of permutations (since each row and column has exactly one element) with a particular parity distribution.

Key observations:
- The set `s` is a permutation of `Fin 8 × Fin 8`.
- The filter conditions imply `s` describes a permutation matrix.
- The parity conditions imply equally many chosen points with `(row + column)` even and odd.

The problem amounts to counting permutations of 8 elements where exactly 4 of the positions are on squares with `(row + column)` even, and 4 are on squares with `(row + column)` odd. Since `s` specifies exactly one element per row and column, `s` corresponds to a permutation.

The positions are on an 8x8 grid:
- Half the positions are on even sum squares, half on odd sum squares. Specifically, in an 8x8 checkerboard pattern:
  - There are 32 total squares with `(row + column)` even
  - 32 total squares with `(row + column)` odd

The count reduces to:

Number of permutations `p` of `{1,2,...,8}` such that:
- Exactly 4 mapped pairs `(i, p(i))` are on squares with `(i + p(i))` even,
- Exactly 4 mapped pairs are on squares with `(i + p(i))` odd.

We can count via combinatorics:
- Choose which 4 rows `i` will map to positions with `(i + p(i))` even.

- For each such choice, count the possible arrangements.

Because of symmetry, the total number of permutations adhering to the parity constraints can be computed as:

\[
\sum_{k=0}^{4} \binom{8}{k} \times \text{number of derangements with parity matching}
\]

But in fact, since the grid is perfectly bipartitioned, and we require the permutation to have exactly 4 even and 4 odd pairs, the count reduces to:

\[
\binom{8}{4} \times 4! \times 4! 
\]

because:
- Choose 4 rows that will map to even-sum columns
- Assign these 4 rows to 4 even-sum columns (4! ways)
- The remaining 4 rows assign to the 4 odd-sum columns (another 4! ways)

Total:

\[
\boxed{\binom{8}{4} \times (4!)^2}
\]

which is 70 × 24 × 24 = 70 × 576 = 40,320.

So, the answer is 40320.

Here's the Python code to verify this:

```python
from math import comb, factorial

# Choose 4 rows to assign to even-sum columns
rows_even_choices = comb(8, 4)
# Permute chosen 4 rows among 4 even-sum columns
perm_even = factorial(4)
# Permute remaining 4 rows among the 4 odd-sum columns
perm_odd = factorial(4)

answer = rows_even_choices * perm_even * perm_odd
print(answer)
```

This code computes the total number of such permutations directly, verifying the combinatorial reasoning.
