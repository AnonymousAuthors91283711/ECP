This problem involves finding the maximum value of the sum of four cyclic terms, each involving positive variables with a fixed sum. Due to symmetry and positivity constraints, the extremum likely occurs with some equalities among the variables. To assist in conjecturing the answer, I will enumerate candidate values, focusing on cases where the variables are equal or nearly equal, and some boundary cases where one variable is maximized and others are minimized, respecting the sum constraint.

Given that `a + b + c + d = 100` and all variables are nonnegative, I will generate candidates by fixing some variables to small, equal, or boundary values, then compute the sum. The approach will be to evaluate the sum for various plausible configurations, prioritizing symmetry, as these often give extrema. We seek the maximum of the sum, so we track candidates and print each as encountered.

Note: The variables are positive but can be zero (since non-neg = 0). The division by `b+7`, etc., prevents division by zero, so adding 7 ensures division safe even if variables are zero.

```python
import itertools

def evaluate_sum(a, b, c, d):
    # Compute the sum of the four cyclic terms
    term1 = (a / (b + 7)) ** (1/3)
    term2 = (b / (c + 7)) ** (1/3)
    term3 = (c / (d + 7)) ** (1/3)
    term4 = (d / (a + 7)) ** (1/3)
    return term1 + term2 + term3 + term4

max_value = -float('inf')

# Explore configurations where variables are equal
for val in [0, 25, 50, 75, 100]:
    # All equal
    a = b = c = d = 100/4
    candidate = evaluate_sum(a, b, c, d)
    print(f'Equal variables: a=b=c=d={a:.2f} -> Sum={candidate:.4f}')
    if candidate > max_value:
        max_value = candidate

# Explore boundary cases: one variable large, others small
for large in [100, 75, 50]:
    for small_set in itertools.combinations_with_replacement([0, 25, 50, 75], 3):
        a = large
        b, c, d = small_set
        # Adjust to sum to 100
        total = a + b + c + d
        diff = 100 - total
        b += diff
        if b < 0:
            continue
        candidate = evaluate_sum(a, b, c, d)
        print(f'Boundary case: a={a}, b={b:.2f}, c={c}, d={d}')
        if candidate > max_value:
            max_value = candidate

# Explore some asymmetric small tests
a, b, c, d = 0, 0, 50, 50
candidate = evaluate_sum(a, b, c, d)
print(f'Small asymmetry: a=0, b=0, c=50, d=50 -> Sum={candidate:.4f}')
if candidate > max_value:
    max_value = candidate

# Final: print the best candidate found
print(f'Max approximate value: {max_value:.4f}')
```
