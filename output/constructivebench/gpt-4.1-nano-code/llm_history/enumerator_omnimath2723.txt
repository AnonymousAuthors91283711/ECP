This problem involves four non-negative integers \(a, b, c, d\) with total sum 120, and relations \(b = a + 6\), \(c = b + 6\), \(d = c + 6\). We need to find \(d\). Since the relations are linear, we can determine actual values of \(a, b, c, d\), then output \(d\).

The relations imply:
- \(b = a + 6\)
- \(c = a + 12\)
- \(d = a + 18\)

Sum constraint:
\[a + (a+6) + (a+12) + (a+18) = 120\]
Simplify:
\[4a + 36 = 120\]
\[4a = 84\]
\[a = 21\]

Then:
\[b = 27, \quad c=33, \quad d=39\]

Since the parameters are fixed by the equations, there's only one solution.

Here's the code that computes and outputs this result directly, matching your requirements:

```python
# Since the relations are linear, find a directly
a = (120 - 36) // 4  # integer division
b = a + 6
c = b + 6
d = c + 6
print("d =", d)
```
