The given problem seems to be about constructing a function \(f : \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \to \mathrm{Fin}\ 10\) satisfying certain injectivity conditions for all pairs within a bounded domain \(x, y \in [1, 252]\), with all pairs distinct and the images either in the set \(\mathrm{Fin}\ 10\).

The goal appears to be to find or verify the existence of such a function, which maps pairs of integers within certain bounds into 10-element finite sets under constraints. Since the problem is high-level and asks for enumeration, we'll fix small sample ranges for \(x, y\) (say, within 1 to 10) and examine possible injective mappings.

We will:
- Fix small bounds for \(x, y\) (say, 1 to 10).
- Generate all possible functions \(f\) from pairs \((x, y)\) within those bounds, mapping into \(\{0, 1, ..., 9\}\).
- Enforce that for all pairs \((a, b)\) and \((b, c)\), if \(a \neq b\), then \(f(a, b) \neq f(b, c)\).
- Print each valid \(\text{function}\) as a dictionary or similar structure when found.

Below is a simplified enumeration approach for small sets, focusing on satisfying the injectivity constraints, given the constraints are complex for the broader large domain.

```python
import itertools

# For simplified enumeration, restrict to small ranges.
min_x, max_x = 1, 5
min_y, max_y = 1, 5
domain_pairs = [(x, y) for x in range(min_x, max_x + 1) for y in range(min_y, max_y + 1)]

# Generate all possible mappings: assign each pair a value in {0,...,9}.
# Given the large number of possibilities, limit to fewer combinations for feasibility.
# For demonstration, we'll generate a limited sample of functions:
max_computations = 1000
count = 0

# Helper: Check the injectivity condition for the current mapping.
def check_conditions(f_map):
    for (a, b) in domain_pairs:
        for (b2, c) in domain_pairs:
            if b2 == b and a != b2:
                if f_map[(a, b)] == f_map[(b2, c)]:
                    return False
    return True

# Sample a subset of mappings to attempt (since full enumeration is large).
for assign in itertools.product(range(10), repeat=len(domain_pairs)):
    if count >= max_computations:
        break
    f_map = dict(zip(domain_pairs, assign))
    if check_conditions(f_map):
        print("Found valid function mapping for sample domain:")
        for pair in domain_pairs:
            print(f"f({pair}) = {f_map[pair]}")
        print("---")
        count += 1
```
