theorem IMO2021SLN3 (n : ℕ) (hn : 0 < n) :
  (∃ (l : List ℕ), l.Perm (n.divisors.toList) ∧ ∀ i ∈ Finset.range (l.length + 1), 
    IsSquare (l.take i).sum) ↔ n ∈ IMO2021SLN3_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n, divisors
1
3
Candidate n with the property: [1, 3]. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The pattern suggests the answer set corresponds to numbers whose divisors form a list permutable to [1, 3], with the property that the initial sum is a perfect square. This only holds when n = 3, since the divisors are {1, 3} and sums 1, 4 (which is 2^2). For other n, divisors differ or sums are not perfect squares.  
Final answer: <<<{3}>>>
