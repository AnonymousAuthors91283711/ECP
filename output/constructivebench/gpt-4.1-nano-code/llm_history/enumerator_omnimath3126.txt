The problem involves a parameterized equation: for all real x, (x + a)(x + 8) = x^2 + b x + 24. We need to find the sum a + b based on this condition. 

Since the equality holds for all real x, compare coefficients of the expanded form with the right side to derive a and b:

- Expand the left: (x + a)(x + 8) = x^2 + (a + 8)x + 8a.
- The right side is: x^2 + b x + 24.

Matching coefficients:

- For x^2: both sides are x^2, so OK.
- For x: a + 8 = b
- Constant term: 8a = 24 -> a = 3

Once a is known, then b = a + 8 = 3 + 8 = 11.

Therefore, a + b = 3 + 11 = 14.

Our code will verify this by enumerating candidate pairs (a, b) that satisfy the polynomial identity for multiple x values â€” or rather, directly derive a and b as above. Since the problem is straightforward, we'll programmatically check the coefficients match for arbitrary (a, b), confirming the result.

```python
# Enumerate possible (a, b) that satisfy (x + a)(x + 8) = x^2 + b*x + 24 for multiple sample x
# Then compute and print a + b

possible_answers = set()

# Test for a range of a near the solution to verify the relation
for a in [i * 0.1 for i in range(-100, 101)]:
    # From the constant term: 8a = 24 => a should be 3, but we allow minor deviations for verification
    if abs(8 * a - 24) > 1e-8:
        continue
    # Compute b from the coefficient of x: a + 8 = b
    b = a + 8
    # Verify the linear coefficient matches
    # The polynomial equality: (x + a)(x + 8) = x^2 + (a + 8) x + 8a
    # So for arbitrary x, the identity holds if the coefficients match
    # Confirm the coefficients match for multiple x values
    for x in [-10, 0, 10]:
        left = (x + a)*(x + 8)
        right = x**2 + b * x + 24
        if abs(left - right) > 1e-8:
            break
    else:
        # If only one a satisfies, compute a + b
        possible_answers.add(a + b)

# We expect a + b to be 14
for answer in sorted(possible_answers):
    print(answer)
```
