theorem olympiadbench2847 :
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ ∃ (b r : ℕ), b + r = n ∧ 0 < b ∧ 0 < r ∧ b * r * (b + r - 2) / 2 = 25} olympiadbench2847_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: b=2, r=5, n=7
b=5, r=2, n=7
Least n satisfying conditions: 7. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The minimal n satisfying the conditions is 7, with b=2, r=5, or vice versa. The pattern indicates n= b + r, with b, r ≥ 1, and the product b * r * (b + r - 2)/2 = 25. Since the product involves b, r, and their sum, the minimal n is when b + r is minimized, which is 7. The expression is thus unified as n = b + r, with b, r ≥ 1, and the product equals 25.
