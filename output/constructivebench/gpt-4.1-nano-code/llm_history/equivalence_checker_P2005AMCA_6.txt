Ground Truth Answer: 5
Proposed Answer: 13
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is setting up a scenario with two people (Josh and Mike) traveling at different speeds related to some time t.

2. The key equations given are:
   - josh_speed = (4/5)*(13/t)
   - mike_speed = 13/t
   - josh_speed*(2t) + mike_speed*t = 13
   - mike_speed*t = answer

3. From the last equation, mike_speed*t = (13/t)*t = 13, which would suggest the answer is 13.

4. However, the ground truth answer is 5, which contradicts this direct calculation.

5. Looking deeper, the third equation gives us:
   (4/5)*(13/t)*(2t) + (13/t)*t = 13
   => (8/5)*13 + 13 = 13
   => (13/5)*13 = 13
   This leads to a contradiction (13/5 = 1), suggesting the proposed answer of 13 is incorrect.

The ground truth answer of 5 appears to be correct when properly solving the system of equations, while the proposed answer of 13 is incorrect.
