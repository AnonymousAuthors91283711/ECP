The problem involves solving the equation \( \frac{x}{90} - \frac{x}{120} = \frac{16}{60} \). We will implement a program to find all solutions within a reasonable range, prioritize exact rational solutions, and then check for possible values of x. Since the exact algebraic solution is straightforward, we'll enumerate candidate values within a small range to observe possible solutions, aiding in forming conjectures.

```python
# We will enumerate possible x values in a reasonable range to observe solutions.
# The equation is (x/90) - (x/120) = 16/60.
# Simplify RHS: 16/60 = 4/15.

from fractions import Fraction

# Known constants
left_diff = lambda x: Fraction(x, 90) - Fraction(x, 120)
rhs = Fraction(4, 15)

# Range for enumeration - since denominators are 90 and 120, trying multiples of 6 or 15 for simplicity
for x in range(-300, 301):
    val = left_diff(x)
    if val == rhs:
        print(f"x = {x}")
```
