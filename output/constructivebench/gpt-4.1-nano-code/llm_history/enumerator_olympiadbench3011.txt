The problem appears to involve finding the minimal positive real number \( t \) such that there exists an injective function \( f : \text{Fin } 3 \to \mathbb{R} \), with each value in the set \(\{\arcsin(\sin t), \arccos(\cos t), \arctan(\tan t)\}\), and the difference between consecutive function values is a constant nonzero \( d \). We need to explore possible candidate values \( t \) and check the consistency of such a \( f \).

Considering the angles involved:
- \(\sin t\), \(\cos t\), and \(\tan t\) are standard trigonometric functions.
- The values \(\arcsin (\sin t)\), \(\arccos (\cos t)\), \(\arctan (\tan t)\) simplify to certain principal values within their ranges.
- The problem asks for the least \( t > 0 \) satisfying these conditions.

Given the difficulty of abstract symbolic analysis, let's select small sample \( t \) values and evaluate the possible values of these inverse trigonometric functions, then try to find an arithmetic progression among three values in the set.

The key idea:
- For small \( t \), \(\arcsin (\sin t) \approx t\),
- \(\arccos (\cos t) \approx t\) when \( t \) near zero, but actually \(\arccos(\cos t) = t\) only if \( t \in [0, \pi] \),
- \(\arctan (\tan t) \approx t\) for \( t \) in principal domain.

A strategy: pick small positive \( t \), compute the three principal inverse functions, and check whether the three values form an arithmetic progression with a common difference \( d \).

Let's implement this for a small sample of \( t \) values and check all ordering permutations of the three values, looking for the minimal such \( t \).

```python
import math

# Generate candidate t values up to a certain threshold
t_values = [n * 0.01 for n in range(1, 100)]  # t from 0.01 to 1.00

# For each t, compute the three inverse values
# and check if they can form an arithmetic progression
for t in t_values:
    vals = {
        'arcsin_sin_t': math.asin(math.sin(t)),
        'arccos_cos_t': math.acos(math.cos(t)),
        'arctan_tan_t': math.atan(math.tan(t))
    }
    # Permute the order of values to check all orderings
    values_list = list(vals.values())
    from itertools import permutations
    found = False
    for perm in permutations(values_list):
        d = perm[1] - perm[0]
        if math.isclose(perm[2] - perm[1], d, rel_tol=1e-9):
            # Record the minimal t found with this property
            print(f"t = {t:.3f} with values {perm} forms an arithmetic progression with difference {d:.6f}")
            found = True
            break
    if found:
        # Since we're looking for the least such t, exit early
        break
```
