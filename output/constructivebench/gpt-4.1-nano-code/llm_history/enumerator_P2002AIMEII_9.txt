This problem involves enumerating all pairs of disjoint nonempty subsets of a certain set S, where S is the image of {0,1,...,9} under the successor function. To find the value of n, the total number of such pairs, we will:

- Generate S as {1, 2, ..., 10}.
- Enumerate all nonempty subsets of S.
- For each pair of nonempty, disjoint subsets, count it.

Since the total number can be large, but manageable for small sets, we'll implement an efficient enumeration directly in Python, counting pairs of subsets with the conditions.

The code will:

- Generate all nonempty subsets of S.
- For each pair, check disjointness and nonemptiness.
- Count total pairs.
- Output the count modulo 1000 as required.

```python
from itertools import combinations, chain

def all_nonempty_subsets(s):
    return chain.from_iterable(combinations(s, r) for r in range(1, len(s)+1))

def enumerate_pairs():
    S = list(range(1, 11))
    subsets = list(all_nonempty_subsets(S))
    count = 0
    for A in subsets:
        setA = set(A)
        for B in subsets:
            setB = set(B)
            if setA.isdisjoint(setB):
                count += 1
                # Output each pair to stream partial results
                print(f"Disjoint pair: {setA} and {setB}")
    return count

total_pairs = enumerate_pairs()
print(f"Total number of pairs: {total_pairs}")
print(f"Answer modulo 1000: {total_pairs % 1000}")
```
