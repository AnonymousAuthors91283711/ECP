Given q = (2/5) p and p q = 90, substituting q yields (2/5) p^2 = 90, so p^2 = 90 * (5/2) = 225, and p = ±√225 = ±15. The relevant solution (since p is real and contextually positive) is p = 15.

The current expression attempts to include a reasoning paragraph directly after the definition `abbrev omnimath2672_answer : ℝ := ...`, which is not valid syntax in Lean. Instead, the value should be directly assigned as a mathematical expression, derived from the problem's solution steps.

From the reasoning, the positive real solution for \( p \) that satisfies \( q = \frac{2}{5} p \) and \( p q = 90 \) is \( p = 15 \). Since the question asks for a closed-form answer in Lean, the most straightforward contribution is simply `15`.

Here is the fixed Lean answer, which removes the invalid "Given ..." reasoning and directly assigns the value:
