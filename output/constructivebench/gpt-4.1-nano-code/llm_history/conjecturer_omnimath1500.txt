. Enumerated answers: a(999) = 999
. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests a recursive relation where a(n) relates to n^3 divided by a(n−1). With a(1) = 1, successive values align with the previous value, implying the sequence becomes n itself. Testing initial cases supports this, concluding that a(n) = n. Therefore, a(999) = 999.
