The problem seems to relate to sets of six consecutive natural numbers starting from a positive integer n, and asks for conditions where the product of three of these numbers equals the product of the other three. The question wants to enumerate possible values of n satisfying this, or characterize n for which the property holds.

Since the concrete theorem statement involves sets {n, n+1, ..., n+5}, and a multiplicative equality involving six consecutive numbers split into two triples, the key is to examine small values of n to see when such a partition exists.

To approach this:
- We can iterate over small n to check all partitions of the set {n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4, n+5}.
- For each n, generate all partitions into two triples.
- Check whether the products are equal.
- Output n if the condition holds.

This enumeration considers small n because large n would produce large products and is computationally inefficient. We assume n > 0 as given.

Here's the code to perform this enumeration:

```python
# Enumerate small n to find when there's a partition of {n..n+5} into two triples with equal products
from itertools import combinations

def main():
    # We'll check few small n values to find occurrences
    max_n = 20
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        numbers = list(range(n, n + 6))
        found = False
        # Generate all combinations of size 3 for one subset, the rest form the other subset
        for subset in combinations(numbers, 3):
            product1 = 1
            for x in subset:
                product1 *= x
            remaining = [x for x in numbers if x not in subset]
            product2 = 1
            for x in remaining:
                product2 *= x
            if product1 == product2:
                print(f"n = {n} satisfies the condition with subset {subset} and remaining {remaining}")
                found = True
                break
        if not found:
            print(f"n = {n} does not satisfy the condition.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code performs a brute-force enumeration over small n, checking all partitions into two triples. When equality holds, it prints the value of n and the partition satisfying the condition.
