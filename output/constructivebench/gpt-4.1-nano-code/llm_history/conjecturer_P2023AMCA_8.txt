theorem P2023AMCA_8 (n : ℕ) (s : ℝ) (h₁ : (s + 11) / (n + 1) = s / n + 1) 
  (h₂ : (s + 33) / (n + 3) = s / n + 2) : 
  s / n = P2023AMCA_8_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n = 3, s/n = 7. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The given equations suggest a linear relation between s/n and n, with the solutions converging to a specific value as n varies. Analyzing the pattern, s/n simplifies to 7 when n = 3.

Hence, the final closed form answer, independent of n, is the constant 7.

<<<7>>>

This matches the enumeration where n = 3, s/n = 7, and generalizes the solution.
