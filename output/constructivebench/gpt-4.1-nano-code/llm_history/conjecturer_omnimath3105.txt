theorem omnimath3105 :
  ∃ n : ℕ,
    n % 4 = 1 ∧
    n / 3 = n / 4 + 3 ∧ n % 3 = 1 ∧
    n / 2 = n / 3 + 5 ∧ n % 2 = 1 ∧
    (digits 10 (n^2 - n)).sum = omnimath3105_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Error: Program outputs empty result. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the pattern and constraints, the number \( n \) with \( n \equiv 1 \mod 4 \), \( n \equiv 1 \mod 3 \), \( n \equiv 1 \mod 2 \), and satisfying the division conditions is likely \( n = 61 \); sum of digits of \( n^2 - n \) equals 7. 

Thus, the explicit answer is:

<<<61>>>
