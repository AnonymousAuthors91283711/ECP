965. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The pattern suggests the set consists of numbers that maintain the property that the sum of any two elements is squarefree. The incremental pattern hints at elements starting from 1, 2, then jumps to larger numbers maintaining this property. The set appears to contain numbers that are either 1, 2, or odd numbers with specific divisibility properties ensuring the sum with any other element is squarefree. The sequence aligns with numbers that are 1 or 2 mod 4, and include some odd composite numbers avoiding squares.

Final answer:
<<<{ n : ℕ | n = 1 ∨ n = 2 ∨ (∃ k : ℕ, n = 4 * k + 1) ∧ (n ≠ 25) }>>>
