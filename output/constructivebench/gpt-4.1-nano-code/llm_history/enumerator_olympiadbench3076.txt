This problem involves computing the coefficient of \(X^{10}\) in the composition of a polynomial with itself: \(f(X) = X + X^2 + X^4 + X^8 + X^{16} + X^{32}\), specifically in \(f(f(X))\). To find this coefficient, consider all pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are exponents with non-zero coefficients in \(f\), such that \(a + b = 10\) because composing the polynomial sums over all such pairs due to the composition rule.

The non-zero terms of \(f\) are at exponents:
\[ \{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32\} \]
Any pair \((a, b)\) with \(a, b \in \{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32\}\) and \(a + b = 10\) contributes 1 to the coefficient, since all coefficients are 1.

Let's enumerate all pairs:

- \((1, 9)\) - 9 is not in set.
- \((2, 8)\) - 8 is in the set; sum is 10, so counts 1.
- \((4, 6)\) - 6 is not in set.
- \((8, 2)\) - 2 in set; sum is 10, count.
- \((16, -6)\) and others are invalid.

So only the pairs \((2,8)\) and \((8,2)\) contribute.

Hence, the coefficient is 2.

Here's the program enumerating these pairs explicitly:

```python
# Enumerate all pairs of exponents from the set
exponents = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32]
target_sum = 10
count = 0
for a in exponents:
    for b in exponents:
        if a + b == target_sum:
            print(f"Pair found: ({a}, {b})")
            count += 1
print("The coefficient of X^10 in f(f(X)) is:", count)
```
