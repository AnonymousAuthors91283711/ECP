The problem appears to involve examining the divisibility condition for sequences involving exponents and the infinitude of certain n. To aid in understanding, I will generate small positive pairs \( (a, b) \) with integer values to see whether the divisibility holds for many \( n \). We can systematically check small integer pairs and see if the divisibility condition:

\[
a^n + b^n \mid a^{n+1} + b^{n+1}
\]

holds infinitely often or not. Since the question involves the infinitude of such \( n \), initial testing with small integers will help. We'll generate pairs with \( a \neq b \), both positive, and test for divisibility for increasing \( n \).

Additionally, I will output all candidate pairs with their respective \( n \) satisfying the divisibility, and track whether the divisibility occurs infinitely often (i.e., for arbitrarily large \( n \)) for these pairs.

```python
# Enumerate small pairs (a, b) with 1 <= a < b <= 10
# For each pair, test for n from 1 up to 50
# Check if a^n + b^n divides a^{n+1} + b^{n+1}
# Record pairs where divisibility happens for multiple n, indicating potential infinitude

max_b = 10
max_n = 50

for a in range(1, max_b):
    for b in range(a+1, max_b+1):
        divisible_ns = []
        for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
            numerator = a**(n+1) + b**(n+1)
            denominator = a**n + b**n
            if numerator % denominator == 0:
                divisible_ns.append(n)
                print(f"Pair (a={a}, b={b}), n={n} -> divisible")
        # Check if divisibility occurs at multiple n, suggesting potential infinite occurrence
        if len(divisible_ns) > 5:
            print(f"Pair (a={a}, b={b}) shows divisibility for many n: {divisible_ns}")
```
