This problem asks finding a unique value Y less than 10 such that for all X less than 10, the number 1230000 + X * 1000 + 500 + 10Y + 7 is not divisible by 11, and Y should be uniquely determined by this condition.

To assist in conjecturing the true answer, I will implement a Python script that:
- Enumerates all Y from 0 to 9.
- Checks the condition for all X from 0 to 9.
- Prints Y if the condition holds for all X.
- Stops once the unique Y is identified.

This approach helps verify the candidate Y values and find the exact answer.

```python
# Enumerate Y from 0 to 9
for Y in range(10):
    # Check for all X in 0..9
    all_fail = True
    for X in range(10):
        number = 1230000 + X * 1000 + 500 + Y * 10 + 7
        if number % 11 == 0:
            all_fail = False
            break
    # If for all X, number is not divisible by 11, print Y
    if all_fail:
        print(f"Y = {Y} satisfies the condition.")
```
