This problem involves evaluating the product: (1 - 1/3) * (1 - 1/4) * (1 - 1/5), and representing the exact rational value. To assist conjecturing and verifying the answer, we'll compute this step-by-step in Python with exact rational arithmetic using the `fractions` module, then stream the result immediately after each calculation.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Compute (1 - 1/3)
part1 = Fraction(1) - Fraction(1, 3)
print(f"(1 - 1/3) = {part1}")

# Compute (1 - 1/4)
part2 = Fraction(1) - Fraction(1, 4)
print(f"(1 - 1/4) = {part2}")

# Compute (1 - 1/5)
part3 = Fraction(1) - Fraction(1, 5)
print(f"(1 - 1/5) = {part3}")

# Compute the product
answer = part1 * part2 * part3
print(f"(1 - 1/3) * (1 - 1/4) * (1 - 1/5) = {answer}")

# Assign to the provided abbreviation
omnimath3392_answer = answer
```
