The problem appears to involve finding a least natural number \( n \) satisfying certain voting conditions. Specifically, the conditions relate to distributing \( n \) votes among 27 candidates, with the total sum of votes equal to \( n \), and a certain inequality involving votes for each candidate.

Given the pattern, it resembles a problem about the distribution of votes, proportions, and inequalities that arise in mathematical competitions such as the AIME. To help conjecture the answer, we'll enumerate possible \( n \) values starting from the smallest positive integers. For each candidate \( n \), we'll attempt to find a voting distribution and check the inequality.

The key inequality:
\[ \frac{100 \times \text{votes}_i}{n} < \text{votes}_i - 1 \]

which can be rearranged to:
\[ 100 \times \text{votes}_i < (\text{votes}_i - 1) \times n \]

We will search for the minimal \( n \) that admits such a distribution.

Here's a Python script that performs this enumeration efficiently, checking small \( n \) values and trying all feasible vote distributions, stopping once it finds the least such \( n \) with a valid distribution.

```python
# Enumerate n starting from 1 upwards to find the minimum n satisfying the conditions.
# For each n, distribute votes among 27 candidates to satisfy the total votes and inequalities.
from itertools import combinations_with_replacement

def check_votes(n, num_candidates=27):
    # Generate all possible votes distributions summing to n (heuristic: try promising patterns)
    # To keep it feasible, we only check distributions where votes are not too large.
    # For efficiency, limit max votes per candidate.
    max_vote = n  # maximum votes per candidate cannot exceed n.
    for votes in generate_votes(n, num_candidates, max_vote):
        if all((100 * votes_i) < (votes_i -1)*n for votes_i in votes if votes_i > 0):
            return True
    return False

def generate_votes(total, length, max_vote):
    # Generate all combinations with replacement summing to total
    # We use recursion with pruning for efficiency.
    def backtrack(start, remaining, path):
        if len(path) == length:
            if remaining == 0:
                yield tuple(path)
            return
        for v in range(max(0, remaining - (length - len(path) - 1)*max_vote), min(remaining, max_vote)+1):
            backtrack(start+1, remaining - v, path + [v])
    return backtrack(0, total, [])

n = 1
while True:
    # For each n, check if distribution exists
    if check_votes(n):
        print(f"Found n={n}")
        break
    n += 1
```
