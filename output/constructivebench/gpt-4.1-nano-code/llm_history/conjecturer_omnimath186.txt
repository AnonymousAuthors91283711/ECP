abbrev omnimath186_answer : Prop := sorry
theorem omnimath186 : omnimath186_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Solution: (x=0, y=5)
Solution: (x=3, y=4)
Solution: (x=4, y=3)
Solution: (x=5, y=0)
. Expected Answer Type: Prop
The pattern indicates solutions are pairs where the sum equals 5, i.e., x + y = 5, with x and y in ℕ. No other solutions are apparent in the pattern. Thus, the closed-form pattern expressed as a property: 

<<<∀ x y : ℕ, x + y = 5>>>
