The problem appears to be about finding the greatest \(k \leq 1000\) such that 7 divides \(\binom{1000}{k}\). We need to find all such values of \(k\) where \(\binom{1000}{k}\) is divisible by 7, then determine the maximum \(k\).

To do this efficiently, we can:
- Enumerate \(k = 0\) to 1000.
- Check if \(\binom{1000}{k}\) is divisible by 7.
- Track the maximum \(k\) where divisibility occurs.
- Output all such divisors as they are found.

The key is the divisibility check. For small \(n\), it's feasible to compute \(\binom{n}{k}\). Since \(n=1000\) and \(k\leq 1000\), iterating over all \(k\) and checking divisibility is straightforward with Python's arbitrary-precision integers. To optimize, we avoid recomputing factorials repeatedly; instead, use the recursive relation:
\[
\binom{n}{k+1} = \binom{n}{k} \times \frac{n - k}{k + 1}
\]
which allows us to generate the binomial coefficients iteratively.

Because the problem is about divisibility by 7, we only need to check the modulus of \(\binom{n}{k}\) by 7.

Here's the code:

```python
# Enumerate k from 0 to 1000, check divisibility by 7 of binomial coefficients
# and find the maximum such k, printing all qualifying k's immediately.

def main():
    n = 1000
    max_k = -1
    k_values = []

    # Start with C(n,0) = 1
    c = 1
    print(0)  # C(n,0) = 1, not divisible by 7
    if c % 7 == 0:
        max_k = 0
        k_values = [0]

    for k in range(1, n + 1):
        # Compute C(n,k) from C(n,k-1)
        c = c * (n - k + 1) // k
        print(k)
        if c % 7 == 0:
            # Found a coefficient divisible by 7
            if k > max_k:
                max_k = k
                k_values = [k]
            elif k == max_k:
                k_values.append(k)

    # Now, output the maximum k where binomial coefficient is divisible by 7
    print("Max k with C(n,k) divisible by 7:", max_k)
    # For completeness, list all such k if needed
    # (Though only max is required, but as per problem, we track all)

main()
```
