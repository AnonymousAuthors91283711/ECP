[write_program]
Below is a Python program to enumerate all integer values `k` between 1 and 17 inclusive, evaluate the expression \(\frac{5 \sin(10k^\circ) - 2}{\sin^2(10k^\circ)}\), and identify those where the expression is at least 2. The program prints each satisfying `k` immediately as found.

```python
import math

# Iterate over k in [1, 17]
for k in range(1, 18):
    angle_deg = 10 * k
    angle_rad = math.radians(angle_deg)
    sine_val = math.sin(angle_rad)
    # Avoid division by zero
    if abs(sine_val) < 1e-12:
        continue
    value = (5 * sine_val - 2) / (sine_val ** 2)
    if value >= 2:
        print(k)
```
