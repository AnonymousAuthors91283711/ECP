Ground Truth Answer: fun T => (T - 13) * (30 - 16) / (20 - 13) + 16
Proposed Answer: fun T : ℕ => 2 * T - 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes an arithmetic sequence where:
   - aₙ = a₁ + (n-1)*d
   - a₁₆ = 13
   - a₃₀ = 20

2. The ground truth answer correctly solves for n in terms of T:
   - Using the two given points, we find d = (20-13)/(30-16) = 7/14 = 0.5
   - Then a₁ = 13 - 15*0.5 = 5.5
   - Solving T = 5.5 + (n-1)*0.5 gives n = 2T - 10

3. The proposed answer gives n = 2T - 2, which is different from the correct solution.

The proposed answer has the correct form (linear in T) but incorrect coefficients. Therefore, it's close but not exactly correct.
