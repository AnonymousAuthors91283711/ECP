Ground Truth Answer: 100
Proposed Answer:  44
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest natural number n where the minimal p-value for n+2 is less than the minimal p-value for n. This involves finding integer solutions to systems of linear equations.

2. The ground truth answer is 100, which suggests that n=100 is the smallest number where this condition holds.

3. The proposed answer is 44, which is significantly smaller than 100.

4. To verify, let's consider the equations:
   - For n: 6a + 10b = n
   - For p: 7a + 12b = p
   We need to find minimal p for n and n+2, and find the smallest n where p(n+2) < p(n).

5. The difference between these answers is too large (44 vs 100) to be a simple calculation error. The proposed answer 44 is likely incorrect based on the ground truth.
