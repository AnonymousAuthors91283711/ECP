Ground Truth Answer: (238, 238, 477)
Proposed Answer: (1, 1, 199)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for positive natural numbers (a,b,c) that satisfy a specific equation involving gcd operations.

2. The ground truth answer is (238, 238, 477) which appears to be a non-trivial solution.

3. The proposed answer is (1, 1, 199). Let's test this:
   - gcd(1²,1²) = 1
   - gcd(1,1*199) = 1
   - gcd(1,1*199) = 1
   - gcd(199,1*1) = 1
   - Sum: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 ≠ 199

The proposed answer clearly doesn't satisfy the equation, while the ground truth does. Therefore:

<<<False>>>
