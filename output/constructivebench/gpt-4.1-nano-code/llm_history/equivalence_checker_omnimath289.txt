Ground Truth Answer: {(7, 3, 2), (3, 2, 7), (5, 3, 5)}
Proposed Answer: {(3, 2, 7), (5, 3, 5), (7, 3, 2)}
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer contains exactly the same elements as the ground truth answer, just in a different order. Since sets are unordered collections, the two answers are equivalent. The order of elements in a set does not matter for equality. All three tuples (7,3,2), (3,2,7), and (5,3,5) are present in both answers.
