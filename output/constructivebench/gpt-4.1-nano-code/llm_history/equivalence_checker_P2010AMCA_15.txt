Ground Truth Answer: (3 - sqrt 3) / 6
Proposed Answer: (√3 - 1)/(2 * √3)
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

Ground truth: (3 - √3)/6
Proposed answer: (√3 - 1)/(2√3)

Let's simplify the proposed answer:
(√3 - 1)/(2√3) = √3/(2√3) - 1/(2√3) = 1/2 - 1/(2√3) = (3 - √3)/6

This matches exactly with the ground truth answer (3 - √3)/6.

Therefore, the answers are equivalent.
