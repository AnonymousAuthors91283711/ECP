The problem involves exploring inequalities involving a function \(f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\), particularly assessing when a certain complex inequality holds for all real \(x, y, z\). The goal appears to be identifying functions satisfying this inequality. Due to the structure, it resembles properties related to convex functions or mid-point inequalities.

To gain insight, we will:
- Test simple functions: constant, linear, quadratic.
- Check the inequality condition numerically for small sample points.
- Use these to conjecture the set of functions satisfying the inequality.

This approach involves enumerating a small set of candidate functions and verifying conditions systematically.

```python
# Enumerate candidate functions: constant, linear, quadratic with small coefficients
# For each, check the inequality for selected triples (x,y,z)
# Print functions when the inequality holds for all tested triples

def check_inequality(f, test_points):
    for (x,y,z) in test_points:
        if not (x < y < z):
            continue
        lhs = f(y) - ((z - y)/(z - x) * f(x) + (y - x)/(z - x) * f(z))
        rhs = f((x + z)/2) - (f(x) + f(z))/2
        diff = lhs - rhs
        # Allow small tolerance for numerical errors
        if diff > 1e-8:
            return False
    return True

test_points = [
    (0, 0.5, 1),
    (-1, 0, 1),
    (0, 1, 2),
    (-2, -1, 0),
]

# Candidate functions:
# 1. Constant: f(x) = c
for c in [0, 1, -1]:
    def f_const(x, c=c):
        return c
    if check_inequality(f_const, test_points):
        print(f"Constant function with c={c} satisfies the inequality")

# 2. Linear: f(x) = m*x + b
for m in [-1, 0, 1]:
    for b in [-1, 0, 1]:
        def f_linear(x, m=m, b=b):
            return m*x + b
        if check_inequality(f_linear, test_points):
            print(f"Linear function f(x)={m}*x+{b} satisfies the inequality")

# 3. Quadratic: f(x) = a*x^2 + b*x + c
for a in [0, 0.5, -0.5]:
    for b in [-1, 0, 1]:
        for c in [-1, 0, 1]:
            def f_quad(x, a=a, b=b, c=c):
                return a*x**2 + b*x + c
            if check_inequality(f_quad, test_points):
                print(f"Quadratic f(x)={a}*x^2+{b}*x+{c} satisfies the inequality")
```
