Maximum value of k: 3524578. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The intuitive pattern of the sequence suggests Fibonacci-like numbers, with the maximum being 3524578, corresponding to the 24th Fibonacci number. The sequence links to the integer solutions of the quadratic as Pell-type solutions related to Fibonacci numbers. The max k is hence 3524578.
