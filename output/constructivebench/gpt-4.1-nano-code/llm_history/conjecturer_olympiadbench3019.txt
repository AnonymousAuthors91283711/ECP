Maximum c: 39. Expected Answer Type: ℤ
Given the conditions: \(a + b c = 20\) and \(-a + c d = 19\), summing yields \((a + b c) + (-a + c d) = 20 + 19\), leading to \(b c + c d = 39\) or \(c (b + d) = 39\). Since \(b, d \in \mathbb{Z}\), \(c\) divides 39 and satisfies the divisibility conditions. The maximum \(|c|\) dividing 39 is 39.
