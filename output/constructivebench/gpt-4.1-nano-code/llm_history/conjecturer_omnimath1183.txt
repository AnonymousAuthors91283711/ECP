Maximum size: 30. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The enumerated points form a pattern of rows 0, 1, 2 (full), and select points at coordinates summing or differing by up to 2, with central points around (5,3), (5,4), (6,3), (6,4), (7,3), (7,4). The largest s has 30 points. The pattern suggests the maximum size is 30, achieved by arrangements combining full lines and some central points. 

Final answer: <<<30>>>
