Let's analyze the problem:

Given variables \( a_1, a_{2,1}, a_{2,2} \) (with the original notation \( a.1, a.2.1, a.2.2 \)), satisfying the following equations and inequalities:

1. \( a_1 > 0 \)
2. \( a_{2,1} > 0 \)
3. \( a_{2,2} > 0 \)

and the equations:

- \( 2(a_1^2 + 1) = 3(a_{2,1}^2 + 1) \)
- \( 3(a_{2,1}^2 + 1) = 4(a_{2,2}^2 + 1) \)
- \( a_1 a_{2,1} + a_{2,1} a_{2,2} + a_{2,2} a_1 = 1 \)

and the goal is to find the sum \( S = a_1 + a_{2,1} + a_{2,2} \).

---

Step-by-step:

- From the first two equations:

\[
2(a_1^2 +1) = 3(a_{2,1}^2 + 1) \Rightarrow 2a_1^2 + 2 = 3a_{2,1}^2 + 3
\]
\[
\Rightarrow 2a_1^2 - 3a_{2,1}^2 = 1
\tag{A}
\]

- The second and third:

\[
3(a_{2,1}^2 +1) = 4(a_{2,2}^2 + 1) \Rightarrow 3a_{2,1}^2 + 3 = 4a_{2,2}^2 + 4
\]
\[
\Rightarrow 3a_{2,1}^2 - 4a_{2,2}^2 = 1
\tag{B}
\]

Now, the inequalities:

\[
a_1 > 0, \quad a_{2,1} > 0, \quad a_{2,2} > 0
\]

We can parameterize \(a_1, a_{2,1}\) in terms of \(a_{2,1}\), then find \(a_{2,2}\) accordingly.

From (A):

\[
2a_1^2 = 3a_{2,1}^2 + 1 \Rightarrow a_1^2 = \frac{3a_{2,1}^2 + 1}{2}
\]

Since \(a_1 > 0\):

\[
a_1 = \sqrt{\frac{3a_{2,1}^2 + 1}{2}}
\]

From (B):

\[
3a_{2,1}^2 - 4a_{2,2}^2 = 1 \Rightarrow 4a_{2,2}^2 = 3a_{2,1}^2 - 1
\]
\[
a_{2,2} = \sqrt{\frac{3a_{2,1}^2 - 1}{4}}
\]

\[ a_{2,2} \text{ is real and positive} \implies 3a_{2,1}^2 - 1 \ge 0 \Rightarrow a_{2,1}^2 \ge \frac{1}{3} \]

Because \(a_{2,1} > 0\):

\[
a_{2,1} \ge \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}
\]

---

Now, the key constraint:

\[
a_1 a_{2,1} + a_{2,1} a_{2,2} + a_{2,2} a_1 = 1
\]

Expressed as:

\[
a_1 a_{2,1} + a_{2,1} a_{2,2} + a_{2,2} a_1 = 1
\]

Substitute \( a_1, a_{2,2} \):

\[
a_1 = \sqrt{\frac{3a_{2,1}^2 + 1}{2}}
\]
\[
a_{2,2} = \sqrt{\frac{3a_{2,1}^2 - 1}{4}}
\]

Compute:

\[
S(a_{2,1}) = a_1 a_{2,1} + a_{2,1} a_{2,2} + a_{2,2} a_1
\]

Let \(x = a_{2,1} \ge 1/\sqrt{3}\). Then:

\[
a_1 = \sqrt{\frac{3x^2 + 1}{2}}
\]
\[
a_{2,2} = \sqrt{\frac{3x^2 - 1}{4}}
\]

Calculate the sum:

\[
S(x) = a_1 x + x a_{2,2} + a_{2,2} a_1
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
S(x) = x a_1 + a_{2,2}(x + a_1)
\]

---

Now, code the numerical search over feasible \(x\) values, starting at \(x = 1/\sqrt{3}\), increasing with small steps, checking when \(S(x)\) reaches 1.

Here's the implementation:

```python
import math

# Search parameters
start_x = 1 / math.sqrt(3)  # lower bound based on square root condition
max_x = 3  # arbitrary upper limit for search
step = 0.001

# List to store solutions
solutions = []

x = start_x
while x <= max_x:
    a1_squared = (3 * x**2 + 1) / 2
    a2_2_squared = (3 * x**2 - 1) / 4
    if a1_squared <= 0 or a2_2_squared <= 0:
        x += step
        continue
    a1 = math.sqrt(a1_squared)
    a2_2 = math.sqrt(a2_2_squared)
    sum_value = a1 * x + a2_2 * (x + a1)
    if abs(sum_value - 1) < 0.01:
        answer_sum = a1 + x + a2_2
        print(f"Found near solution at x={x:.3f}: sum={answer_sum:.3f}")
        solutions.append(answer_sum)
    x += step

# output approximate solutions
for s in solutions:
    print(f"Approximate total sum: {s:.3f}")
```

---

This code searches for feasible \(a_{2,1}\), computes corresponding \(a_1, a_{2,2}\), checks the sum condition close to 1, and streams solutions as it finds them. It provides approximate sums, which can be refined or used for conjecturing the exact value.

---

**Note:** For an exact symbolic solution, further algebraic manipulations could be done in a CAS, but for the enumeration purpose, this numeric exploratory approach suffices.
