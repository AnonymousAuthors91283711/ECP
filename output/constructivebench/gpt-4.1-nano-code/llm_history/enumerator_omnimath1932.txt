To assist in conjecturing and verifying the least value among the given options, I'll generate candidate answers and compare their values numerically. The candidates are: \(54 \sqrt{3}\), 144, and \(108 \sqrt{6} - 108 \sqrt{2}\). I will evaluate these to ensure the least is identified.

```python
import math

# Candidate values
value1 = 54 * math.sqrt(3)
value2 = 144
value3 = 108 * math.sqrt(6) - 108 * math.sqrt(2)

# Print each candidate immediately
print(f"54 * sqrt(3) = {value1}")
print(f"144 = {value2}")
print(f"108 * sqrt(6) - 108 * sqrt(2) = {value3}")

# Determine the minimum among these values
min_value = min(value1, value2, value3)
print(f"Minimal value: {min_value}")
```
