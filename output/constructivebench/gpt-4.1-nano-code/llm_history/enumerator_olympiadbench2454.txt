This problem is a combinatorial probability on pairs of faces with given values, computing the proportion of their sums that are prime. The faces are [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]. For each pair, we compute the sum and then check if that sum is prime. We need to estimate the ratio of the count of prime sums to the total number of pairs.

To assist in conjecturing, we will enumerate all pairs, check prime sums, and output the exact fraction. We will not hardcode the answer but compute it explicitly and output it as a rational number. The approach involves:

- Generate all pairs using List.product.
- Calculate sums and filter those that are prime.
- Compute the ratio as a Rational number (using `nat` division for exactness).

```python
import math

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

faces = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]

# Generate all pairs and their sums
outcomes = [(a, b, a + b) for a in faces for b in faces]

# Filter sums that are prime
prime_sums = [ (a, b, s) for (a, b, s) in outcomes if is_prime(s)]

# compute exact ratio as rational number
ratio = (len(prime_sums), len(outcomes))
print(f"{ratio[0]}/{ratio[1]}")
```
