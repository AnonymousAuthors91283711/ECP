The minimal n > 20 with palindromic digits that start with 20 and end with 14 is 2000000000000000000014, as the pattern suggests the number placed just after the smallest 20-digit number starting with 20, ending with 14, with leading 20 and trailing 14, minimizing the number. The pattern indicates the minimal such number adding zeros between 20 and 14.
