Ground Truth Answer: 508
Proposed Answer: 180
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us two real numbers r₁ and r₂ with:
   - r₁ * r₂ = 8
   - r₁ + r₂ = 180

2. We need to evaluate the expression: r₁/(r₂^(1/3)) + r₂/(r₁^(1/3))

3. The ground truth answer is 508, which is a specific numerical value.

4. The proposed answer is 180, which is exactly the sum r₁ + r₂ given in the problem.

Analysis:
- The proposed answer simply returns the sum of the variables, ignoring the more complex expression we're asked to evaluate.
- There's no mathematical justification for the expression simplifying to just the sum of r₁ and r₂.
- The actual evaluation of the expression would involve cube roots and more complex operations that wouldn't simplify to 180.

Conclusion:
The proposed answer is incorrect and not equivalent to the ground truth answer.

<<<False>>>
