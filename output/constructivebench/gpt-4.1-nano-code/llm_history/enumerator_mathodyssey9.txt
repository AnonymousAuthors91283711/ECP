Let's analyze the problem:

We are asked to find the number of triples \((a, b, c) \in \mathbb{N}^3\) satisfying:
- \(a > b > c > 1\),
- \(a b c \mid (a b - 1)(b c - 1)(c a - 1)\).

We will write a Python program to enumerate candidate triples with small values to infer patterns and approximate the answer.

Key points:
- Enforce \(a > b > c > 1\),
- Limit the search to small positive integers (e.g., \(a, b, c \leq 50\)),
- Check the divisibility condition,
- Count all such triples.

This enumeration helps us conjecture the total count and possibly identify the structure of solutions.

```python
# Enumerate triples (a, b, c) with a > b > c > 1 up to a limit
limit = 50
count = 0

for a in range(3, limit + 1):            # Start from 3 since c > 1
    for b in range(2, a):
        for c in range(2, b):
            numerator = (a * b - 1) * (b * c - 1) * (c * a - 1)
            denominator = a * b * c
            if numerator % denominator == 0:
                print(f"Triple: ({a}, {b}, {c})")
                count += 1

print(f"Total count of solutions up to limit {limit}: {count}")
```
