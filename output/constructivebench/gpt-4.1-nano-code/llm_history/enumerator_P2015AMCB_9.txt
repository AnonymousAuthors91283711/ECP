The problem seems to be about summing a series related to the probability that Larry wins on his nth throw. The probability for each throw n is given as p(n) = (1/2)^(2n - 1). Summing this series over all n gives the total probability that Larry eventually wins.

Let's analyze the series:
Sum_{n=1 to ∞} (1/2)^{2n - 1}

Expressing the series explicitly:
Sum_{n=1}^{∞} (1/2)^{2n - 1} = Sum_{n=1}^{∞} (1/2)^{2n} * (1/2)^{-1}
= (1/2) * Sum_{n=1}^{∞} [(1/2)^{2n}]

Note that (1/2)^{2n} = ( (1/2)^2 )^n = (1/4)^n, which is a geometric series with ratio r = 1/4.

Sum_{n=1}^{∞} r^n = r / (1 - r) for |r| < 1.

Plugging in r=1/4:
Sum_{n=1}^{∞} (1/4)^n = (1/4) / (1 - 1/4) = (1/4) / (3/4) = 1/3.

Multiplying back by the initial factor (1/2):
Total sum = (1/2) * (1/3) = 1/6.

Now, the program should enumerate partial sums for several values of n to approximate this total, and explicitly find the total sum.

```python
# Python code to compute the sum of the series and its partial sums
# series: sum_{n=1}^∞ (1/2)^{2n-1}

# Function to compute the partial sum up to max_n
def partial_sum(max_n):
    total = 0.0
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        term = (0.5) ** (2 * n - 1)
        print(f'n={n}, term={term}')
        total += term
        print(f'Partial sum up to n={n}: {total}')
    return total

# Enumerate partial sums up to n=20 for approximation
partial_sum(20)

# Since the series converges, the total sum is known to be 1/6 (~0.166666...)
# We can just print the calculated partial sums for analysis
```
