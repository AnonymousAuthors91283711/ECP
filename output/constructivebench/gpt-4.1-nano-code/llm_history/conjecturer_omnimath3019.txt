. Enumerated answers: Computed x from 3^x = 5: x = 1.4649735207179269
Answer for (3)^(x+2): 44.99999999999999
Exact answer using properties: 45. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The problem asks to find \((3)^{x+2}\) given \(\, 3^x = 5\): then, \\
\(3^{x+2} = 3^x \times 3^2 = 5 \times 9 = 45.\) 

Answer: <<<45>>>
