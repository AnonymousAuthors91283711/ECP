Total coprime with 200 in [1, 99]: 40. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The only numbers coprime with 200 within 1 to 99 are all odd numbers not divisible by 2 or 5, and not sharing prime factors with 200 (which is 2^3·5^2). Excluding multiples of 2 and 5, odd numbers remaining are those congruent to 1, 3, 7, 9 mod 10, with some exceptions. Counting them yields 40.

Answer: <<<40>>>
