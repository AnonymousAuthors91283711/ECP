This problem appears to involve straightforward evaluation of an expression involving powers of -1, which are well-known to alternate between 1 and -1. Since the problem structure hints at enumerating answers, I will write a Python script that computes the value of the expression for various parameter choices if needed, but here it's a specific fixed expression. The main goal is to print the evaluated answer immediately and systematically.

Given the expression: `(-1)^3 + (-1)^2 + (-1)`, the evaluation is straightforward:

- `(-1)^3 = -1`
- `(-1)^2 = 1`
- `(-1) = -1`

Summing these: `-1 + 1 + -1 = -1`

The program will evaluate this step-by-step, print the answer, and be ready for similar expressions if extended.

```python
# Evaluator for the given expression:
# (-1)^3 + (-1)^2 + (-1)
# Since the powers are fixed, we can evaluate and print immediately.

# Compute each term
term1 = (-1) ** 3
print(f"(-1)^3 = {term1}")
term2 = (-1) ** 2
print(f"(-1)^2 = {term2}")
term3 = -1
print(f"(-1) = {term3}")

# Sum the terms
result = term1 + term2 + term3
print(f"Sum = {result}")
```
