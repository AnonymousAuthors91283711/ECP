Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {1, 3, 5, 15}
<<<None>>>
Since the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's intentionally left undefined in Lean), we cannot verify whether the proposed answer {1, 3, 5, 15} is correct or equivalent. The problem asks to find natural numbers n > 0 where n divides (n² + n + 15), but without the ground truth, we cannot confirm the equivalence.
