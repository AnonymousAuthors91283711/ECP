            |1000 * ∑ n ∈ Finset.range 9998, (1 : ℝ) / ((n + 3)^2 - 4) - m| := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Sum over n=0..50: 0.47658790304498555
Sum over n=0..10: 0.4305869923007506
Direct sum n=0..10: 0.4462454212454212. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the pattern and the approximate sums, the answer seems to approach a value related to the telescoping sum of the form 1/(n+1)(n+3). Recognizing the partial sums, the limit should be a constant around 0.45.  
Considering the progressive sums, the conjectured closed-form is: <<<0.45>>>
