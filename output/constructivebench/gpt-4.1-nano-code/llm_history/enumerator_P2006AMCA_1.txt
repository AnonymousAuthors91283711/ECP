[write_program]
This appears to be a formal proof-like, possibly Lean or similar proof assistant code snippet, referencing a Mathlib import. The problem seems simple enough: verify that \(3 \times 5 + 2 \times 8\) equals some answer.

Since the task is to create a Python program that enumerates possible answers for such a problem, here we just need to evaluate the expression \(3 \times 5 + 2 \times 8\) exactly.

Here's how we can enumerate possible answers: We know the arithmetic expression exactly, and for a simple problem like this, the answer is definitive. But to follow your instructions, let's write a program that explicitly enumerates candidate answers for this expression, confirms the correct one, and streams it out.

```python
# Enumerate potential answers for the expression 3*5 + 2*8
# Since the expression is simple, we directly evaluate it and print the answer.
# Additionally, for demonstration, we can check a range around the computed answer.

target_value = 3*5 + 2*8

# For consistency with instructions, enumerate all candidate answers in a small range
for candidate in range(0, 50):
    print(candidate)
    if candidate == target_value:
        print(f"Found exact match: {candidate}")
        # stop after finding the exact answer
        break
```
