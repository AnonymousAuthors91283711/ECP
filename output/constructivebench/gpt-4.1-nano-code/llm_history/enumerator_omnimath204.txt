The problem appears to involve a polynomial \( P : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \) associated with a polynomial \( q \) of degree 3, with specific values of \( P \) at certain points. Given the conditions on \( P \) (related to three types of inputs modulo 3), and that \( P(3n+1) = 730 \), we want to determine \( n \). 

Our goal: to find all possible \( n \) satisfying the conditions, especially the condition \( P(3n+1) = 730 \).

Given the pattern:
- For \( 0 \leq k \leq n \), \( P(3k) = 2 \)
- For \( 0 \leq k \leq n-1 \), \( P(3k+1) = 1 \)
- For \( 0 \leq k \leq n-1 \), \( P(3k+2) = 0 \)

and \( P(3n+1) = 730 \), the polynomial \( P \) follows a predictable pattern over these points.

We can interpret \( P \) as a polynomial interpolation through these points, with values depending on \( n \). To approximate this, we'll construct possible values of \( P \) at relevant points for small \( n \), check what \( P(3n+1) \) would be, and see for which \( n \) it can be 730.

Since \( q \) has degree 3, and its evaluations are interpolated at points \( 0,1,2,..., 3n+1 \), we try small \( n \) values and analyze.

```python
# The following script approximates the polynomial's behavior at key points
# for small n, to identify when P(3n+1) == 730.

# We'll simulate the polynomial interpolated through points:
# (3k, 2), (3k+1, 1), (3k+2, 0), and check P(3n+1) for n from 0 up to a threshold.

from sympy import symbols, interpolate, degree

x = symbols('x')

# Helper function to generate points for given n
def generate_points(n):
    points = []
    for k in range(n + 1):
        points.append((3 * k, 2))
        if k < n:
            points.append((3 * k + 1, 1))
            points.append((3 * k + 2, 0))
    return points

# For each n, interpolate polynomial of degree <=3 from these points (up to 3k+1)
# and check P(3n+1). Since the degree is limited to 3, we only consider 4 points
# or the minimal set necessary for interpolation.

# Search over small n to find when P(3n+1) == 730
max_n = 15  # arbitrary small limit for illustration
for n in range(max_n + 1):
    pts = generate_points(n)
    # Keep only 4 points for degree 3 interpolation or fewer if available
    if len(pts) >= 4:
        subset_pts = pts[:4]
    else:
        subset_pts = pts
    try:
        p = interpolate(*subset_pts, x)
        val = p.subs(x, 3 * n + 1)
        # Since polynomial evaluations can be symbolic, evaluate numerically
        val_eval = val.evalf()
        print(f"n={n}, P({3 * n + 1}) â‰ˆ {val_eval}")
        if abs(val_eval - 730) < 1e-6:
            print(f"Found n={n} where P(3n+1)=730.")
    except Exception:
        continue
