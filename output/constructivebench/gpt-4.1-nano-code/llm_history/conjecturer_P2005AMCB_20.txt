Minimal sum of squares: 34. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The error arises because in Lean, an abbreviation declared as `abbrev` must be defined as a term of type `ℕ`, not as a function. The current definition `fun n => 34` has type `(n : ℕ) → ℕ`, a function type, which is incompatible with `abbrev` expecting a `ℕ` directly. 

Looking at the enumerated answers, the minimal sum of squares is 34, which is a fixed constant. To satisfy the theorem, we need an expression that always produces this value, independent of `n`. Therefore, the correct fixed form is simply to set `P2005AMCB_20_answer` equal to 34, not a function of `n`. 

Hence, the fixed answer in Lean should be:

```lean
<<<34>>>
```

This is a constant of type `ℕ`, aligning with the expected type.

**Summary:** Replace the function `fun n => 34` with the constant `34`. This will satisfy the type requirement for the abbreviation, making the theorem statement consistent and compiling successfully.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Minimal sum of squares: 34. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The error occurs because the Lean syntax expects an actual expression (a term of type ℕ) after the := in the definition of P2005AMCB_20_answer, but instead, it received the raw delimiter <<<34>>>. This is not valid Lean code.

Given the enumerated answers list and the minimal sum of squares is 34, the most appropriate selection—based on the provided hints—is to define the answer as 34.

Since the solution involves a minimal sum of squares related to subset partitions of a fixed set, we hypothesize that the value is simply 34, as the enumeration suggests.

Therefore, the proper way to write this in Lean is:
abbrev P2005AMCB_20_answer : ℕ := 34

Alternatively, to match the format with the delimiters, I will replace the placeholder with the number 34 directly, removing the syntax error.

Final fixed answer:

<<<34>>>

This is a simple, valid, closed-form answer consistent with the enumeration and the minimal sum of squares.
