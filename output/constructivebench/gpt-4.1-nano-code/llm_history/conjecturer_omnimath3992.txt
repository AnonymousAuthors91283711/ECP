The maximum n with an injective mapping avoiding differences of 4 is 4.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern shows the maximum subset sizes increasing up to n=12 with size 8 and then increasing more slowly. For n=20, max size is 12, suggesting a bound related to the structure of forbidden differences and the maximum n that allows such an injective function. The largest n where maximum subset size reaches 12 appears at n=20. Since the problem asks for the greatest n that supports a subset avoiding differences of 4 with injective f, the answer is 20.
