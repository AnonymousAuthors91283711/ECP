This problem involves exploring placements of points within a 20Ã—20 grid with constraints involving distances and a validity condition. To enumerate all candidates, I'll fix a small set of points (parameters), check all possible candidate points within the grid, and verify the placement rules.

I will:
- Enumerate all valid point placements within the 1 to 20 grid.
- For each, check the distance constraint.
- Print each candidate immediately.
- Since the problem asks for the greatest K satisfying certain properties, I'll find the largest such number by gradually increasing the size.

Here's an efficient, straightforward implementation focusing on the core enumeration logic.

```python
import math

# Define the grid boundaries
MIN_COORD, MAX_COORD = 1, 20

# Function to check if a point is a valid red placement
def is_valid_red_placement(placed_points, p):
    # p must be within grid
    if not (MIN_COORD <= p[0] <= MAX_COORD and MIN_COORD <= p[1] <= MAX_COORD):
        return False
    # p must not be in placed_points
    if p in placed_points:
        return False
    # Distance from existing points must not be sqrt(5)
    for q in placed_points:
        dist = math.dist(q, p)
        if abs(dist - math.sqrt(5)) < 1e-9:
            return False
    return True

# For demonstration, fix an initial placement and expand
initial_points = []

# Attempt to find all candidates by adding points sequentially
# For simplicity, test all points within grid
all_points = [(x, y) for x in range(MIN_COORD, MAX_COORD+1) for y in range(MIN_COORD, MAX_COORD+1)]

# Store valid configurations keyed by number of points
valid_configurations = {}

# Breadth-first expansion: start with empty and build
for p in all_points:
    if is_valid_red_placement(initial_points, p):
        # Add the new point to the set
        new_points = initial_points + [p]
        count = len(new_points)
        # Print each point as it's validated
        print(f"Valid placement with {count} points: {new_points}")
        # Store the configuration
        valid_configurations.setdefault(count, []).append(new_points)

# Finding the maximum number of points where placement rules hold
if valid_configurations:
    max_points = max(valid_configurations.keys())
    print(f"Maximum placement size: {max_points}")
    print("One such configuration:", valid_configurations[max_points][0])
else:
    print("No valid placements found.")
```
