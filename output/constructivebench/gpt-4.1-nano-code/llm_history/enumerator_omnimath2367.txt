[write_program]
The problem involves computing a ratio of areas (volumes in the plane) where an additional condition involving a floor of a square root is imposed. To assist in conjecturing and potentially proving the answer, I will write a Python program that enumerates possible values over a discretized grid of points within the unit square and checks the parity of the floor of the square root of p1/p2.

Here's the plan:
- Use small sample values (e.g., step size 0.01) for p1 and p2 in [0,1].
- For each (p1,p2), compute floor(sqrt(p1/p2)), check if even.
- Count total points and points satisfying the condition, then compute the ratio.
- Print the ratio when found, along with sample parameter details.
- This approach helps in approximating the ratio of areas matching the condition to the total area.

The output will stream each approximate ratio found for increasing resolution, helping in conjecture.

```python
# Enumerate points in [0,1] x [0,1] with small grid step
step = 0.01  # discretization step
total_points = 0
matching_points = 0

for i in range(1, int(1/step)+1):  # p1 from 0 to 1, avoiding division by zero
    p1 = i * step
    for j in range(1, int(1/step)+1):  # p2 from 0 to 1, avoiding division by zero
        p2 = j * step
        total_points += 1
        ratio = p1 / p2
        val = int((ratio**0.5))
        if val % 2 == 0:
            matching_points += 1
        # Output approximate ratio at current resolution
        # Compute ratio approximation
        approx_ratio = matching_points / total_points
        print(f"Resolution step: {step}, current ratio approximation: {approx_ratio:.4f}")
        
# Final average ratio over the grid's approximate area
final_ratio = matching_points / total_points
print(f"Approximate ratio of area with even floor(sqrt(p1/p2)) to total area: {final_ratio:.4f}")
```
