. Enumerated answers: 720. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests considering the number of proper divisors: 29 divisors implies the number n has exactly 30 divisors total (including 1 and n). Such numbers are often prime powers or product of primes with specific exponents. Given the answer 720 appears as a hint, 720 is highly composite with many divisors, but not exactly 30. Likely, the number is 2^4 * 3^2 * 5, which equals 16*9*5=720, having exactly 29 proper divisors (since total divisors =30).  
Final answer:
<<<720>>>
