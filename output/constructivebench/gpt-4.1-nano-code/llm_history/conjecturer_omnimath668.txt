The minimal size k of A covering all ℤ modulo 100 with a powers set corresponds to the number of generators needed to generate all residues mod 100 through powers. Since 100 = 2² * 5², the multiplicative group modulo 100 isn't cyclic, but generated by elements of certain orders. The smallest set size is based on the number of elements needed to generate primitive roots modulo each factor, leading to k = 4, covering the least common multiple of the orders.
