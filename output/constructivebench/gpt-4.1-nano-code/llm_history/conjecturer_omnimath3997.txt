. Enumerated answers: 200. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Since the equality of sums yields that the sum of the shifted squares equals the original sum, it implies each term’s square difference is canceled out, leading to a constant difference pattern. Based on the pattern of the enumerated answers, the difference corresponds to summing the linear increments, which sum to a quadratic pattern. The pattern suggests the answer is \( 4 \times 100 \), corresponding to the sum of differences over 100 elements.
