omnimath2937_answer = 15. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The problem states an equation involving prime factorization: 3*3*5*5*7*9 = 3*3*7 * omnimath2937_answer^2. We need to find a constant (or fixed natural number) that fit into this factorization, specifically as the value of omnimath2937_answer.

Prime factorization of the left side:
3 * 3 * 5 * 5 * 7 * 9
Note that 9 = 3^2, so rewriting:
3^2 * 5^2 * 7 * 3^2 = 3^(4) * 5^2 * 7

On the right, we have:
3 * 3 * 7 * omnimath2937_answer^2 = 3^2 * 7 * omnimath2937_answer^2

Matching prime factors on both sides:
Left: 3^4 * 5^2 * 7
Right: 3^2 * 7 * omnimath2937_answer^2

Dividing both sides:
(3^4 * 5^2 * 7) ÷ (3^2 * 7) = omnimath2937_answer^2

Simplify numerator and denominator:
3^(4 - 2) * 5^2 * 7 / 7 = 3^2 * 5^2

Hence, omnimath2937_answer^2 = 3^2 * 5^2 = (3*5)^2 = 15^2

Therefore, omnimath2937_answer = 15.

The error in the code is due to defining the answer as a function from ℕ to ℕ rather than a fixed number, leading to a type mismatch. Since the theorem expects omnimath2937_answer to be a ℕ, define it simply as 15.

Final answer:
<<<15>>>
