The problem seems to involve defining a function of integers and proving a certain relation involving this function. Since the initial code is in Lean, a formal proof assistant, and refers to an `abbrev` with `sorry`, the goal is to explore the actual expression `(x + 2*y) - (2*x + y)` under the given conditions.

Given `x = 2*y`, we can simplify the expression directly and find the explicit result. The function `omnimath2849_answer` appears to depend on `y`, possibly returning the simplified value derived from the algebraic substitution.

Let's interpret and generate all possible values of `y` with small integers to see the pattern and print the corresponding output.

```python
# Enumerate small values of y (excluding zero, since y â‰  0) to find the value of the expression
# (x + 2*y) - (2*x + y) with x = 2*y.

for y in range(-10, 11):
    if y == 0:
        continue
    x = 2 * y
    result = (x + 2 * y) - (2 * x + y)
    print(f'y = {y}, x = {x}, expression result = {result}')
```

This code tests small integer values for y, computes x, then evaluates the expression. It helps in conjecturing the formula or pattern for the function `omnimath2849_answer y`.
