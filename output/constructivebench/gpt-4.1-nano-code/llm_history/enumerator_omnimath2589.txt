The problem involves three equations with variables x, y, z in ℝ, and asks to find x² + y² + z². To assist in conjecturing, we will enumerate small rational (or floating-point) solutions satisfying the equations, then compute their sum of squares immediately when solutions are found. Since the problem is complex algebraically, we'll do a brute-force search over a small bounded grid of candidate solutions.

Note: We avoid hardcoding the answer; we print all solutions for the given equations within a small grid, which may hint toward the true value or behavior.

```python
import itertools

# Small sample space for testing
candidate_range = [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]
solutions_found = []

# Enumerate possible candidate solutions
for x, y, z in itertools.product(candidate_range, repeat=3):
    # Check if the equations are approximately satisfied
    hxy = 2 * x + y + 4 * x * y + 6 * x * z
    hyz = y + 2 * z + 2 * x * y + 6 * y * z
    hxz = x - z + 2 * x * z - 4 * y * z
    
    # Using a small tolerance for floating point comparison
    tol = 1e-6
    if all(abs(val) < tol for val in [hxy + 6, hyz - 4, hxz + 3]):
        sum_squares = x**2 + y**2 + z**2
        print(f"Solution: x={x}, y={y}, z={z} -> x² + y² + z² = {sum_squares}")
        solutions_found.append(sum_squares)

# If no solutions in grid, inform us
if not solutions_found:
    print("No solutions found in the sample grid.")
```
