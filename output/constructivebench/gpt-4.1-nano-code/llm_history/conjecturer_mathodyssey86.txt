The pattern suggests the ratio approaches 1 as n increases, with the maximum at n=1 (ratio=2). Therefore, the greatest lower bound is 2.

Given the enumerated data, we observe the ratio series: 2, √2, 3/√3 ≈ 1.1547, 4/2 ≈ 2, 5/√5 ≈ 2.236... Wait, let's examine the ratios based on the sum: for n=1, sum_b=2, ratio=2/1^{3/2}=2; for n=2, sum_b=4, ratio=4/2^{3/2}=4/ (2 * √2)= 4/(2*1.414)=≈1.414; for n=3, sum_b=6, ratio=6/ (3^{3/2})=6/ (√27)=6/ (5.196)=≈1.1547; for n=4, sum_b=8, ratio=8/ (4^{3/2})=8/ (8)=1; for n=5, ratio=10/ (5^{3/2})=10/ (5*√5)=10/ (5*2.236)=10/11.18≈0.894; for n=6, 12/ (6*√6)=12/ (6*2.45)=12/14.7≈0.816; 7: 14/ (7*√7)=14/ (7*2.6458)=14/18.52≈0.7559, etc.

The sequence appears decreasing from 2 at n=1: the ratio approaches 1 as n→∞, with maximum at n=1 alluding to the ratio at n=1 being 2.

Since the ratios are decreasing and approaching 1, the greatest lower bound (supremum) is 2, achieved at the initial point (n=1).

Therefore, the answer should be 2.

Final Lean-formulated answer:
<<<2.0>>>

This reflects that the maximal ratio observed (or an upper bound) is 2, which is attained at the initial case (n=1). The pattern in the sum confirms this conjecture.
