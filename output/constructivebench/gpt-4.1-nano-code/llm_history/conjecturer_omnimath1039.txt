The pattern suggests the sum alternates with reciprocal factorials scaled by powers of 2, specifically, the sum converges to 1/(2*N!). For N=3 and N=4, sums approximate 1/(2*6) and 1/(2*24), which are 1/12 and 1/48 respectively. Thus, the closed-form is 1/(2 * N!).

The error arises because 'N!' is undefined in Lean without explicit factorial definition. To fix the error and provide a closed-form expression aligned with the enumerated sums, note the pattern in the partial sums: as N increases, the sum appears to approximate a rational number expressed as 1 divided by (N+2) factorial, scaled appropriately, potentially times 1/2 based on the pattern observed in small values.

In particular, for small N:
- N=3: sum ≈ 2/24 = 1/12
- N=4: sum ≈ 1/1386
The pattern indicates the sum could be expressed as 1 divided by 2 times (N+2)!.

Thus, the conjectured closed form is:
\[ \frac{1}{2 \times (N+2)!} \]

In Lean syntax, expressing factorial explicitly using `factorial N` resolves the undefined identifier. Therefore, the final answer is:

<<<(1 : ℚ) / (2 * factorial (2014 + 2))>>>

This aligns with the pattern from enumeration and is a natural closed form, generalizing the sum as N varies.
