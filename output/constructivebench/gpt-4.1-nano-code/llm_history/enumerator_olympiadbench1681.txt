This problem involves characterizing functions \(f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}\) that are surjective and satisfy the property \(\forall m, n, p,\) with \(p\) prime, that \(p \mid f(m + n) \iff p \mid f(m) + f(n)\). Such functions are known to be linear with integer coefficients, likely of the form \(f(n) = a n + b\).

To enumerate possible answers, I'll consider small values of \(a\) and \(b\) within reasonable bounds, check surjectivity (which for linear functions over \(\mathbb{N}\) requires \(a \neq 0\)), and verify the divisibility property.

Here's a Python program that systematically tests small integer functions of the form \(f(n) = a n + b\) for these conditions, printing each candidate immediately, focusing on small \(|a|\) and \(b|\), and ensuring it aligns with the problem constraints.

```python
# Enumerate small linear functions f(n) = a*n + b
# Check for surjectivity onto N: usually requires a > 0, b >= 0
# Verify the divisibility property for small primes p and small m,n
# Print each candidate function immediately

def is_divisibility_preserving(f, max_m=10, max_n=10, max_p=13):
    # Random small prime list for testing
    primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]
    for p in primes:
        for m in range(max_m + 1):
            for n in range(max_n + 1):
                left = p | f(m + n)
                right = p | (f(m) + f(n))
                if left != right:
                    return False
    return True

for a in range(1, 4):  # small positive slopes
    for b in range(0, 3):  # small intercepts
        def f(n, a=a, b=b):
            return a * n + b
        # Check surjectivity: for a>0, f(n) covers all large enough numbers
        # For simplicity, assume surjective if b=0 and a>0
        if a > 0:
            if is_divisibility_preserving(f):
                print(f"f(n) = {a}*n + {b}")
```
