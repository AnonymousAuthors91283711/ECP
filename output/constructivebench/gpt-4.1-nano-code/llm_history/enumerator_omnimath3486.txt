This problem appears to be a challenge in enumerating integers, specifically to find a number that does not belong to the set \(\{ y \in \mathbb{N} \mid \exists n, 1 \le n \le 400, y = 3n + 1 \}\). In other words, we want to find a natural number not of the form \(3n+1\) with \(1 \le n \le 400\).

To approach this, we will:
- Enumerate all values \(3n+1\) for \(n=1,\dots,400\),
- Store these values,
- Then verify and find a natural number outside this set, ideally starting from 1 upward.

Given the constraints, the smallest number that isn't of the form \(3n+1\) with \(1\leq n \leq 400\) would be a candidate, such as 1, 2, 4, etc., checking sequentially until we find one that isn't in the set.

```python
# Enumerate all y = 3n+1 for n from 1 to 400
values = {3*n + 1 for n in range(1, 401)}
# Start checking from 1 upwards for the first number not in the set
candidate = 1
while candidate in values:
    candidate += 1
# Print the first number not of the form 3n+1 in the given range
print(candidate)
```
