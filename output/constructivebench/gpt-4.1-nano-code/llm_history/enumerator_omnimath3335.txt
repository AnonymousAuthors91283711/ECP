This problem involves roots of unity, specifically the complex sixth roots of unity. We want to compute:
\[
\left(e^{i \frac{2\pi}{3}}\right)^6 + \left(e^{i \frac{4\pi}{3}}\right)^6
\]

Since \( e^{i \theta} \) raised to the 6th power is \( e^{i 6 \theta} \), we can observe that:
- \( \left(e^{i \frac{2\pi}{3}}\right)^6 = e^{i 6 \times \frac{2\pi}{3}} = e^{i 4\pi} \)
- \( \left(e^{i \frac{4\pi}{3}}\right)^6 = e^{i 6 \times \frac{4\pi}{3}} = e^{i 8\pi} \)

And since \( e^{i 2k\pi} = 1 \) for any integer \(k\), both are equal to 1:
- \( e^{i 4\pi} = 1 \)
- \( e^{i 8\pi} = 1 \)

The sum is thus 2.

Below is a Python program to verify and enumerate such computations in general, reflecting the reasoning process.

```python
import cmath
import math

# List of parameters: angles for roots of unity
angles = [2 * math.pi / 3, 4 * math.pi / 3]
exponents = [6, 6]

results = []

for angle in angles:
    base = cmath.exp(1j * angle)
    powered = base ** 6
    results.append(powered)

# Print individual results immediately
for idx, res in enumerate(results):
    print(f"Root {idx+1} raised to power 6: {res}")

# Sum to find the total
total = sum(results)
print(f"Sum of both: {total}")

# Check if total is close to an integer (exact value expected to be 2)
if abs(total - 2) < 1e-10:
    print("Result is exactly 2.")
else:
    print("Result is approximately:", total)
```
