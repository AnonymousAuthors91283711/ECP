This problem involves enumerating all functions s from a 3-element domain (Fin 3) to a 6-element codomain (Fin 6) that satisfy certain triangle inequalities among their images at 0, 1, 2. The set S represents all such functions with images a, b, c that satisfy the triangle inequalities: a + b > c, a + c > b, b + c > a.

We approach it by:
- Choosing small sample values for a, b, c within 0..5 (since Fin 6).
- Enumerating all triples (a, b, c) that satisfy the inequalities.
- For each valid triple, generate all functions s : {0,1,2} â†’ {0..5} with s(0)=a, s(1)=b, s(2)=c.
- Count total such functions and compute the ratio: number of such functions / 6^3 (the total number of all functions from 3 to 6).

Since the total functions from 3 to 6 is 6^3 = 216, and the number of valid triples is manageable, we can enumerate and print each solution's ratio.

Here's the code:

```python
# Enumerate all triples (a, b, c) in [0..5] satisfying the triangle inequalities
# For each valid triple, count the number of functions s with s(0)=a, s(1)=b, s(2)=c
# Sum counts over all such triples
# For simplicity, we list the counts for each valid triple and compute total solutions
# Then, output the ratio: total solutions / 216

def main():
    total_functions = 6 ** 3  # total functions from 3 elements to 6
    valid_counts = []
    total_valid = 0
    for a in range(6):
        for b in range(6):
            for c in range(6):
                if a + b > c and a + c > b and b + c > a:
                    count = 1  # fixed s(0)=a, s(1)=b, s(2)=c
                    total_valid += count
                    print(f"Triple (a={a}, b={b}, c={c}): functions = {count}")
    ratio = total_valid / total_functions
    print(f"Total valid functions: {total_valid} / {total_functions} = {ratio}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
