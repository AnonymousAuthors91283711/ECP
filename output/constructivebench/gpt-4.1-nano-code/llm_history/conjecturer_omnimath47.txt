theorem omnimath47 (r : ℝ) :
    r ∈ {r' : ℝ | ∃ (b : ℕ → ℕ), (∀ n, 0 < b n) ∧ 
    StrictAnti (fun n : ℕ => (b (n + 1)) / (n + 1)^2) ∧ 
    (b 1) / 1^2 = 1 ∧ 
    (∀ n, (b n) / n^2 ≥ r') ∧ 
    IsGreatest {r'' : ℝ | ∀ n, (b n) / n^2 ≥ r''} r'} ↔ r ∈ omnimath47_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Possible r' values in the set where sequence decreases to 0, with initial condition:
0. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
