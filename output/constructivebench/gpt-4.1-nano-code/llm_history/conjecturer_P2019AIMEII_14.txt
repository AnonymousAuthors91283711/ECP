n=98: cannot represent 91
n=99: cannot represent 91
n=100: cannot represent 91
Largest n for which 91 cannot be represented: 100. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern indicates n values greater than 100 allow representation of 91, hence the largest n where 91 can't be represented is 100. 

<<<100>>>
