The problem appears to involve characterizing pairs of natural numbers \((a, b)\) within 1 to 100 such that

\[ P a b \leftrightarrow 0 < a \le 100,\, 0 < b \le 100,\, \text{and}\, a b = \left(\frac{\operatorname{lcm}(a, b)}{\operatorname{gcd}(a, b)}\right)^2. \]

We want to find the maximum possible sum \( s = a + b \) among all such pairs that satisfy \( P a b \).

Since \(\operatorname{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a b}{\gcd(a, b)}\), the condition becomes:

\[
a b = \left(\frac{a b}{\gcd(a, b)^2}\right)^2 \Rightarrow a b = \frac{(a b)^2}{\gcd(a, b)^4}.
\]

Rearranged:

\[
a b \cdot \gcd(a, b)^4 = (a b)^2.
\]

Divide both sides by \(a b\) (assuming \(a, b > 0\)):

\[
\gcd(a, b)^4 = a b.
\]

Therefore:

\[
a b = (\gcd(a, b))^4.
\]

Hence, the conditions are:

\[
a b = g^4, \quad \text{where } g = \gcd(a, b).
\]

Express \(a, b\) as:

\[
a = g x, \quad b = g y,
\]
where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). Then:

\[
a b = g^2 x y,
\]
and this should equal \(g^4\):

\[
g^2 xy = g^4 \Rightarrow xy = g^2.
\]

Because \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), the only way for \(x y = g^2\) is for \(x\) and \(y\) to be coprime factors of \(g^2\). Since they are coprime:

- \(x\) divides \(g^2\),
- \(y\) divides \(g^2\),
- \(\gcd(x, y)=1\),
- and \(x y = g^2\).

In particular, \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime factors of \(g^2\).

Because \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime factors of \(g^2\), they are coprime divisors such that:

\[
x y = g^2,
\]
and

\[
\gcd(x, y) = 1.
\]

Now, for each \(g\) from 1 to 100 (since \(a, b \le 100\), and \(a, b \ge1\), the gcd \(g\le 100\)), compute all coprime pairs \((x, y)\) with:

- \(x y = g^2\),
- \(\gcd(x, y) =1\).

From \((x,y)\), arrive at candidate pairs:

\[
a = g x,\quad b = g y.
\]

The sum:

\[
s = a + b = g (x + y).
\]

Our goal: Find the maximum \(s\) where \(a,b \le 100\):

\[
g x \le 100, \quad g y \le 100.
\]

Given these, an approach:

- For each \(g\) from 1 to 100:
  - Find divisors \(x\) of \(g^2\),
  - For each divisor \(x\), compute \(y = g^2 / x\),
  - Check if \(\gcd(x, y)=1\),
  - Verify \(a = g x \le 100\) and \(b = g y \le 100\),
  - Calculate sum \(s = g(x + y)\),
  - Track maximum \(s\).

Below is an implementation following this plan.

```python
# Enumerate candidate pairs (a, b) satisfying the derived condition
# and track the maximum sum s = a + b.

def find_max_sum():
    max_sum = 0
    for g in range(1, 101):
        g_sq = g * g
        # Find divisors of g^2
        for x in range(1, int(g_sq**0.5) + 1):
            if g_sq % x == 0:
                y = g_sq // x
                # Check if gcd(x, y) == 1 (coprime factors)
                # using math.gcd
                import math
                if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                    a, b = g * x, g * y
                    # Ensure a and b are within bounds
                    if a <= 100 and b <= 100:
                        s = a + b
                        print(f"Candidate: a={a}, b={b}, sum={s}")
                        if s > max_sum:
                            max_sum = s
    print(f"Maximum sum: {max_sum}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_max_sum()
```
