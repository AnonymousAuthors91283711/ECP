The problem appears to involve evaluating a polynomial \( P \) at specific points (-1, 0, 1, 2), given some relationships between these evaluations, and then summing \( P(2) + P(-2) \). The goal seems to be to find an explicit expression or pattern for this sum in terms of \( k \).

Given:
- \( P(0) = k \)
- \( P(1) = 2k \)
- \( P(-1) = 3k \)

We want to compute \( P(2) + P(-2) \).

Assuming \( P(x) \) is quadratic (polynomial of degree 2), we can try to parametrize \( P \) using these values. Let's proceed with enumeration over potential polynomial forms fitting the data, then derive the sum \( P(2) + P(-2) \).

Here's a Python program that:
- Assumes \( P \) is quadratic: \( P(x) = a x^2 + b x + c \).
- Uses the given evaluations to find \( a, b, c \) in terms of \( k \).
- Computes \( P(2) + P(-2) \).
- Enumerates all possible solutions consistent with the data.

```python
# Enumerate possible quadratic polynomials matching the evaluations
# P(0) = c = k
# P(1) = a + b + c = 2k
# P(-1) = a - b + c = 3k
# From first: c = k
# Plug into second: a + b + k = 2k => a + b = k
# Plug into third: a - b + k = 3k => a - b = 2k
# Solving these: 
# a + b = k
# a - b = 2k
# Add: 2a = 3k => a = 1.5k
# Then: b = k - a = k - 1.5k = -0.5k

# Compute P(2) + P(-2) = (a*4 + b*2 + c) + (a*4 - b*2 + c)
# = (4a + 2b + c) + (4a - 2b + c)
# = 8a + 2c

# Substitute a = 1.5k, c = k:
# sum = 8*1.5k + 2k = 12k + 2k = 14k

print("Enumerated solutions (assuming quadratic polynomial):")
for k in [-10, -1, 0, 1, 10]:  # Sample small k values
    a = 1.5 * k
    b = -0.5 * k
    c = k
    sum_P2 = 8 * a + 2 * c  # Simplifies to 14 * k
    print(f"For k={k}: P(2)+P(-2) = {sum_P2}")
```

This code computes all possible sums \( P(2) + P(-2) \) in terms of \( k \) assuming a quadratic polynomial consistent with the data points. It explicitly prints solutions for small sample \( k \)-values to help conjecture the general pattern, which is linear in \( k \).
