The given theorem describes a functional equation: \( f(x^2 - y^2) = x f(x) - y f(y) \). To assist in conjecturing and potentially proving the solution set, our strategy is to test simple functions and parameterized cases, especially focusing on polynomial functions, linear functions, and special substitutions like \( y=0 \) and \( x=y \). We'll generate candidate functions and verify the equation for various small, representative values to identify solutions.

Here's a Python script to:
- Test candidate functions, especially linear functions \(f(x) = a x\) and constant functions.
- Verify the functional equation for small integer values of \(x, y\).
- Print candidate functions that satisfy the equation for multiple test cases.
- Output candidate functions immediately as they are checked.

Since we're asked to avoid hardcoding or stating the ground-truth answer, we will generate functions with parametric forms and test their validity across small ranges.

```python
# Enumerate simple candidate functions and verify the functional equation
import math

# Define small sample values for testing
sample_values = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]

# Candidate function forms: linear, constant, zero
candidate_functions = [
    ("f(x) = 0", lambda x: 0),
    ("f(x) = a*x", lambda x, a: a * x),
    ("f(x) = x", lambda x: x),
    ("f(x) = -x", lambda x: -x),
    ("f(x) = 2*x", lambda x: 2*x)
]

# Check functions, for different parameters if needed
for name, func in candidate_functions:
    print(f"Testing candidate: {name}")
    for a in [0, 1, -1, 2, -2]:  # For parametric functions
        def f(x, a=a):
            return func(x) if 'a' not in name else func(x, a)
        satisfies_for_all = True
        for x in sample_values:
            for y in sample_values:
                lhs = f(x**2 - y**2)
                rhs = x * f(x) - y * f(y)
                if lhs != rhs:
                    satisfies_for_all = False
                    break
            if not satisfies_for_all:
                break
        if satisfies_for_all:
            print(f"  Candidate {name} with parameter a={a} satisfies the equation over sampled values.")
            print(f"    f(x) = {func.__name__.replace('_', ' ')} with a={a}")
```

This code:
- Tests a small set of simple functions.
- Checks their conformity to the functional equation over sample values.
- Immediately prints when a candidate passes the tests, aiding in constraining the solution set.

The approach is efficient and scalable for more complex candidate forms if needed.
