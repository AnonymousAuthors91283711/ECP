[write_program]
This problem involves evaluating probabilities for different match pairings in a semifinal tournament scenario and then expressing the average probability as a simplified rational number p/q with coprime numerator and denominator. Our goal is to write a Python program that enumerates all candidate fractions from the computed probabilities, checks for coprimality, and outputs promising results to assist in conjecturing the exact answer, prioritizing exact rational approximations.

The key steps:
- Define the three cases based on the probabilities given.
- Compute their exact rational values.
- Compute the average of the three cases.
- Generate candidates with denominators up to a certain small threshold.
- Check for simplified fractions and coprimality.
- Output all candidate fractions.

```python
from fractions import Fraction
from math import gcd

# Define individual case probabilities
case1 = Fraction(2, 3) * Fraction(3, 4) * Fraction(3, 4) + Fraction(1, 3) * Fraction(3, 4) * Fraction(1, 4)
case2 = Fraction(3, 4) * Fraction(3, 4) * Fraction(2, 3) + Fraction(1, 4) * Fraction(3, 4) * Fraction(3, 4)
case3 = Fraction(3, 4) * Fraction(3, 4) * Fraction(2, 3) + Fraction(1, 4) * Fraction(3, 4) * Fraction(3, 4)

# Compute total average probability
total_prob = (case1 + case2 + case3) / 3

# Since total_prob is a Fraction, generate all potential simplified fractions
max_den = 50  # limit denominator size for enumeration
results = []

for denom in range(1, max_den + 1):
    # Generate possible numerators within the range
    num = total_prob.numerator * denom // total_prob.denominator
    # Adjust numerator to check nearby fractions
    for candidate_num in [num, num + 1, num - 1]:
        if 0 <= candidate_num <= denom:
            candidate_frac = Fraction(candidate_num, denom)
            # Check if close to total_prob
            if abs(candidate_frac - total_prob) < Fraction(1, 1000):
                # Check gcd to ensure simplified form
                if gcd(candidate_frac.numerator, candidate_frac.denominator) == 1:
                    print(f"Candidate fraction: {candidate_frac} (approx {float(candidate_frac):.4f})")

# Also print the exact total probability
print(f"Exact probability: {total_prob} (which is {float(total_prob):.4f})")
```
