[write_program]
The provided code appears to be related to a problem involving matrices and their rank, with the matrix defined by a specific formula for its entries. Since the problem requires enumeration of answers to understand and verify the rank in a concrete setting, I will create a Python program that simulates the problem by generating matrices for small values of n and counts their rank over ℚ (rational numbers). I will focus on the entries \(A_{i,j} = (i+1) + (j+1)\), which simplifies to \(A_{i,j} = i + j + 2\), for small n.

The program will:
- Iterate over small values of n (say 1 to 5) for demonstration.
- Generate the matrix for each n.
- Compute the rank over rationals.
- Print the value of n, the generated matrix, and the rank immediately.

This provides a basis for conjecture about the rank and the dependence on n, directly streaming the results.

```python
import numpy as np

# Helper function to compute matrix rank over rationals
def rank_over_rationals(matrix):
    # Use numpy to compute the rank over ℚ
    return np.linalg.matrix_rank(matrix)

# Enumerate matrices for small n
for n in range(1, 6):
    # Generate the matrix with entries A_{i,j} = i + j + 2
    A = np.array([[i + j + 2 for j in range(n)] for i in range(n)], dtype=float)
    rank_A = rank_over_rationals(A)
    print(f"n={n}")
    print("Matrix:")
    print(A)
    print(f"Rank over ℚ: {rank_A}\n")
```
