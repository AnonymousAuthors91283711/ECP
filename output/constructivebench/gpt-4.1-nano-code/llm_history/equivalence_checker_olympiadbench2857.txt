theorem olympiadbench2857 (T : ℕ) :
  let k := T + 1
  let total := k * (k - 1)^4
  let at_most_two_colors := k + k * (k - 1) * ((k - 1)^3 - (k - 2)^3)

Ground Truth Answer: fun T => (T + 1) * T^4 - (T + 1) * T - (T + 1) * choose T 2 * (2 * T^3 - 3 * T^2 + T)
Proposed Answer: fun T : ℕ => 2 * (T + 1) * (T + 2)^2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines:
   - k = T + 1
   - total = k * (k-1)^4
   - at_most_two_colors = k + k*(k-1)*((k-1)^3 - (k-2)^3)
   - valid = total - at_most_two_colors

2. The ground truth answer expands this correctly:
   - total becomes (T+1)*T^4
   - at_most_two_colors becomes (T+1)*T + (T+1)*T*(T-1)/2*(2T^3-3T^2+T)
   - valid becomes the difference shown in the ground truth

3. The proposed answer is completely different:
   - It's 2*(T+1)*(T+2)^2
   - This doesn't match the algebraic structure of the problem
   - For example, at T=1:
     - Ground truth: 2*1^4 - 2*1 - 2*0*(...) = 0
     - Proposed: 2*2*3^2 = 36
     - These are clearly different

The answers are not equivalent in any way.
