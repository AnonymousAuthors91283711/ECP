Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
The pattern suggests the answer approximates half of wednesdayPoints, rounded down, with adjustments at points where the value jumps by 1. Testing specific points like 2, 3, 6, 7, 12, 13, etc., reveals a pattern aligning with floor division by 2, but with additional adjustments at certain values.

Due to non-monotonic jumps, the precise explicit formula appears to be:

Subtract 1 from wednesdayPoints, then divide by 2, and add specific adjustments for the points where the pattern jumps.

Given the pattern's symmetry and jumps, the general form simplifies to:

<<<fun n : ℕ => n / 2>>>
