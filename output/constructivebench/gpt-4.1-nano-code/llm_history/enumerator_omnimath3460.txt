The problem appears to involve analyzing a list of pairs of rational numbers, and checking whether there exists a pair in the list such that when combined with certain constants, some average falls below 80. To help verify possible pairs, we can generate candidate pairs within reasonable bounds, evaluate the condition, and output all pairs that satisfy it.

Assuming the list isn't huge, and considering rational numbers in a manageable range, we can sample pairs with numerator/denominator within small limits, and check the condition.

The constants sum to 73 + 82 + 85 = 240, adding p.1 + p.2, dividing by 5, less than 80, gives the inequality:

(240 + p.1 + p.2) / 5 < 80  
=> 240 + p.1 + p.2 < 400  
=> p.1 + p.2 < 160

We can generate pairs with sum less than 160, for denominators 1..10 (small rationals).

Here's the code that enumerates such pairs, outputs those satisfying the condition immediately, and produces a set of candidate pairs:

```python
# Generate pairs of rational numbers with small denominators and check the condition
# Specifically, find pairs (p1, p2) with p1 + p2 < 160
# For simplicity, generate fractions with denominators 1 to 10 and numerator up to 160 times the denominator
# Since the inequality p1 + p2 < 160, and rationals are positive or could be negative, but assuming positive here for a meaningful search

max_denom = 10
max_numer = 160

for denom1 in range(1, max_denom + 1):
    for numer1 in range(0, max_numer + 1):
        p1 = numer1 / denom1
        for denom2 in range(1, max_denom + 1):
            for numer2 in range(0, max_numer + 1):
                p2 = numer2 / denom2
                if p1 + p2 < 160:
                    total = (73 + 82 + 85 + p1 + p2) / 5
                    if total < 80:
                        print(f"Pair: ({p1:.2f}, {p2:.2f}), sum: {p1 + p2:.2f}, average: {total:.2f}")
```
