. Enumerated answers: Found candidate: x=23, y=16, x + y=39
Candidate sums x + y: {39}. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests the answer is the sum x + y for the solution with x=23, y=16, which is 39. Since the problem asks to eliminate the existential and universal quantifiers, the consistent, closed-form answer based on the enumeration and the constraints is 39.

<<<39>>>
