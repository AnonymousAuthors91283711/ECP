This is a complex functional analysis problem involving the maximal number of points on the complex unit circle arranged so that their sum is zero, with each point expressed as an exponential involving a common angle θ. The problem asks for the greatest such integer n satisfying these conditions, which corresponds to the maximum number of equally spaced points on the unit circle summing to zero, possibly rotated by a uniform angle θ.

Key insight:
- For n points equally spaced on the circle, their sum is zero if and only if they form the vertices of a regular polygon centered at the origin, i.e., the roots of unity.
- Adding a common rotation (θ) does not affect the sum being zero.
- The largest such n is therefore the maximum number of roots of unity that sum to zero, which is known to be unbounded in principle. But here, the points are constrained to a configuration where their sum is zero, and they are all on the unit circle.

In classical results, such configurations are the n-th roots of unity, which always sum to zero for n ≥ 2. There are no larger configurations satisfying these conditions unless we allow multiple centers or more complex arrangements; the question is essentially classical: what is the largest n for which such a symmetric configuration exists? The answer is infinity, but the problem likely expects the maximal finite n with the provided constraints, i.e., the roots of unity.

Given the structure, the maximal such n is unbounded in theory, but since `n` is natural and bounded in the problem context, the best guess is that for finite n, the maximum is arbitrarily large, with roots of unity at n → ∞.

However, considering the problem's context, likely the greatest such n is the highest known size for these configurations, which, in practice, is 12 (the vertices of a regular 12-gon sum to zero). But since the problem doesn't specify any upper bound, and from functional analysis and group symmetry, the maximum n is unbounded.

Since a precise answer isn't explicitly provided, but the problem asks for the maximal n satisfying this configuration, it is standard to note that:
- For n ≥ 2, the roots of unity sum to zero.
- No maximum exists unless restricted.

Thus, for the purpose of the enumeration, we may limit n to some small sample, say, n=2, 3, 4, 6, 12, etc.

Let's pick small sample values and print their configurations.

```python
# Enumerate small possible n's where roots of unity sum to zero, considering their arrangement.
# These are easy to check: n=2,3,4,6,12 (classical roots).
# For each, generate the points as `exp(θ * I + 2π I i / n)` with θ=0 for simplicity.
# Since the problem allows rotation, the key is that they can be rotated arbitrarily to satisfy the sum condition.
# For each n, we confirm if the sum of points (roots of unity) with rotation θ can be zero.

import math

# List of sample n values to test
sample_n = [2, 3, 4, 6, 12]

for n in sample_n:
    # For roots of unity, sum is zero regardless of rotation
    # Generate points at θ=0
    points = []
    for i in range(n):
        angle = 2 * math.pi * i / n
        z = complex(math.cos(angle), math.sin(angle))
        points.append(z)
        print(f"n={n}, point {i}: {z}")
    sum_points = sum(points)
    print(f"Sum of roots of unity for n={n}: {sum_points}\n")
```
