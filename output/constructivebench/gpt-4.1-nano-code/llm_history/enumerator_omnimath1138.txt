The problem involves a set \(S = [1, 9]\) and a property \(P\) of functions \(f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}\) with:
- \(f\) satisfying \(f(f(f(s))) = s\) for all \(s \in S\),
- \(f(s) - s\) not divisible by 3.

We need to enumerate solutions satisfying these conditions and determine the number of such functions.

Given the symmetry and constraints:
- \(f\) acts as a permutation on the finite set \(S = \{1, 2, ..., 9\}\),
- The condition \(f(f(f(s))) = s\) suggests that the permutation decomposes into cycles of length 1 or 3 (since applying \(f\) thrice brings elements back).

Possible cycle types on \(S\) with lengths dividing 3:
- fixed points (1-cycles),
- 3-cycles,
- 9-cycles is not possible because \(f(f(f(s)))=s\) would return to original after 3 steps.

But the permutation acts only on \(S\), so the potential structures are limited.

Furthermore, the condition \(\neg 3 \mid f s - s\) restricts \(f(s) \not\equiv s \pmod{3}\), i.e., \(f(s)\) cannot be congruent to \(s\) mod 3.

---

Here is a Python script to enumerate possible functions and count those satisfying the conditions (note: in a simplified, small scale, since complete permutations on 9 elements are large).

```python
from itertools import permutations

# Elements of set S = 1..9
S = list(range(1, 10))

# Partition S into residue classes mod 3
residue_classes = {0: [], 1: [], 2: []}
for s in S:
    residue_classes[s % 3].append(s)

count = 0

# Generate all permutations of S
for perm in permutations(S):
    f = {s: perm[i] for i, s in enumerate(S)}
    # Check if f satisfies f(f(f(s))) = s
    if all(((f[f[f[s]]]) == s) for s in S):
        # Check the divisibility condition
        if all((f[s] - s) % 3 != 0 for s in S):
            count += 1
            print(f"Found valid f: {f}")

print(f"Total number of such functions: {count}")
```
