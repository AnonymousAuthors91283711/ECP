The problem appears to involve finding the greatest prime \( p \) that satisfies the condition: there exists a set \( s \) of primes such that the average of the primes in \( s \) is 27, and \( p \) is a member of \( s \). The goal is to find the largest such prime.

**Key points:**
- \( s \) is a finite set of primes
- The average of all primes in \( s \) is 27, i.e., \(\frac{\sum_{q \in s} q}{|s|} = 27\)
- \( p \) is a prime in \( s \)
- The theorem asks for the greatest such \( p \)

We will:
- Iterate over small sizes of \( s \) (since large sizes are impractical to brute-force)
- For each size, generate combinations of primes whose sum divided by size equals 27
- Collect all primes in those sets and find the maximum \( p \)

Below is a Python script that performs this enumeration efficiently over a range of sizes and small primes, and outputs candidate primes immediately as they are found.

```python
from itertools import combinations
from math import sqrt

# Generate small primes up to a certain limit for candidate sets
def generate_primes(n):
    sieve = [True]*(n+1)
    sieve[0:2] = [False, False]
    for i in range(2, int(sqrt(n))+1):
        if sieve[i]:
            for j in range(i*i, n+1, i):
                sieve[j] = False
    return [p for p in range(2, n+1) if sieve[p]]

# We choose an upper limit for prime generation
primes = generate_primes(200)

# To handle the average = 27, the sum depends on the size of s.
# For each size s_size, the sum should be 27 * s_size
# We'll search over s sizes from 2 up to, say, 15
max_p = 0

for size in range(2, 16):
    target_sum = 27 * size
    # Generate all combinations of the given size
    for combo in combinations(primes, size):
        s_sum = sum(combo)
        if s_sum == target_sum:
            # For each prime in the combo, check if it's greater than current max
            for p in combo:
                if p > max_p:
                    max_p = p
                    print(f"Found candidate p={p} in set={combo}")
```

This code:
- Generates primes up to 200 for candidate sets
- For each size between 2 and 15, checks all prime combinations
- When sum matches the required total, it prints each prime in the set immediately for conjecture

This approach finds all candidate primes and highlights the largest \( p \) satisfying the condition, streamlining the process of inferring the correct or maximal prime.
