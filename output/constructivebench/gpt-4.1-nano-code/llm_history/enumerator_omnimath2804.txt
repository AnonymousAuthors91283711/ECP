The problem defines a set of sequences \(f: \text{Fin } 11 \to \mathbb{R}\) with specific boundary conditions and a recursive relation involving a geometric mean. We need to find the number of such sequences modulo 100.

Observations:
- The sequence is defined for \( n = 0, 1, ..., 10 \).
- Boundary conditions: \(f(0) = 4\), \(f(10) = 1024\).
- Recursive relation: \(f(n) + f(n-1) = \frac{5}{2} \sqrt{f(n)f(n-1)}\), for \(n \in 1..10\).
- For \(f(n)\) to be real, \(\sqrt{f(n)f(n-1)}\) must be real and positive.
- The relation resembles a geometric mean relation. Let \(g(n) = \sqrt{f(n)}\). then the relation becomes linear in \(g(n)\) and \(g(n-1)\).

Rearranged:
\[
f(n) + f(n-1) = \frac{5}{2} \sqrt{f(n)f(n-1)} \implies g(n)^2 + g(n-1)^2 = \frac{5}{2} g(n)g(n-1)
\]
Divide both sides by \(g(n)g(n-1)\):
\[
\frac{g(n)^2}{g(n)g(n-1)} + \frac{g(n-1)^2}{g(n)g(n-1)} = \frac{5}{2}
\]
\[
\frac{g(n)}{g(n-1)} + \frac{g(n-1)}{g(n)} = \frac{5}{2}
\]
Set \(r = \frac{g(n)}{g(n-1)}\).

Thus:
\[
r + \frac{1}{r} = \frac{5}{2}
\]
Multiply through by \(r\):

\[
r^2 - \frac{5}{2} r + 1 = 0
\]
Quadratic in \(r\):
\[
2r^2 - 5r + 2 = 0
\]
Discriminant:
\[
D = 25 - 16 = 9
\]

Solutions:
\[
r = \frac{5 \pm 3}{4}
\]
\[
r_1 = \frac{8}{4} = 2, \quad r_2 = \frac{2}{4} = 0.5
\]

Hence, at each step, the ratio \(r = g(n)/g(n-1)\) is either 2 or 0.5.

Given:
\[
f(0) = 4 \implies g(0) = \sqrt{4} = 2
\]

Sequence of ratios: each \(r_i \in \{2, 0.5\}\).

Sequence \(f(n) = g(n)^2\).

Since \(g(n) = g(0) \times \prod r_i\), with \(g(0)=2\):

\[
g(n) = 2 \times \prod_{i=1}^{n} r_i
\]

and:

\[
f(n) = g(n)^2 = 4 \times \left( \prod_{i=1}^{n} r_i \right)^2
\]

Boundary condition:
\[
f(10) = 1024
\]
which means:
\[
g(10) = \sqrt{1024} = 32
\]

Since:
\[
g(10) = 2 \times \prod_{i=1}^{10} r_i
\]
we have:
\[
32 = 2 \times \prod_{i=1}^{10} r_i \implies \prod_{i=1}^{10} r_i = 16
\]

Now, each \(r_i \in \{2, 0.5\}\). The product:

\[
\prod_{i=1}^{10} r_i = 2^{k} \times (0.5)^{(10 - k)} = 2^{k} \times 2^{-(10 - k)} = 2^{k - (10 - k)} = 2^{2k - 10}
\]

Set equal to 16 (which is \(2^4\)):

\[
2^{2k - 10} = 2^{4} \implies 2k - 10 = 4 \implies 2k = 14 \implies k=7
\]

Thus, exactly 7 of the ratios are 2, and 3 are 0.5.

Number of such sequences:
\[
\binom{10}{7} = \binom{10}{3} = 120
\]

Each sequence corresponds to choosing which 7 steps are 'up' (ratio 2) and which 3 steps are 'down' (ratio 0.5). Computing:

\[
f(n) = 4 \times \left( \prod_{i=1}^n r_i \right)^2
\]

For each sequence, the sequence of \(f(n)\) is determined uniquely.

Final tally:
Number of sequences \(= 120\). Since we only need the count mod 100:

\[
120 \equiv 20 \pmod{100}
\]
