  IsLeast {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ (∑ k in Finset.range n, ‖k - (round (sqrt k : ℝ))^2‖) = 100 * n} omnimath1518_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 0. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The question seeks the minimal natural number n > 0 satisfying a sum condition. Given only the enumeration (0), and analyzing the problem, the smallest n greater than zero that could satisfy the sum condition (which involves the absolute difference sum) is n=100, as the sum likely becomes 100*n at n=100. Therefore, the least such n is 100.

<<<100>>>
