[write_program]
This problem involves solving for x and y given the equations:  
3 + x = 5  
-3 + y = 5  

Once x and y are determined, compute x + y. I'll write a Python program that finds these solutions explicitly and then outputs their sum.

```python
# Solve for x from 3 + x = 5
x_candidates = [5 - 3]

# Solve for y from -3 + y = 5
y_candidates = [5 + 3]

# Enumerate all candidate pairs (x, y)
for x in x_candidates:
    for y in y_candidates:
        answer = x + y
        print(f"x: {x}, y: {y}, x + y: {answer}")
```
