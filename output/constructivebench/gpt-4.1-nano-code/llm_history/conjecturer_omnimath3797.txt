Minimum sum: 1. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the pattern in enumerated answers and the minimal sum being 1, the sum of digits for n=0 yields 1. Since 0 is often the smallest non-negative integer, the minimal sum corresponds to n=0, giving digits sum as 1. Therefore, the answer is λ s, ∃ n, s = (digits 10 (3 * n^2 + n + 1)).sum, currently minimized at n=0.
