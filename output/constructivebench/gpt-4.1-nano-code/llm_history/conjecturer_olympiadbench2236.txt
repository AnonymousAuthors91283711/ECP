Minimum t: 2. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The function \( \sin (\pi t - \pi/2) \) achieves \(-1\) at \( \pi t - \pi/2 = 3\pi/2 + 2k\pi \). Solving for \(t\), the smallest positive is at \(k=0\): \( t = \frac{3\pi/2 + \pi/2}{\pi} = 2 \). Therefore, minimal such \( t \) is 2, matching the enumerated answer.
