The problem seems to be about finding four-digit numbers \( x \) between 1000 and 9999, where \( x \) has certain digit properties and is related to a perfect square in the form \( x = n^2 + 1 \). Specifically, the conditions suggest:

- \( x \) has digits \( a, b \) such that \( x = 1000a + 100b + 10a + b \), which simplifies to \( x = 1010a + 101b \).
- \( a \neq 0 \) (to ensure four digits).
- \( x = n^2 + 1 \).
- Therefore, the problem is to find such \( x \) and \( n \).

Let's generate candidate \( x \) by iterating over \( a \) and \( b \) within their constraints, compute \( x \), check if \( x - 1 \) is a perfect square, and if \( x \) falls within 1000 to 9999.

```python
import math

# Collect all candidate answers
answers = []

# Iterate through possible digit values a and b
# a from 1 to 9 (since leading digit can't be zero)
# b from 0 to 9
for a in range(1, 10):
    for b in range(0, 10):
        x = 1010 * a + 101 * b
        if 1000 <= x <= 9999:
            # Check if x-1 is a perfect square
            n = int(math.isqrt(x - 1))
            if n * n == x - 1:
                # If so, record x
                print(x)
                answers.append(x)
```
