Let's analyze the problem:

- Digits a, b, c are between 0 and 9, with a between 1 and 9.
- The sum a + b + c ≤ 7.
- There exists a t > 0 such that: 100a + 10b + c + 55t = 100c + 10b + a
- The sum of squares a² + b² + c² is assigned to the answer.

Rewrite the key equation:
100a + 10b + c + 55t = 100c + 10b + a

Subtract 10b from both sides:
100a + c + 55t = 100c + a

Bring all to one side:
100a - a + c + 55t - 100c = 0
(99a) + c + 55t - 100c = 0
(99a) + 55t = 99c

Divide through by 11:
9a + 5t = 9c

Rearranged:
9 c - 9 a = 5 t
t = (9/5)(c - a)

Since t > 0 and integer, it follows that (c - a) must be divisible by 5, and t is integer.

Let's consider c - a in multiples of 5:

- If c - a = 0 → t = 0, invalid because t > 0.
- If c - a = 5 → t = 9.
- If c - a = -5 → t = -9, invalid because t > 0.

But c ≥ a, and c ≤ 9, a ≥ 1.

Thus, only c - a = 5 is feasible.

Check if c = a + 5, with c ≤ 9 and a ≥ 1:

a: 1 to 4 (because c ≤ 9)

For each a:

- c = a + 5

Calculate t:
t = (9/5) * 5 = 9

Now, check the sum constraint:
a + b + c ≤ 7
but c = a + 5

So:
a + b + (a + 5) ≤7
2a + b + 5 ≤7
b ≤ 2 - 2a

Since b ≥ 0:
b ≤ 2 - 2a

And b ≤ 9 (digits).

For b ≥ 0:
b ≤ min(9, 2 - 2a)

Test for a values:

a=1:
b ≤ 2 - 2(1) = 2 - 2 = 0
b between 0 and 0 → b=0

Sum check:
a + b + c = 1 + 0 + 6 =7 ≤7 ✓

a=2:
b ≤ 2 - 4 = -2
b ≥0 → no solutions

a=3:
b ≤ 2 - 6 = -4 → no solutions

a=4:
b ≤ 2 -8 = -6 → no solutions

Only a=1 produces solutions, with c=6, b=0, t=9.

Sum candidates:
a=1, b=0, c=6, t=9

Check sum of squares:
a² + b² + c² = 1 + 0 + 36 = 37

Answer: 37

Now, generate code to find this systematically.

```python
# Enumerate all (a,b,c) with constraints and check for valid t
def main():
    max_sum = 7
    answer_values = []
    for a in range(1, 10):
        for c in range(0, 10):
            if c - a == 5:  # from derivation
                t = (9 * (c - a)) // 5
                if t > 0:
                    for b in range(0, 10):
                        if a + b + c <= max_sum:
                            # Validate the key equation:
                            left = 100 * a + 10 * b + c + 55 * t
                            right = 100 * c + 10 * b + a
                            if left == right:
                                sum_squares = a**2 + b**2 + c**2
                                print(sum_squares)
                                answer_values.append(sum_squares)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
