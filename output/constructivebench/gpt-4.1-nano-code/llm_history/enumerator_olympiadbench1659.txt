This problem appears to involve functional equations with positive real variables, symmetry, and potentially specific form conjectures. Since the question involves finding all solutions \(f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) satisfying a certain functional equation and positivity condition, I will attempt to generate candidate functions by exploring simple functional forms such as linear functions.

Given the structure \(f(x + f(y)) = f(x + y) + f(y)\) for all \(x, y > 0\), I will test linear functions \(f(x) = c x\) for various constants \(c\). These are typical solutions in such equations; then verify if they satisfy the conditions.

To assist in conjecturing, I will:
- Substituting \(f(x)=c x\) into the functional equation.
- Generate candidate constants \(c\).
- For each candidate \(c\), verify if the positive domain condition and the functional equation hold.

Here's the Python code that approaches this idea efficiently:

```python
# Enumerate candidate linear functions f(x) = c * x with c > 0
# Check whether they satisfy the functional equation for sampled values
# Print candidates that satisfy the equation (approximate verification)

import numpy as np

# Range of c to test
c_values = np.linspace(0.1, 5.0, 50)

# Sample positive x, y values
sample_x = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
sample_y = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]

# Tolerance for approximation
tol = 1e-6

for c in c_values:
    f = lambda x: c * x
    # Check the functional equation on sampled values
    valid = True
    for x in sample_x:
        for y in sample_y:
            left = f(x + f(y))
            right = f(x + y) + f(y)
            if abs(left - right) > tol:
                valid = False
                break
        if not valid:
            break
    if valid:
        # All sampled checks passed, print the candidate function
        print(f'f(x) = {c:.3f} * x appears to satisfy the functional equation.')
```
