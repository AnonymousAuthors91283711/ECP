Let's analyze the problem:

- The set \(\{a, b, c, d, q\}\) is exactly \(\{19, 21, 23, 25, 27\}\).
- There exists a common sum \(s\) satisfying various additive relations involving these variables.
- The relations imply that sums of pairs involving these variables are all equal to \(s\) (or related to \(s\)).

From the equations:
1. \(a + b + q = s\)
2. \(c + d + q = s\)
3. \(a + c + 17 = s\)
4. \(b + d + 17 = s\)
5. \(a + d + 13 = s\)
6. \(b + c + 13 = s\)

Subtract the equations to eliminate \(s\) and find relations among \(a, b, c, d, q\).

By reasoning, the key is to find pairs that sum to these values and to identify \(q\). 

Since the set is small and all elements are known but unordered, generate all permutations of \(\{19, 21, 23, 25, 27\}\) assigned to \(a, b, c, d, q\), check which fit the equations, and extract \(q\). This approach is efficient given only five elements.

Here's the code.

```python
import itertools

# Known set of elements
elements = [19, 21, 23, 25, 27]

# To store discovered answers for q
answers = set()

# Generate all permutations assigning elements to a,b,c,d,q
for perm in itertools.permutations(elements):
    a, b, c, d, q = perm
    s1 = a + b + q
    s2 = c + d + q
    s3 = a + c + 17
    s4 = b + d + 17
    s5 = a + d + 13
    s6 = b + c + 13

    # All must be equal for the system to hold
    if s1 == s2 == s3 == s4 == s5 == s6:
        answers.add(q)
        print(f"Found q = {q} with sum s = {s1}. Variables: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}")

# If no specific search criterion, list all possible q
print(f"All possible q values: {sorted(answers)}")
```
