Ground Truth Answer: {(2, 0), (0, -2)}
Proposed Answer: { (x, y) | (x = 0 ∧ y = -2) ∨ (x = 2 ∧ y = 0) }
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is exactly equivalent to the ground truth answer. Both specify the same two integer solutions (2, 0) and (0, -2) to the equation x³ - y³ = 2xy + 8. The proposed answer just expresses these solutions in set-builder notation with explicit conditions, while the ground truth lists them explicitly. Both forms represent identical solution sets.
