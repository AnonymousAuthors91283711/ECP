This problem involves enumerating combinations of pairs from a set of 6 sock types with certain characteristics, and calculating the ratio of pairs of the same type to total valid pairs. To conjecture the true answer, I will:
- enumerate all pairs,
- count how many are of the same type,
- and compute their ratio.

Because the problem is based on small sample sets, a brute-force enumeration of pairs is straightforward and efficient enough. Make sure to handle floating point ratios accurately.

```python
# Enumerate all pairs and count same-type pairs
from itertools import combinations

# Sock types: 0=complex, 1=synthetic, 2=trigonometric
sock_types = [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]

total_pairs = 0
same_type_pairs = 0

# Generate all possible pairs
for i, j in combinations(range(len(sock_types)), 2):
    total_pairs += 1
    if sock_types[i] == sock_types[j]:
        same_type_pairs += 1
        # Print each same-type pair for illustration
        print(f"Same type pair: indices ({i},{j}), type {sock_types[i]}")

# Compute ratio of same type pairs to total pairs
ratio = same_type_pairs / total_pairs
print(f"Total pairs: {total_pairs}")
print(f"Same type pairs: {same_type_pairs}")
print(f"Ratio of same type pairs: {ratio}")

# Output the ratio as an exact fractional approximation
from fractions import Fraction
exact_ratio = Fraction(same_type_pairs, total_pairs)
print(f"Exact ratio: {exact_ratio}")
```
