It looks like the problem involves solving for the value of \( \frac{s}{n} \) given two equations involving \( s \) and \( n \). The equations are:

1. \(\frac{s + 11}{n + 1} = \frac{s}{n} + 1\)
2. \(\frac{s + 33}{n + 3} = \frac{s}{n} + 2\)

The goal is to find the value of \(s/n\) that satisfies both equations.

To algorithmically find this, we can:
- Iterate over small positive integer values of \( n \),
- For each \( n \), solve the system for \( s/n \),
- Check if both equations hold with the candidate \( s/n \),
- Output all solutions found.

Below is the code that performs this enumeration efficiently and streams solutions:

```python
# We will test small positive integer values for n
for n in range(1, 50):
    # From the first equation:
    # (s + 11)/(n + 1) = s/n + 1
    # which can be rearranged to solve for s/n
    # (s + 11) = (n + 1)*(s/n + 1)
    # (s + 11) = (n + 1)*(s/n) + (n + 1)
    # But s/n = x, so s = x * n
    # Substitute:
    # x * n + 11 = (n + 1)*x + n + 1
    # Rearrange:
    # x * n + 11 = x * (n + 1) + n + 1
    # x * n - x * (n + 1) = n + 1 - 11
    # x*(n - (n + 1)) = n - 10
    # x * (-1) = n - 10
    # x = 10 - n
    # Therefore, from the first equation, s/n = 10 - n

    x1 = 10 - n

    # Now check the second equation:
    # (s + 33)/(n + 3) = s/n + 2
    # Substitute s = x1 * n
    numerator = x1 * n + 33
    denominator = n + 3
    left_side = numerator / denominator

    right_side = x1 + 2

    # If they are equal (within floating point tolerance), output the solution
    if abs(left_side - right_side) < 1e-9:
        print(f"n = {n}, s/n = {x1}")
```

This code numerically confirms the solutions based on the algebraic derivation. It enumerates small \( n \) values, finds candidate \( s/n \) from the first equation, and then verifies the second. Each matching solution is printed immediately, supporting exploration of satisfactory solutions without hardcoding or assumptions.
