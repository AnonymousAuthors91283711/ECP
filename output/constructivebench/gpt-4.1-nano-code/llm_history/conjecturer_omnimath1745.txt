Cardinality is countably infinite (ℵ₀).. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the pattern of pairs where c and d are equal up to sign and satisfy the conditions, these form (x, ±x) with x ≠ 0 and c|d, d|c, which reduces to x dividing itself, always true. The number of such pairs per magnitude is 2, excluding zero. Since the pairs are for all nonzero integers with no upper bound, the set is countably infinite.

Cardinality is countably infinite (ℵ₀).. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The main issue is that `ℕ.univInfinite` does not exist in Mathlib, because it's not standard notation, and moreover, ℕ (natural numbers) are finite (or at best, countably infinite, but there's no such attribute as `univInfinite` for ℕ). 

From the enumerated pairs, we observe that these pairs are precisely all pairs of integers (c, d) such that c and d are equal or negatives of each other, with both c and d nonzero, i.e. c ≠ 0, d ≠ 0, and c divides d, d divides c, leading to their ratios being ±1. This set corresponds exactly to all pairs where c = d or c = -d, with both c, d ≠ 0.

Since the set is countably infinite (it's comparable to the set of all non-zero integers, choosing c and d from ℤ\{0}), the cardinality is ℵ₀ (aleph-null). 

Thus, a suitable closed-form answer in Lean for the size of the set is ℕ, specifically ℵ₀, which is represented as `Infinite.card ℤ \ {0}` or simply the cardinality of ℤ\{0}. 

Lean's `Cardinal` type contains `aleph0` as `ℵ₀`, and since the set is countably infinite, the cardinality of the set corresponds to `aleph0`.

So, fixing the error: Instead of `ℕ.univInfinite`, use `Nat.cast` of ℵ₀, or simply `aleph0`.

Final answer:

<<<
aleph0
>>>

This correctly indicates the set's cardinality and matches the problem's expected answer type `ℕ`, considering countable infinity as ℵ₀.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Cardinality is countably infinite (ℵ₀).. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The key task is to interpret the set of pairs \( p = (c, d) \in \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \) where \( c \neq 0 \), \( d \neq 0 \), and there exists an \( x \in \mathbb{Z} \) such that \( c x = d \) and \( d x = c \). The given enumeration suggests that solutions are pairs of integers with certain symmetry, specifically those where \( c \) and \( d \) are proportional with a ratio \( x \) satisfying \( c x = d \) and \( d x = c \). 

From the equations:
- \( c x = d \)
- \( d x = c \)

We see that:
- \( c x = d \)
- \( d x = c \)

Substituting \( d = c x \) into the second:
- \( (c x) x = c \Rightarrow c x^2 = c \)

Since \( c \neq 0 \), dividing both sides by \( c \):
- \( x^2 = 1 \Rightarrow x = \pm 1 \)

Thus, for the pair \( (c, d) \):
- \( c x = d \), with \( x = \pm 1 \)

If \( x = 1 \), then \( d = c \),
If \( x = -1 \), then \( d = -c \).

Given \( c \neq 0 \), and \( d \neq 0 \), the pairs are all where \( d = c \) or \( d = -c \), with \( c \neq 0 \). This matches the enumerated pairs which are pairs of integers with opposite signs or same signs.

Counting all such pairs, these are all the pairs of non-zero integers of the form \( (c, c) \) or \( (c, -c) \) with \( c \neq 0 \). The set of such pairs is countably infinite because \( c \in \mathbb{Z} \setminus \{0\} \), which is countably infinite.

The set of \( c \in \mathbb{Z} \setminus \{ 0 \} \) is countably infinite, hence the set of pairs is countably infinite, and its cardinality is \( \aleph_0 \).

Error Explanation:
- The original code references `aleph0`, which is a known notation for the first infinite cardinal, but in Lean, the notation is `aleph0`.
- Importing or defining `aleph0` correctly requires importing `Mathlib.Data.Nat.Choosing` or `Mathlib.Set.Countable`, which include the `aleph0` definition.
- Without such import, Lean does not recognize `aleph0`, causing an "unknown identifier" error.

Final Answer:
- Use `import Mathlib.Data.Nat.Choosing` or relevant namespace where `aleph0` is defined.
- Provide the answer as `aleph0`, representing the countably infinite set.

Considering this, the fixed code snippet would be:

```lean
import Mathlib.Data.Nat.Choosing -- or the appropriate import to get aleph0

abbrev omnimath1745_answer : ℕ := aleph0
```

Thus, the final assertion:

Cardinality is countably infinite (ℵ₀).. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the enumerated pairs, the set includes all pairs of integers where the entries are equal in magnitude and either both positive or both negative, or can be negatives and positives of each other with equal magnitude. Because the set includes pairs like (−n, −n), (n, n), (−n, n), and (n, -n) for all natural numbers n ≥ 1, and the total collection appears to be countably infinite, the cardinality corresponds to ℵ₀.

In Lean, the cardinality of such a countably infinite set is ℵ₀ (aleph-zero). The correct import to express this in Lean is `aleph0`, which is provided by `Mathlib`. The initial code attempt had an import error. Correctly, `aleph0` is either directly available after importing `Mathlib`, or it can be referenced via `Mathlib.SetTheory.Cardinal.aleph0`.

Hence, the fixed, concise answer in Lean compatible form is:

<<<fun _ => aleph0>>>

This is a closed-form expression mapping any input (here, the set's parameters are irrelevant for its cardinality) to `aleph0`, the countably infinite cardinal.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Cardinality is countably infinite (ℵ₀).. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The problem involves counting pairs (c, d) of integers satisfying certain divisibility conditions, and the enumeration suggests symmetric pairs with both positive and negative values aligned along the line c=d or c=-d. The key insight from the enumerated sample points is that all pairs are of the form (x, x) or (x, -x) for z ∈ ℤ, with x ≠ 0, and that they satisfy a certain symmetry and divisibility relation.

Given the conditions:

(let (c, d) := p; c ≠ 0 ∧ d ≠ 0 ∧ (∃ x : ℤ, c * x = d ∧ d * x = c))

The pairs are characterized by cases where:
- c and d are nonzero integers.
- There exists an integer x such that c * x = d and d * x = c; implying c and d are related via x.

When analyzing such relations, a pattern emerges: (c, d) must be of the form (x, x) or (x, -x), due to symmetry and the fact that these satisfy the constraints. For (x, x), the relations are trivial; for (x, -x), the relations also hold if x ≠ 0 and x ≠ 0.

From the enumeration and symmetry, the set corresponds to pairs where c and d are either equal or negatives of each other, with both nonzero, and the relation holds for specific x.

To count this set, observe:
- The pairs are countably infinite, corresponding to setting x ∈ ℤ \ {0}.
- The pairs correspond to pairs (x, ±x) where x ≠ 0.

Hence, the set is countably infinite, with cardinality ℵ₀.

In Lean, ℵ₀ can be denoted as `infinite` or `countableEncode`, but the standard is `⊤`, or referring to the cardinality of ℤ, which is `aleph0`. Organizing, a succinct, closed-form statement for the answer matching the set's cardinality is:

Answer:
```lean
fun _ => ℵ₀
```

which indicates the set is countably infinite.

Here's the fixed version with the correct identifier:
