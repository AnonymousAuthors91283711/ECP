Given the set S = {d : ℕ | d > 0 ∧ d ∣ 100000}, the problem asks for the count of pairs (d1, d2) in S with d1 ≠ d2 and p = d1 * d2. Since S includes divisors of 100000, all such pairs are distinct divisors with products dividing 100000. The total pairs with d1 ≠ d2 aligns with the number of distinct divisor pairs. 

Since the total number of divisors of 100000 is 45, and each pair (d1, d2) is counted once (excluding pairs with d1 = d2), the number of such pairs is 117.

<<<(45 * 44) / 2>>>
