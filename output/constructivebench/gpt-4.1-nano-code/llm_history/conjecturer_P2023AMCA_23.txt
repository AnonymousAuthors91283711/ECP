theorem P2023AMCA_23
: {(a, b) : ℝ × ℝ | a > 0 ∧ b > 0 ∧ (1 + 2 * a) * (1 + b) * (2 * a + b) = 16 * a * b}.encard = P2023AMCA_23_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Solution found at a=0.50, b=1.00
The estimated number of solutions is: 1

. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern in the enumeration suggests a unique solution exists at a=0.5 and b=1. Given the problem constraints, the only solution corresponds to this pair, resulting in a single solution set.

<<<1>>>

This indicates exactly one solution.
