Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The minimal S occurs when r approaches 0 from above, approaching the limit of S = a / (1 - r) with a * r = 1, i.e. a = 1 / r. As r ↓ 0, a → ∞ but S remains finite; with the smallest S tending toward the limit as r→0+, S ≈ (1 / r) / (1 - r) → 1 / r as r → 0. To minimize S under the given constraints, we thus have the minimal S approaching 4 as r approaches 0.1 from above. The minimal value is attained at r = 0.1, giving S = 11.11, but as r→0, S→ ∞. Therefore, the infimum (least value) of S is 4.
