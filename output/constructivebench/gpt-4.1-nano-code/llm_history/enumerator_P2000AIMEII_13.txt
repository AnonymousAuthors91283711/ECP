This problem involves analyzing a degree-6 polynomial to determine its roots and specific form related to rational and quadratic expressions. To aid in conjecture and verification, I will implement a Python script that:

- Defines the polynomial.
- Searches for roots numerically over a small interval.
- Finds real roots with high precision.
- Checks if roots match the form (m + sqrt(n))/r with integers m, r, n.
- Enumerates candidate roots for possible solutions, focusing on minimal positive roots.
- Streamingly prints the roots and candidate forms.

This approach helps approximate the roots, identify their structure, and support conjecture about the polynomial's roots and their special form.

```python
import math
import numpy as np

# Define the polynomial p(x) = 2000x^6 + 100x^5 + 10x^3 + x - 2
def p(x):
    return 2000 * x**6 + 100 * x**5 + 10 * x**3 + x - 2

# Use numpy to find approximate roots over a specified interval
# We select a broad interval based on initial estimates
intervals = [(-2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)]
roots = []

# Tolerance for root approximation
tolerance = 1e-8

for (a, b) in intervals:
    xs = np.linspace(a, b, 2000)
    for i in range(len(xs)-1):
        x0, x1 = xs[i], xs[i+1]
        y0, y1 = p(x0), p(x1)
        # Check if there is a sign change
        if y0 * y1 <= 0:
            # Find root via bisection
            low, high = x0, x1
            for _ in range(100):
                mid = (low + high) / 2
                val = p(mid)
                if abs(val) < tolerance:
                    break
                if y0 * val < 0:
                    high = mid
                else:
                    low = mid
            root = (low + high) / 2
            # Avoid duplicates
            if not any(abs(root - r) < 1e-6 for r in roots):
                roots.append(root)
                print(f"Found root at x ≈ {root}")

# Analyze roots for form (m + sqrt(n))/r
# Search over small integer ranges for m, r, n
max_m = 5
max_r = 5
max_n = 5

print("\nCandidates matching (m + sqrt(n))/r form:")
for root in roots:
    for m in range(-max_m, max_m + 1):
        for n in range(0, max_n + 1):
            for r in range(1, max_r + 1):
                candidate = (m + math.sqrt(n)) / r
                if abs(candidate - root) < 1e-4:
                    print(f"Root {root:.6f} ≈ (m={m} + sqrt({n})) / r={r}")
```
