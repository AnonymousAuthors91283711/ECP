  P2017AIMEII_5_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Maximum possible sum of a pair: 320. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The set of pair sums includes 189, 234, 287, 320, and two unknowns x and y, with the maximum sum of any pair being 320. The largest pair sum occurs when both elements are the largest two numbers, possibly involving x or y, but since 320 is listed explicitly, and it must be the maximum, the sum is 320. 

Therefore, the maximum sum of the pair is 320.

<<<320>>>
