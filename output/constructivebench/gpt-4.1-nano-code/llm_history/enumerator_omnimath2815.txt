This problem involves a system of equations with real variables x and y:

1) 3x + 2y = 6  
2) 9x² + 4y² = 468

We need to find the value of x * y.

Approach:
- Express y in terms of x from the first equation.
- Substitute into the second to find possible x values.
- For each x, compute y, then find x * y.
- Enumerate all solutions, prioritize exact algebraic solutions.

Let's perform the algebra:
From 3x + 2y = 6,  
2y = 6 - 3x,  
y = (6 - 3x)/2.

Substitute into the second:  
9x² + 4 * ((6 - 3x)/2)² = 468

Simplify:  
9x² + 4 * (36 - 36x + 9x²)/4 = 468  
9x² + (36 - 36x + 9x²) = 468  
9x² + 36 - 36x + 9x² = 468  
(9x² + 9x²) - 36x + 36 = 468  
18x² - 36x + 36 = 468

Subtract 468:  
18x² -36x + 36 - 468 = 0  
18x² -36x - 432 = 0

Divide by 18:  
x² - 2x - 24 = 0

Solve quadratic:  
x = [2 ± sqrt(4 - 4 * 1 * (-24))]/2 = [2 ± sqrt(4 + 96)]/2 = [2 ± sqrt(100)]/2

So:  
x = [2 ± 10]/2

Two solutions:  
x₁ = (2 + 10)/2 = 12/2 = 6  
x₂ = (2 - 10)/2 = (-8)/2 = -4

For each x, compute y:

- For x=6:  
y = (6 - 3*6)/2 = (6 - 18)/2 = (-12)/2 = -6

- For x=-4:  
y= (6 - 3*(-4))/2 = (6 + 12)/2 = 18/2 = 9

Finally, compute x*y:

- For (6, -6): 6 * (-6) = -36
- For (-4, 9): -4 * 9 = -36

Both solutions give the same product, -36.

The answer is therefore -36.

Here's a Python code to verify the solutions and compute x*y:

```python
# Enumerate solutions based on algebraic derivation
solutions = [
    {'x': 6, 'y': (6 - 3*6)/2},
    {'x': -4, 'y': (6 - 3*(-4))/2}
]

for sol in solutions:
    x = sol['x']
    y = sol['y']
    product = x * y
    print(f"x={x}, y={y}, x*y={product}")
```

This outputs the exact solutions and confirms the product.

```python
# The product of x and y for all solutions is -36
```
