. Enumerated answers: Possible roots for r and s:
r = 12.64575131106459
s = 7.354248688935409
Sum r + s = 20.0
Product r * s = 92.99999999999999
Computed c (product of r+1 and s+1): 114.0
Verification: (r+1) + (s+1) = 22.0
Verification: (r+1)*(s+1) = 114.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given r + s = -b and r * s = 93, then r and s are roots of x² + bx + 93 = 0.  
Since (r + 1) + (s + 1) = 22, we get r + s + 2 = 22, so r + s = 20. Therefore, b = -20.  
Similarly, (r + 1)(s + 1) = c, which expands to rs + r + s + 1 = c → 93 + 20 + 1 = c → c = 114.  

Final answer: <<<114>>>
