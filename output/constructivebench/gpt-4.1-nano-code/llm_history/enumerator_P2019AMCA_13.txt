This problem involves counting functions `c : Fin 8 → Fin 3` with a specific divisibility condition: for any `i < j`, if `(i + 2)` divides `(j + 2)`, then `c i ≠ c j`. We need to enumerate all such functions, ideally identify the total count, and then possibly find the answer.

### Approach:
- Generate all functions from 8 elements (indices 0..7) to 3 colors (0..2).
- Check the divisibility condition for each pair `(i,j)` where `i < j`.
- Count only those functions satisfying the condition.

Since `Fin 8` has 8 elements and each can map to 3 options, total functions are `3^8 = 6561`. Enumerating all is feasible but should be done efficiently.

### Implementation:
- Use list comprehensions to generate all functions.
- Check the condition for each.
- Count and print valid functions, and at the end, produce the total count.

The answer is the number of valid functions satisfying the condition.

```python
# Count functions c: Fin 8 -> Fin 3 with the condition:
# For all i < j, if (i+2) divides (j+2), then c(i) != c(j).

# Generate all functions as lists of length 8, each element in {0,1,2}
total = 0
valid_functions = []

for pattern in range(3**8):
    c = []
    temp = pattern
    for _ in range(8):
        c.append(temp % 3)
        temp //= 3
    
    # Check the condition
    is_valid = True
    for i in range(8):
        for j in range(i+1, 8):
            if (i + 2) != 0 and (j + 2) % (i + 2) == 0:
                if c[i] == c[j]:
                    is_valid = False
                    break
        if not is_valid:
            break
    
    if is_valid:
        total += 1
        print(c)  # streaming partial results

print(f"Total valid functions: {total}")
```

This program enumerates all functions, checks the constraints efficiently, streams valid solutions, and finally outputs the total count, which is the ground-truth answer for the problem's question.
