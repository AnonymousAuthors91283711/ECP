The problem involves summing the cubes of integers from 1 to 2001 and identifying the answer. The sum of cubes from 1 to n is known to be (n(n+1)/2)^2. To assist in conjecturing and verifying, I'll write a Python script that computes this sum directly using this formula and also enumerates individual terms to verify or approximate if needed.

Given the constraints, the code will:
- Compute the sum of cubes from 1 to 2001 directly via the formula.
- Also, as a check, sum the cubes by iteration for verification.
- Print the result immediately upon calculation.

```python
# Computes sum of cubes from 1 to n using the formula: (n(n+1)/2)^2
n = 2001
# Calculate sum using formula
sum_cubes_formula = (n * (n + 1) // 2) ** 2
print(f"Sum of cubes from 1 to {n} (formula): {sum_cubes_formula}")

# Optional: verify by summation loop (less efficient for large n, but illustrative)
sum_cubes_iter = 0
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    sum_cubes_iter += i ** 3
print(f"Sum of cubes from 1 to {n} (iteration): {sum_cubes_iter}")
```
