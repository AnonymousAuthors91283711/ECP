This problem involves analyzing sequences of complex numbers with specific real/imaginary properties and constraints on their products, to find minimal norms of sums over a range of indices. To aid in conjecturing, we will pick small values for \( n \), construct candidate sequences \( z(k) \), and compute the associated sums and norms, then stream the minimal and related values.

Given the structure:
- Odd k: z(k).im = 0 (z(k) is real)
- Even k: z(k).re = 0 (z(k) is purely imaginary)
- The product condition: |z(k) * z(k+1)| = 2^k
- The function involves sums of z(k) and their norms

As an approximation, we choose a feasible pattern, such as:
- For odd k: z(k) = a_k (real)
- For even k: z(k) = i * b_k (imaginary)
- Then, |z(k) * z(k+1)| = |z(k)| * |z(k+1)| = 2^k

Let's set:
- For odd k: z(k) = r_k
- For even k: z(k) = i * s_k

From the product condition:
- For k odd: |r_k| * |s_{k+1}| = 2^k
- For k even: |s_k| * |r_{k+1}| = 2^k

To keep things minimal for small n, choose simple values:
- For odd k: r_k = 2^{k/2} (real positive)
- For even k: s_k = 2^{k/2} (real positive)

Now, compute sum norms for small n, e.g., n=1, 2, 3, 4, etc.

```python
import math

def enumerate_answers():
    # N=1: sum of z(1)
    n = 1
    z1 = 2**(1/2)  # z1 real
    sum_z = z1
    norm_sum_z = abs(sum_z)
    print(f"n={n}: norm of sum = {norm_sum_z}")

    # N=2: sum of z(1)+z(2)
    n=2
    z1 = 2**(1/2)
    z2 = 1j * 2**(2/2)  # imaginary
    sum_z = z1 + z2
    print(f"n={n}: norm of sum = {abs(sum_z)}")

    # N=3: sum z(1)+z(2)+z(3)
    n=3
    z1 = 2**(1/2)
    z2 = 1j * 2**(2/2)
    z3 = 2**(3/2)
    sum_z = z1 + z2 + z3
    print(f"n={n}: norm of sum = {abs(sum_z)}")

    # N=4: sum z(1)+z(2)+z(3)+z(4)
    n=4
    z1 = 2**(1/2)
    z2 = 1j * 2**(2/2)
    z3 = 2**(3/2)
    z4 = 1j * 2**(4/2)
    sum_z = z1 + z2 + z3 + z4
    print(f"n={n}: norm of sum = {abs(sum_z)}")

    # Optionally, explore minimal sum norms by adjusting magnitudes slightly
    # Or check other small variations to find smaller norms
