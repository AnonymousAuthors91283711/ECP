The problem involves computing a sum of ratios of double factorials for odd and even integers, and then analyzing its 2-adic valuation. To assist in conjecturing the true answer, we'll explicitly compute the sum for small i up to a certain point (e.g., i=100), print the sum and intermediate values, and observe the pattern. This helps approximate the behavior of the sum and possibly identify a closed form or trend.

```python
# This script computes the sum of (double factorial of odd numbers) divided by (double factorial of even numbers),
# for i from 1 to 100 (or a small sample),
# and prints the partial sums and key intermediate values to assist in conjecture.

import math

def double_factorial(n):
    """Compute the double factorial of n."""
    result = 1
    if n <= 0:
        return 1
    while n > 0:
        result *= n
        n -= 2
    return result

# Compute the sum for i from 1 to 100
limit = 100
total_sum = 0.0

for i in range(1, limit + 1):
    numerator = double_factorial(2 * i - 1)  # double factorial of odd
    denominator = double_factorial(2 * i)   # double factorial of even
    term = numerator / denominator
    total_sum += term
    print(f"i={i}: (2*i-1)!!={double_factorial(2*i-1)}, (2*i)!!={double_factorial(2*i)}, term={term:.6f}, cumulative sum={total_sum:.6f}")

print(f"\nApproximate sum for i=1 to {limit}: {total_sum:.6f}")

# Additional notes:
# Observing the pattern in terms of numerator/denominator and sum accumulation may assist in
# formulating a closed form or understanding the p-adic valuation behavior.
```
