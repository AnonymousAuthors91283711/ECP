Ground Truth Answer: {(2, 2), (1, 3), (3, 3)}
Proposed Answer: { (a, b) | a = b } ∪ { (1, 3) }
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for pairs (a,b) of natural numbers where both conditions hold:
   - a³b - 1 is divisible by a+1
   - b³a + 1 is divisible by b-1

2. Ground truth gives three specific pairs: (2,2), (1,3), (3,3)

3. Proposed answer gives all pairs where a=b plus (1,3)

Comparison:
- (2,2) and (3,3) are included in both answers (since they satisfy a=b)
- (1,3) is explicitly included in both
- However, the proposed answer would also include ALL pairs where a=b (like (4,4), (5,5), etc.), but these don't necessarily satisfy the original conditions. For example, (4,4) doesn't work because 4³*4-1=255 isn't divisible by 5.

The proposed answer is too broad - it includes many invalid pairs while missing none of the correct ones. Therefore, it's not equivalent to the ground truth.
