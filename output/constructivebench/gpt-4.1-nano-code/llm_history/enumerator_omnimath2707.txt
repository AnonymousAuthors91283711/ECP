This appears to be a Lean theorem stating an equation involving basic arithmetic and asking for an answer. Since the theorem is about the value of `(2 * 3 + 4) / (2 + 3)`, we can directly compute this exact value. To assist in conjecturing and proving, let's write a Python program to enumerate possible answers for this expression, prioritizing exact decimal (rational) values.

The expression simplifies to (6 + 4) / 5 = 10 / 5 = 2.0 exactly.

We'll generate rational approximations, but since it's straightforward, we'll also print the exact fraction for clarity.

```python
# Enumerate simple rational approximations of (2*3+4)/(2+3)
from fractions import Fraction

# Given expression
numerator = 2*3 + 4  # 6 + 4 = 10
denominator = 2 + 3   # 5

exact_fraction = Fraction(numerator, denominator)  # Fraction(10, 5)

# Print the exact value as a fraction
print(f"Exact value: {exact_fraction} = {float(exact_fraction)}")

# Enumerate rational approximations with denominators up to 10 for verification
for denom in range(1, 11):
    approx = Fraction(numerator, denominator).limit_denominator(denom)
    print(f"Approximation with denominator <= {denom}: {approx} â‰ˆ {float(approx)}")
```
