Ground Truth Answer: 216
Proposed Answer: 16
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

The problem is counting the number of 4×4 binary matrices where:
1. Each row has exactly 2 true and 2 false entries
2. Each column has exactly 2 true and 2 false entries

This is equivalent to counting the number of 4×4 0-1 matrices with exactly two 1's in each row and column. 

The ground truth answer is 216, which is correct because:
- The number of such matrices is given by the number of ways to pair rows, which is the number of perfect matchings in a complete bipartite graph K_{4,4}
- This is equal to the number of ways to partition 4 elements into pairs, which is (4-1)!! = 3*1 = 3 for the first pair, then (4-1)!! = 3*1 = 3 for the remaining pairs
- The exact count is 4! * (number of derangements) = 24 * 9 = 216

The proposed answer is 16, which is incorrect because:
- 16 would be the count if we were just considering row constraints (2^4 = 16 ways to arrange two 1's in each row)
- But it doesn't account for the column constraints, which significantly reduce the number of valid matrices
