abbrev omnimath531_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath531 :
  let doors := 7
  let prizeDoors := 2
  let totalCases := 7 * (choose 5 2) -- 7 initial choices × C(5,2) host choices
  let favorableCases := 5 * (choose 4 2) -- when initial choice has no prize
  favorableCases / totalCases = omnimath531_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Total cases: 735
Favorable cases: 630
Probability as fraction: 6/7. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
<<<(6 : ℚ) / 7>>>
