Ground Truth Answer: 405
Proposed Answer: 2897
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding two real numbers r (r1 and r2) that satisfy a certain common root condition for two quadratic equations, then computing their sum and expressing it as a reduced fraction a/b, and finally computing 100*a + b.

2. The ground truth answer is 405, which would correspond to a=4 and b=5 (since 100*4 + 5 = 405).

3. The proposed answer is 2897, which would correspond to a=28 and b=97 (since 100*28 + 97 = 2897).

4. The correct sum of roots r1 + r2 is indeed -5 + (-14/3) = -29/3, which when expressed as a reduced fraction gives a=29, b=3. However, neither answer matches this correct result (100*29 + 3 = 2903).

5. Both the ground truth (405) and proposed answer (2897) are incorrect, but they are also different from each other.

Since the proposed answer (2897) is not equivalent to the ground truth answer (405), and neither is correct, the correct response is:

<<<False>>>
