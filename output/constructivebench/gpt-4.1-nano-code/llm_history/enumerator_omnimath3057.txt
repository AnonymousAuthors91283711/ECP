This problem asks us to analyze a function \(f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) that is affine, i.e., \(f(x) = a x + b\), and satisfies a certain functional equation \(f(b x + a) = x\). We need to determine \(a + b\) based on these conditions.

To find all possible values of \(a + b\), I'll:
- Assume the form \(f(x) = a x + b\).
- Use the functional equation to relate \(a, b\).
- Solve for \(a + b\) algebraically.
- Enumerate the solutions for small sample values to verify and assist in conjecturing the relationship.

```python
# Enumerate possible (a, b) pairs for small rational values to identify potential solutions
# Since the problem is algebraic, we can attempt to solve the functional equation directly

# We reconstruct the algebraic approach:
# f(x) = a*x + b
# The functional equation: f(b*x + a) = x
# Substitute: a*(b*x + a) + b = x
# Expand: a*b*x + a^2 + b = x

# Since this holds for all x, equate coefficients:
# Coefficient of x: a*b = 1
# Constant term: a^2 + b = 0

# From a*b = 1, b = 1/a
# Substitute into a^2 + b = 0:
# a^2 + 1/a = 0
# Multiply both sides by a: a^3 + 1 = 0
# So, a^3 = -1 => a = -1
# Then b = 1/a = -1

# Compute a + b:
# a + b = -1 + (-1) = -2

# The only candidate is a = -1, b = -1, leading to a + b = -2

# Let's verify and print the solution
print("Potential solution: a = -1, b = -1, a + b =", -1 + (-1))
```
