This problem involves finding the maximum sum of digits in the decimal representation of 25 times a number N, where N ranges from 1,000,000 to 10,000,000. To assist with conjecture, we'll enumerate the values of s = sum of digits in 25 * N for representative N's within the given interval, focusing on key points (e.g., N near the bounds, N that are multiples of certain values) and attempt to find the greatest observed digit sum.

The solution will:
- Define a range of N's within the limits.
- Compute sum of digits of 25 * N for each.
- Print each value immediately as computed.
- Keep track of the maximum value.
- Output the maximum at the end, fulfilling the problem's enumerative and streaming criteria.

```python
def sum_of_digits(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

max_digits_sum = 0
max_N = None

# Sample points: start, end, middle, multiples of 10, 100, 1000 etc.
sample_points = [1_000_000, 5_500_000, 10_000_000, 1_000_000 + 1, 5_000_000, 10_000_000 - 1]

for N in sample_points:
    value = 25 * N
    s = sum_of_digits(value)
    print(f'N = {N}, 25*N = {value}, sum of digits = {s}')  # Streaming output
    if s > max_digits_sum:
        max_digits_sum = s
        max_N = N

# Additional exploration: check N towards the upper bound in steps
for N in range(9_900_000, 10_000_001, 1000):
    value = 25 * N
    s = sum_of_digits(value)
    print(f'N = {N}, 25*N = {value}, sum of digits = {s}')
    if s > max_digits_sum:
        max_digits_sum = s
        max_N = N

# Output the maximum found
print(f"Maximum sum of digits found: {max_digits_sum} (at N = {max_N})")
```
