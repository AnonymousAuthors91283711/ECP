2. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The pattern suggests that S contains elements with a certain divisibility and gcd property. To fulfill the unique t condition with gcd d, the set S likely contains consecutive integers starting from 1, as this pattern satisfies the divisibility and gcd uniqueness. Thus, the set S's cardinality is 1 for the minimal set satisfying the criterion, or could be larger for more complex sets. Since the question asks for a closed-form answer set with the key property, and the answer set is in Set ℕ, the simplest and consistent choice is {1, 2}, which satisfies gcd and divisibility conditions more generally.
