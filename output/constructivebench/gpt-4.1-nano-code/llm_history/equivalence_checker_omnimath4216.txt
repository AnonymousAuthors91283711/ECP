Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {n : ℕ | n = 1 ∨ n = 3}
<<<None>>>

Since the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's intentionally left undefined in Lean), we cannot verify whether the proposed answer {n : ℕ | n = 1 ∨ n = 3} is equivalent to the ground truth. The problem asks about numbers whose squares have all odd digits, and while 1 (1²=1) and 3 (3²=9) satisfy this condition, we cannot confirm whether these are the only solutions without the ground truth.
