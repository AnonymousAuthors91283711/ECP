This problem involves enumerating 5-element subsets of the set {3, 4, ..., 99} with specific conditions: all elements are odd and greater than 2; the subset size is 5; and their product equals a 4-digit number of a specific form: 10000a + 1000b + 10a + b, with a and b as digits, and a ≠ 0, a ≠ b. Given constraints, only odd numbers greater than 2 are considered, i.e., the odd numbers from 3 up to 99.

The key points:
- Elements are odd, >2 in [3..99]
- |s|=5
- Product equals 10000a + 1000b + 10a + b
- a ≠ 0, a ≠ b, a,b ∈ [1..9]

We'll:
- Generate all 5-element subsets meeting the criteria.
- Compute their product.
- Check if the product matches the pattern for some digit pair (a,b).
- For each match, print the subset and the corresponding number.

Let's write a streamlined enumeration in Python.

```python
from itertools import combinations
import math

# Generate all odd numbers > 2 up to 99
numbers = [n for n in range(3, 100, 2)]

results = []

# Generate all 5-element subsets
for subset in combinations(numbers, 5):
    product = math.prod(subset)
    # Check for possible (a, b)
    for a in range(1, 10):
        for b in range(1, 10):
            if a != 0 and a != b:
                val = 10000 * a + 1000 * b + 10 * a + b
                if product == val:
                    # Output the subset and pattern match
                    print(f'Subset: {sorted(subset)}, product: {product} = {val} (a={a}, b={b})')
                    results.append((subset, val))
```
