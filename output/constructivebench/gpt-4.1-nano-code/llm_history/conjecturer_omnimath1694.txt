. Enumerated answers: Prime p satisfying P: 23
Prime p satisfying P: 29
p1 = 23, p2 = 29, sum = 52. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the enumeration, the pattern suggests the primes satisfying P are 23 and 29, with their sum being 52. Since the question asks for a closed form and the sum of these primes, the natural conjecture is that the answer is the sum of the specific primes found. 

Thus, the target sum, based on the enumerations, is 52, which is the sum of 23 and 29.
