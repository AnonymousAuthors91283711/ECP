The problem appears to involve an equation with exponential and logarithmic expressions on the real numbers, with the goal of solving for \(x\). Our task is to find the value of \(x\) that satisfies the equation:
\[
2^{\frac{\log(x^2)}{\log 10}} = 3 \cdot 2^{1 + \frac{\log x}{\log 10}} + 16
\]
assuming \(x > 0\).

Let's analyze the equation step-by-step:

1. Recall that \(\log\) is base 10. So:
\[
\log x^2 = 2 \log x
\]
2. The left side becomes:
\[
2^{\frac{2 \log x}{\log 10}} = 2^{2 \frac{\log x}{\log 10}}
\]
3. Write:
\[
a = \frac{\log x}{\log 10} \Rightarrow x = 10^a
\]
which simplifies the equation to:
\[
2^{2a} = 3 \times 2^{1 + a} + 16
\]
4. Re-express:
\[
2^{2a} = 3 \cdot 2^{1 + a} + 16
\]
Note \(2^{2a} = (2^a)^2\), and \(2^{1 + a} = 2 \times 2^a\).

Set \(y = 2^a > 0\), then:
\[
y^2 = 3 \times 2 \times y + 16
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
y^2 = 6 y + 16
\]
5. Rearranged:
\[
y^2 - 6 y - 16 = 0
\]
6. Solve quadratic:
\[
y = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4 \times 1 \times (-16)}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 + 64}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2}
\]
\[
y = \frac{6 \pm 10}{2}
\]
which gives:
- \(y = \frac{6 + 10}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8\)
- \(y = \frac{6 - 10}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2\)

Since \(y = 2^a > 0\), discard the negative root:
\[
y = 8
\]

Now:
\[
2^a = 8 \Rightarrow a = \log_{2} 8 = 3
\]

Recalling \(a = \frac{\log x}{\log 10}\):
\[
\frac{\log x}{\log 10} = 3 \Rightarrow \log x = 3 \log 10 \Rightarrow x = 10^{3} = 1000
\]

**Answer:**

```python
# Enumerate candidate solutions for x to verify and confirm the solution
# Since the algebra suggests a unique positive solution, we confirm x=1000.

solutions = []

# Parameter a from the derivation:
a_candidates = [3]  # derived from solving quadratic: y=8 => a=log2(8)=3

for a in a_candidates:
    x = 10 ** a
    # Verify if x > 0 and satisfy the original equation within a small tolerance
    left = 2 ** (2 * a)  # from original form
    right = 3 * 2 ** (1 + a) + 16
    if abs(left - right) < 1e-9:
        print(f"x = {x}")
        solutions.append(x)

# Output the found solution(s)
for sol in solutions:
    print(f"Solution: x = {sol}")
```
