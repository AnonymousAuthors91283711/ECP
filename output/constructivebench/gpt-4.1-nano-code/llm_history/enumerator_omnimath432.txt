The problem appears to define a function `omnimath432_answer` over pairs of natural numbers, specifically with parameters `a` and `b`. The theorem states that the value of `omnimath432_answer (a, b)` corresponds with the least element of a certain set involving solutions to a linear Diophantine equation and sum, given specific `a` and `b`.

Given `a = 221` and `b = 403`, the set consists of `n = x + y` where `x` and `y` are natural numbers satisfying `x * b = y * a`.  

This equation simplifies to `x * 403 = y * 221`. The goal is to find all pairs `(x, y)` with `x, y ≥ 0` that satisfy this, then for each pair, compute `n = x + y`. We want the least such `n`.  

Since `a` and `b` are fixed, we can find the common solutions by analyzing the ratio:

`x / y = a / b = 221 / 403`.

The general solutions are when `x` and `y` are proportional to `221` and `403`, i.e.,

`x = k * 221`,  
`y = k * 403`, for `k ∈ ℕ`.

Then:

`n = x + y = k * (221 + 403) = k * 624`.

The smallest `k ≥ 1` gives the minimal positive `n`:

`k=1`, so:
`n = 624`.

So the least `n` occurs at `k=1`, with:

`x = 221`,  
`y = 403`,  
`n = 624`.

Now, to find the smallest possible `n`, considering the possibility of `k=0`. But at `k=0`, `x=0`, `y=0`, sum `0`, which still satisfies `0 * b = 0 = 0 * a`, so `n=0` is also in the set.

Looking back at the definitions: it appears the set includes all `n` where there exist `x,y ∈ ℕ` with `x * b = y * a`, and `n = x + y`.

- For `x=0`, `y=0`, then `n=0`. Since `x=y=0` satisfies `x*b= y*a=0`, zero is in the set.  
- For the minimal positive solution, `k=1`, we get `n=624`.  

Hence, the minimal `n` in the set is zero.

But the problem states `∃ (x : ℕ), ∃ (y : ℕ)`, which includes zero, so zero is valid.

Thus, the least `n` is **0**.

**Python code implementation:**

```python
# Find the minimal n = x + y with x*b = y*a, x, y ≥ 0 for fixed a=221, b=403
# The solutions are x= k*221, y= k*403, n= k*(221+403)=k*624
# Minimal n is at k=0, which gives n=0

# Generate the minimum answer
def omnimath432_answer(a_b):
    a, b = a_b
    # The minimal n corresponding to k=0
    return 0

print(omnimath432_answer((221, 403)))
```
