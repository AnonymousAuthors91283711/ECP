Approximate minimal sum of squares: 6.0
Candidate solutions achieving this minimum:
(-1.0, -1.0, 2.0)
(-1.0, 2.0, -1.0)
(2.0, -1.0, -1.0). Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the solutions, the minimal sum of squares is 6.0, achieved when (a, b, c) ∈ {(-1, -1, 2), (-1, 2, -1), (2, -1, -1)}. These are symmetric permutations of the vector (-1, -1, 2). Therefore, the sum of squares is minimized exactly at the sum of squares of these permutations, which is 6.0. Since the problem asks for the least possible x, it is 6.0. 

Final in Lean expression:

<<<6.0>>>
