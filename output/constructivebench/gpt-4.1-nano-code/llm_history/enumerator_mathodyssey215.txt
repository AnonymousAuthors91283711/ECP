This problem involves solving the equation √(x^2 + 2x -6) = √(x^2 -14). To explore solutions, we will systematically test a range of x values, check where the equality holds, and note the solutions. Since the question asks for an approach to help conjecture the answer, we will enumerate possible solutions for various x and observe when the expressions are equal.

```python
import math

# Define the range to search for solutions
search_range = range(-20, 21)

# Store candidate solutions
solutions = []

for x in search_range:
    expr_left = math.sqrt(x**2 + 2*x - 6)
    expr_right = math.sqrt(x**2 - 14)
    # Check for real solutions inside the domain of both square roots
    if x**2 - 14 >= 0:  # domain of second sqrt
        if math.isclose(expr_left, expr_right, rel_tol=1e-9, abs_tol=1e-9):
            solutions.append(x)
            print(f"x = {x} is a solution (approximate).")

# Output all solutions found
print("Candidates for solutions:", solutions)
```
