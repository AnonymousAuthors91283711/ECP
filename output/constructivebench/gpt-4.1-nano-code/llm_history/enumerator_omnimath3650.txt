The problem involves finding the number of pairs `(a, b)` of positive integers such that their GCD and LCM meet specific conditions involving the numbers from 1 to 50. Specifically:

- `gcd(a, b) = ∏_{i=1}^{50} i`
- `lcm(a, b) = ∏_{i=1}^{50} i^2`

Given the constraints, since `a, b > 0`, and these are related via gcd and lcm, careful analysis reveals that:

- The gcd divides both `a` and `b`.
- The product gcd * lcm should equal `a * b`.
- The values involve large products, so direct enumeration over all possibilities up to `lcm` or `gcd` is necessary.

To efficiently find all such pairs, I will:

- Compute the `gcd_value` (product of 1..50).
- Compute the `lcm_value` (product of i^2 for i in 1..50).
- Enumerate all divisors of `lcm_value`.
- For each divisor `d`, check if `d` divides `lcm_value` and whether `gcd_value` divides both `d` and `lcm_value/d`.
- Count pairs `(a, b)` where `gcd(a, b) = gcd_value` and `lcm(a, b) = lcm_value`.

Since direct enumeration can be large, we will limit the outer loops as much as possible and directly check only relevant divisors.

Below is the code following these considerations.

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

# Compute the product of integers from 1 to 50
def product_range(start, end):
    result = 1
    for i in range(start, end + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

gcd_value = product_range(1, 50)
lcm_value = product_range(1, 50)**2

# Function to get all divisors of a number
def get_divisors(n):
    divisors = set()
    i = 1
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.add(i)
            divisors.add(n // i)
        i += 1
    return sorted(divisors)

# Enumerate divisors of lcm_value
divisors = get_divisors(lcm_value)

count = 0

# For each divisor d of lcm_value, check if it can be gcd of the pair
for d in divisors:
    if gcd_value % d != 0:
        continue
    m = lcm_value // d
    if m % gcd_value != 0:
        continue
    # Now, check if gcd_value == gcd(d, m)
    if gcd(d, m) == gcd_value:
        count += 1
        print(f"Pair candidates with gcd={d} and lcm={m}")

# Output total count of such pairs
print("Total pairs:", count)
```
