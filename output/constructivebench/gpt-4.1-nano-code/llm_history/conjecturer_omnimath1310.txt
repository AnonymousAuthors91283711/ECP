Potential minimal m: 6
Answer (minimal m satisfying P): 6. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on pattern analysis, f(n) relates to the number of prime factors of n (counting multiplicities). For minimal m, f(n) stabilizes at the maximum prime multiplicity encountered up to n, which is 2 for 12, 18, 24, etc. The minimal m satisfying P is thus the maximum f(n) observed, which is 6 for n=24. Therefore, omnimath1310_answer = 6.
