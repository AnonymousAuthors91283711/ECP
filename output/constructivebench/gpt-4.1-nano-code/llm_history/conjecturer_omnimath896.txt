The pattern suggests the maximum occurs at the boundary when x=y, leading to the expression x^2 + xy + 2y^2 with the constraint x^2 - xy + 2y^2=8. Setting x=y yields the maximum value as x^2 + x^2 + 2x^2=4x^2, with x satisfying 0 to satisfy the constraint.

From the constraint: x^2 - x^2 + 2x^2=8 → 2x^2=8 → x^2=4 → x=2 (since x>0). Then the maximum is 4x^2=4*4=16.

Thus, the maxima when x=y=2 give the maximum value 16.
