noncomputable abbrev omnimath3350_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3350 :
  2 * Real.sqrt (1.5 + Real.sqrt 2) - (1.5 + Real.sqrt 2) = omnimath3350_answer :=
sorry
. Enumerated answers: For a=0.5, b=1.0: sqrt(1.5 + sqrt(2)) ≈ 1.707107, expression ≈ 0.500000
For a=1.0, b=0.5: sqrt(1.5 + sqrt(2)) ≈ 1.707107, expression ≈ 0.500000. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern indicates the expression evaluates to a constant around 0.5, independent of parameters a and b. The simplification hints that the expression simplifies to 1/2 exactly.
