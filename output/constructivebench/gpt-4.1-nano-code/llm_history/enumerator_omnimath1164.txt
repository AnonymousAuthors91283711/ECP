Let's analyze the problem:

- It involves finding the greatest natural number \( n \) such that there's a Finset \( p \subseteq \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \) with certain properties.
- \( p \) is pairwise disjoint, and all pairs \((x,y)\) satisfy \( x,y \in [0, 100] \), with \( x \neq y \).
- For each pair \((x,y)\), the inequalities \( x \geq y/2 + 7 \) and \( y \geq x/2 + 7 \) hold.
- The goal is to find the maximum size \( n = |p| \).

Given the constraints, the crucial part is to identify all pairs \((x,y)\) within range [0,100] that satisfy:
\[
x \geq \frac{y}{2} + 7,\quad y \geq \frac{x}{2} + 7.
\]

This creates a mutual constraint that both inequalities must hold simultaneously.

To find the maximum number of such disjoint pairs, we can:

- Generate all pairs \((x,y)\) with \( x,y \in [0,100] \), \( x \neq y \), satisfying the inequalities.
- Use a greedy approach to select the largest subset of pairwise disjoint pairs from this set.

Below, the code enumerates all valid pairs, then greedily selects the maximum number of disjoint pairs by iterating over sorted pairs.

```python
# Generate all pairs (x,y) with specific inequalities
# Select maximum disjoint pairs greedily
# Output the maximum size found

def main():
    RANGE = range(101)
    pairs = []

    # Find all pairs satisfying the inequalities
    for x in RANGE:
        for y in RANGE:
            if x != y:
                # Check inequalities
                if x >= y / 2 + 7 and y >= x / 2 + 7:
                    pairs.append((x, y))
    print(f"Total pairs satisfying inequalities: {len(pairs)}")
    # Greedy selection for maximum disjoint pairs
    pairs.sort(key=lambda p: max(p))
    chosen = []
    used_x = set()
    used_y = set()

    for x, y in pairs:
        if x not in used_x and y not in used_y:
            # Add pair and mark as used
            chosen.append((x, y))
            used_x.add(x)
            used_y.add(y)
            print(f"Selected pair: ({x}, {y})")
    print(f"Maximum number of disjoint pairs: {len(chosen)}")
    # The maximum size is the answer
    # Optionally, store this as the answer
    omnimath1164_answer = len(chosen)
