theorem P2012AMCB_4 : 
  let euroToDollar := 1.3
  let dianaDollars := 500
  let etienneEuros := 400
  let etienneDollars := etienneEuros * euroToDollar
  100 * (etienneDollars - dianaDollars) / dianaDollars = P2012AMCB_4_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 4.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Since etienneDollars = 400 * 1.3 = 520, the difference (520 - 500) = 20, and (100 * 20)/500 = 4.0. The answer is the proportional change, which is 4 in decimal form. 

<<<4.0>>>
