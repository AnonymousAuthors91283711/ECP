. Enumerated answers: a(4) = 15.333333333333334. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests the sequence involves powers and nested roots, leading to a constant sum after the initial terms. Given the enumerated value 15.333..., and analyzing the pattern, the closed-form answer is the sum of a geometric series converging after initial terms, which simplifies to a specific rational value. 

<<<15 + 1/3>>>
