. Enumerated answers: (2, 4, 6). Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ × ℝ × ℝ)
The clues suggest a unique real triplet solution satisfying cyclical polynomial relations. Based on the pattern in enumerations, the set simplifies to the singleton containing the specific triplet (2, 4, 6). 

Thus, the answer set is the singleton { (2, 4, 6) }.
