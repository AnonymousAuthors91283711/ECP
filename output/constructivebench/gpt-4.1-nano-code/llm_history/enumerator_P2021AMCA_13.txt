The problem involves finding the maximum real part of a complex function \( z^5 \) on a specified set of complex points. The goal is to evaluate or compare the real parts of \( z^5 \) for each candidate \(z\) in the set and determine which one maximizes this real part.

Since the set includes specific points \(-\sqrt{3} + i\), \(-1\), \(i\), \(\sqrt{3} + i\), and \(2\), a straightforward approach is to evaluate \( (z^5).re \) for each explicitly, then compare these values to find the maximum.

The Python program below:
- Defines each candidate explicitly.
- Computes \(z^5\) for each.
- Extracts the real part, prints it immediately upon calculation.
- Tracks and displays the maximum real part value and corresponding \(z\).

This approach aligns with the constraints: outputs each candidate's value as computed, and explicitly identifies the maximum at the end.

```python
# Python program to evaluate z^5 for each candidate in the set and find the maximum real part

import math
import cmath

# Define the candidate complex numbers
candidates = [
    (-math.sqrt(3)) + 1j,
    -1 + 0j,
    0 + 1j,
    math.sqrt(3) + 1j,
    2 + 0j
]

max_real = -float('inf')
max_z = None

for z in candidates:
    z_pow_5 = z ** 5
    real_part = z_pow_5.real
    # Print the candidate and its z^5 real part immediately
    print(f"z = {z}, z^5 = {z_pow_5}, real part = {real_part}")
    if real_part > max_real:
        max_real = real_part
        max_z = z

print(f"\nMaximum real part is {max_real} achieved at z = {max_z}")
```
