The problem seems related to a set of functions \(a: \{0,1,2,3\} \to \mathbb{R}\) satisfying recurrence relations: \(a_2 = a_1 + a_0\) and \(a_3 = a_2 + a_1\). We want to analyze the maximum of \(\cos(a_0) - \cos(a_3)\) over functions meeting these conditions, where \(a(n)\) can be expressed as a quadratic polynomial \(A n^2 + B n + C\) fitting certain cosine values.

Since the problem involves cosine and quadratic polynomials, a straightforward approach is to sample small parameter values \(A, B, C\), check the relations, compute the corresponding \(\cos(a_0) - \cos(a_3)\), and keep track of maximum and minimum values found, streaming answers immediately when an extremum is identified.

Given the constraints, we choose small integer/small float ranges for \(A, B, C\), evaluate \(a(0)\) and \(a(3)\), compute \(\cos\) difference, and print each candidate result.

Here's the Python code to enumerate possible answers for this problem:

```python
import math

# Define small ranges for A, B, C
A_range = [-1, 0, 1]
B_range = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]
C_range = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]

max_diff = -math.inf
min_diff = math.inf

# Store candidates to show later
candidates = []

for A in A_range:
    for B in B_range:
        for C in C_range:
            # Compute a(0) and a(3)
            a0 = C
            a3 = A*9 + 3*B + C  # a(3) = A*3^2 + B*3 + C

            # Compute cosine difference
            diff = math.cos(a0) - math.cos(a3)

            # Save candidate
            candidates.append((a0, a3, diff))
            print(f"Candidate a0={a0:.2f}, a3={a3:.2f}, diff={diff:.4f}")

            # Track extremal values
            if diff > max_diff:
                max_diff = diff
            if diff < min_diff:
                min_diff = diff

# Print extremal answers
print(f"\nMaximum difference: {max_diff:.4f}")
print(f"Minimum difference: {min_diff:.4f}")
```
