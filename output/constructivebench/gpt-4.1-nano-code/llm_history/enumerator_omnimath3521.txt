The given code is from Lean mathlib, involving sets, functions, and natural numbers. It defines a noncomputable function `r(S, n)` that counts pairs `(p.1, p.2)` in `S Ã— S` with constraints: distinct elements summing to `n`. The goal seems related to exploring pair sums in sets, perhaps for a conjecture involving sums of two elements.

To assist in conjecturing and proving, we'd enumerate sets `S` with elements up to some small limit, compute the values of `r(S, n)` for various `n`, and see the pattern or extremal values. Since no specific problem is given, we'll generate small sets and compute `r(S, n)` for various `n`.

Here's a Python program that:
- Defines a set `S` with elements 0 to 4,
- For each `n` from 0 to 8 (since max sum with small elements),
- Counts pairs `(a, b)` in `S` with `a != b` and `a + b = n`,
- Prints each result immediately for inspection.

This approach helps in empirical exploration.

```python
# Enumerate small sets of natural numbers and compute counts
S = list(range(5))  # elements 0 to 4
max_sum = 2 * max(S)  # maximum sum for pairs in S

for n in range(0, max_sum + 1):
    count = 0
    for a in S:
        for b in S:
            if a != b and a + b == n:
                print(f"Sum {n}: pair ({a}, {b})")
                count += 1
    print(f"Total pairs with sum {n}: {count}")
```

This code exhaustively checks pairs in small set `S`, streaming answers as it finds them, illustrating the counts of pairs summing to various `n`.
