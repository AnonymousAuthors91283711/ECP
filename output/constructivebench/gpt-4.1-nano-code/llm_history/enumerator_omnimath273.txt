This problem seems to involve a sequence \(a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}\) satisfying a specific summation identity involving both sums of \(a\) and cubes of \(a\), parameterized by \(m\). The key condition is:

\[ 3 \left(\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} a(i)\right)^2 = \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} (a(i))^3 \quad \text{for all } 1 \le m \le n, \text{ with } n=2017. \]

Since the problem asks for \(a(1337)\), our goal is to infer possible values by testing small sequences and looking for patterns. Because the sums involve each \(a(i)\), and the relation holds for all prefixes up to \(n=2017\), the pattern of \(a(i)\) should be consistent across the sequence.

The code below will:

- Check small sequences of \(a(i)\) with plausible values.
- Verify the condition for all \(m\) up to a small limit \(m_{max}\) (say 20).
- Output all possible \(a(1337)\) candidates found in these sequences.

Given the problem's complexity, starting with small sequences and simple values like 1 or 0 will help keep the computation feasible. We won't hardcode answers but look for consistent sequences.

```python
# Enumerate small sequences of a(i) with values 0, 1, 2
# Verify the summation condition for prefix lengths up to m_max
# Record possible values of a(1337) if it appears in consistent sequences

from itertools import product

m_max = 20
max_sequence_length = 20
possible_a1337_values = set()

# Generate sequences of a(i) with values 0, 1, 2
for seq in product([0, 1, 2], repeat=max_sequence_length):
    # Check the condition for all m up to m_max
    valid = True
    sum_seq = 0
    for m in range(1, m_max+1):
        sum_seq += seq[m-1]
        left = 3 * (sum_seq ** 2)
        right = sum((x ** 3) for x in seq[:m])
        if left != right:
            valid = False
            break
    if valid:
        # Record a(1337) if within sequence length
        if len(seq) > 1337:
            possible_a1337_values.add(seq[1337])
        # Also consider sequences that are shorter but valid; cannot determine a(1337) then
        # So skip if sequence length insufficient
        elif len(seq) <= 1337:
            continue

# Since sequences are limited to length 20, no sequence includes index 1337
# But if we prepare since the problem asks for a possible answer of a(1337),
# we can check for sequences that could extend infinitely with constant pattern
# For demonstration, assume pattern 1's (or 0's) repeat indefinitely

# Generate repeating pattern of length 3 for possible infinite extension
for pattern in product([0,1,2], repeat=3):
    seq = list(pattern)
    # Try to extend pattern infinitely with the repeating cycle
    # Check the pattern's validity for initial m
    sum_seq = 0
    valid = True
    for m in range(1, m_max+1):
        sum_seq += seq[(m-1) % 3]
        left = 3 * (sum_seq ** 2)
        right = sum((x ** 3) for x in (seq * ((m)//3+1)))[:m]
        if left != right:
            valid = False
            break
    if valid:
        # Now pattern repeats infinitely
        # a(1337) would be seq[(1337-1) % 3]
        a1337 = seq[(1337-1)%3]
        possible_a1337_values.add(a1337)

# Print all candidate values
for val in sorted(possible_a1337_values):
    print(f"a(1337) = {val}")
```
