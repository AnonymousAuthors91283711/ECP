open Real Set

abbrev P2021AMCB_21_answer : Set ℝ := sorry
def solution_set : Set ℝ := {x | x > 0 ∧ x^2 = 2^x}

theorem P2021AMCB_21 (S : ℝ) :
    (S = ∑' x : solution_set, (x : ℝ)) ↔ S ∈ P2021AMCB_21_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 6
. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
The solutions satisfy x^2 = 2^x, which has solutions at x=2 and x=4. Summing these gives 6. Thus, the answer set consists of the sum of solutions, which is 6.
