abbrev omnimath3866_answer : ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3866 (f : ℝ → ℝ) (hf : ∀ x, f x > 0) :
  (∀ x y, x > 0 → y > 0 → f x * f y = 2 * f (x + y * f x)) ↔ f = omnimath3866_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing constant functions f(x) = c
Candidate constant f(x) = 2 matches the equation.

Testing linear functions f(x) = a + b * x

Testing square root function f(x) = sqrt(x). Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
Given the enumeration, the only candidate that matches is the constant function \(f(x) = 2\). The structure of the functional equation suggests that \(f\) is constant, satisfying \(f(x) = 2\).
