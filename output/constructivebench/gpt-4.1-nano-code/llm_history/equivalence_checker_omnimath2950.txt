Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: 24
To determine if the proposed answer of 24 is correct, let's solve the problem step by step.

Given:
1. r = b + 6
2. r/b = 5/3

Substitute r from h1 into h2:
(b + 6)/b = 5/3

Cross-multiply:
3(b + 6) = 5b
3b + 18 = 5b
18 = 2b
b = 9

Then r = b + 6 = 15

Thus r + b = 15 + 9 = 24

The proposed answer matches our calculation.

<<<True>>>
