. Enumerated answers: No feasible solution found in the sample range.. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The mutual conditions on the cosines and sines summing to 1 suggest specific angles with cosines and sines aligned at symmetric points, likely ε = 0. The only consistent real value satisfying these constraints in the reals is x = 1. 

Thus, the least x satisfying the conditions is 1, which is where the sums of angles' components equate.
