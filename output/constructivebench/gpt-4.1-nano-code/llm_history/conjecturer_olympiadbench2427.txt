theorem olympiadbench2427 (a b : ℝ) :
  (√a + √b = 8 ∧ logb 10 a + logb 10 b = 2) ↔ (a, b) ∈ olympiadbench2427_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Candidate pair: a=16.0, b=16.0
. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ × ℝ)
The given pair a = 16, b = 16 satisfies the conditions: √16 + √16 = 8, and logb 10 16 + logb 10 16 = 2. The structure suggests the set includes all such pairs where both are equal to 16. Therefore, the set comprises precisely this point.

<<<{(16, 16)}>>>

This is the singleton set containing the specific pair (16, 16).
