The problem involves symmetric combinatorial counting of handshakes among pairs (twins) and triplets, considering how many handshakes occur within each group. To find the total number of handshakes, we calculate the handshakes among twins and among triplets, then verify their sum.

We will enumerate possible integer values for the total handshakes step-by-step, verifying the values as we go. Since the expression is simplified, the critical step is to evaluate the total handshake count and verify the final sum after dividing by 2.

Here's a Python script that computes and streams each possible total handshake count based on these parameters:

```python
# Enumerate small values for twins and triplets to verify handshake counts
# For this problem, the parameters are:
# twins = 9 * 2 = 18
# triplets = 6 * 3 = 18

twins = 9 * 2
triplets = 6 * 3

# Calculate the internal handshake counts:
# twin_handshakes includes handshakes among twin pairs
twin_handshakes = 9 * (2 * (twins - 2) + 2 * (triplets // 2))
# triplet_handshakes includes handshakes among triplet groups
triplet_handshakes = 6 * (3 * (triplets - 3) + 3 * (twins // 2))

total_handshakes = (twin_handshakes + triplet_handshakes) // 2

print("Twin handshakes:", twin_handshakes)
print("Triplet handshakes:", triplet_handshakes)
print("Total handshakes (divided by 2):", total_handshakes)
# This should give the value for P2011AMCA_9_answer
```

Running this code will produce the precise handshake tally, stream the result, and adhere to the constraints. The calculation aligns with the algebraic form in the original theorem.
