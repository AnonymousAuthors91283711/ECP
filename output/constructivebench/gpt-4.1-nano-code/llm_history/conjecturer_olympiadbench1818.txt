  (olympiadbench1818_answer n) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Color count k=1 is feasible with at least one coloring.
Color count k=2 is feasible with at least one coloring.
Color count k=3 is feasible with at least one coloring.
Color count k=4 is feasible with at least one coloring.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
<<<fun n => 4>>>

Given the enumerations, for all n > 1, the maximum feasible color count is 4, as higher colorings are also possible.
