The comparison indicates the candidate n=7 maximizes the set condition with the given constraints. The pattern suggests a fixed n. The critical value derived from the formula involves n, 107+99n over 200, which is close to 3.5 when n=7. The answer after simplification is constant, independent of k, focusing on n's value. The pattern points toward n=7.
