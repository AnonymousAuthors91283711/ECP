This problem appears to involve analyzing factorials and their p-adic valuations at prime p=7, within the set of integers from 1 to 2004. The goal is to find how many integers n in [1,2004] satisfy that the 7-adic valuation of n! equals the 8-adic valuation of n!—which effectively reduces to identifying where these valuations are equal.

Since factorial valuations depend on prime powers dividing the factorial, and p-adic valuation v_p(n!) counts how many factors of p appear in n!, we focus on the equality v_7(n!) = v_8(n!). Noting that 8 = 2^3, the 8-adic valuation v_8(n!) equals the largest exponent e such that 8^e divides n!, i.e., e = v_8(n!).

But the key insight is that v_8(n!) counts the number of times 8 divides n!, which depends on powers of 2, not 7; Similarly, v_7(n!) counts factors of 7 in n!. Each of these valuations is computed by Legendre's formula, summing floor division results.

Given the problem, the equivalence v_7(n!) = v_8(n!).

Since v_8(n!) depends on powers of 2, and v_7(n!) on powers of 7, these valuations are equal only at their common value—probably zero for many n, but potentially larger at special points. To write the code efficiently, we'll compute these valuations for each n in [1,2004], then count how many satisfy the equality.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def v_p_factorial(n, p):
    """Compute the p-adic valuation of n!."""
    count = 0
    divisor = p
    while divisor <= n:
        count += n // divisor
        divisor *= p
    return count

max_n = 2004
answer = []

for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
    v7 = v_p_factorial(n, 7)
    v8 = v_p_factorial(n, 2) // 3  # v_8(n!) = v_2(n!) // 3
    if v7 == v8:
        answer.append(n)
        print(n)  # Stream output for each matching n

# To summarize, the answer is the count of such n:
print(f"Total count: {len(answer)}")
```
