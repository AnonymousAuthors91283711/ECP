Ground Truth Answer: {1, 100, 101, 201}
Proposed Answer: {100, 101, 201}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is mostly correct but missing the element 1, which should be included according to the ground truth answer. The problem statement allows for k=1 (0<k<202), and the condition holds for k=1 since the sum would be fract(n/202), which equals 1/2 when n=101 (as fract(101/202) = 1/2). Therefore, the proposed answer is incomplete.
