[write_program]
The problem seems to be about finding the minimal size \( n \) of a set of functions \( a : \text{Fin } n \to \mathbb{Q} \) satisfying certain positivity, sum, and reciprocal sum conditions. Given typical contest-level settings, it's common that such problems involve small configurations, possibly \( n = 3 \) or \( 4 \). To aid in conjecturing and proving the minimal \( n \), I'll write a program that enumerates possible \( n \) up to a small bound (say 5), and searches for functions meeting the given conditions. Since the constraints involve infinitely many solutions, I will focus on small, explicit candidates, especially rational solutions with small denominators, to find the minimal \( n \).

The code will:
- Iterate over \( n \) from 1 to 5.
- For each \( n \), generate a small set of rational functions with positive values.
- Check if they satisfy the sum and reciprocal sum conditions with their ranges in integers.
- Print viable solutions immediately upon discovery.

This approach helps in conjecturing the minimal \( n \).

```python
from itertools import product
from fractions import Fraction

# Set a small candidate range for rational values to test
candidate_values = [Fraction(i, j) for i in range(1, 4) for j in range(1, 4)]  # 1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 2/1, 2/2, 2/3, 3/1, 3/2, 3/3

# Function to check if all elements are positive
def all_positive(vec):
    return all(a > 0 for a in vec)

# Check for each n from 1 to 5
for n in range(1, 6):
    # Generate all possible functions a: Fin n -> rational candidates
    for a in product(candidate_values, repeat=n):
        # Check positivity
        if not all_positive(a):
            continue
        s = a
        sum_a = sum(a)
        inv_sum = sum(1 / a_i for a_i in a)
        # Check if sum_a and inv_sum are integers
        if sum_a.denominator == 1 and inv_sum.denominator == 1:
            sum_int = sum_a.numerator
            inv_sum_int = inv_sum.numerator
            # Since the problem states the sums are in the range (i.e., are integers), we accept
            print(f"Found for n={n}: a = {a}, sum = {sum_int}, reciprocal sum = {inv_sum_int}")
```
