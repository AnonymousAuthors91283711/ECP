This problem involves analyzing the function \(f(x) = (\sin x)^2 - 2 \sin x + 2\), to find its minimum and maximum values over all real \(x\). We want to find the least and greatest values of the set \(\{ y \mid y = (\sin x)^2 - 2 \sin x + 2 \}\) for \(x \in \mathbb{R}\).

The key steps:
1. Express \(f(x)\) in terms of \(s = \sin x\), since \(\sin x\) ranges between -1 and 1.
2. Therefore, the problem reduces to analyzing \(f(s) = s^2 - 2s + 2\) for \(s \in [-1, 1]\).
3. Find critical points of \(f(s)\) or analyze the endpoints to determine the min and max over \([-1, 1]\).

Analyzing \(f(s) = s^2 - 2s + 2\):

- It is a parabola opening upward.
- Derivative: \(f'(s) = 2s - 2\).
- Critical point at \(f'(s) = 0 \Rightarrow s = 1\).
- At \(s = 1\), \(f(1) = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1\).
- At \(s = -1\), \(f(-1) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5\).
- \(f(s)\) at the endpoint \(s = -1\) is 5, at \(s = 1\) is 1.

Since the parabola opens upward, the minimum over \([-1, 1]\) occurs at the vertex \(s=1\), and the maximum at the endpoint \(s=-1\).

**Answer:**
- Least value: \(f(1) = 1\), achieved when \(\sin x = 1\).
- Greatest value: \(f(-1) = 5\), achieved when \(\sin x = -1\).

We conclude the set's least element is 1, greatest element is 5.

```python
# Enumerate over s in [-1, 1], critical point at s=1 (minimum), endpoint s=-1 (maximum)
# The extremal values are f(1) = 1 and f(-1) = 5.
# Corresponding x values: sin x = 1 => x = pi/2, and sin x = -1 => x = 3pi/2 + 2kÏ€
# For simplicity, just print the answer pair.

# Since the problem asks for the set's extremal values, give the exact answers.
min_value = 1  # at sin x = 1
max_value = 5  # at sin x = -1

print(f"Least value: {min_value}")
print(f"Greatest value: {max_value}")
```
