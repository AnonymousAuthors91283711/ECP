The problem involves evaluating the expression (20 + 16 * 20) / (20 * 16) and determining its value. Since the expression is straightforward, the primary goal is to compute this value precisely and possibly verify different candidates if the problem wants enumeration of answers.

Here's a Python script that calculates this exactly, streams the answer, and shows how to consider potential variations if needed:

```python
# Python program to evaluate the given mathematical expression
# and stream exact rational answer.

from fractions import Fraction

# Given parameters
a, b = 20, 16

# Compute numerator and denominator
numerator = a + b * a
denominator = a * b

# Compute the exact rational result
result = Fraction(numerator, denominator)

# Print the result immediately
print("Answer:", result)
```
