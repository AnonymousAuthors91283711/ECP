This problem seems to involve a multinomial probability calculation, with parameters p_A, p_M, p_C and counts k = [3, 2, 1], total n = 6. The formula appears to be the multinomial probability mass function:

\[ \frac{n!}{k_1! k_2! k_3!} p_A^{k_1} p_M^{k_2} p_C^{k_3} \]

Given the probabilities, we want to enumerate all possible solutions or compare possible probability values. 

To assist, we'll create a Python script that:
- Sets the known parameters.
- Enumerates the probability values p_A, p_M, p_C within their possible ranges.
- Calculates the binomial coefficients and probabilities.
- Prints out the exact values to help in conjecture.

Since the question specifies small sample values, we can focus on the fixed probability values already given, and compute the multinomial PMF directly.

```python
import math

def multinomial_prob(n, ks, ps):
    """
    Compute the multinomial probability:
    (n! / (k1! k2! ... km!)) * p1^k1 * p2^k2 * ... * pm^km
    """
    coeff = math.factorial(n)
    for k in ks:
        coeff /= math.factorial(k)
    prob = 1.0
    for p, k in zip(ps, ks):
        prob *= p ** k
    return coeff * prob

# Known parameters
p_A = 1/2
p_M = 2 * (1 - p_A) / 3  # = 2 * (1 - 0.5) / 3 = 2 * 0.5 / 3 = 1/3
p_C = (1 - p_A) / 3      # = 0.5 / 3 = 1/6
n = 6
k_counts = [3, 2, 1]
p_values = [p_A, p_M, p_C]

# Compute the probability
result = multinomial_prob(n, k_counts, p_values)
print(f"Multinomial PMF with p_A={p_A}, p_M={p_M}, p_C={p_C} and counts {k_counts} is {result}")
```
