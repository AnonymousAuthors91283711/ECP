This problem appears to involve a weighted average calculation related to students' scores. Given the initial and final average scores, the total number of students, and an unknown score (the answer) representing a particular student's score, the goal is likely to find that student's score, assuming the overall average score changed from 80 to 81.

The equation:

initial_avg * (students - 1) + answer = final_avg * students

For an exact solution, we solve for `answer`:

answer = final_avg * students - initial_avg * (students - 1)

To assist in conjecturing, I'll write a program that enumerates possible `answer` values for small sample values, checking if the division yields an integer score. Since the problem seems straightforward, I'll demonstrate enumeration over a range around the computed value, to find plausible candidate scores.

```python
# Enumerate possible answers for the student's score based on the given averages and student count
students = 15
initial_avg = 80
final_avg = 81

# Compute the expected answer analytically
expected_answer = final_avg * students - initial_avg * (students - 1)

# We search around the expected answer to see all plausible integral scores
for candidate in range(expected_answer - 2, expected_answer + 3):
    total_score = initial_avg * (students - 1) + candidate
    # Check if total_score divided by students is exactly final_avg
    if total_score % students == 0:
        print(candidate)
```
