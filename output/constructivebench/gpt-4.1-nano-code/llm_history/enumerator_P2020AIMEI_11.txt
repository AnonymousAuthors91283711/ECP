This problem involves enumerating all integer triples (a, b, c) with |a|, |b|, |c| ≤ 10, for which there exists an integer d such that the quadratic functions f(x) = x^2 + a x + b and g(x) = x^2 + c x + d satisfy g(f(2)) = 0 and g(f(4)) = 0. We need to find the value of P2020AIMEI_11_answer (probably the count of such triples).

Let's analyze the constraints:
- f(x) produces outputs: f(2), f(4)
- g must satisfy g(f(2))=0, g(f(4))=0
- g(x) = x^2 + c x + d; so g(t) = 0 at t=f(2) and t=f(4)

Since g(t) = t^2 + c t + d, and g(t1)=g(t2)=0, then the roots of g are t=f(2) and t=f(4).

Thus,
g(t) = (t - f(2))*(t - f(4)) = t^2 - (f(2)+f(4)) t + f(2) * f(4)

Matching with g(t)= t^2 + c t + d:
- c = -(f(2) + f(4))
- d = f(2) * f(4)

Now,

f(2)= 4 + 2a + b
f(4)= 16 + 4a + b

Require |a|, |b|, |c| ≤ 10, with c and d as above.

Compute c and d in terms of a and b:

c = -(f(2) + f(4))
= -[(4 + 2a + b) + (16 + 4a + b)]
= - [20 + 6a + 2b]
= -20 - 6a - 2b

d = f(2) * f(4):
= (4 + 2a + b)*(16 + 4a + b)

Expanding:

= 4*16 + 4*4a + 4b + 2a*16 + 2a*4a + 2a*b + b*16 + b*4a + b^2

= 64 + 16a + 4b + 32a + 8a^2 + 2a b + 16 b + 4 a b + b^2

Combine like terms:

d = 64 + (16a + 32a) + (4b + 16b) + 8a^2 + (2a b + 4a b) + b^2

= 64 + 48a + 20b + 8a^2 + 6a b + b^2

Now, the key is that

- c = -20 - 6a - 2b, with |c| ≤ 10
- d = as above, with |d| ≤ 10

We can iterate over all integer a, b in [-10,10], compute c and d, check if |c| and |d| ≤ 10, and count how many such triples exist.

Let's implement this approach.

```python
# Enumerator to find all (a, b, c, d) satisfying the constraints
count = 0
for a in range(-10, 11):
    for b in range(-10, 11):
        c = -20 - 6*a - 2*b
        d = 64 + 48*a + 20*b + 8*a*a + 6*a*b + b*b
        if abs(c) <= 10 and abs(d) <= 10:
            print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}")
            count += 1
print(f"Total valid triples: {count}")
```

This code enumerates all possible (a, b) within bounds, computes c and d, and filters those meeting the magnitude constraints. It prints each valid quadruple as found, aligning with the streaming requirement and allowing to conjecture the count or examine specific solutions.
