theorem olympiadbench2544 (a b : ℕ) :
  0 < a ∧ a < b ∧ Real.sqrt a + Real.sqrt b = Real.sqrt 50 ↔ (a, b) ∈ olympiadbench2544_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: (a=2, b=32) with sqrt_a=1.4142, sqrt_b=5.6569 sums to 7.071068
(a=8, b=18) with sqrt_a=2.8284, sqrt_b=4.2426 sums to 7.071068. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ)
<<< {(a, b) | 8 ≤ a ∧ a < b ∧ b = 50 - a} >>>
