The problem asks to find the minimal value of \(z = x^2 + 16 y^2\) subject to the linear constraint \(3x + 4 y = 10\). The enumerated data suggests the minimum occurs at \(x=3, y=0.25\), resulting in \(z=10.0\). 

Analytically, we are minimizing \(x^2 + 16 y^2\) constrained by \(3x + 4 y = 10\). From the linear constraint, \(y = \frac{10-3x}{4}\), substituting into the quadratic:

\[
z = x^2 + 16 \left(\frac{10 - 3x}{4}\right)^2 = x^2 + 16 \cdot \frac{(10 - 3x)^2}{16} = x^2 + (10 - 3x)^2
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
z = x^2 + 100 - 60x + 9x^2 = 10x^2 - 60x + 100
\]

Differentiating:

\[
\frac{d z}{dx} = 20x - 60 = 0 \implies x = 3
\]

At \(x=3\), \(y = \frac{10 - 3 \cdot 3}{4} = \frac{10 - 9}{4} = 0.25\), consistent with the enumeration. Substituting back:

\[
z = 10 \cdot 3^2 - 60 \cdot 3 + 100 = 10 \cdot 9 - 180 + 100 = 90 - 180 + 100 = 10
\]

Thus, the minimal \(z\) value is 10, achieved at \(x=3, y=0.25\).

In Lean, the answer should be a closed-form real number representing this minimum:

<<<10>>>

This is a closed-form, general, and correct minimal value of \(z\). The previous candidate with division errors is not necessary; the minimal value is simply 10.
