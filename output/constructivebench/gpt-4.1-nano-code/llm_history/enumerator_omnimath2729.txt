This problem involves finding the value of \( x \) such that \(\frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{x}\). To analyze and verify the solution, I'll write a Python script that:
- Enumerates potential \( x \) values systematically,
- Checks for the exact equality \(\frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{x}\),
- Reports the exact solution without hardcoding.

Given the fractions involved, the solution for \( x \) is straightforward algebraically: 

\[
\frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{2}{6} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

So, \( \frac{1}{x} = \frac{1}{2} \Rightarrow x = 2 \).

The script will confirm this by enumeration.

```python
# Enumerate x values and find exact solutions for 1/6 + 1/3 = 1/x
results = []
for x in range(1, 11):  # small range for efficiency
    lhs = 1/6 + 1/3
    rhs = 1/x
    if abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-9:
        print(f"Found solution: x = {x}")
        results.append(x)
# Since algebra shows solution is x=2, the enumeration confirms it.
print(f"Exact solution candidate: {results}")
```
