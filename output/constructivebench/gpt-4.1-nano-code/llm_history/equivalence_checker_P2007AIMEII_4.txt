theorem P2007AIMEII_4 :
  ∃ (w₁ w₂ : ℕ), -- widget and whoosit production rates per worker per hour
  (100 * w₁ = 300 ∧ 100 * w₂ = 200) ∧ -- first condition
  (2 * 60 * w₁ = 240 ∧ 2 * 60 * w₂ = 300) ∧ -- second condition

Ground Truth Answer: 450
Proposed Answer: 3 * 50 * 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem sets up equations about production rates:
   - First condition: 100*w₁ = 300 ⇒ w₁ = 3
   - First condition: 100*w₂ = 200 ⇒ w₂ = 2
   - Second condition confirms these values: 2*60*3 = 360 ≠ 240 (contradiction)
   - However, the proposed answer uses w₂ = 2 from the first condition

2. The final expression is 3*50*w₂:
   - Using w₂ = 2 gives 3*50*2 = 300
   - But ground truth is 450, which would require w₂ = 3

3. The contradiction in conditions suggests the problem might have inconsistent data, but:
   - The proposed answer follows from the first condition's w₂ value
   - The ground truth doesn't match this calculation

The proposed answer correctly calculates based on the first condition's w₂ value, but:
- There's an inconsistency in the problem's conditions
- The ground truth doesn't match this calculation

<<<False>>>
