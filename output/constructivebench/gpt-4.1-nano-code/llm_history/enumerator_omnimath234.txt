This problem explores the set of real numbers \( t \) for which there exists an infinite subset \( X \subseteq \mathbb{R} \) such that, for any quadruple \( x,y,z \in X \), and any \( a,d \) with \( d > 0 \), the maximum of the three distances exceeds \( t \times d \). To understand this threshold, weâ€™ll examine potential values of \( t \) by constructing specific infinite sets \( X \) and testing the inequality.

We will:
- Pick simple, small samples of \( X \), such as sequences tending to infinity,
- For candidate \( t \) values, construct \( X \) and verify if the condition holds,
- Cover a range of \( t \) values to approximate the set answer.

This enumeration will efficiently determine the possible \( t \) values by testing whether the supremum of such \( t \) can be exceeded or not, focusing on the extremal cases.

```python
# Enumerate certain candidate t values to approximate the set answer
import math

# Candidate t values to test
candidate_ts = [i * 0.1 for i in range(0, 21)]  # 0, 0.1, ..., 2.0

# Function to test whether for a given t, there exists an infinite X satisfying the condition
def test_t(t):
    # Construct X as a sequence tending to infinity, e.g., X = {n} for n in N
    # For each n, test the worst-case distances
    # Since the problem asks for all triples, we consider for large n
    # For simplicity, pick X as the sequence of integers
    X = list(range(1, 1000))  # finite sample, assume behavior extends
    for a in X:
        for d in [0.1, 1, 10]:
            for x in X:
                for y in X:
                    for z in X:
                        # For each quadruple, check if max distances > t * d
                        dist_x = abs(x - (a - d))
                        dist_y = abs(y - a)
                        dist_z = abs(z - (a + d))
                        max_dist = max(dist_x, dist_y, dist_z)
                        if max_dist <= t * d:
                            # Found a counterexample for this t
                            return False
    return True

# Print whether each candidate t satisfies the condition
for t in candidate_ts:
    result = test_t(t)
    print(f"t = {t:.2f} ->", "Sets exist" if result else "No such set")
```
