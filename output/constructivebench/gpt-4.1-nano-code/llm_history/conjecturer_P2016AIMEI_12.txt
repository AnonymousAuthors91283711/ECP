The problem involves finding the least positive integer m such that there exists a product of primes (p_i) indexed by Fin k with k ≥ 4, satisfying (∏ p_i) = m² - m + 11.

Analyzing the pattern, for small m, the expression m² - m + 11 generates values like 11, 19, 29, 41, ... This quadratic is minimized at m=1, giving 11, which is prime; for larger m, the product is a multiple of multiple primes.

The minimal m > 0 that yields a product of primes equal to m² - m + 11 with all p_i prime and at least 4 of them occurs at m=4, where m² - m + 11 = 16 - 4 + 11=23, which is prime.

Since at k=4, the product can be simply p_0 = p_1 = p_2 = p_3 = 23 (all primes), the minimal m satisfying the condition is m=4.

Therefore, the answer is 4.

. Current Proposed Answer: The problem involves finding the least positive integer m such that there exists a product of primes (p_i) indexed by Fin k with k ≥ 4, satisfying (∏ p_i) = m² - m + 11.

Therefore, the answer is 4.

The main issues are that the current `abbrev` definition is being assigned a verbal description rather than an expression, and also that the conclusion is missing a value of type ℕ. Based on the analysis, for m=4, m² - m + 11 = 23, which is prime, and choosing k=4 with p_i=23 works (product = 23). It seems the minimal such m is 4, satisfying the conditions.

Therefore, the answer should be simply the numeral 4. To fix the code, we define `P2016AIMEI_12_answer` as 4, without any further complex expressions.
