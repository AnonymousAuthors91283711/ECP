[write_program]
This appears to be some formal proof code (possibly in Lean) rather than a specific math problem. However, it shows the function \( f(x) = x - 5 \) applied at 0, with a placeholder answer `omnimath2952_answer`. The statement likely wants us to find the value of \( f(0) \).

Since \( f(x) = x - 5 \),
\[ f(0) = 0 - 5 = -5 \]

The `sorry` placeholders suggest that the goal is to fill in the actual value.

Below, I will write a Python program that fulfills the requirements: it will compute \( f(0) \) directly, print the answer immediately, and assume this is the exact value.

```python
# The problem reduces to computing (x - 5) at x=0, which is -5.
# We will define the function, evaluate at 0, and print the answer immediately.

def func(x):
    return x - 5

answer = func(0)
print(answer)
```
