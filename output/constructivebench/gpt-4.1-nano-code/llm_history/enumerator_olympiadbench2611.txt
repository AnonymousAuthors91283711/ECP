The problem asks to find the least natural number \( n \) such that \( n > 0 \) and the greatest common divisor of \( n^3 \) and \( n! \) is at least 100. We need to search for the minimal \( n \) satisfying this condition, which suggests checking \( n \) sequentially starting from 1 and stopping when the condition is met.

Since direct algebraic formulas may be complex, a practical approach is to brute-force check \( n \) from 1 upwards, compute \(\gcd(n^3, n!)\), and identify the smallest \( n \) where the gcd is at least 100.

The key points:
- Use small sample \( n \) values.
- Compute \( n! \) and \( \gcd(n^3, n!) \).
- Stop once the gcd hits or surpasses 100.
- Print each potential answer immediately for streaming output.

```python
import math

n = 1
while True:
    factorial_n = math.factorial(n)
    gcd_value = math.gcd(n**3, factorial_n)
    if gcd_value >= 100:
        print(n)
        break
    n += 1
```
