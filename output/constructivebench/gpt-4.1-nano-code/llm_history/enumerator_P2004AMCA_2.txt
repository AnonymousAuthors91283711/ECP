The problem seems to involve finding the least natural number n (up to 17) satisfying the inequality n * 6 + (8 * 5) / 2 â‰¥ 100. To aid in conjecturing the answer, we can enumerate all n from 0 to 17, evaluate the inequalities, and identify the smallest n that meets or exceeds the threshold, considering potentially exact calculations.

```python
# Enumerate n from 0 to 17
for n in range(18):
    # Calculate the left side of the inequality
    value = n * 6 + (8 * 5) / 2
    # Check if the value satisfies the inequality
    if value >= 100:
        print(n)
```
