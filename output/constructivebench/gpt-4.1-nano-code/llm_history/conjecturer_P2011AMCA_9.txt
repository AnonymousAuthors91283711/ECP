theorem P2011AMCA_9 : 
  let twins := 9 * 2
  let triplets := 6 * 3
  let twin_handshakes := 9 * (2 * (twins - 2) + 2 * (triplets / 2))
  let triplet_handshakes := 6 * (3 * (triplets - 3) + 3 * (twins / 2))
  (twin_handshakes + triplet_handshakes) / 2 = P2011AMCA_9_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Twin handshakes: 450
Triplet handshakes: 432
Total handshakes (divided by 2): 441. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests the total handshakes divided by 2 is 441, matching the sum of twin and triplet handshakes divided by 2. The total is a specific constant based on the enumerations; thus, the answer is 441.
