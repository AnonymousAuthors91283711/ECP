Given the problem statement, we need to determine the value of the expression:

\[
(3p + q) + 2010 \times \left((3p + q) - (3p - q)\right)
\]

with the conditions:
- \(q = 9\)
- The equality \((3p - q) - p = (3p + q) - (3p - q)\) holds

We want to solve for \(p\) and evaluate the expression.

---

First, substitute \(q=9\):

\[
(3p + 9) + 2010 \times \left((3p + 9) - (3p - 9)\right)
\]

Calculate the difference inside the multiplication:

\[
(3p + 9) - (3p - 9) = 3p + 9 - 3p + 9 = 18
\]

Now, analyze the condition:

\[
(3p - 9) - p = (3p + 9) - (3p - 9)
\]

Simplify both sides:

Left:
\[
3p - 9 - p = 2p - 9
\]

Right:
\[
(3p + 9) - (3p - 9) = 3p + 9 - 3p + 9 = 18
\]

Set equal:

\[
2p - 9 = 18 \implies 2p = 27 \implies p = 13.5
\]

Now, compute the main expression with \(p=13.5\) and \(q=9\):

\[
(3 \times 13.5 + 9) + 2010 \times 18
\]

Calculate:

\[
(40.5 + 9) + 2010 \times 18 = 49.5 + 2010 \times 18
\]

Compute \(2010 \times 18\):

\[
2010 \times 18 = (2000 + 10) \times 18 = 2000 \times 18 + 10 \times 18 = 36,000 + 180 = 36,180
\]

Sum:

\[
49.5 + 36,180 = 36,229.5
\]

Since the problem likely expects an exact rational or decimal answer, the answer is \(36,229.5\).

---

Here's the code to reproduce the result:

```python
# Given q=9, find p satisfying the condition
q = 9
# Solve for p: 2p - 9 = 18 => p = 13.5
p = 13.5

# Compute the expression: (3p + q) + 2010 * ((3p + q) - (3p - q))
part1 = 3 * p + q
difference = (3 * p + q) - (3 * p - q)  # should be 18
result = part1 + 2010 * difference

print(result)  # Output the exact answer
```

This will output: `36229.5`

---

**Notes**:
- The code directly computes the value based on derived \(p\).
- For larger ranges or parameters, one could generalize enumeration, but here the unique solution suffices.
- The approach prioritizes clarity and minimal computation.
