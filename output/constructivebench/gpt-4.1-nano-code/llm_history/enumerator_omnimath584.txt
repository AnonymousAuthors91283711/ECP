The problem provides a system of equations involving real numbers x, a, and c, with conditions:

1. \(20 + c = x\)
2. \(50 + c = a \times x\)
3. \(100 + c = a^2 \times x\)

From equations (1) and (2):
\[
a \times x = 50 + c = (50 + c)
\]
but since \(x = 20 + c\), substitute:
\[
a \times (20 + c) = 50 + c
\]

Similarly, from equations (2) and (3):
\[
a^2 \times x = 100 + c
\]

Substitute \(x = 20 + c\) into these:
\[
a \times (20 + c) = 50 + c \quad (A)
\]
\[
a^2 \times (20 + c) = 100 + c \quad (B)
\]

From (A):
\[
a = \frac{50 + c}{20 + c}
\]

Substitute into (B):
\[
a^2 = \left(\frac{50 + c}{20 + c}\right)^2
\]

So:
\[
a^2 \times (20 + c) = 100 + c
\]
\[
\left(\frac{50 + c}{20 + c}\right)^2 \times (20 + c) = 100 + c
\]
\[
\frac{(50 + c)^2}{(20 + c)^2} \times (20 + c) = 100 + c
\]
\[
\frac{(50 + c)^2}{20 + c} = 100 + c
\]

Multiply both sides by \(20 + c\):
\[
(50 + c)^2 = (100 + c)(20 + c)
\]

Expand:
\[
(50 + c)^2 = (100 + c)(20 + c)
\]
\[
(50)^2 + 2 \times 50 \times c + c^2 = 100 \times 20 + 100 c + 20 c + c^2
\]
\[
2500 + 100 c + c^2 = 2000 + 120 c + c^2
\]

Subtract \(c^2\) from both sides:
\[
2500 + 100 c = 2000 + 120 c
\]

Bring all to one side:
\[
2500 - 2000 = 120 c - 100 c
\]
\[
500 = 20 c
\]
\[
c = 25
\]

Now, back to find \(a\):
\[
a = \frac{50 + c}{20 + c} = \frac{50 + 25}{20 + 25} = \frac{75}{45} = \frac{5}{3}
\]

And \(x\):
\[
x = 20 + c = 45
\]

Check the equations:
- \(20 + 25 = 45\) OK
- \(50 + 25 = 75 = a \times 45 \Rightarrow a \times 45 = 75 \Rightarrow a = \frac{75}{45} = \frac{5}{3}\) OK
- \(100 +25 =125 = a^2 \times x\), check:
\[
a^2 = \left(\frac{5}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{25}{9}
\]
\[
a^2 \times x = \frac{25}{9} \times 45 = \frac{25}{9} \times 45 = 25 \times 5 = 125
\]
Yes, the equations check out.

The only solution for \(a\) given the constructed conditions is \(\frac{5}{3}\).

Since the problem's proof pathway leads to a unique solution, the answer for \(a\) is \(\frac{5}{3}\).

```python
# Enumerate the candidate c value that satisfies the derived quadratic relation
# and compute corresponding a. This is a unique solution, but we will verify.

# Prepare sets for candidate c and resulting a
c_candidates = []

# The key quadratic in c was derived as:
# (50 + c)^2 = (100 + c)(20 + c)
# which simplifies to c = 25 (verified above), but let's test around it for completeness

for c_try in range(0, 51, 1):  # small range around the known solution
    left = (50 + c_try) ** 2
    right = (100 + c_try) * (20 + c_try)
    if left == right:
        c_candidates.append(c_try)

for c_val in c_candidates:
    # compute a
    a = (50 + c_val) / (20 + c_val)
    # compute x
    x = 20 + c_val
    print(f'c = {c_val}, a = {a}, x = {x}')
```
