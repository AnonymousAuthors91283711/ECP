This problem involves exploring quadruples \((a, b, c, d)\) where all are positive, satisfying \((a + c)(b + d) = ac + bd\), and analyzing the sum \(a/b + b/c + c/d + d/a\). The goal is to find the minimal value of that sum among all such quadruples.

Given the constraints and symmetry, small sample values can be tested to observe patterns, especially because hard algebraic solutions can be involved. We focus on enumerating candidate quadruples with small positive values and check the sum \(S\).

Here's an approach:
- Fix small values for \(a, b, c, d\) within a limited range (e.g., 1 to 10).
- Check if they satisfy the relation \((a + c)(b + d) = ac + bd\).
- For those that do, compute \(S\).
- Keep track of the minimal \(S\).

This approach provides insights and conjectures, with output streamed as solutions are found.

```python
# Enumerate small positive quadruples (a,b,c,d) to find those satisfying the relation,
# then compute S and output candidate results to help conjecture the minimal value.

min_sum = float('inf')
results = []

for a in range(1, 11):
    for b in range(1, 11):
        for c in range(1, 11):
            for d in range(1, 11):
                # Check the given relation
                if (a + c) * (b + d) == a * c + b * d:
                    s = a / b + b / c + c / d + d / a
                    print(f"Found quadruple a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d} with sum={s}")
                    if s < min_sum:
                        min_sum = s
                        results = [(a, b, c, d, s)]
                    elif s == min_sum:
                        results.append((a, b, c, d, s))
# Output the minimal sum candidates
print(f"Minimal sum found: {min_sum}")
for res in results:
    a,b,c,d,s = res
    print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d} => sum={s}")
```
