This problem asks us to analyze the set of real numbers \( x \) in the interval \([0, \pi]\) satisfying \( \sin (\frac{\pi}{2} \cos x) = \cos (\frac{\pi}{2} \sin x) \). The goal is to find the number of such solutions.

Since the problem involves trigonometric functions, a common approach is to consider special angles or symmetry properties. For a computational enumeration, we can discretize the interval [0, π], evaluate both sides for a fine grid, and count solutions where the two sides are approximately equal.

Here's the plan:
- Choose a small step size (e.g., 0.001).
- For each \( x \) in [0, π], evaluate both sides.
- Check if the absolute difference is below a small threshold (e.g., 1e-6).
- Count the solutions, and output each solution as soon as found.

This approach efficiently approximates the solutions and streams outputs.

```python
import math

def main():
    solutions = []
    step = 0.001
    threshold = 1e-6
    x = 0.0
    pi = math.pi
    while x <= pi:
        left = math.sin((pi / 2) * math.cos(x))
        right = math.cos((pi / 2) * math.sin(x))
        if abs(left - right) < threshold:
            # Record and print the approximate solution
            print(f"Approximate solution at x = {x:.3f}")
            solutions.append(x)
        x += step
    print(f"Total approximate solutions: {len(solutions)}")
    # Optionally, find exact solutions at special points
    # For example, check x=0, x=pi/2, x=pi where functions may have known values
    for x_check in [0, pi/2, pi]:
        left = math.sin((pi / 2) * math.cos(x_check))
        right = math.cos((pi / 2) * math.sin(x_check))
        print(f"At x={x_check:.3f}: left={left:.6f}, right={right:.6f}")

    main()
