This problem involves understanding the inequality \((x^2 - 3)(x^2 + 5) < 0\). Since \(x^2 + 5 > 0\) for all real \(x\), the inequality reduces to \(x^2 - 3 < 0\). Thus, \(x^2 < 3\) and the solutions are all real \(x\) with \(-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}\). For integers, this means \(x\) must satisfy \(-1 < x < 1\)â€”i.e., \(x\) can only be \(-1, 0, 1\). Checking these:

- For \(x = -1\): \((-1)^2 - 3 = 1 - 3 = -2 < 0\). Since \(x^2 + 5 = 1 + 5 = 6 > 0\), the product is negative, satisfying the inequality.
- For \(x = 0\): \(0 - 3 = -3 < 0\), and \(0 + 5 = 5 > 0\), product negative, satisfies.
- For \(x = 1\): \(1 - 3 = -2 < 0\), and \(1 + 5 = 6 > 0\), product negative, satisfies.

So the set of integers satisfying the inequality is \(\{-1, 0, 1\}\).

```python
# The solutions are all integers x where x in {-1, 0, 1}
# Since the inequality reduces to x^2 < 3, and for integers, this means x in {-1, 0, 1}
# We produce the set of these solutions immediately.

def enumerate_solutions():
    for x in [-1, 0, 1]:
        # check the inequality for confirmation if necessary
        if (x**2 - 3) * (x**2 + 5) < 0:
            print(x)

enumerate_solutions()
```
