abbrev P2018AMCA_4_answer : Set ℝ := sorry
theorem P2018AMCA_4 (d : ℝ) :
    (¬ (d ≥ 6) ∧ ¬ (d ≤ 5) ∧ ¬ (d ≤ 4)) ↔ d ∈ P2018AMCA_4_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: d = 5.1 satisfies the conditions.
d = 5.5 satisfies the conditions.
d = 5.9 satisfies the conditions.
Answer candidate: d = 5.1
Answer candidate: d = 5.2
Answer candidate: d = 5.3
Answer candidate: d = 5.4
Answer candidate: d = 5.5
Answer candidate: d = 5.6
Answer candidate: d = 5.7
Answer candidate: d = 5.8
Answer candidate: d = 5.9. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
The conditions ñ(¬ (d ≥ 6)), ñ(¬ (d ≤ 5)), and ñ(¬ (d ≤ 4)) indicate that d is neither ≥ 6 nor ≤ 4, i.e., 4 < d < 6. The enumerated answers are in the interval (5.1, 5.9), inclusive of 5.1 and 5.9, with candidate values between. Thus, the set contains **all** real numbers strictly between 5 and 6, including 5.1 and 5.9, but not 4 or 6. Otherwise, the set is continuous in that interval.
