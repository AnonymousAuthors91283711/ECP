This problem appears to involve analyzing a set of pairs \((x', y')\) satisfying a quadratic relation and finding the maximum of another quadratic expression involving \(x', y'\). Based on the structure, I suspect it is about finding the maximum value of \(x'^2 + x' y' + 2 y'^2\) subject to the constraint \(x'^2 - x' y' + 2 y'^2 = 8\), with both \(x'\) and \(y'\) positive, for varying \(x, y\).

To assist in formulating conjectures, I will code a numerical exploration over a small sample of \(x, y\) values. For each pair, I will enumerate candidate \(x', y'\) satisfying the constraints approximately and compute the target.

```python
import math

def check_candidates(x, y, delta=0.1):
    results = []
    # Explore a small grid for x' and y' near positive values
    for x_prime in [i*delta for i in range(1, 20)]:  # 0.1 to 1.9
        for y_prime in [j*delta for j in range(1, 20)]:
            # Check the constraint x'^2 - x'*y' + 2 y'^2 â‰ˆ 8
            constraint = x_prime**2 - x_prime * y_prime + 2 * y_prime**2
            if abs(constraint - 8) < delta:
                # Compute the target z
                z = x_prime**2 + x_prime * y_prime + 2 * y_prime**2
                results.append(z)
                print(f"x'={x_prime:.2f}, y'={y_prime:.2f}, constraint={constraint:.2f}, z={z:.2f}")
    if results:
        print(f"Maximum z for x={x:.2f}, y={y:.2f}: {max(results):.2f}")
    else:
        print(f"No solutions found for x={x:.2f}, y={y:.2f}")

# Sample small values to get an idea
sample_points = [(0.5, 0.5), (1.0, 0.8), (1.2, 1.0)]
for (x, y) in sample_points:
    check_candidates(x, y)
```
