noncomputable abbrev omnimath4164_answer : ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath4164 (f : ℝ → ℝ) (hpos : ∀ x > 0, f x > 0) :
  (∀ x > 0, ∀ y > 0, x * f (x^2) * f (f y) + f (y * f x) = f (x * y) * (f (f (x^2)) + f (f (y^2)))) ↔ f = omnimath4164_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Summary of candidates satisfying the test:
. Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
Based on pattern recognition, a common candidate satisfying positive constraints and complex functional equations is the identity function.  
Final Lean expression: <<<fun x : ℝ => x>>>
