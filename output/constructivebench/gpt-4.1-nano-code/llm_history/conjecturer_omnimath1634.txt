Let's analyze the set S. It is the intersection over all sets T with 0 in T, closed under x ↦ 3x and x ↦ 3x+1. Each such T must contain 0, 3*0=0, and 3*0+1=1, so 0 and 1 are in T. Then, by closure, it must also contain 3*0=0, 3*0+1=1, 3*1=3, 3*1+1=4, and so forth. The minimal set S is thus the union of all these closures, which generate all non-negative integers whose base-3 representation contains only 0s and 1s. The integers form numbers with no digit '2' in base 3. Counting numbers less than 2008 without digit 2 in base 3 gives the answer.

Final answer is the count of all such numbers in [0, 2008).

Number of base-3 numbers with digits 0 or 1 less than 3^k is 2^k, and 3^6=729, 3^7=2187. Since 2187>2008, highest k=6, so counting all numbers with up to 6 digits in base 3 with digits 0 or 1 gives 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^6 = 127 in total, but only up to 2008.

Counting all such numbers less than 2008 involves summing over these, leading the total to be:

Answer = 2^7 - 1 - numbers with base-3 representation containing only 0s and 1s.

But to simplify, it's the sum of counts of all binary-like numbers for k=1..6, i.e., sum_{k=1}^{6} 2^k = 2^{7} - 2 =128-2=126. Including zero, total count is 127.

So, total count of numbers less than 2008 with digits {0,1} in base 3 is 127.

Thus, the total is 127 directly, but as per pattern, the count is 2^7 - 1.

Since 2008 < 2187=3^7, total such numbers with digits 0 or 1 in base 3 less than 2008 is 2^7 - 1 = 127.

Answer: 

<<<2^7 - 1>>>
