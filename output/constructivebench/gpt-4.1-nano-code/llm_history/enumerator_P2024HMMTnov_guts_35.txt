The problem is about finding the least integer N between 1 and 1024 such that the expected number of rounds, computed by a summation, is less than 2. The expected_rounds function calculates a sum involving (1 - (n-1)/1024)^k for k from 0 to 9.

To assist, I will write a Python script that enumerates candidate values of N from 1 upwards, computes the expected rounds, and outputs those N where the sum is less than 2. Once identified, I will find the smallest such N.

```python
import math

def expected_rounds(n):
    if not (1 <= n <= 1024):
        return 0
    total = 0.0
    base = 1 - (n - 1) / 1024
    for k in range(10):
        total += base**k
    return total

# Enumerate N from 1 to 1024
for N in range(1, 1025):
    rounds = expected_rounds(N)
    print(f"N={N}, expected rounds={rounds}")
    if rounds < 2:
        print(f"First N with expected rounds < 2: {N}")
        break
```
