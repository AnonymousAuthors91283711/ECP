The problem appears to involve solving for integer triples (x, y, z) with positive components satisfying two equations:
1. \( x^2 = 2 (y+z) \)
2. \( x^6 = y^6 + z^6 + 31 (y^2 + z^2) \)

To assist in conjecturing the solutions, we'll enumerate small positive values of x, y, and z matching these constraints. We prioritize smaller values, check the equations for integer solutions, and print any solutions found immediately. We limit search to small ranges to avoid excess computation.

```python
# Enumerate small positive integer solutions to the system:
# x^2 = 2(y+z)
# x^6 = y^6 + z^6 + 31(y^2 + z^2)
# We'll iterate over a small range of x, y, z.

max_val = 20  # limit search space for efficiency
for x in range(1, max_val + 1):
    lhs1 = x**2
    # y + z must be lhs1 / 2, which must be integer
    if lhs1 % 2 != 0:
        continue
    sum_yz = lhs1 // 2
    for y in range(1, sum_yz):
        z = sum_yz - y
        if z <= 0 or z > max_val:
            continue
        # Check the second equation
        lhs2 = x**6
        rhs = y**6 + z**6 + 31 * (y**2 + z**2)
        if lhs2 == rhs:
            print((x, y, z))
```
