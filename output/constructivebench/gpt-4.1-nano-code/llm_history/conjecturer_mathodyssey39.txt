  ∃ (ks : Finset ℕ), 
    (∀ k ∈ ks, digitProduct k = (25 * k) / 8 - 211) ∧ 
    (∀ k', digitProduct k' = (25 * k') / 8 - 211 → k' ∈ ks) ∧ 
    mathodyssey39_answer = ks.sum id := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 72
88
Answer: 160. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the pattern of enumerated answers (72, 88) and their relation to the digit product formula, the sum resulting in 160 suggests that the particular set ks contains numbers satisfying digitProduct k = (25 * k) / 8 - 211. The total sum likely computes to 160 with these specific k values. 

Therefore, the lean expression representing the answer, considering the pattern and the problem context, is:

<<<160>>>
