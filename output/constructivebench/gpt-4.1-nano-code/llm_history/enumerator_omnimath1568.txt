The problem involves evaluating a triple sum over natural numbers with a specific condition and then determining its value or possible values. To analyze this sum, we can:

- Consider small values of a, b, c to approximate the sum.
- Focus on the region where none of a, b, c are zero.
- Sum over small ranges to get a sense of the total.
- Since larger values contribute less (due to the exponential denominator), summing up to a small cutoff (like 10) will give a good approximation.
- Present all partial sums immediately for potential conjecture.

Here's the implementation:

```python
# Enumerate all triples (a, b, c) with a, b, c in 1..10 (since 0 excluded inside the sum) to approximate the sum.
# For values with a, b, c > 0, compute the summand, sum, and print each partial sum for insight.

max_val = 10
total_sum = 0.0

for a in range(1, max_val + 1):
    for b in range(1, max_val + 1):
        for c in range(1, max_val + 1):
            denom = (4 ** (a + b + c)) * (a + b) * (b + c) * (c + a)
            if denom != 0:
                term = (a * b * (3 * a + c)) / denom
                total_sum += term
            # Print each term as found for streaming
            print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, term={term:.8f}")
# At the end, print the total sum approximation
print(f"Approximate sum over a,b,c <= {max_val}: {total_sum}")
```
