The pattern suggests the answer counts the numbers in [1,10] satisfying divisibility. For \(a\) in [1,10], the divisibility \(a^{2014} + a^{2015} = a^{2014}(1 + a)\) implies \(a^{2014}\) divisible by 5 only if 5 divides \(a\). Since 5 divides exactly when \(a=5\), only \(a=5\) satisfies the divisibility. Count of such \(a\) is 1. But the enumerated options are 4, 5, 9, 10; total options suggest counting all options or a bigger set. Well, 1, 5, 9, and 10 fit into [1,10] and match the enumerated options. But only 5 divides 5; for 9, 9^2014 + 9^2015 ≡ 0 mod 5? Let's check 9 ≡ -1 mod 5, so 9^k ≡ (-1)^k mod 5. Since 2014 is even, 9^{2014} ≡ 1 mod 5, 9^{2015} ≡ -1 mod 5, sum ≡ 0 mod 5. So 9 satisfies the divisibility.

Similarly for 10: since 10 ≡ 0 mod 5, 10^{2014} + 10^{2015} ≡ 0 + 0 ≡ 0 mod 5, so 10 also satisfies. On the other hand, 4: 4 ≡ 4 mod 5, 4^{even} ≡ 1, 4^{odd} ≡ 4, so for 4^{2014} ≡ 1, 4^{2015} ≡ 4, sum ≡ 5 ≡ 0 mod 5, so 4 also satisfies.

Thus, the numbers are 4, 5, 9, 10.

Final answer: 4
