This problem involves exploring the possible triple solutions `(t.1, t.2.1, t.2.2)` based on a sign function and symmetric conditions. The key insight is that the sign function divides the real plane into three regions: positive, zero, and negative, and the constraints are symmetric in `t.2.1` and `t.2.2`. To analyze all solutions efficiently, we'll:

- Fix some small sample values for `t.2.1` and `t.2.2`.
- Check the sign of their sum.
- Compute `t.1` accordingly.
- Verify the symmetry conditions.
- Output each solution as soon as it is found.

Given the problem's structure, we can restrict ourselves to small floating-point samples and systematically check all combinations. Because the constraints are recursive with symmetry, the solutions should be evident among small integers or rationals.

```python
# Enumerate small sample values for t2_1 and t2_2
samples = [ -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 ]
solutions = set()

for t2_1 in samples:
    for t2_2 in samples:
        sum_val = t2_1 + t2_2
        # Determine sign according to sign function rules
        if sum_val > 0:
            sign_val = 1
        elif sum_val == 0:
            sign_val = 0
        else:
            sign_val = -1

        # Compute t1 based on the given formula
        t1 = 2018 - 2019 * sign_val

        # Check symmetry conditions
        cond1 = (t1 == 2018 - 2019 * sign_val)
        cond2 = (t2_1 == 2018 - 2019 * sign_val)
        cond3 = (t2_2 == 2018 - 2019 * sign_val)

        # Confirm all conditions and add solutions
        if cond1 and cond2 and cond3:
            solution = (t1, t2_1, t2_2)
            # Use rounding to handle floating point imprecision
            solution = tuple(round(x, 5) for x in solution)
            solutions.add(solution)
            print(f"Solution found: {solution}")
```

The problem resembles a mathematical fixed point or symmetry condition involving the sign function defined piecewise. The enumeration considers small sample values and appears to check if certain equalities hold, then outputs solutions when all conditions match.

**Judgment:**
The code only considers very small integers for t2_1 and t2_2, which are symmetric around zero, and then checks whether the resulting conditions hold. The problem appears to have solutions for larger or more complex values, especially since the original problem involves 2018 and 2019 with relations that likely produce solutions beyond the small sample range. The code also doesn't account for the signs of t2_1 and t2_2 themselves, only their sums.

Given that:
- The code reports "Error: Program outputs empty result," indicating no solutions are found within the small samples.
- The original problem seems to involve fixed points, which are more likely with specific, possibly larger values.
- The enumeration is limited to small integers only, probably missing solutions configured outside the range.

**Conclusion:**  
The program is **not** acceptable because it does not find solutions, and limiting to small samples prevents capturing solutions that involve larger magnitudes. It should be expanded to consider a broader range of values, especially given the constants involved (2018, 2019).

### Corrected Program:
```python
# Enumerate a broader range of values for t2_1 and t2_2
samples = range(-50, 51)  # Expand from small to moderate range
solutions = set()

for t2_1 in samples:
    for t2_2 in samples:
        sum_val = t2_1 + t2_2
        # Determine sign according to the given sign function
        if sum_val > 0:
            sign_val = 1
        elif sum_val == 0:
            sign_val = 0
        else:
            sign_val = -1

        # Compute t1 based on the given relation
        t1 = 2018 - 2019 * sign_val

        # Conditions based on the relations
        cond1 = (t1 == 2018 - 2019 * sign_val)
        cond2 = (t2_1 == 2018 - 2019 * sign_val)
        cond3 = (t2_2 == 2018 - 2019 * sign_val)

        # For the fixed point, all three should

The problem statement appears to be a formal theorem in Lean, but the core of it (the actual answer value `omnimath1010_answer`) is marked as `sorry`, meaning it hasn't been provided. The theorem involves a piecewise signing function and fixed points of a symmetric system, which likely reduces to finding specific values of `t.2.1` and `t.2.2` satisfying the given equalities.

Given:

- There is no implementation, just an empty template.
- The enumeration produces no answers (error). 
- The program is empty, so it can't be run or produce any output.
  
**Judgement:**  
Since the problem instructs to enumerate answers and the program produces none, it fails to meet the operational criteria. Without an implementation, the code can't produce partial results or reflect the problem's intended solution.

**Acceptance:**  
<<<False>>>

### Corrected approach:

Given the nature of the equations and symmetry, we analyze the system:

\[
\begin{cases}
t_1 = 2018 - 2019 \cdot \operatorname{sign}(t_2 + t_3) \\
t_2 = 2018 - 2019 \cdot \operatorname{sign}(t_3 + t_2) \\
t_3 = 2018 - 2019 \cdot \operatorname{sign}(t_2 + t_3)
\end{cases}
\]

Notice that since the second and third equations are symmetric in \(t_2, t_3\), the signs involved are similar.

Possible cases for the sign:

- If \(t_2 + t_3 > 0\), then \(\operatorname{sign} = 1\):
  \[
  t_2 = t_3 = 2018 - 2019 \times 1 = 2018 - 2019 = -1
  \]
  Then check the first equation:
  \[
  t_1 = 2018 - 2019 \times 1 = -1
  \]
  So, one fixed point candidate: \((-1, -1, -1)\).

- If \(t_2 + t_3 = 0\), then \(\operatorname{sign} = 0\), so:
  \[
  t_{2,3} = 2018 - 201
