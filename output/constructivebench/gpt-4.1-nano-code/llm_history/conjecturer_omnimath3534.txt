Maximum x: 4. Expected Answer Type: Prop
To find the maximum x satisfying the enumerated answer set, observe the pattern from the options: the maximum value listed is 4. Therefore, the statement that x's maximum is 4 can be expressed as: 

"∃ x, ℤ, max x in the list is 4." 

Since the context suggests propositional form, the simplest representation capturing the maximum is:

<<<∃ x : ℤ, x = 4>>[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Maximum x: 4. Expected Answer Type: Prop
The problem indicates that the set contains enumerated answers with maximum value 4, specifically listing integers from -4 up to 4, and identifies 4 as the maximum. The goal is to express in Lean that there exists an integer x which equals this maximum value, 4, using propositional logic.

The initial provided Lean code tried to state "To find the maximum x ..." directly in the abbrev, leading to syntax errors because it contained normal language rather than Lean expressions, including the unknown identifier 'To'.

The correct approach is to define a Prop that states "there exists an integer x such that x equals 4," which formally captures the fact that the maximum answer listed is 4.

Final corrected answer:

<<<∃ x : ℤ, x = 4>>>
