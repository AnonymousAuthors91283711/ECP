noncomputable abbrev P2025HMMTfeb_algnt_7_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2025HMMTfeb_algnt_7 :
  ∃! (a : ℝ × ℝ × ℝ), 0 < a.1 ∧ 0 < a.2.1 ∧ 0 < a.2.2 ∧
  2 * (a.1^2 + 1) = 3 * (a.2.1^2 + 1) ∧
  3 * (a.2.1^2 + 1) = 4 * (a.2.2^2 + 1) ∧
  a.1 * a.2.1 + a.2.1 * a.2.2 + a.2.2 * a.1 = 1 ∧
  a.1 + a.2.1 + a.2.2 = P2025HMMTfeb_algnt_7_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found near solution at x=0.624: sum=1.872
Found near solution at x=0.625: sum=1.876
Found near solution at x=0.626: sum=1.880
Approximate total sum: 1.872
Approximate total sum: 1.876
Approximate total sum: 1.880. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the pattern of solutions near 0.624–0.626 with sums close to 1.872–1.880, and noting the constraints imply symmetric relations, the sum converges approximately to 1.875.  
Final answer: <<<(3/2)>>>
