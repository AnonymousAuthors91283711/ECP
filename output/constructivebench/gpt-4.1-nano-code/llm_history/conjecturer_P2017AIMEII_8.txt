theorem P2017AIMEII_8 :
  {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ n < 2017 ∧ 720 ∣ (1 + n + ∑ i in Finset.Icc (1 : ℕ) 6, (n ^ i : ℚ) / (i)!)}.ncard = P2017AIMEII_8_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 1440

Candidates n: [1440, 1495, 1620, 1659, 1710, 1800, 1935, 1970, 1972, 1980, 1996]. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the pattern in the enumerated answers and simplified divisibility conditions, the most consistent and centrally located candidate that fits the pattern for a high-divisibility number within the range is 1980. 

Thus, the final answer is:

<<<1980>>>
