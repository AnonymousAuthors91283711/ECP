  IsGreatest {L : ℝ | ∀ (x : ℝ), x ∈ Ico 0 1 → 
    let Sx := {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ Even ⌊n * x⌋}
    ∑' (n : Sx), 1 / 2^(n : ℕ) ≥ L} 
  omnimath3207_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: timeout triggered. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The supremum over all L satisfying the given inequality approaches 1 as x approaches 1, because for x close to 1, the sum approaches the harmonic series with dyadic terms summing to 1. Hence, the greatest such L is 1.
