The polynomial with degree 4 satisfying the evaluation symmetry is \(x^4 - 10x^2 + 1\). Evaluating at 10 and 0 yields \(10^4 - 10 \times 10^2 + 1 = 10000 - 1000 + 1 = 9001\). The polynomial's constant term is 1, implying the polynomial's value difference at 10 and 0 is 9001; however, considering the algebraic symmetry, the simplified minimal polynomial coefficient that captures this is -2, consistent with the pattern that the evaluation difference equals -2.
