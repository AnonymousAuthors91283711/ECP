The problem appears to define a sequence \(a(n)\) recursively, starting with \(a(1) = 2\), and where \(a(n+1) = a(n) + l(a(n))\). Here, \(l(n) = \sup\{ p \mid p \text{ is prime and } p \le n \}\). The goal seems to find all squares that appear in the sequence \(\{ a_i \}\), i.e., all \(a_i = m^2\).

To analyze, I'll:
- Generate small values of \(a(n)\).
- For each step, compute \(l(a(i))\) as the maximum prime \(\leq a(i)\).
- Generate \(a(i+1) = a(i) + l(a(i))\).
- Check if \(a(i)\) is a perfect square.
- Limit steps to keep under 400 tokens.

This will allow us to enumerate possible squares in the sequence.

```python
import math

# Function to generate the largest prime <= n efficiently for small n
def largest_prime_leq(n):
    # For small n, a simple search suffices
    for candidate in range(n, 1, -1):
        for divisor in range(2, int(math.sqrt(candidate)) + 1):
            if candidate % divisor == 0:
                break
        else:
            return candidate
    return 2 if n >= 2 else 1

a = [2]  # starting value: a(1) = 2
squares_found = set()
steps = 50  # number of steps to simulate
for i in range(1, steps + 1):
    current = a[-1]
    p_max = largest_prime_leq(current)
    next_val = current + p_max
    a.append(next_val)
    root = int(math.isqrt(next_val))
    if root * root == next_val:
        print(f"a({i+1}) = {next_val} = {root}^2")
        squares_found.add(next_val)
```

This script:
- Simulates initial steps of the sequence.
- Prints each term that is a perfect square.
- Uses small sample values for primes and sequence length.
- Can be extended or modified for more steps or deeper analysis.
