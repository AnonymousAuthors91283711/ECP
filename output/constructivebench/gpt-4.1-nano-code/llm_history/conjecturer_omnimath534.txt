theorem omnimath534 : 
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | 10000 ≤ n ∧ n < 100000 ∧ (digits 10 n).reverse = digits 10 n ∧ 99 ∣ n} omnimath534_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 54945. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The problem asks for the least 5-digit number divisible by 99, with digits palindromic in reverse and in the range [10000, 99999]. Since the number's digits reverse is equal to itself, it is a palindrome; also divisible by 99. The smallest such number in the range that meets these conditions appears to be 54945, based on the enumeration.

Final answer in Lean:
<<<54945>>>
