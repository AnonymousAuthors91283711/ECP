This problem involves counting permutations of a finite set with specific constraints. We are considering functions \(f : \text{Fin}\,10 \to \text{Fin}\,10\) such that:

- For each \(i\), \(f(i) \in \{i, i+1, i-1\}\) (with appropriate bounds).
- \(f\) is injective (a permutation of 10 elements).

This essentially describes permutations of 10 elements where each element can only stay the same, move to the neighbor on the left, or move to the neighbor on the right, subject to boundary conditions.

To enumerate possible such permutations, we:

- Model the problem as counting permutations with local move constraints.
- Since the domain is small (10 elements), we can brute-force all permutations and check the constraints.

Here's a Python program that enumerates all permutations of 10 elements, filters those satisfying the constraints, and counts them.

```python
import itertools

def is_valid_perm(perm):
    for i in range(10):
        # f(i) is perm[i], which maps i to perm[i]
        f_i = perm[i]
        # The index i maps to perm[i], which must be in {i, i-1, i+1} within bounds
        if abs(f_i - i) > 1:
            return False
        # Check injectivity implicitly by permutation enumeration
    return True

def main():
    count = 0
    for perm in itertools.permutations(range(10)):
        if is_valid_perm(perm):
            count += 1
            # Print permutation as a candidate answer
            print(perm)
    print("Total count:", count)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code exhaustively enumerates all permutations of 10 elements and filters those where each image differs from the original index by at most 1, which satisfies the problem's constraints.

Expected output:

- Prints each valid permutation (each is an answer candidate).
- After enumeration, prints the total count of such permutations.

This assists in conjecturing the total number of such permutations for the problem.
