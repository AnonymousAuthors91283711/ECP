The problem asks for integer solutions `(p.1, p.2)` to the equation:  
`7 * p₁ + 14 * p₂ = 5 * p₁² + 5 * p₁ * p₂ + 5 * p₂²`.  

To explore potential solutions, we can test small integers for `p₁` and `p₂`, since quadratic growth may quickly exceed linear terms for larger integers, and the domain is integers.

We'll:
- Choose a small range, e.g., from -10 to 10.
- For each `(p₁, p₂)`, check if the equation holds exactly.
- Print solutions immediately when found.

This helps to identify potential solutions and analyze their pattern.

```python
# Enumerate integer pairs within a small range to find solutions to the given equation.
solutions = []

for p1 in range(-10, 11):
    for p2 in range(-10, 11):
        lhs = 7 * p1 + 14 * p2
        rhs = 5 * p1 ** 2 + 5 * p1 * p2 + 5 * p2 ** 2
        if lhs == rhs:
            print((p1, p2))
            solutions.append((p1, p2))
```
