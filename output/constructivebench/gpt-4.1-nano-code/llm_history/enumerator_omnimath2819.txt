The problem involves a linear equation with parameters and an unknown answer for x, which should be derived from the given conditions. Since the code is formalized in a theorem-proving style, but we're asked to write a Python program to generate potential answers, here's an approach:

- Given the linear equation: `a * (x + 2) + b * (x + 2) = 60`.
- Using the condition `a + b = 12`.
- Simplify the equation: `(a + b) * (x + 2) = 60`.
- Substitute `a + b = 12`: `12 * (x + 2) = 60`.
- Solve for x: `x + 2 = 60 / 12 = 5`, so `x = 3`.

But since parameters are involved, we will enumerate all possible small integer pairs `(a, b)` where `a + b = 12`. For each such pair, compute potential x to see if it results in the same value. To demonstrate partial enumeration and natural constraints, choose `a` from 0 to 12, with `b=12 - a`. For each pair `(a, b)`, find the x solution. Since the solution is linear and determined directly, the program will outline the set of potential answers for different parameter pairs:

```python
# Enumerate all pairs (a, b) with a + b = 12 where a and b are non-negative integers
# For each pair, compute x from the simplified equation: (a + b) * (x + 2) = 60
# Since a + b = 12, (x + 2) = 60 / 12 = 5, so x = 3, regardless of the pair
# But if a or b are zero, the equation reduces accordingly; we check for different scenarios
for a in range(13):
    b = 12 - a
    # Check if the sum is zero to avoid division by zero
    if a + b != 0:
        x_value = 60 / (a + b) - 2
        print(f"Parameters: a={a}, b={b}; x={x_value}")
```

This enumerates all pairs satisfying the sum condition and computes the corresponding x, illustrating possible solutions.

```python
# Enumerate parameter pairs with a + b = 12 and compute corresponding x values
for a in range(13):
    b = 12 - a
    # Avoid division by zero if a + b == 0
    if a + b != 0:
        x = 60 / (a + b) - 2
        print(f"a={a}, b={b} => x={x}")
```
