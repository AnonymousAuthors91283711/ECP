Let's analyze the problem. We are given several linear equations involving the positive integers \(w, d, a, b\). Our goal is to find the quadruples \((w, d, a, b)\) that satisfy all the equations simultaneously, considering the constraints that all variables are greater than zero.

The equations are:
1. \(201 = 6w + 4d + 30a + 63b\)
2. \(200 = 6w + 3d + 35a + 60b\)
3. \(192 = 6w + 4d + 30a + 54b\)
4. \(191 = 6w + 4d + 28a + 55b\)
5. \(178 = 5w + 7d + 18a + 59b\)
6. \(176 = 4w + 7d + 32a + 59b\)
7. \(176 = 4w + 7d + 36a + 55b\)

Approach:
- Use brute-force enumeration over small ranges for \(w, d, a, b\) because the coefficients are small enough.
- For each candidate tuple, check if all equations are satisfied.

To limit search space, since the maximum constants involved are around hundreds, we'll search over a small range (say 1 to 50).

Here's the Python code:

```python
# Enumerate all positive integer solutions for the given equations
for w in range(1, 50):
    for d in range(1, 50):
        for a in range(1, 50):
            for b in range(1, 50):
                eq1 = 6*w + 4*d + 30*a + 63*b
                eq2 = 6*w + 3*d + 35*a + 60*b
                eq3 = 6*w + 4*d + 30*a + 54*b
                eq4 = 6*w + 4*d + 28*a + 55*b
                eq5 = 5*w + 7*d + 18*a + 59*b
                eq6 = 4*w + 7*d + 32*a + 59*b
                eq7 = 4*w + 7*d + 36*a + 55*b
                if (eq1 == 201 and eq2 == 200 and eq3 == 192 and
                    eq4 == 191 and eq5 == 178 and eq6 == 176 and eq7 == 176):
                    print(w, d, a, b)
```
