. Enumerated answers: 282. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The problem asks for the least N > 0 such that no integer k satisfies the condition for all m in the interval. The pattern suggests N=282, since the interval 1000*N to 1000*N+999 contains numbers with perfect squares that are not all perfect squares. For N=282, the interval likely contains a perfect square but no single k fulfills the condition throughout.  
Final answer: <<<282>>>
