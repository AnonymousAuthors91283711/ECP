theorem omnimath3498 (SteveMoney WayneMoney : ℕ → ℕ) : 
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | n > 0 ∧ SteveMoney n > WayneMoney n ∧ ∀ (k : ℕ), k < n → SteveMoney k ≤ WayneMoney k} omnimath3498_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 1. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Because the minimal n > 0 satisfying SteveMoney n > WayneMoney n and the order property is typically n=1 when SteveMoney(n)=2n, WayneMoney(n)=n, the minimal n occurs at 1.
