The problem defines a probability related to outcomes where there are w wins, l losses, and t ties, with total outcomes 6, and w > l. The probability is based on a multinomial distribution with each outcome having probability 1/3. The task is to compute this probability, simplified as a fraction, without hardcoding the answer.

Approach:
- Enumerate all (w, l, t) with w+l+t=6 and w>l.
- For each, compute the multinomial coefficient: factorial(6)/(factorial(w)*factorial(l)*factorial(t))
- Multiply by p^w * p^l * p^t where p=1/3.
- Sum over all valid outcomes.
- Output the sum as an exact fraction.

To assist with the conjecture, we will print each computed probability term as a fraction for clarityâ€”avoiding floating-point errors and favoring exactness.

```python
from math import factorial
from fractions import Fraction

# Total outcomes and probability for each outcome
total = 6
p = Fraction(1, 3)

# Generate all (w, l, t) with sum = total and w > l
valid_outcomes = []
for w in range(total + 1):
    for l in range(total + 1):
        t = total - w - l
        if t < 0:
            continue
        if w > l:
            valid_outcomes.append((w, l, t))

# Compute the probability sum
prob_sum = Fraction(0, 1)

print("Enumerating outcomes and their contributions:")
for (w, l, t) in valid_outcomes:
    multinom = factorial(total) // (factorial(w) * factorial(l) * factorial(t))
    term = multinom * (p ** w) * (p ** l) * (p ** t)
    print(f"Outcome (w={w}, l={l}, t={t}): coeff={multinom}, term={term}")
    prob_sum += term

# Simplify and print the total probability as a fraction
print(f"\nTotal probability as a fraction: {prob_sum}")
```
