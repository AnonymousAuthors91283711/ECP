The problem defines a setting where we are considering a minimal number of planes needed to cover all non-zero integer points within an n×n×n cube. Each plane is represented as an equation `a*x + b*y + c*z = 0` with non-zero coefficients, and all points inside the cube must be covered by these planes. The goal is to find the minimal such number `k`, and the theorem states that this minimal number is `olympiadbench1662_answer n`.

Since the function `olympiadbench1662_answer` is not given and the problem is at a high-school level, we interpret it as asking for the minimal number of planes to cover all points `(x,y,z)` with `1 ≤ x,y,z ≤ n`, `(x,y,z) ≠ (0,0,0)` (but the points are within the cube, thus all points are positive and within the cube).

A simple coverage approach:
- For small `n`, we can guess that:
  - For `n=2`, small number of planes suffice.
  - For larger `n`, at least need as many planes as the number of faces to cover all corners, etc.

Although the hyperminimal coverage involves complex combinatorics, an initial conjecture is that the answer might follow certain pattern, e.g., for `n=2`, 3 planes suffice (each covering one "corner" or "edge" of the cube), for other larger `n`, the number increases.

Below, we implement a simple enumeration over small `n`, testing possible number of planes from 1 up to, say, 8, to see if a coverage can be found. This is a rough approximation and only to assist in conjecture.

```python
# Enumerate minimal number of planes needed to cover all points in 1<n<=4 cubes
from itertools import product, combinations

def cover_points(n, max_planes):
    # Generate all points in the cube except the origin
    points = [(x, y, z) for x in range(1, n+1) 
                        for y in range(1, n+1) 
                        for z in range(1, n+1)]

    for k in range(1, max_planes + 1):
        # Generate all combinations of planes represented by coefficients (a,b,c)
        # For simplicity, coefficients are small integers from -1 to 1
        candidate_planes = []
        for a in [-1, 0, 1]:
            for b in [-1, 0, 1]:
                for c in [-1, 0, 1]:
                    if (a, b, c) != (0, 0, 0):
                        candidate_planes.append((a, b, c))
        # Generate all sets of k planes
        for planes in combinations(candidate_planes, k):
            # Check coverage
            covered = set()
            for p in points:
                for (a, b, c) in planes:
                    if a * p[0] + b * p[1] + c * p[2] == 0:
                        covered.add(p)
                        break
            if len(covered) == len(points):
                print(f"Found coverage with {k} planes using coefficients: {planes}")
                return k
    return None

for n in range(2, 5):
    answer = cover_points(n, 8)
    print(f"Minimal number of planes for n={n} is at most {answer}")
```
