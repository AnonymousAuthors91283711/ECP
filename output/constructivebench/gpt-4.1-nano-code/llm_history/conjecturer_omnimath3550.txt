. Enumerated answers: m = 1: Factorization of P_m(x): 1
m = 2: Factorization of P_m(x): 1
m = 4: Factorization of P_m(x): 1
m = 8: Factorization of P_m(x): 1
m = 9: Factorization of P_m(x): 1
Values of m where P_m(x) factors over ℤ: [1, 2, 4, 8, 9]. Expected Answer Type: Set ℤ
The polynomial factors over ℤ only for m in {1,2,4,8,9}, i.e., when P_m has a nontrivial factorization. Thus, the set of such m is precisely those values. Final answer: <<<{1, 2, 4, 8, 9}>>>
