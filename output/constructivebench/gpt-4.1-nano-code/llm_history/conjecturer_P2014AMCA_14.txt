theorem P2014AMCA_14 :
  IsLeast {c : ℕ | ∃ a b : ℕ, a < b ∧ b < c ∧ b - a = c - b ∧ c * a = b * b} P2014AMCA_14_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Least c satisfying conditions: None. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the enumeration indicates no such c exists that satisfies all conditions, the minimal such c is none, i.e., no element exists in the set. Therefore, the answer should be zero, representing the minimal element of an empty set in ℕ.
