This problem involves finding the number of solutions θ in (0, 2π] satisfying the equation:

\[ 5 \cos(3\theta) = 3 \sin \theta - 1 \]

Given the trigonometric complexity, we can test θ in small increments over the interval (0, 2π], and check for solutions using approximate numerical methods. To avoid missing solutions, we'll choose a sufficiently fine step size (e.g., 0.01 radians) and count how many solutions satisfy the equation within a small numerical tolerance.

Here's a Python program that enumerates possible solutions by discretization, then counts the approximate solutions matching the equation:

```python
import math

# Define the function to check
def f(theta):
    return 5 * math.cos(3 * theta) - (3 * math.sin(theta) - 1)

# Parameters
start = 0.0001  # just above 0 to avoid boundary issues
end = 2 * math.pi
step = 0.01   # discretization step size
tolerance = 1e-4

count_solutions = 0
prev_value = f(start - step)

# Enumerate solutions
theta_values = []
theta = start
while theta <= end:
    current_value = f(theta)
    # Check for sign change indicating a root in [theta - step, theta]
    if prev_value * current_value <= 0:
        # Approximate root location by bisection or midpoint
        low, high = theta - step, theta
        for _ in range(20):
            mid = (low + high) / 2
            f_mid = f(mid)
            if abs(f_mid) < tolerance:
                theta_solution = mid
                break
            if prev_value * f_mid <= 0:
                high = mid
                current_value = f_mid
            else:
                low = mid
        else:
            theta_solution = (low + high) / 2
        # Record solution
        print(f"Solution at θ ≈ {theta_solution:.4f}")
        count_solutions += 1
    prev_value = current_value
    theta += step

print(f"Total approximate solutions: {count_solutions}")
```
