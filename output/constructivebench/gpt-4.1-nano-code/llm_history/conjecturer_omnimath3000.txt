. Enumerated answers: 19 = 2 + 17
21 = 2 + 19
23 cannot be expressed as sum of two primes.
25 = 2 + 23
27 cannot be expressed as sum of two primes.
Total elements expressible as sum of two primes: 3. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The expressible elements are 19, 21, and 25. 19=2+17, 21=2+19, 25=2+23, all with prime summands. 23 and 27 cannot. So, the answer is 3.
