This problem involves solving the equation \(m + 1 = \frac{n - 2}{3}\) for integers \(m\) and \(n\), then computing \(3m - n\). 

Since \(m, n \in \mathbb{Z}\), the equation implies \(n - 2\) must be divisible by 3. Let's proceed by enumerating small integer pairs \((m, n)\) satisfying the divisibility condition, then compute \(3m - n\).

We'll choose small ranges for \(m\) and \(n\), print each candidate answer immediately, and print the extremal value at the end.

```python
# Enumerate small integer pairs (m, n) satisfying (n - 2) divisible by 3
# and m + 1 = (n - 2)/3, then compute 3m - n.

results = []

# Define small range for m
for m in range(-10, 11):
    # n = 3*(m + 1) + 2 (derived from the equation)
    n = 3 * (m + 1) + 2
    answer = 3 * m - n
    # Print each answer immediately
    print(f"m={m}, n={n}, 3m - n={answer}")
    results.append(answer)

# Output the minimal and maximal results for completeness
print(f"Minimal answer: {min(results)}")
print(f"Maximal answer: {max(results)}")
```
