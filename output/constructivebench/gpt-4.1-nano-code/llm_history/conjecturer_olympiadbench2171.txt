The current proposed answer is attempting to define a set containing a lambda expression directly with braces `{ }`, which is not valid syntax in Lean. Instead, the syntax for a set of functions defined by a property P is `Set {f : ℚ → ℚ | P f}`.

Given the candidate solutions from enumeration are linear functions `f(x) = ±x`, it suggests the solutions are functions of the form `f(x) = s * x` where `s ∈ { -1, 1 }`. The set should then include exactly those functions.

Therefore, the correct answer is to define the set as follows:
`Set {f : ℚ → ℚ | ∀ x, f x = s * x for some s ∈ { -1, 1 } }.`

In order to compactly represent the set, we can specify the set of functions which are linear with slope either 1 or -1.

Final Lean answer:
<<<
{f : ℚ → ℚ | ∃ s : ℚ, (s = 1 ∨ s = -1) ∧ ∀ x, f x = s * x}
>>>

This defines the set of functions `f` with the property that there exists a scalar `s` equal to either 1 or -1 such that `f(x) = s * x` for all `x`, aligning with the observed candidate solutions and properly conforming to Lean syntax.
