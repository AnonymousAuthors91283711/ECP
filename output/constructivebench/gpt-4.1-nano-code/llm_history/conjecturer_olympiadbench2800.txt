  olympiadbench2800_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found minimal n: 11
Answer: 11
. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the enumeration and pattern, the minimal n satisfies the interval conditions based on θ's congruence classes, ensuring a θ in each quadrants with minimal n. The smallest n meeting all these conditions is 11.
