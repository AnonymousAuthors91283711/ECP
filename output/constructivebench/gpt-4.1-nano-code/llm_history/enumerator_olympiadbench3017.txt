This problem appears to involve transforming a sequence with morph operations, looking for the minimal number of operations needed to produce a sequence that is an arithmetic progression. The goal seems to be to find the least `n` such that applying `morph_sequence` to the initial sequence `[1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,9,9,10,10]` iteratively produces an arithmetic progression.

Since the problem asks to find the minimal such `n`, I will write a script that simulates increasing application counts, printing sequences until an arithmetic progression is achieved, and then report that minimal `n`.

**Approach:**
- Iterate `n` from 0 upwards.
- For each `n`, compute `morph_sequence` on the initial sequence.
- Check if the resulting sequence is an arithmetic progression.
- Once found, print `n` and the resulting sequence.

This approach efficiently finds the minimal `n` and stops immediately when the condition is satisfied.

```python
def is_arithmetic_progression(seq):
    if len(seq) < 2:
        return True
    diff = seq[1] - seq[0]
    return all(y - x == diff for x, y in zip(seq, seq[1:]))

def morph_condition(a, b):
    return a + 1 < b - 1

def morph_operation(seq):
    if len(seq) < 2:
        return seq
    a, b, *rest = seq
    if morph_condition(a, b):
        return [a + 1, b - 1] + rest
    else:
        return [a, b] + rest

def morph_sequence(seq, n):
    for _ in range(n):
        seq = morph_operation(seq)
    return seq

initial_seq = [1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,9,9,10,10]

# Search for minimal n
n = 0
while True:
    s = morph_sequence(initial_seq, n)
    if is_arithmetic_progression(s):
        print(f"Minimal n: {n}")
        print("Resulting sequence:", s)
        break
    n += 1
```
