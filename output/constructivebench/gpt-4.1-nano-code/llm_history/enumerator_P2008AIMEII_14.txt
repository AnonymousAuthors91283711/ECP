The problem appears to involve finding the greatest possible value of some ratio involving \( a \) and \( b \) under the given constraints, which relate to geometric conditions involving \( x, y \), and the given equations. To assist in conjecturing the true answer, I'll focus on sampling small values for \( a \) and \( b \) within the constraints and systematically checking for the maximum of the ratio \(\sqrt{(x,y) \text{ satisfying the conditions}}\).

I'll implement a brute-force search over small ranges for \( a \) and \( b \), and find the maximum ratio \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\), which the original theorem likely relates to.

```python
import math

# Sample small ranges for a and b, with a > 0 and b > 0, b ≤ a
max_a = 10
max_b = 10
step = 0.1

max_ratio = 0
max_params = (0, 0)
for a in [i * step for i in range(1, int(max_a / step) + 1)]:
    for b in [j * step for j in range(1, int(a / step) + 1)]:  # ensure b ≤ a
        # Search over possible x, y
        for x_int in range(int(-a*10), int(a*10)+1):
            x = x_int / 10
            for y_int in range(int(-a*10), int(a*10)+1):
                y = y_int / 10
                # Check the constraints
                if 0 <= x < a and 0 <= y < b:
                    # Check the equations
                    lhs1 = a**2
                    rhs1 = x**2 + y**2 + x*y
                    lhs2 = b**2
                    rhs2 = x**2 + y**2
                    if abs(lhs1 - rhs1) < 1e-3 and abs(lhs2 - rhs2) < 1e-3:
                        # Compute the ratio
                        ratio = math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
                        if ratio > max_ratio:
                            max_ratio = ratio
                            max_params = (a, b, x, y)
                            print(f"New max ratio: {ratio:.3f} with a={a:.2f}, b={b:.2f}, x={x:.2f}, y={y:.2f}")
# After the search, output the ratio and parameters
print(f"Maximum ratio found: {max_ratio:.3f} with parameters a={max_params[0]:.2f}, b={max_params[1]:.2f}, x={max_params[2]:.2f}, y={max_params[3]:.2f}")
```
