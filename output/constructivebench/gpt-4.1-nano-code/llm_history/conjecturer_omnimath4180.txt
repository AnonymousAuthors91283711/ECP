The pattern suggests the answer involves values of m where the division conditions relate to the divisibility of choose n (m - 2 * n) by (m - 2 * n). By analyzing enumerated options, special small values emerge as the solution set. The pattern indicates that m's reliant on factors of 6, or small integers where the divisibility holds.

The set comprises small integers satisfying these properties, notably including 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, with no indication of larger values satisfying the constraint systematically.

Thus, the answer set is {2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10}, which can be expressed as:

10. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
Given the enumerated values (2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10) and analyzing the divisibility properties and the pattern, the likely set of m satisfying the condition is finite and includes these specific small integers. The pattern suggests these particular values are those for which, whenever the division constraints hold, the binomial coefficient divisibility property also holds.

The main issue with the current attempted answer is that it's only a set literal, but in Lean, we need to explicitly define a set of natural numbers, typically via `Set.ofList` or similar, or by defining a predicate set.

Given the context and the enumerated elements, the most straightforward closed-form answer is the finite set {2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10}. To satisfy Lean syntax and maintain a set of ℕ, we can write:

```lean
{2,3,4,5,7,10}
```

Wrap in the `Set` constructor to match the declaration:

```lean
{2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10}
```

which in Lean is interpreted as a `Set ℕ`.

**Final answer:**

<<<{2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10}>>

**Summary of reasoning:** The enumeration aligns with small integers that satisfy the divisibility condition based on the pattern and analysis. Since the provided attempt had a syntax error near "to," the correct way to write an explicit finite set in Lean is simply using `{ ... }`. This completes the formalization, satisfying the consistency with enumerated solutions and proper Lean syntax.
