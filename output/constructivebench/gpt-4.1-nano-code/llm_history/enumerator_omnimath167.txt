The problem appears to explore whether for a natural number \( n \geq 2 \), the expression \( 2^{2^n} \mod (2^n - 1) \) can be a perfect power \( 4^k \).

Analyzing the problem:
- \( 2^{2^n} \) is a power of 2.
- \( 4^k = (2^2)^k = 2^{2k} \). So the question reduces to whether \( 2^{2^n} \equiv 2^{2k} \pmod{2^n - 1} \).
- For the equality \( 2^{2^n} \equiv 2^{2k} \pmod{2^n - 1} \), the difference of exponents modulo the order of 2 modulo \( 2^n - 1 \) matters.

Next, we will:
- Check for small \( n \geq 2 \) whether the residue is a power of 4.
- For each \( n \), compute \( 2^{2^n} \mod (2^n - 1) \).
- Check if this result is a power of 4 (\( 4^k \)).

Here's the code:

```python
# Script to test small n for the property:
# whether 2^{2^n} mod (2^n - 1) is a power of 4

def is_power_of_4(x):
    # Check if x is a power of 4
    # A number is a power of 4 if it is > 0 and binary form has only one '1' at an even position
    return x > 0 and (x & (x - 1)) == 0 and (x.bit_length() - 1) % 2 == 0

max_n = 20  # Limit search to small n for efficiency
for n in range(2, max_n + 1):
    modulus = 2 ** n - 1
    val = pow(2, 2 ** n, modulus)
    print(f"n={n}, 2^{2 ** n} mod {modulus} = {val}")
    if is_power_of_4(val):
        print(f"Found n={n} where the residue is a power of 4: {val}")
```
