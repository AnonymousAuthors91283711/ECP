. Enumerated answers: 2
5. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The pattern suggests that the values of n are specific integers where the divisibility condition holds, and from the enumeration, 2 and 5 fit this pattern. The set of all such n can be described as those integers satisfying the divisibility, which appears to be limited to these specific values based on the given enumeration. Thus, the generalized set should explicitly include just these solutions.
