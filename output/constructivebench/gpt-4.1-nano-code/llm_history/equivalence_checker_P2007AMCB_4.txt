Ground Truth Answer: 16 / 20
Proposed Answer: (4/5 : ℚ)
<<<True>>>

The proposed answer (4/5 : ℚ) is equivalent to the ground truth answer (16/20) because when simplified, both fractions reduce to the same value (4/5). The simplification of 16/20 by dividing numerator and denominator by 4 yields 4/5. Therefore, the answers are mathematically equivalent.
