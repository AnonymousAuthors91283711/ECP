[write_program]
This problem involves an infinite sum over \( k \) of a floor function involving square roots and powers of 4, summed over natural numbers. To assist with conjecturing, I'll write a Python program to evaluate partial sums for small values of \( k \), using a fixed parameter (the divisor 2000000), and check the sum where the summand becomes negligible or zero. This allows us to see the pattern and approximate the total sum.

Since the formula inside the sum is:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{1 + \sqrt{\frac{2000000}{4^k}}}{2} \right\rfloor
\]
I'll evaluate this for increasing \( k \) until the terms become zero or negligible. The program prints each term and the cumulative sum immediately, to help conjecture the total sum.

```python
import math

# Fixed parameter
param = 2000000

# Initialize total sum
total_sum = 0

# Loop over k from 0 to a reasonably small upper bound
for k in range(0, 50):
    denominator = 4 ** k
    value = param / denominator
    sqrt_val = math.sqrt(value)
    inside_floor = (1 + sqrt_val) / 2
    term = math.floor(inside_floor)
    # Output the current term and the cumulative sum
    print(f"k={k}, term={term}")
    if term == 0:
        # Once terms become zero, subsequent are likely zero as well
        break
    total_sum += term

print(f"Partial sum up to k={k}: {total_sum}")
```
