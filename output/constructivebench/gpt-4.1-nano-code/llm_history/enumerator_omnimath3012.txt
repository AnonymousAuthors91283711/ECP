The problem asks for the number of integers k between 1 and 20 (inclusive) such that 9 divides k². Since 9 divides k² if and only if 3 divides k (because 9 = 3²), we are counting the integers from 1 to 20 that are multiples of 3.

Let's find all such k in the range [1, 20].

```python
# Enumerate k from 1 to 20
results = []
for k in range(1, 21):
    if (k ** 2) % 9 == 0:
        # 9 divides k^2 if and only if 3 divides k
        if k % 3 == 0:
            results.append(k)
            print(k)  # Stream partial results

# Count the total such k
answer = len(results)
print("Total count:", answer)
```
