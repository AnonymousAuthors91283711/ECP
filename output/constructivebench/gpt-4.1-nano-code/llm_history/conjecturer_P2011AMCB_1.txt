. Enumerated answers: Answer: 7/12. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The pattern suggests the answer involves a specific constant ratio between the sums. Given the enumerated answer 7/12, the conjecture is that the simplified form is constant, independent of the sum components. Based on the problem structure, the final answer reduces to the ratio 7/12.

<<<(7 : ℚ) / 12>>>
