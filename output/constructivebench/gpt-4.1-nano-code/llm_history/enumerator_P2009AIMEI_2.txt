This problem involves exploring complex products related to an integer \( n \), with constraints on the imaginary part of a complex number \( z \), which is the product of specific complex factors. The key is to understand and analyze the structure of

\[
z = \prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \left( 1 + (k+1) i \right),
\]

and find the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that \( \operatorname{Im}(z) = 164 \).

Given the product, \( z \), its imaginary part depends on the factors \( 1 + (k+1)i \): in particular, we're asked to find the minimal \( n \) for which this imaginary part equals 164.

Since the imaginary parts of the factors are linear and the factors are complex conjugates with known imaginary parts, we can explore this by enumerating \( n \), calculating the product, and extracting the imaginary part.

Here's a Python program that computes \( \operatorname{Im}(z) \) for successive \( n \) and identifies the minimal \( n \) where the imaginary part reaches 164.

```python
import math
import cmath

target_imag = 164
n = 1

# Continue increasing n until imaginary part >= target
while True:
    product = 1 + 0j  # initialize complex product
    for k in range(n):
        factor = complex(1, (k + 1))
        product *= factor
    imag_part = product.imag
    # Print the current n and imaginary part for progress tracking
    print(f"n = {n}, Imaginary Part = {imag_part}")
    if imag_part >= target_imag:
        if abs(imag_part - target_imag) < 1e-6:
            print(f"Found n = {n} with Im(z) approximately {imag_part}")
        else:
            print(f"At n = {n}, Im(z) = {imag_part} (exceeds or close to 164)")
        if abs(imag_part - target_imag) < 1e-6:
            break
    n += 1
```

This code sequentially computes the imaginary part of the product for increasing \( n \) and reports progress. Once \( \operatorname{Im}(z) \) is approximately 164 (within a small tolerance), it will output that \( n \).

Note: The actual minimal \( n \) can be precisely determined when the imaginary part equals 164 exactly (or within a tiny tolerance). The approach is efficient for this problem's scope and fits within provided constraints.
