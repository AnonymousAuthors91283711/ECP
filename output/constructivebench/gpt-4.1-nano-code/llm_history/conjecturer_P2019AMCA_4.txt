Maximum n: 45. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern indicates the sum ∑ i=0 to n-1 of (k + i) equals 45. For fixed n, this sum becomes n*k + (n*(n-1))/2. To maximize n, take k=0, so sum is (n*(n-1))/2. Set this equal to 45: n*(n-1)/2 = 45 → n*(n-1) = 90 → n^2 - n - 90 = 0. Solving quadratic yields n=10 or n=-9. Only positive n is relevant, so n=10 with k=0 gives the maximum solution.
