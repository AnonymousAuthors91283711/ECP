This problem involves trigonometric expressions with fixed angles. To assist in conjecturing and verifying the simplified value, I will enumerate possible values based on rational approximations of the involved constants, focusing on the specific case of 20 degrees. Since the problem features exact trigonometric functions with rational multiples of Ï€, a good approach is to evaluate the expressions numerically for this fixed angle and attempt to recognize patterns or exact values.

I'll:

- Define the angle in degrees and radians.
- Compute tangent, sine, and their squares.
- Compute the numerator and denominator of the given expression.
- Simplify and check for known exact values.
- Print the approximate results to help identify a pattern.

Here's the code implementing this approach.

```python
import math

# Define the fixed angle in degrees and radians
angle_deg = 20
angle_rad = math.radians(angle_deg)

# Compute necessary trig functions
tan_value = math.tan(angle_rad)
sin_value = math.sin(angle_rad)

# Compute their squares
tan_sq = tan_value ** 2
sin_sq = sin_value ** 2

# Calculate numerator and denominator
numerator = tan_sq - sin_sq
denominator = tan_sq * sin_sq

# Compute the result
result = numerator / denominator

# Print the computed values for inspection
print(f"Angle: {angle_deg} degrees ({angle_rad} radians)")
print(f"tan({angle_deg}) = {tan_value}")
print(f"sin({angle_deg}) = {sin_value}")
print(f"tan^2 = {tan_sq}")
print(f"sin^2 = {sin_sq}")
print(f"Numerator: {numerator}")
print(f"Denominator: {denominator}")
print(f"Expression value: {result}")
```
