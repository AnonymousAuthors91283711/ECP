The problem involves positive integers \(a, b, c\) with the constraints \(a = b\) and \(abc = 128\). We need to find \(a + b + c\).

Since \(a = b\) and \(a, b, c > 0\), the key is to find all positive divisors \(a\) (and \(b\)) such that \(ab c = 128\). Because \(a = b\), then \(a^2 c = 128\).

Let's enumerate all positive integer solutions of \(a^2 c = 128\), with \(a > 0, c > 0\). For each \(a\), \(c = 128 / a^2\) must be a positive integer, so \(a^2\) must divide 128. The divisors of 128 are \(1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128\).

Now, check for those divisors being perfect squares:

- \(a^2 = 1\) → \(a=1\), \(c=128/1=128\), sum: \(a + a + c=2a + c=2*1 + 128 = 130\)
- \(a^2=4\) → \(a=2\), \(c=128/4=32\), sum: \(2*2 + 32=4 + 32=36\)
- \(a^2=16\) → \(a=4\), \(c=128/16=8\), sum: \(2*4 + 8=8 + 8=16\)
- \(a^2=64\) → \(a=8\), \(c=128/64=2\), sum: \(2*8+2=16 + 2=18\)

Other divisors (like 2, 8, 32, 128) are not perfect squares, so no solutions.

The sums for all solutions are 130, 36, 16, and 18. The minimal sum is 16.

The program will enumerate the solutions systematically and print each sum.

```python
# Enumerate all positive divisors a where a^2 divides 128
# For each such a, compute c = 128 / a^2 and sum a + a + c
# Print all possible sums, then identify the minimal sum

# List of divisors of 128
divisors = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128]

for a_squared in divisors:
    # Check if a_squared is a perfect square divisor of 128
    # Since we're iterating over divisors, a_squared already divides 128
    # Find 'a' as the integer square root
    a = int(a_squared ** 0.5)
    if a * a == a_squared:
        c = 128 // a_squared
        sum_ac = 2 * a + c
        print(sum_ac)
```
