Ground Truth Answer: 600 / 7
Proposed Answer: 85.7
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a scenario where:
   - Trains depart every 3 minutes (0.05 hours)
   - Linh is passed by trains every 10 minutes (≈0.1667 hours)
   - Linh's speed is 60 km/h
   - We need to find the train speed v

2. The equation setup is correct:
   passing_interval = train_distance / relative_speed
   10/60 = (v * 3/60) / (v - 60)

3. Solving this equation:
   (10/60)(v - 60) = (3/60)v
   (1/6)(v - 60) = (1/20)v
   (10/60 - 3/60)v = 10
   (7/60)v = 10
   v = 600/7 ≈ 85.714

4. The ground truth answer is exact (600/7)
   The proposed answer is a decimal approximation (85.7)

While the proposed answer is numerically close to the correct value, it's not mathematically equivalent to the exact fraction. However, it's a reasonable decimal approximation.
