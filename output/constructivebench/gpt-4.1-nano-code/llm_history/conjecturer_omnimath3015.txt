9376
24. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern of enumerated answers suggests they are specific numbers involving powers of 10 and related to the sequence of the sums of digits. Observing the sequence: 0, 6, 76, 376, 9376, and considering the problem's structure, the number 376 is a prominent candidate aligned with earlier solutions involving repeated digit patterns.

Given the sequence, the pattern suggests that the final answer is 9376, which aligns with known sums involving such digit or power patterns in similar problems.

<<<37 * 256 + 376>>>

or, directly noting the pattern, it simplifies to ꟸ 9376.
