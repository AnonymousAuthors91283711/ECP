128. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The condition \((n.divisors).card^3 = 4 * n\) simplifies noticing that for small n, divisors counts are perfect cubes, with \(d(n)^3 = 4 n\). Since 4 divides \(n\) and divisor count, and considering small divisors, minimal solution is \(n=128\).

Answer:
<<<{128}>>>
