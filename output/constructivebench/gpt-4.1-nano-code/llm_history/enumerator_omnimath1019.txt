The problem involves summing over all pairs (a, b) with a and b in range 8, computing ((a + 1) * (b + 1) % 8) as a rational number, and then dividing the total sum by 64 to get the answer. To assist, I'll write a Python program to enumerate all possible sums explicitly, compute the total sum, and calculate the final value, thus helping to conjecture or verify the answer.

The program:
- Iterates over a, b in [0..7]
- Computes ((a + 1) * (b + 1)) % 8
- Sums all these values
- Divides the sum by 64 and prints the final answer as a float or rational approximation

```python
# Enumerate all pairs (a, b) with 0 <= a, b <= 7
# Calculate ((a + 1) * (b + 1)) % 8 for each pair
# Sum all these values
# Divide by 64 to find the average

total_sum = 0
for a in range(8):
    for b in range(8):
        total_sum += ((a + 1) * (b + 1)) % 8

# Compute the final answer as a rational number
final_answer = total_sum / 64

print("Total sum:", total_sum)
print("Final answer as fraction:", total_sum, "/ 64 =", final_answer)
```
