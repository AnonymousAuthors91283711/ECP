The problem asks to analyze the set of positive integers \( a \) satisfying a particular algebraic relation involving parameters \( m \) and \( n \), both at least 3, and determine for which \((m,n)\) this set is infinite. Our goal is to enumerate solutions to conjecture the nature of this set.

Given the structure, the general approach:
- Fix small values for \( m \) and \( n \) (with \( m,n \ge 3 \))
- For each pair, check whether there are infinitely many \( a \) satisfying \( a^m + a - 1 = k \cdot (a^n + a^2 - 1) \), for some \( k \)
- Since handling infinite sets directly is impossible, approximate by checking large \( a \) up to a threshold to see if solutions persist
- Since the problem is high-level and abstract, start with small parameter values and small \( a \)

The program will:
- Loop over small \( m, n \)
- For a range of \( a \), check the equation
- Collect all pairs \((m, n)\) for which solutions appear repeatedly implying potential infinitude
- Output all such pairs immediately

Below is the implementation:

```python
# Enumerate pairs (m, n) with m, n >= 3 within small bounds
# For each pair, check for solutions in a range of a's
# Collect pairs that have solutions, and print immediately when found

max_m = 5
max_n = 5
max_a = 1000  # range limit for a to approximate infinity
found_pairs = set()

for m in range(3, max_m + 1):
    for n in range(3, max_n + 1):
        solutions_found = False
        for a in range(1, max_a + 1):
            numerator = a ** m + a - 1
            denominator_expr = a ** n + a ** 2 - 1
            if denominator_expr == 0:
                continue
            if numerator % denominator_expr == 0:
                k = numerator // denominator_expr
                # Check if k is positive (likely, given positive a, m, n)
                if k > 0:
                    # Immediately print pair upon first solution for this a
                    print(f"m={m}, n={n}, a={a}, k={k}")
                    solutions_found = True
        if solutions_found:
            # Consider this pair as likely part of the answer set
            print(f"Possible infinite set for (m, n)=({m}, {n})")
            found_pairs.add((m, n))
```
