[write_program]
This problem appears to involve polynomial evaluation and properties relating evaluations at \( z \) and \( 1/z \), possibly discovering some algebraic relation. To explore candidates, I'll generate some specific example polynomials \( P \) with various degrees (excluding degree 0, since \( P \) is not degree 0), and check the property for various \( z \neq 0 \).

Since the problem asks for an enumeration and an exploration of possible polynomials, I'll:
- Choose sample polynomials like monomials, quadratics, cubics.
- For each polynomial, test several nonzero values of \( z \).
- Check the relation provided.
- Stream candidates that satisfy the condition.

This will serve to conjecture and guide the proof, avoiding hardcoding and focusing on meaningful patterns.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Define sample polynomials with degrees 1, 2, 3
degree_samples = {
    1: [sp.Poly(sp.symbols('x')), 
        sp.Poly(sp.symbols('x') + 1), 
        sp.Poly(2 * sp.symbols('x') - 3)],
    2: [sp.Poly(sp.symbols('x')**2 + 1),
        sp.Poly(sp.symbols('x')**2 - 4),
        sp.Poly(3*sp.symbols('x')**2 + 2*sp.symbols('x') + 1)],
    3: [sp.Poly(sp.symbols('x')**3 - 2*sp.symbols('x') + 1),
        sp.Poly(2*sp.symbols('x')**3 + sp.symbols('x') - 5)]
}

# Define sample z values avoiding zero
z_values = [1, 2, -1, -2, 0.5, -0.5]

# Store candidates matching the property
candidates = []

for deg, polys in degree_samples.items():
    for P in polys:
        for z in z_values:
            if z == 0:
                continue
            # Evaluate P at z and 1/z
            eval_z = P.eval(z)
            eval_1_over_z = P.eval(1/z)
            # Avoid division by zero
            if eval_z == 0 or eval_1_over_z == 0:
                continue
            lhs = 1 / eval_z + 1 / eval_1_over_z
            rhs = z + 1/z
            # Check the relation
            if abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-6:
                # Candidate polynomial satisfies the property
                candidates.append((P, z))
                print(f"Polynomial: {P.as_expr()}, z: {z}, eval_z: {eval_z}, eval_1/z: {eval_1_over_z}, lhs: {lhs}, rhs: {rhs}")

# Output collected candidates for further analysis or conjecture
```
