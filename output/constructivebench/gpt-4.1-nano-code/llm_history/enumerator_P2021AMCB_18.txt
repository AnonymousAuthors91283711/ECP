The problem involves a complex variable \( z \) and an equation relating the norms of related complex expressions. We want to analyze the solutions \( z \) satisfying:

\[ 12 \|z\|^2 = 2 \|z+2\|^2 + \|z^2+1\|^2 + 31 \]

and then find \( z + \frac{6}{z} \).

To explore possible solutions numerically, we'll parametrize \( z = x + iy \), with \( x, y \in \mathbb{R} \), and evaluate the given condition over a small grid of \( (x,y) \) values. For each candidate satisfying the condition approximately, we will compute \( z + 6/z \) and print it.

Here's an efficient enumeration approach to approximate the solutions:

```python
import numpy as np

# Set up a grid of points in the complex plane
x_vals = np.linspace(-10, 10, 200)
y_vals = np.linspace(-10, 10, 200)

for x in x_vals:
    for y in y_vals:
        z = x + 1j*y
        if abs(z) < 1e-8:
            continue  # Avoid division by zero
        norm_z2 = abs(z)**2
        norm_z_plus2 = abs(z + 2)**2
        norm_z2_plus1 = abs(z**2 + 1)**2
        lhs = 12 * norm_z2
        rhs = 2 * norm_z_plus2 + norm_z2_plus1 + 31
        if abs(lhs - rhs) < 0.1:
            # Candidate solution found
            answer = z + 6 / z
            print(answer)
```
