abbrev omnimath3952_answer : ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3952 (f : ℝ → ℝ) (hpos : ∀ x > 0, f x > 0) :
  (∀ x > 0, ∀ y > 0, f (x + f (x * y)) + y = f x * f y + 1) ↔ f = omnimath3952_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Linear solution: f(x) = 1*x + 1

Possible solutions found:
f(x) = 1x + 1
. Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
The pattern indicates the solution is linear with coefficient 1 and intercept 1, based on the enumeration. The canditate is f(x) = x + 1. 

Therefore, I propose expressing the answer as a closed form function with the structure suggested by the pattern:

<<<fun x : ℝ => x + 1>>>
