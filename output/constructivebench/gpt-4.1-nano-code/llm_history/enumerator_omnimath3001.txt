[write_program]
The goal is to evaluate the expression `2 + 3 * 5 + 2` and find the answer to assign to `omnimath3001_answer`. Since the expression is straightforward, I will compute its value and immediately print it, following the instructions to stream answers.

```python
# Python program to compute the value of 2 + 3 * 5 + 2 immediately upon execution
# matching the specified expression in the theorem.

# Compute the expression
result = 2 + 3 * 5 + 2

# Print the result immediately
print(result)
```
