This problem appears to be a high-school level diophantine-like equation involving powers:  
\[ 2013^x + 2014^y = 2015^z \]  
where \( x, y, z \) are non-negative integers. The goal is to find all triplets \((x, y, z)\) satisfying this equation.

Given the difficulty of directly solving such exponential equations, and considering this is a competition-level problem, we can try small values with Python to identify any solutions or patterns, since larger values will quickly grow beyond manageable ranges.

Approach:
- Fix small ranges for \( x, y \), and check if the sum \( 2013^x + 2014^y \) equals a power \( 2015^z \) for some small \( z \).
- Collect solutions as they appear with the first goal of discovering patterns or solutions.
- If solutions are sparse, print them directly.

Here's the Python code:

```python
# Enumeration of small possible solutions for 2013^x + 2014^y = 2015^z
# Limit ranges for x, y, z to small values for efficiency and feasibility
max_x = 10
max_y = 10
max_z = 20  # Zlimit, since powers grow fast

solutions = []

for x in range(max_x + 1):
    pow_x = 2013 ** x
    for y in range(max_y + 1):
        pow_y = 2014 ** y
        total = pow_x + pow_y
        # Check if total is a perfect power of 2015 within range of z
        for z in range(max_z + 1):
            pow_z = 2015 ** z
            if pow_z == total:
                print(f"Solution found: x={x}, y={y}, z={z}")
                solutions.append((x, y, z))
            # Since powers grow quickly, break early if pow_z exceeds total
            if pow_z > total:
                break
```

This code searches small ranges for solutions and prints each found triplet immediately, aiding pattern recognition or conjecture formation.
