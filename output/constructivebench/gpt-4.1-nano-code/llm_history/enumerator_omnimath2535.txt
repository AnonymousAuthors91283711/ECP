This problem asks us to find all real numbers \( x \) such that \((x^2 + 2x + 3)^{(x^2 + 2x + 3)^{(x^2 + 2x + 3)}} = 2012\). The theorem seeks a finite set \( s \) of such \( x \), and the sum of all these solutions.

---

Because directly solving the exponential equation algebraically can be challenging, we can approach the problem numerically:

- Define \( y = x^2 + 2x + 3 \), then the equation simplifies to \( y^{y^y} = 2012 \).
- For each candidate \( y \), check if \( y^{y^y} \) is approximately 2012.

Our plan:

- Enumerate \( y \) over small, plausible values where \( y^{y^y} \) is near 2012.
- For each such \( y \), solve \( x^2 + 2x + 3 = y \), which is a quadratic.
- For each real root \( x \), check if the original equation holds within a small tolerance.
- Collect these \( x \) values into a set \( s \).

Let's implement this with a small grid of \( y \) values around the suspected range.

```python
import math

# Define the target value
TARGET = 2012
tolerance = 1e-5

# List to store solutions
solutions = set()

# Range of y to test: based on rough estimation, y should be around where y^{y^y} â‰ˆ 2012
# y must be > 0 and reasonable (since y^{y^y} grows super-exponentially).
# Pick y from about 1 to 4
for y in [i/10.0 for i in range(10, 41)]:  # y from 1.0 to 4.0 in steps of 0.1
    try:
        val = y**(y**y)
    except:
        continue
    if abs(val - TARGET) < 50:  # broad check, since y^y grows rapidly
        # Solve x^2 + 2x + (3 - y) = 0
        a, b, c = 1, 2, 3 - y
        discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c
        if discriminant >= 0:
            for sign in [1, -1]:
                x = (-b + sign * math.sqrt(discriminant)) / (2 * a)
                # Check if this x satisfies the main equation within tolerance
                y_val = x**2 + 2 * x + 3
                try:
                    check_val = y_val ** (y_val ** y_val)
                except:
                    continue
                if abs(check_val - TARGET) < tolerance:
                    print(f"Found solution x = {x} for y = {y_val}")
                    solutions.add(x)

# Sum of solutions
sum_solutions = sum(solutions)
print("Solutions:", solutions)
print("Sum of solutions:", sum_solutions)
```
