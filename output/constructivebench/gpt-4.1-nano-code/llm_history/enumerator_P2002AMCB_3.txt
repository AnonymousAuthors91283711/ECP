This problem asks us to find the number of natural numbers \( n \) such that \( 0 < n \) and \( n^2 - 3n + 2 \) is prime. To assist with conjecture and proof, we'll enumerate small values of \( n \), check the primality of \( n^2 - 3n + 2 \), and count the solutions.

Steps:
- For small \( n \), compute \( n^2 - 3n + 2 \).
- Check if this value is prime.
- Count the total such \( n \).

Let's choose a small range for \( n \) to make enumeration feasible, say from 1 to 20, since larger \( n \) will produce larger numbers and the primes become less frequent, but in this context, we just need enough to find the pattern.

```python
# Import is not needed beyond standard capabilities; we implement a primality test.
def is_prime(num):
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    if num <= 3:
        return True
    if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

count = 0
for n in range(1, 21):  # small range for enumeration
    value = n**2 - 3*n + 2
    if is_prime(value):
        print(f"n={n}, n^2 - 3n + 2 = {value} (prime)")
        count += 1
print(f"Total solutions found in range 1 to 20: {count}")
```
