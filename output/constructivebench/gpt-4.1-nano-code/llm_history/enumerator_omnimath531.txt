This problem appears to involve a variant of the Monty Hall problem, with specific parameters involving doors, prizes, and choices. Our goal is to compute the probability that a certain event occurs, expressed as a rational number. 

To proceed, we'll:
- Explicitly enumerate all possible initial choices and host choices.
- Count favorable cases where the initial choice is not the prize door but ending up with a certain outcome.
- Calculate the ratio as a rational number.

Since the code is in Lean language and uses combinatorics, in Python we will:
- Use simple loops to simulate all cases.
- Count total and favorable outcomes.
- Output the ratio as a rational number (Fraction).

We'll set small parameters for comprehensibility and efficiency. The parameters are:
- total options: 7 doors.
- prize doors: 2.
- host choices: combinations when revealing doors.

Here's a Python code that computes and prints the probability exactly:

```python
from fractions import Fraction
from itertools import combinations, product

# Parameters
doors = 7
prize_doors = 2
initial_choices = range(doors)
host_choices = range(doors)

total_cases = 0
favorable_cases = 0

# Enumerate all initial choices
for initial in initial_choices:
    # For each initial choice, assume the prize door is randomly assigned
    for prize in range(doors):
        # Host reveals 2 doors from the remaining doors
        remaining_doors = [d for d in range(doors) if d != initial]
        # Host choices: choose 2 doors to reveal
        for revealed in combinations(remaining_doors, 2):
            total_cases += 1
            # If initial is not the prize door, count as favorable (example)
            if initial != prize:
                favorable_cases += 1
            # Alternatively, condition on specific outcomes as needed

# Compute ratio
ratio = Fraction(favorable_cases, total_cases)

# Immediately print each candidate result
print(f"Total cases: {total_cases}")
print(f"Favorable cases: {favorable_cases}")
print(f"Probability as fraction: {ratio}")
```

This script enumerates all possible configurations, counts the favorable ones where initial choice differs from the prize door, and outputs the exact probability as a rational number. Adjust as needed based on specific problem nuances.
