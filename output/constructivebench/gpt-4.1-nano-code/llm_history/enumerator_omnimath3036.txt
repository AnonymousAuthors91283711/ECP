The problem appears to involve finding digits \( K, L, M, N \) in certain ranges such that a specific equation holds when these digits are inserted into a number. The goal is to find the value of `omnimath3036_answer` satisfying the given condition using enumeration, considering all possible digits in 0-9.

The constructed equation is:

\[ (6 \times 1000 + K \times 100 + 0 \times 10 + L) - (M \times 1000 + 9 \times 100 + N \times 10 + 4) = 2011 \]

which simplifies to:

\[ (6000 + 100K + L) - (1000M + 900 + 10N + 4) = 2011 \]

Approach:
- Enumerate all possible \( K, L, M, N \) within their range.
- Check the equation.
- When the condition is satisfied, identify the value of \( K + L + M + N \) as the answer.
- Print all candidates and the resulting sum when matching.

Here's a Python script implementing this:

```python
# Enumerate all possible digits K, L, M, N in [0, 9]
# Check the equation and output the sum K+L+M+N
# We assume the solution is unique or interested in all solutions

for K in range(10):
    for L in range(10):
        for M in range(10):
            for N in range(10):
                left_side = 6000 + 100 * K + L
                right_side = 1000 * M + 900 + 10 * N + 4
                if left_side - right_side == 2011:
                    answer = K + L + M + N
                    print(answer)
```

This code will immediately output each candidate answer matching the condition, aiding in conjectures or proofs about `omnimath3036_answer`.
