This problem appears to involve calculating a probability related to arrangements or selections involving blue and red objects, each size 5, with certain favorable outcomes. To assist in conjecturing and eventually proving the answer, I'll enumerate possible values for the probability based on the given parameters, emphasizing precise fractions first, then approximations if needed, and outputting each candidate immediately.

Since the problem involves ratios of counts, the key quantities are:
- total = 10
- favorable = 2 * [blue * (blue - 1) + red * (red - 1)] = 2 * [5 * 4 + 5 * 4] = 2 * (20 + 20) = 80
- possible = total * (total - 1) = 10 * 9 = 90

The probability is favorables / possibles = 80 / 90 = 8/9.

However, to follow the instructions, I'll generate candidates systematically over possible counts (even if the current parameters are fixed). For demonstration, I'll vary the counts up to 10 for both blue and red, compute the favorable and total counts, and output the resulting fractions or approximations to allow conjecture.

```python
# Enumerate varying counts of blue and red (up to 10), compute probability candidates
from fractions import Fraction

for blue in range(1, 11):
    for red in range(1, 11):
        total = blue + red
        favorable = 2 * (blue * (blue - 1) + red * (red - 1))
        possible = total * (total - 1)
        if possible == 0:
            continue  # Skip invalid counts
        prob_fraction = Fraction(favorable, possible)
        print(f"blue={blue}, red={red} => favorable={favorable}, possible={possible}, ratio={prob_fraction}")
        # Print the decimal approximation as well
        print(f"approx={float(prob_fraction):.4f}")
```
