The problem asks to evaluate the sum of all positive divisors of 1184, expressed as an â„• (natural number). Specifically, it's about the sum of all divisors d > 0 with d dividing 1184. The task is to compute that sum without hardcoding the answer, so I'll write a Python program to:

- Find all positive divisors of 1184.
- Sum these divisors.
- Immediately print each divisor as it is found (streaming output).

This helps in understanding the divisor structure and the sum.

```python
# Enumerate all divisors of 1184 and sum them
n = 1184
divisors = []

for d in range(1, n + 1):
    if n % d == 0:
        print(d)
        divisors.append(d)

print("Sum of divisors:", sum(divisors))
```
