The problem seems to involve functions from integers to integers, with a property related to divisibility by 23, and we're asked to find the least positive integer \(k\) such that \(f(n+k) \equiv f(n) \pmod{23}\) for all \(n\).

Given the assumption that for all \(n\), there exists \(m\) with \(f(n) = 23m\), this suggests \(f(n)\) is divisible by 23 everywhere.

Since the function outputs are multiples of 23, the values of \(f\) lie in \(23 \mathbb{Z}\). The task is to find the minimal positive period \(k\) such that \(f(n+k) \equiv f(n) \pmod{23}\).

---

To assist with conjecturing, I'll generate candidate \(k\) values, starting from 1 upwards, and check whether the property can hold — i.e., whether for all \(n\), the difference \(f(n+k) - f(n)\) is divisible by 23. Since \(f(n)\) can be arbitrary multiples of 23, the only test reduces to whether the function can be periodic modulo 23 with period \(k\).

I will choose small sample values for \(k\) and print candidate \(k\) values for which the property is possible, stopping once reaching a certain threshold (say 20), and then find the least such \(k\).

```python
# Enumerate candidate periods k from 1 up to 20
max_k = 20
possible_ks = []

print("Candidate k values where the periodicity might hold:")
for k in range(1, max_k + 1):
    # For the property to hold, for all n,
    # the difference f(n + k) - f(n) ≡ 0 mod 23
    # Since f(n) are multiples of 23, f(n) = 23 * m(n)
    # and the difference reduces to 23*(m(n + k) - m(n))
    # which is automatically divisible by 23
    # Therefore, there's no contradiction for any k; periodicity is possible
    # So, all k in [1, max_k] are candidates
    print(f"k = {k}")
    possible_ks.append(k)

# The least such k satisfying the property is the minimal candidate
min_k = min(possible_ks)
print(f"\nThe minimal period k is: {min_k}")
```
