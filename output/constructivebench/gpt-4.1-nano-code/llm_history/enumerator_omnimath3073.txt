This problem involves modular arithmetic and finding the value of \(3 \times 542 \mod 10\). The task of the code is to compute this value, print it immediately, and align with the given theorem structure. There are no parameters or extensive enumeration needed here; simply compute and output the result.

```python
# Compute 3 * 542 mod 10 and print it immediately
result = (3 * 542) % 10
print(result)
```
