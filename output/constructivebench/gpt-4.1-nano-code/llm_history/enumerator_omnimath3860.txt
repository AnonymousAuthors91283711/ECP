[write_program]
This is a formal theorem statement in Lean, involving properties of a sequence `a` defined over the finite set `Fin 2020`. Some key points:
- The sequence `(a i)` takes values in ℕ.
- Each `a i` is positive.
- For `i ≥ 2`, `a (i+1)` has divisibility properties involving `a i` and `a (i-1)`.
- The goal concerns the minimal value of `a 2019`.

Given the complexity, the problem resembles a recurrence with divisibility constraints, and the minimal value at index 2019 is of interest. To help, I will write a Python program to generate all possible sequences for small parameters (`i` up to 10 or so) with values starting from small positive integers, obeying similar divisibility rules, and examining the value at `i=2019`.

Since enumerating sequences up to `i=2019` is infeasible, choose small sample parameters (say, `n = 5`), initialize starting values, and check the divisibility rules to generate candidate sequences, then find the minimal `a 4` (or similar), which mimics the core problem.

**Note:** The core logic involves generating sequences `a` for small `i`, with positive starting values, respecting the divisibility rules for `i≥ 2`, and tracking the sequence values at the last index to find minimal possible values.

```python
# Enumerate small sequences (up to length 5) with positive starting values to identify potential minimal values
def enumerate_sequences():
    results = []
    max_i = 5  # small sample size
    # limit starting values to small integers to keep search feasible
    for a0 in range(1, 4):
        for a1 in range(1, 4):
            seq = [a0, a1]
            # Generate sequence according to the rules
            for i in range(2, max_i):
                # Find candidate for a[i] that satisfies the divisibility conditions
                candidates = []
                for candidate in range(1, 20):  # limited range
                    # Conditions:
                    # a[i] > 0 always true
                    # divisibility conditions:
                    # a[i+1] % a[i] == 0   (but note a[i+1] is being chosen)
                    # a[i+1] % (a[i] + a[i-1]) == 0
                    # Since we are generating a[i+1], reverse logic: pick a[i+1] satisfying:
                    # For given a[i], a[i-1], check whether candidate satisfies the divisibility
                    # Actually, we're selecting a[i], so for a fixed sequence,
                    # check if current a[i] satisfies the divisibility with previous
                    # But the rules specify the next term divisibility, so for forward generation:
                    # Let's pick a[i+1] in range(), and check if it satisfies the rules
                    pass
                # Because rules specify properties of a[i+1], generate next based on previous terms
                # Simplify by assuming a[i+1] is multiple of a[i], and multiple of a[i] + a[i-1]
                valid_candidates = [cand for cand in range(1, 20)
                                    if cand % seq[i-1] == 0 and cand % (seq[i-1] + seq[i-2]) == 0]
                if not valid_candidates:
                    break  # no valid extension
                a_next = valid_candidates[0]
                seq.append(a_next)
            # Record the sequence and value at last index
            if len(seq) >= max_i:
                results.append((list(seq), seq[-1]))
    # Print minimal last element found
    min_value = min([val for _, val in results], default=None)
    print(f"Minimum last term in sampled sequences: {min_value}")
    # Stream results
    for seq, val in results:
        print(f"Sequence: {seq}, last term: {val}")
