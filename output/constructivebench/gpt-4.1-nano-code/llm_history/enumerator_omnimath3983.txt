This problem involves analyzing a recursive sequence \(a_n\) with a piecewise definition depending on the value of \(a_n\) relative to \(2^m\). The goal is to explore possible values of the initial \(a_1\) that satisfy the structure for given parameters, potentially characterizing the set of all initial values \(a_1\) where the sequence remains well-defined and trends in \(\mathbb{Z}\).

Since the sequence definition involves conditional behavior and potentially infinite iterations, we can focus on small sample values of \(m\) and initial \(a_1\). Because the problem reduces to exploring possible \(a_1\) for a fixed \(m\), a practical approach is to generate candidates of \(a_1\) in some bounded integer range and simulate the first few iterations of the sequence to infer possible initial values that satisfy the conditions, streaming each when found.

Here, I will:
- Pick a small \(m\), e.g., \(m=2\).
- Test a range of \(a_1\) from, say, \(-10\) to \(10\).
- For each \(a_1\), simulate a few iterations (e.g., 10) to see if the sequence remains consistent.
- Print candidate initial values that could satisfy the conditions.

This approach is heuristic and aims at conjecturing the structure of \(\operatorname{omnimath3983\_answer}\).

```python
# Enumerate possible initial a_1 in a small range for a fixed m=2
m = 2
a1_range = range(-10, 11)
max_iterations = 10

def next_a(n, current_a, m):
    # Implements the recursive step according to the piecewise rule
    if current_a < 2**m:
        return current_a**2 + 2**m
    else:
        return current_a // 2

for a1 in a1_range:
    sequence = [a1]
    valid = True
    for _ in range(max_iterations):
        next_value = next_a(len(sequence), sequence[-1], m)
        sequence.append(next_value)
        # Check for instability or impractical large growth
        if abs(next_value) > 1e6:
            valid = False
            break
    if valid:
        print(f"a_1 = {a1} may satisfy the sequence conditions.")
```
