The problem involves sequences \(a_n = 27r^{n-1}\) and \(b_n = 99r^{n-1}\) with the conditions:
- \(a_{15} = b_{11}\)
- \(a_9 =\) some value to find.

Given the sequence forms, the key condition \(a_{15} = b_{11}\) translates to:
\[ 27r^{14} = 99r^{10} \]

which simplifies to:
\[ 27r^{14} = 99r^{10} \]
Divide both sides by \(r^{10}\) (assuming \(r \neq 0\)):
\[ 27r^4 = 99 \]
\[ r^4 = \frac{99}{27} = \frac{11}{3} \]

Now, \(a_9 = 27r^{8}\):

Using \(r^4 = \frac{11}{3}\), then:
\[ r^8 = (r^4)^2 = \left(\frac{11}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{121}{9} \]

Hence:
\[ a_9 = 27 \times r^8 = 27 \times \frac{121}{9} = 3 \times 121 = 363 \]

Therefore, the answer is 363, and the sequence parameter \(r\) has four possible real solutions:
\[ r = \pm \left(\frac{11}{3}\right)^{1/4} \]

Since the problem involves ± roots, the values for \(a_9\) are the same. We just need to verify the primary solution and output the obtained value.

```python
# Enumerate solutions for r: r^4 = 11/3
from math import pow, sqrt

# Known: r^4 = 11/3
value = 11/3
r4 = value

# r = ±(r^4)^{1/4}
r_candidates = [pow(r4, 0.25), -pow(r4, 0.25)]

# Calculate a_9 = 27 * r^8, with r^8 = (r^4)^2
a9_values = []

for r in r_candidates:
    r8 = pow(r4, 2)  # (r^4)^2
    a9 = 27 * r8
    print(a9)  # Stream output when found
    a9_values.append(a9)
```
