. Enumerated answers: x = 0.0000 satisfies the condition.
Total solutions approximate count: 1. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The given condition holds when \( \arcsin(\sin(6x)) = \arccos(\cos x) \). Since \( \sin(6x) \) and \( \cos x \) are related via the identity \( \arcsin(\sin(6x)) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \arccos(\cos x) \), the equality simplifies, and solutions occur at points where \( 6x \equiv x \ (\text{mod } 2\pi) \). Within \( [0, \pi] \), this yields a unique solution at \( x=0 \).
