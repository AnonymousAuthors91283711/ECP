theorem omnimath2312 : 
  card {s : Finset (Fin 8 × Fin 8) | card s = 31 ∧ 
    ∀ (k₁ k₂ : Fin 8 × Fin 8), k₁ ∈ s → k₂ ∈ s → 
    (k₁ ≠ k₂ → ¬((k₁.1 - k₂.1)^2 + (k₁.2 - k₂.2)^2 = 5))} = omnimath2312_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Maximum independent set size (heuristic): 24
No such set of size 31 found via heuristic.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the heuristic indicating a maximum independent set size around 24, and the fact that 31 exceeds this maximum, the largest possible independent set size that satisfies the conditions is at most 24. Thus, the answer likely equals 24, the maximal independent set size under these constraints.
