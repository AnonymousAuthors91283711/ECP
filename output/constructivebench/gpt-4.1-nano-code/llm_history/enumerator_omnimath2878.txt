[write_program]
This problem defines a custom binary operation `otimes` on real numbers, with the specific form `a / b + b / a`. It asks for the value of `otimes 4 8`, which simplifies to `(4 / 8) + (8 / 4)`.

We can compute this directly: `(4/8) + (8/4) = (1/2) + 2 = 2.5`.

The task is to write a Python program that, given this operation, evaluates and outputs this value. To simulate an enumeration of possible answers, I'll generate approximations around 2.5, but clearly, the exact value is 2.5.

Here's the Python program implementing this:

```python
# The operation: a / b + b / a
# For a=4, b=8
a = 4
b = 8

# Compute the exact value
answer = (a / b) + (b / a)
print(answer)

# To assist in conjecture, generate approximate values around the exact answer
# (not explicitly required, but illustrative)
for delta in [0.1, 0.01, 0.001]:
    approximate = answer + delta
    print(approximate)
```

This program computes the precise value and prints it immediately, satisfying the requirement of streaming answers.
