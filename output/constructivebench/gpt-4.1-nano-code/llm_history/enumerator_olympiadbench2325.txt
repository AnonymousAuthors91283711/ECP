[write_program]
The problem appears to involve enumerating possible solutions for an unknown function related to the input (like combinatorial, arithmetic, or geometric configurations). Since the exact problem statement and constraints are not provided, I'll assume we need to explore possible values of some function (perhaps related to combinatorics or number theory) for small sample inputs, especially focusing on the input (10, 2).

I'll generate a Python program that:
- Evaluates the function `olympiadbench2325_answer` for small values,
- Prints answers immediately upon finding them,
- Keeps enumerating until a certain threshold,
- Focuses on the parameters (10, 2),
- Doesn't hardcode answers, but explores plausible values, and
- Keeps code concise and efficient.

Here's the code:

```python
# Enumerates possible answers for a hypothetical function related to (10, 2).
# Since the original function is unknown, we'll model plausible behavior for demonstration.
# For example, assume the function computes some combinatorial or arithmetic result.

def olympiadbench2325_answer(params):
    n, k = params
    # Placeholder for an assumed relation or enumeration logic.
    # For instance, sum of squares up to n minus some factor related to k.
    # Since we don't have the exact formula, we'll explore some sample computations.
    # In actual use, this should be replaced with the plausible logic or enumeration.
    
    # Example: sum of first n natural numbers times k (just as a placeholder)
    answer = sum(i*i for i in range(1, n+1)) * k
    return answer

# Focus on input (10, 2)
params = (10, 2)
answer = olympiadbench2325_answer(params)
print(f'Answer for {params}: {answer}')
```

This code:
- Defines a placeholder function to simulate enumerations,
- Prints the result immediately,
- Can be extended with more complex enumeration logic if needed.

Note that without the actual problem constraints or the functional form, this code demonstrates the enumeration approach rather than the precise solution.
