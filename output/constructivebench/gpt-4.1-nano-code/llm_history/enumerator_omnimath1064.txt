The problem defines \( n = 60 \), then \( p = \frac{3^{n-1} + 1}{4 \cdot 3^{n-1}} \), and asks to find the value of \( p \). Letâ€™s analyze this algebraically:

\[
p = \frac{3^{n-1} + 1}{4 \cdot 3^{n-1}} 
= \frac{3^{n-1}}{4 \cdot 3^{n-1}} + \frac{1}{4 \cdot 3^{n-1}} 
= \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4 \cdot 3^{n-1}}
\]

For \( n = 60 \), this becomes:

\[
p = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4 \cdot 3^{59}}
\]

Since \( 3^{59} \) is extremely large, the second term is tiny. Our task in code is to:

- Calculate this value precisely,
- Output the exact fractional form.

Given the problem constraints, I will compute the exact value, print it, and also approximate just for clarity. I will maximize clarity and efficiency.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

n = 60
power = 3 ** (n - 1)
p_fraction = Fraction(1, 4) + Fraction(1, 4 * power)

print("Exact value of p as fraction:", p_fraction)
print("Approximate decimal value:", float(p_fraction))
```
