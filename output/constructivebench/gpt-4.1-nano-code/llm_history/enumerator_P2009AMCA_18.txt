The problem involves finding the greatest \( n \) of the form \( n = \text{padicValNat}\ 2 (10^{k+2} + 64) \) for some \( k \ge 0 \). The p-adic valuation \( v_2(x) \) gives the highest exponent \( e \) such that \( 2^e \) divides \( x \). 

Since \( 10^{k+2} + 64 \) is an odd number plus a power of 2, we analyze its divisibility by 2. Note that:

- \( 10^{k+2} = (2 \cdot 5)^{k+2} = 2^{k+2} \cdot 5^{k+2} \). This is divisible by \( 2^{k+2} \).

- \( 64 = 2^6 \).

So, \( 10^{k+2} + 64 = 2^{k+2} \cdot 5^{k+2} + 2^6 \).

To find the 2-adic valuation, factor out the minimum power of 2:

- \( v_2(10^{k+2} + 64) = \min(v_2(10^{k+2}), v_2(64)) \) only when the sum is divisible exactly by the smaller power without higher powers, but since the sum is not necessarily a perfect power of 2, we need to determine explicitly.

Let's consider the parity:

- For \( k+2 < 6 \): \( 10^{k+2} \) is divisible by \( 2^{k+2} \), which is less than 64, so the sum is divisible by \( 2^{k+2} \), but whether it is divisible by higher powers depends on the sum.

Calculations:

- For small \( k \), compute \( v_2(10^{k+2}+64) \).

- Observe whether the valuation increases with \( k \).

Implementation plan:

- Loop over small \( k \) values (say \( 0 \le k \le 10 \)), compute \( v_2(10^{k+2} + 64) \), and print the results to observe the pattern.

- Maximize \( n = v_2(\text{expression}) \).

The largest \( v_2 \) found for these \( k \) values will determine the greatest \( n \).

```python
# Enumerate k from 0 to 10, compute v2(10^{k+2} + 64), and record the maximum
def v2(n):
    count = 0
    while n % 2 == 0 and n > 0:
        n //= 2
        count += 1
    return count

max_valuation = -1
max_k = None

for k in range(0, 11):
    val = v2(10**(k+2) + 64)
    print(f"k={k}: v2= {val}")
    if val > max_valuation:
        max_valuation = val
        max_k = k

# The answer n is the maximal v2 found
print(f"Maximum v2: {max_valuation} at k={max_k}")

# Since the question asks for the greatest such n, which is the maximum valuation
# The answer is max_valuation
# Abstracted as the p-adic valuation, which is an integer
# If needed, we could compute the actual n, but since it's the valuation, we output that
```
