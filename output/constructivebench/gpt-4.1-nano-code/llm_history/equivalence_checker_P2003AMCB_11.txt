Ground Truth Answer: 10 + 25/60
Proposed Answer: (12 + 10.4 / (57.6 / 60))
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a faulty watch that runs at 57.6 minutes per real hour (57.6/60 speed).
2. The watch shows 22:00 (10 PM) when the actual time is the solution we're seeking.
3. The ground truth answer is 10 + 25/60 hours (10:25 AM/PM).

Now let's evaluate the proposed answer:
- The proposed answer is (12 + 10.4 / (57.6 / 60))
- 10.4 comes from 22 - 12 = 10 (since the watch shows 22:00)
- The division by (57.6/60) accounts for the watch's speed
- This correctly inverts the given watchTime function
- Calculating: 10.4 / (57.6/60) = 10.4 * (60/57.6) ≈ 10.8333
- Adding 12 gives ≈ 22.8333, which is incorrect

Wait, this seems wrong. The correct inversion should be:
actualTime = (watchTime - 12)/(57.6/60) + 12
For watchTime = 22:
= (10)/(0.96) + 12 ≈ 10.4167 + 12 = 22.4167 (which is incorrect)

The ground truth is 10 + 25/60 = 10.4167 hours (10:25 AM/PM)

The proposed answer gives a different result, so they're not equivalent.
