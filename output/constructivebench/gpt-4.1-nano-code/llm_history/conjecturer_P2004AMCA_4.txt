theorem P2004AMCA_4 :
  ∃ (d : ℕ) (gd : ℕ) (x : ℕ),
    d = 6 ∧
    d + gd = 30 ∧
    x ≤ d ∧
    gd = 6 * x ∧
    d + (gd - x) = P2004AMCA_4_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 26. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern indicates that \( d = 6 \), \( gd = 6x \), and \( d + gd = 30 \). From this, 6 + 6x = 30, so x = 4. Then, d + (gd - x) = 6 + (6*4 - 4) = 6 + (24 - 4) = 6 + 20 = 26. The expression simplifies to 26 for the entire formula.
