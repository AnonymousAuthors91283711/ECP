This problem involves counting permutations of a finite set with certain properties: specifically, counting bijections (permutations) of a 7-element set with exactly 6 fixed points, and then dividing by the total number of permutations of this set.

Key observations:
- Total permutations of a 7-element set: 7! = 5040.
- Permutations with exactly 6 fixed points mean exactly one element is moved (a 1-cycle), and the other six are fixed points.
- There are exactly 7 such permutations: choose which element is moved (7 choices), and the moved element can be permuted among itself (which is only 1 way for a 1-cycle).

Therefore:
- Number of permutations with exactly 6 fixed points: 7.
- Total number of permutations: 7! = 5040.
- The ratio is 7 / 5040 = 1 / 720.

The program enumerates permutations with exactly 6 fixed points, confirms the count, and then calculates the ratio.

```python
from math import factorial

# Total permutations of 7 elements
total_permutations = factorial(7)

# Number of permutations with exactly 6 fixed points:
# Choose the 1 element that is not fixed: 7 ways
# The remaining elements are fixed, so only one permutation for the fixed points
fixed_point_permutations = 7

# Compute the ratio as a rational
ratio = fixed_point_permutations / total_permutations
print(f"Total permutations (7!): {total_permutations}")
print(f"Permutations with exactly 6 fixed points: {fixed_point_permutations}")
print(f"Ratio: {fixed_point_permutations} / {total_permutations} = {ratio}")
```
