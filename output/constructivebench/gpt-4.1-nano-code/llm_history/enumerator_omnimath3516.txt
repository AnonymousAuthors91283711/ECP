The given theorem suggests a calculation involving percentages: 100 * (120/100) * (150/100). This simplifies to straightforward multiplication of factors representing percentage increases or decreases, likely aimed at computing a compounded percentage effect or similar.

To explore possible answers, we can:
- Compute the exact product step-by-step.
- Enumerate fractional approximations if needed, but focus on precise rational evaluation.
- Print intermediate results for confirmation.

Here's a simple enumeration approach, computing the exact simplified result:

```python
# The calculation involves 100 * (120/100) * (150/100).
# Let's compute the exact rational result and approximate decimal.

# First, calculate the exact result as rational:
# 100 * (120/100) * (150/100) = (100) * (120/100) * (150/100)

from fractions import Fraction

# Define the quantities
part1 = Fraction(120, 100)
part2 = Fraction(150, 100)

# Compute the product
result_frac = 100 * part1 * part2
# Simplify the fraction
result_frac = result_frac.limit_denominator()

# Print exact fraction
print(f"Exact fractional result: {result_frac}")

# Also, print decimal approximation
approx_value = float(result_frac)
print(f"Approximate decimal: {approx_value}")

# For enumeration, perhaps list candidate integer or rational values within a small range:
for numerator in range(27000, 27100, 1):
    candidate = Fraction(numerator, 100)
    # Check if candidate is close to the exact result:
    if abs(candidate - result_frac) < Fraction(1, 1000):
        print(f"Candidate close to exact: {candidate} (~{float(candidate):.4f})")
```
