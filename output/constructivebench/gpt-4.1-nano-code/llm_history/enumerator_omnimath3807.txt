This problem involves finding quadruples \((x, y, z, t)\) of positive integers satisfying the equation:

\[ 2^x \times 3^y + 5^z = 7^t \]

The task is to enumerate possible solutions systematically, considering small values to find all solutions with manageable computational bounds. Since the equation involves exponential growth, we'll limit our search to small ranges of \(x, y, z, t\).

The plan:
- Set a small maximum for \(x, y, z, t\) (say 10) to keep computation feasible.
- Iterate over all viable combinations of \((x, y, z, t)\).
- Check whether the equality holds.
- Print all solutions immediately upon discovery.

The code avoids hardcoding solutions. Instead, it systematically searches the small bounds, printing each quadruple that satisfies the equation.

```python
# Program to find all positive integer solutions to 2^x * 3^y + 5^z = 7^t with bounds x,y,z,t <= 10

max_val = 10
for x in range(1, max_val+1):
    for y in range(1, max_val+1):
        p1 = 2**x * 3**y
        for z in range(1, max_val+1):
            val = p1 + 5**z
            # Check if val is a power of 7
            t = 1
            while 7**t < val:
                t += 1
            if 7**t == val:
                print((x, y, z, t))
```
