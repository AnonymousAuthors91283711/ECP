Possible answer candidate: 1 (from 0 + 1)
Possible answer candidate: 1 (from 1 + 0)
Possible answer candidate: 1 (from 2 + -1)
Possible answer candidate: 1 (from 3 + -2). Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The expression involves cube roots and conjugates, hinting at the sum of roots simplifying to a rational number. Examining the pattern, the plausible simplified value derived from the combinatorial or algebraic pattern appears to be 1.
