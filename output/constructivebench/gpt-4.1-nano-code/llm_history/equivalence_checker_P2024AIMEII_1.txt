Ground Truth Answer: 73
Proposed Answer: 109
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem is using the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets (diamond, golf, spade, candy).

2. The correct formula for four sets is:
|A∪B∪C∪D| = sum of single sets - sum of intersections of two sets + sum of intersections of three sets - intersection of all four sets

3. The given equation in the theorem is:
all_four = (diamond + golf + spade + candy - exactly_two - 2*exactly_three - total)/2

4. Plugging in the numbers:
(195 + 367 + 562 + 900 - 437 - 2*234 - 900)/2
= (2024 - 437 - 468 - 900)/2
= (2024 - 1805)/2
= 219/2 = 109.5

5. However, the ground truth answer is 73, which suggests the proposed formula might be incorrect.

6. The correct calculation should be:
all_four = (sum of triple intersections) - (sum of pairs) + (sum of singles) - total
But we don't have all needed values.

The proposed answer of 109 comes from an incorrect application of the formula, while the ground truth is 73. They are not equivalent.
