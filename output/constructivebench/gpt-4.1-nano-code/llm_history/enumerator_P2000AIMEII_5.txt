The problem appears to involve counting arrangements (likely permutations with repetitions or combinations), potentially related to a contest math problem like the AIME. To assist in conjecturing the answer, I will enumerate plausible values for the arrangements count based on given parameters.

Since the function involves `n`, `k`, `fingers`, and uses combinatorial functions like choose (binomial), factorial, and exponentiation, I will:

- Fix small parameters (`n=8`, `k=5`, `fingers=4`)
- Enumerate possible arrangements for small values and look for patterns
- Stream answers when exact, verifying the last three digits as needed

The code will compute the arrangements for the given parameters, output the exact number, and check the last three digits for the pattern.

```python
from math import comb, factorial

def countArrangements(n, k, fingers):
    # count arrangements: choices with repetitions times permutations
    # (fingers + k - 1).choose k counts combinations with repetition,
    # multiplied by k! and n^k for additional permutations
    return comb(fingers + k - 1, k) * factorial(k) * (n ** k)

# fixed parameters
n = 8
k = 5
fingers = 4

# compute arrangements
arrangements = countArrangements(n, k, fingers)

# output the exact arrangement count
print(arrangements)

# output the last three digits for initial pattern analysis
print(str(arrangements)[-3:])
```
