theorem omnimath652 (x y : ℕ) : 
  3^x * 4^y = 2^(x + y) + 2^(2*(x + y) - 1) ↔ (x, y) ∈ omnimath652_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 2)}
Proposed Answer: { p : ℕ × ℕ | p.1 = p.2 ∧ p.1 ≥ 1 }
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The equation is 3^x * 4^y = 2^(x+y) + 2^(2*(x+y)-1)
2. Ground truth gives specific solutions: (0,1), (1,1), (2,2)
3. Proposed answer claims all pairs where x=y and x≥1 are solutions

Testing the proposed answer against ground truth:
- (1,1) is in both (correct)
- (2,2) is in both (correct)
- (0,1) is in ground truth but not in proposed answer (missing)
- The proposed answer would include (3,3), (4,4), etc. which are not in ground truth (extra solutions)

Testing (3,3):
3^3 * 4^3 = 27 * 64 = 1728
2^(6) + 2^(11) = 64 + 2048 = 2112 ≠ 1728 → (3,3) is not a solution

Therefore:
1. Proposed answer misses (0,1)
2. Proposed answer incorrectly includes many pairs like (3,3), (4,4), etc.
