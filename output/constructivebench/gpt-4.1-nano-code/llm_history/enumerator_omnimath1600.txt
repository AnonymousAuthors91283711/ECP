This problem asks to find the size of the largest possible subset \(s\) of the grid \(\text{Fin}(19) \times \text{Fin}(19)\) with exactly 99 elements, such that for any two distinct points \(p, q\) in the set, they are not adjacent in both coordinates (i.e., they are not "close" in both \(x\) and \(y\)); equivalently, they are separated by at least 2 in at least one coordinate.

To help conjecture and possibly determine the size, I will generate candidate subsets with various configurations, considering constraints, and check possible maximum sizes.

The strategy:
- Pick small sample parameters for the grid.
- Generate sets of size 99 with the given constraints.
- Display candidate solutions, focusing on approximate density and ensuring the constraints are satisfied.
- Since the core is to find the maximum size under the constraints, I will simulate constructing such sets greedily, adding points that satisfy the separation condition, and stop when the set reaches size 99 or cannot be expanded further.

```python
# Enumerate candidate sets on a small 19x19 grid with the specified separation constraint.
# Objective: find maximum subset size <= 99 with points separated by at least 2 in both coordinates.
# Approach: Greedy placement, prioritize points with more available neighbors.

def is_valid(point, chosen):
    for p in chosen:
        if abs(p[0] - point[0]) < 2 and abs(p[1] - point[1]) < 2:
            return False
    return True

# Generate grid points
grid = [(x, y) for x in range(19) for y in range(19)]
chosen_points = []

for p in grid:
    if is_valid(p, chosen_points):
        chosen_points.append(p)
        # Once reaching 99, stop
        if len(chosen_points) == 99:
            print("Candidate set of size 99 found with parameters:")
            print(f"Selected points: {chosen_points}")
            print(f"Total points: {len(chosen_points)}")
            break

# Output the candidate set if found
# If not found, this suggests the maximum possible may be less than 99 with this construction.
```
