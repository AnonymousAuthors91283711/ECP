  IsLeast {p : ℕ | 0 < p ∧ ∃ (N : ℕ), ∀ (m : ℕ), N ≤ m → 
    (⌊a m⌋ % 2014) = (⌊a (m + p)⌋ % 2014)} omnimath1729_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Error: Program is empty. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the recurrence \(a(n+1) = a(n) \times (a(n-1))^2\) with initial values, the pattern suggests a periodicity mod 2014 with period 3, since the sequence involves squares and roots linking the terms. The least period satisfying the condition occurs at \(p=3\).
