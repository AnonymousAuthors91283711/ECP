The problem asks to count the number of subsets \( C \subseteq \text{Fin } 9 \) (i.e., \(\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\}\)) that satisfy certain conditions:

- Either \( \{0,1\} \subseteq C \) or \( C \cap \{0,1\} = \emptyset \).
- \( C \cap \{2,3\} = \emptyset \).
- \( |C| = 5 \).

We are to enumerate all such sets.

Given these constraints, I will:

- Fix parameters to small sample values.
- Generate all sets satisfying the constraints.
- Count them.
- Stream the partial results by printing each valid set's size.

```python
from itertools import combinations

# Universe |Fin 9| = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}
universe = list(range(9))
result_count = 0

# Prepare subsets of the universe
# Conditions:
# 1. Either includes {0,1} or excludes it
# 2. Excludes {2,3}
# 3. Sets of size 5

# Generate candidates
for include_type in [True, False]:
    # Sets must include {0,1} if include_type is True
    if include_type:
        fixed_part = {0,1}
        remaining_candidates = [x for x in universe if x not in fixed_part and x not in {2,3}]
        min_size = 5 - len(fixed_part)
    else:
        fixed_part = set()
        remaining_candidates = [x for x in universe if x not in {0,1,2,3}]
        min_size = 5  # since no mandatory inclusion of {0,1}
    # Generate combinations for remaining choices to complete size 5
    for size in range(min_size, len(remaining_candidates)+1):
        for combo in combinations(remaining_candidates, size - len(fixed_part)):
            C = set(fixed_part).union(combo)
            if len(C) == 5:
                # Verify condition C ∩ {0,1}
                if include_type:
                    # includes {0,1}
                    if not {0,1}.issubset(C):
                        continue
                else:
                    # excludes {0,1}
                    if {0,1}.intersection(C):
                        continue
                # Check C ∩ {2,3} = ∅
                if {2,3}.intersection(C):
                    continue
                print(C)
                result_count += 1

print("Total count:", result_count)
```
