The problem appears to involve enumerating functions from a finite set (like Fin 4) to Bool and finding their total count (cardinality). Since the functions are from a set of size 4 to 2 (Bool), the total number of such functions is 2^4 = 16. The code structure hints at exploring some enumeration, but "encard" seems to refer to the enumeration cardinality.

Let's write a Python program that enumerates all possible functions from a 4-element domain to Boolean values and counts them, printing each, to assist in confirming the total number.

```python
# Enumerate all functions from a set of 4 elements (0..3) to Bool (True/False)
# Total possibilities: 2^4 = 16

def enumerate_functions():
    for mask in range(1 << 4):  # 2^4 combinations
        func = {}
        for i in range(4):
            # Determine whether the ith element maps to True or False based on mask bits
            value = bool((mask >> i) & 1)
            func[i] = value
        # Count size of this function's codomain (number of True values)
        codomain_size = len(set(func.values()))
        print(f"Function: {func} with codomain size: {codomain_size}")

    total_functions = 1 << 4  # 16
    print(f"Total number of functions: {total_functions}")

enumerate_functions()
```

This program enumerates all functions, prints each function's mapping from each element to Bool, along with the size of its image, and finally confirms the total count.
