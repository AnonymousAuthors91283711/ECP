theorem omnimath1307 : 
  10002000400080016003200640128025605121024204840968192 % 100020004000800160032 = omnimath1307_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 40968192. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests the answer is the entire numerator number, as the question shows the modulus with a specific large number, and the enumerated answer matches the numerator. Therefore, the closed form should be the numerator itself, as the answer:

<<<10002000400080016003200640128025605121024204840968192>>>
