The problem appears to be about finding a least number greater than 2013 such that for all palindromes a and b, their sum is not equal to that number. The function `isPalindrome` seems to be intended to check whether a number is a palindrome, but the provided code is incomplete or incorrectly implemented, with some assumptions like `ofDigits` not provided.

To assist in conjecturing and proving the true answer, I will:
- Enumerate numbers greater than 2013.
- For each candidate, check if it can be written as a sum of two palindromic numbers.
- As per the theorem, find the least such number that cannot be expressed as such sum.

Since the problem calls for minimality, I will:
- Limit the search to a reasonable range.
- For the parameters `a` and `b`, check all palindromes within a manageable range.
- Immediately output candidates that meet the criteria.

Here's an implementation with some assumptions:
- Palindromes are generated up to a certain limit.
- The check for whether a number is a palindrome is implemented correctly.
- The enumeration is streamed for possible answers.

```python
def is_palindrome(n):
    s = str(n)
    return s == s[::-1]

# Generate palindromes up to a limit
limit = 3000  # Safe upper bound around 2013
palindromes = [i for i in range(1, limit + 1) if is_palindrome(i)]

# Starting point
start = 2014
max_check = 2500  # Limit search for efficiency

# For each number > 2013, check if it can be expressed as sum of two palindromes
for n in range(start, max_check + 1):
    can_be_expressed = False
    for a in palindromes:
        if a > n:
            continue
        b = n - a
        if b in palindromes:
            can_be_expressed = True
            break
    if not can_be_expressed:
        print(n)
        break
```
