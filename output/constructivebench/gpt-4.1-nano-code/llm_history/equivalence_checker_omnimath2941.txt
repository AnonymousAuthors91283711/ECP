Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: 8
Since the problem is about counting the number of triples (a, b, c) of positive integers satisfying certain conditions, and both the ground truth answer and proposed answer are marked as "sorry" (meaning they're intentionally left undefined in Lean), we cannot verify the correctness of the proposed answer 8.

In Lean, "sorry" is used as a placeholder for proofs or values that haven't been implemented yet, so we have no actual ground truth to compare against. The proposed answer could be correct, but we have no way to verify this without the actual implementation.
