The problem involves two sequences, \(F(n)\) (a Fibonacci-like sequence) and \(L(n)\) (a Lucas-like sequence), with initial conditions given for each. We need to compute the value of a ratio of products involving these sequences.

Given:
- \(F(1) = 1, F(2) = 1\), and \(F(n+2) = F(n+1) + F(n)\)
- \(L(1) = 1, L(2) = 2\), and \(L(n+2) = L(n+1) + L(n)\)

The goal is to evaluate:
\[
\frac{\prod_{n=1}^{15} \frac{F(2n)}{F(n)}}{\prod_{n=1}^{13} L(n)}
\]

I will:

- Generate \(F(n)\) and \(L(n)\) for necessary \(n\)
- Compute all products explicitly
- Output the computed value for the ratio

The numerator is a product over terms \(\frac{F(2n)}{F(n)}\), which simplifies as \(F(2n)\) divided by the product of \(F(n)\)

Let's enumerate the sequences and compute the ratio step-by-step.

```python
# Generate Fibonacci-like sequence F
F = [0, 1, 1]  # Index from 1, so F[1]=1, F[2]=1
for n in range(3, 30):
    F.append(F[n-1] + F[n-2])

# Generate Lucas-like sequence L
L = [0, 1, 2]  # L[1]=1, L[2]=2
for n in range(3, 30):
    L.append(L[n-1] + L[n-2])

# Compute numerator: product over n=1..15 of F(2n)/F(n)
numerator = 1.0
for n in range(1, 16):
    numerator *= F[2*n] / F[n]
    print(f"F({2*n})/F({n}) = {F[2*n]}/{F[n]} = {F[2*n]/F[n]}")

# Compute denominator: product over n=1..13 of L(n)
denominator = 1.0
for n in range(1, 14):
    denominator *= L[n]
    print(f"L({n}) = {L[n]}")

ratio = numerator / denominator
print(f"The ratio value is approximately: {ratio}")
```
