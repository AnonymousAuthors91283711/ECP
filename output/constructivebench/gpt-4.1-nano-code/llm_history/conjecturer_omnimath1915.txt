The problem involves complex numbers and distances, with known distances from z to 1 and z^2 to 1. The pattern suggests z's real part relates to the distances; the distances imply certain geometric relations, likely involving quadratics. Based on the constraints and typical geometric configurations, the expression for z’s real part aligns with the quadratic roots derived from the distance relations, leading to the closed form involving a constant and square root. The pattern suggests a form involving √5.
