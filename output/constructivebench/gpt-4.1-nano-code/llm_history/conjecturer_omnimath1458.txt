The pattern suggests the answer involves choosing positive real numbers with floors matching the multipliers 3, 4, 5 respectively when multiplied by a, b, c. To satisfy the equations, the simplest case is where the floors directly match these integers, and the real numbers are just above these floors to satisfy positivity. Thus, the set of all such triples is:  
floor(a)=3, floor(b)=4, floor(c)=5, with a>3, b>4, c>5, respectively.  
Hence, the answer is:  
<<<{abc : ℝ × ℝ × ℝ | let ⟨a, b, c⟩ := abc;  a > 3 ∧ b > 4 ∧ c > 5}>>>
