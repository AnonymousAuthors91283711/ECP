theorem omnimath432 (a b : ℕ) (ha : a = 221) (hb : b = 403) :
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | ∃ (x : ℕ), ∃ (y : ℕ), x * b = y * a ∧ n = x + y} (omnimath432_answer (a, b)) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 0. Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ → ℕ
The problem asks for the least n such that x·b = y·a and n = x + y. Since a = 221 and b = 403 are fixed, and the minimal solution occurs when x and y are smallest positive integers satisfying the ratio, the answer corresponds to the minimal positive integer multiple of both a and b.

Since gcd(221, 403) = 1 (checking factors shows they are coprime), the minimal common multiple for x·b = y·a happens when x = a = 221, y = b = 403. So n = x + y = 221 + 403 = 624.

Therefore, the minimal n is 624. 

In Lean:
<<<fun _ => 624>>>
