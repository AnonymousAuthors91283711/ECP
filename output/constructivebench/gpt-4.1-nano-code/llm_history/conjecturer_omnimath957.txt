theorem omnimath957 :
  IsLeast {b : ℕ | 0 < b ∧ 
    let total := 6 + b;
    let sameColor := 3 + choose b 2;
    sameColor / choose total 2 = 1/5} 
  omnimath957_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 4. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The minimal value of b > 0 such that (3 + choose b 2) / choose (6 + b) 2 = 1/5 is b=4, which satisfies the equation. 

Thus, the closed-form answer is 4.
