Ground Truth Answer: fun n => 3 * n
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => n * 3
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer `fun n : ℕ => n * 3` is mathematically equivalent to the ground truth answer `fun n => 3 * n` because multiplication is commutative in natural numbers. Both expressions represent the same function that triples the input n. The order of multiplication does not affect the result.
