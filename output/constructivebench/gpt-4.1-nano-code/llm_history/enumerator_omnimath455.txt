The given code appears to be a Lean theorem involving functions from Fin 5 to Fin 10, with constraints on the values. Since the goal is to determine the number of such functions satisfying the given property, let's analyze it:

- P : (Fin 5 → Fin 10) → Prop
- P d is true iff (d 0 ≠ 0) and the product of all d i is 180.
- The set of functions d : Fin 5 → Fin 10 satisfying P has size equal to the number of functions with d 0 ≠ 0 and product=180.

Our task: enumerate all functions d : Fin 5 → Fin 10 with these constraints, particularly focusing on the first value: d 0 ≠ 0. The other four values d 1..4 must multiply with d 0 to 180.

We will:

1. Fix d 0 from 1..9 (since d 0 ≠ 0 and (d 0 ∈ Fin 10))
2. For each choice of d 0, compute possible assignments to d 1..4 whose product equals 180 / d 0
3. Enumerate all such combinations where each d i is between 0..9 (including 0, but 0 factors make the product zero, so only values ≥1)

Note: Since the product must be exactly 180, all d i ≥ 1, because 0 in any d i would make the product zero, which is not 180.

This reduces to counting all 4-tuples (d 1, d 2, d 3, d 4) with each in 1..9, product=180/d 0, and d 0 in 1..9 that divides 180.

Now, write a Python script to:

- Fix d 0 from {1..9} such that d 0 divides 180.
- For each such d 0, find all 4-tuples (d 1..4) with values in 1..9, product = 180 / d 0.
- Count and print all solutions.

Let's proceed:

```python
# Enumerate all functions d : Fin 5 -> Fin 10 satisfying:
# d 0 ≠ 0 and product of all d i = 180
# Since 0 in d makes product zero, only values ≥1 are valid
# d 0 in {1..9} dividing 180
# For each d 0, find all quadruples (d1,d2,d3,d4) with 1 ≤ d_i ≤ 9 and product = 180/d0

from itertools import product

# Factors to consider for d0: divisors of 180 between 1 and 9
divisors_of_180 = [d for d in range(1, 10) if 180 % d == 0]

solutions_count = 0

for d0 in divisors_of_180:
    target = 180 // d0
    # Generate all 4-tuples with values in 1..9
    for d1, d2, d3, d4 in product(range(1, 10), repeat=4):
        if d1 * d2 * d3 * d4 == target:
            # Found a valid function
            solutions_count += 1
            print(f"d: [{d0}, {d1}, {d2}, {d3}, {d4}]")
print(f"Total solutions: {solutions_count}")
```
