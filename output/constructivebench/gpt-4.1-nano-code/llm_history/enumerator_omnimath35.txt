The given problem appears to involve characterizing a number n in relation to some triplet (x, y, z) and a parameterized answer function `omnimath35_answer`. We are asked to explore possible solutions or values that satisfy a certain property related to whether n is a perfect square or not, with the goal to assist in conjecturing or proving the theorem.

Since the code is pseudocode with `sorry` placeholders, the task is to write a Python script that logically enumerates candidate triples (x, y, z) for small parameters, computes whatever the answer function might be, and attempts to relate it to n.

Because the problem appears high-school level and focuses on properties of squares, we interpret it as exploring small natural numbers and their relationships to their square status, mapping to `omnimath35_answer`.

The key task: For small n, and small positive x, y, z, enumerate all `(x, y, z)` to find those with `omnimath35_answer(x, y, z) = n`, especially for those n which are not perfect squares, per the theorem's statement.

**Assumption:** To proceed practically, we define `omnimath35_answer(x,y,z)` as some function like `x + y + z` or `x * y * z`, to generate potentially meaningful outputs.

Given the nature of the problem, let's assume:

- The function `omnimath35_answer(x,y,z)` outputs the sum `x + y + z`.
- We will enumerate `(x,y,z)` with small positive integers (e.g., 1 to 10) to find all `n` realizable as such sums.
- For each n, on matching `omnimath35_answer(x,y,z)`, if n is not a perfect square, output such triplets.

This approach aligns with the problem's goal to explore for deductive reasoning, without applying actual theorem logic or advanced math.

Here's the Python code implementing this:

```python
# Enumerate small triplets (x, y, z) with positive integers up to 10.
# The answer function is assumed to be the sum x + y + z.
# We will find and print all such triplets for each possible n up to max sum 30.
# This helps explore the values n that correspond to non-square numbers.

import math

def is_perfect_square(n):
    root = int(math.isqrt(n))
    return root * root == n

max_value = 10
max_sum = 30

for x in range(1, max_value + 1):
    for y in range(1, max_value + 1):
        for z in range(1, max_value + 1):
            n = x + y + z  # answer function
            print(f"n = {n}, triplet = ({x}, {y}, {z})")
            # Optional: Mark if n is a perfect square
            if not is_perfect_square(n):
                print(f"  {n} is not a perfect square.")
```

This code streams all small triplet sums, aiding the conjecture or insight into the structure of answers relative to perfect squares.
