The problem asks to find the greatest rational number \( p \) of a certain form, where \( p \) equals the sum over \( x, y \) in the set \(\{1, 2, \ldots, N\}\), and sums 1 whenever \( (x \cdot y) \bmod 10 = 0 \). The task is to find the maximum \( p \) as \( N \) varies, explicitly, by enumerating possible \( N \).

Since the sum involves the condition \( (x y) \bmod 10 = 0 \), this occurs when either \( x \) or \( y \) is divisible by 2 or 5 because \( 10 = 2 \times 5 \). To find the maximum sum ratio, we can analyze small values of \( N \).

We will iterate over small \( N \) (say, \( N = 1 \) to \( 50 \)), compute the sums, and output the resulting \( p \). The maximum over all these samples will be printed as the conjectured maximum.

```python
# Enumerate small values of N to find maximum ratio p
# p = (sum over x,y in 1..N of indicator whether (x*y)%10==0) / N^2
max_p = 0
max_N = 1
for N in range(1, 51):
    count = 0
    for x in range(1, N+1):
        for y in range(1, N+1):
            if (x * y) % 10 == 0:
                count += 1
    p = count / (N * N)
    print(f"N={N}, count={count}, p={p}")
    if p > max_p:
        max_p = p
        max_N = N

print(f"Maximum p appears near N={max_N}, with value approximately {max_p}")
```
