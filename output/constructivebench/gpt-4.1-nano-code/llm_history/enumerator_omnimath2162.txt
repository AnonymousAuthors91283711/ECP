The problem involves a set of functions from a finite set to real numbers, with certain bounds and an intricate sum of absolute values. To assist in conjecturing or proving the volume, I will enumerate possible function values within the bounds and compute the sum of their absolute values as specified.

Since the domain is Fin 3 (i.e., 3 elements), I choose small sample values for each coordinate within [-1, 1], and check whether the equality condition holds. The goal is to find the volume (measure) of the set P by enumerating all functions satisfying the constraints, approximating the volume by counting the measure contributions of small grid cells in ‚Ñù^3.

Here's the Python program following the constraints:

- It will sample within a small grid in [-1, 1]^3.
- For each sampled function, it checks the sum condition.
- Counts how many satisfy the condition.
- Estimates the volume based on grid spacing.

```python
# Enumeration over small grid in [-1, 1] for 3 variables
# Counting solutions that satisfy the sum condition
grid_points = [-1 + i*0.2 for i in range(11)]  # points in [-1, 1] with step 0.2
volume_count = 0
total_points = 0
cell_volume = 0.2 ** 3  # volume of each grid cell

for f0 in grid_points:
    for f1 in grid_points:
        for f2 in grid_points:
            total_points += 1
            sum_abs = abs(f0) + abs(f1) + abs(f2) + abs(f0 + f1 + f2)
            sum_pairs = abs(f0 + f1) + abs(f1 + f2) + abs(f2 + f0)
            if abs(sum_abs - sum_pairs) < 1e-6:
                # Satisfies the condition
                print((f0, f1, f2))
                volume_count += 1

# Estimate volume
estimated_volume = volume_count * cell_volume
print(f"Estimated volume: {estimated_volume}")
```
