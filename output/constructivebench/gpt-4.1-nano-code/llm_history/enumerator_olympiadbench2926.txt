This problem involves finding the least natural number `n` satisfying a certain condition involving the cardinality of integers `k` that meet an inequality constraint. To assist with conjecture and potential proof, we will enumerate candidate values for `n` for a fixed `T=5`, check the set of `k` that meet the conditions, and determine the minimal such `n`.

The key steps in the enumeration:
1. For given `n`, find all integers `k` such that `0<k` and `-k^2 - 2k + n ≥ 0`.
2. Count these `k` values.
3. Check if the card (count) of this set is at least `T=5`.
4. Find the minimal `n` for which this is true.

Given the bounds, to keep the enumeration efficient, we'll test candidate `n` starting from a low threshold upwards until we find the minimal `n` satisfying the condition (cardinality ≥ 5).

Here's the implementation:

```python
# Helper function to count integers k > 0 satisfying the inequality for given n
def count_valid_k(n):
    count = 0
    # k must satisfy 0<k and -k^2 - 2k + n ≥ 0
    # The inequality can be rewritten as: k^2 + 2k - n ≤ 0
    # Solving quadratic: k^2 + 2k - n ≤ 0
    # The roots are: -1 ± sqrt(1 + n)
    import math
    root = math.sqrt(1 + n)
    lower_bound = -1 - root
    upper_bound = -1 + root
    # k > 0 and within the interval (lower_bound, upper_bound)
    for k in range(1, int(upper_bound)+2):  # range extends to cover the upper root
        if k > 0 and (k > lower_bound) and (k <= upper_bound):
            count += 1
    return count

# Enumerate n starting from 1 upwards until count ≥ T=5
T = 5
n_candidate = 1
while True:
    c = count_valid_k(n_candidate)
    if c >= T:
        print(n_candidate)
        break
    n_candidate += 1
```

This code enumerates candidate `n`, finds the set of `k`, and stops once it finds the minimal `n` with at least 5 such `k`. It immediately outputs the answer to assist in conjecturing the true minimum.
