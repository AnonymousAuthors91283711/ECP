The problem involves the function \( N(t, a) = a / 2^{t/6} \) and the given conditions \( A_0 = 2 B_0 \) and \( N(24, A_0) = N(24, B_0) \). The goal is to find a value \( t \) such that \( N(t, B_0) = B_0 / 2 \).

Since \( N(t, a) = a / 2^{t/6} \),
the condition \( N(t, B_0) = B_0 / 2 \) simplifies to:
\[ \frac{B_0}{2^{t/6}} = \frac{B_0}{2} \]
Assuming \( B_0 \neq 0 \), dividing both sides by \( B_0 \):
\[ \frac{1}{2^{t/6}} = \frac{1}{2} \]
which implies:
\[ 2^{t/6} = 2 \]
and thus:
\[ t/6 = 1 \]
\[ t = 6 \]

The code will verify this reasoning by simply enumerating \( t \) over some small positive values to observe when \( N(t, B_0) \) reaches \( B_0 / 2 \).

```python
# Small sample values to test the point where N(t, B0) = B0/2
B0 = 1  # arbitrary non-zero B0
threshold = 20  # limit for t to check

# Since N(t, B0) = B0 / 2^{t/6}
# solve for t when N(t, B0) = B0/2, i.e., 1/2:
# 1 / 2^{t/6} = 1/2
# 2^{t/6} = 2
# t/6 = 1
# t = 6

for t in range(0, threshold + 1):
    value = B0 / (2 ** (t/6))
    print(f"t = {t}, N(t, B0) = {value}")
    if abs(value - B0/2) < 1e-8:
        print(f"Answer t where N(t, B0) = B0/2: {t}")
```
