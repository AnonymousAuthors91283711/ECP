This problem models a classic "climbing and descending" scenario, where an object climbs at a certain rate during the day and descends at a certain rate at night. The key calculation involves the total height reached after several cycles plus any remaining partial cycle.

Assuming T = 10 hours (given), the total time in seconds is T * 60 = 600 seconds.
- Up time = 80 seconds
- Down time = 70 seconds
- Total cycle time = 150 seconds

The speeds:
- Up speed = T / up_time = 10 / 80 = 0.125 units/sec
- Down speed = T / down_time = 10 / 70 â‰ˆ 0.142857 units/sec

We will enumerate the total height after the full time, considering whole cycles and a possible partial cycle, then approximate the partial climb.

```python
# Enumeration of possible total heights after full cycles and partial cycle
# Based on the climbing scenario with T=10, up_time=80, down_time=70

up_time = 80
down_time = 70
T = 10
total_time = T * 60  # total seconds
cycle_time = up_time + down_time

up_speed = T / up_time  # units/sec
down_speed = T / down_time

full_cycles = total_time // cycle_time
remaining_time = total_time - full_cycles * cycle_time

# Function to compute remaining climb
def remaining_climb(remaining):
    if remaining <= up_time:
        return remaining * up_speed
    else:
        return T + (remaining - up_time) * (-down_speed)

# Enumerate possible full cycle counts from 0 up to a reasonable number
max_cycles = int(full_cycles) + 2  # safe buffer for partials

print("Possible total heights (initially as approximate):")
for cycles in range(max_cycles + 1):
    partial_time = remaining_time
    if cycles == int(full_cycles):
        # Partial climb after these full cycles
        height = cycles * T + remaining_climb(partial_time)
        print(f"Cycles: {cycles}, Total height: {height:.4f}")
```
