. Enumerated answers: Potential solutions for a based on simple candidate functions:. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
The pattern in enumerated answers suggests common values of a that satisfy the inequality for simple functions like linear or constant functions. Based on the structure, the feasible solutions are likely a where the inequality holds identically, particularly at specific constants like 0 or 1, possibly involving symmetric or trivial cases. 

My conjecture is that the set of solutions is {a | a = 1} or possibly includes some other specific constants. Given the symmetry and typical solutions in such functional inequalities, the only characteristic a is a = 1.
