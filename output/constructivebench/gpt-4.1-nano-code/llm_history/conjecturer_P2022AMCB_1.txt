Solution: x=10, y=8. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The solutions form pairs (x, y) with x + y = 2 and |x - y| = 2. To satisfy |0 - 2| = |x - y|, we need |x - y|=2, and since x + y=2, solving these gives x = 0 or 2, y=2 or 0, respectively. The consistent relation is: x + y = 2 and |x - y| = 2. 

Final answer:

The error arises because the current expression defines a function from ℝ × ℝ to a Prop, which is incompatible with the expected answer type ℝ. The enumeration shows pairs (x, y) satisfying x + y = 2 and |x - y| = 2, and among these, the pair (0, 2) satisfies both conditions: 0 + 2 = 2 and |0 - 2| = 2.

Given the question's assertion, the answer should be a real number that corresponds to the value of |0 - 2|, which equals 2. Since the property holds for x=0 and y=2, the absolute difference is 2, which perfectly matches the target answer.

Thus, the correct answer is simply the number 2, an explicit real number in Lean.
