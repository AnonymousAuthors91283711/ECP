This problem asks for the greatest rational number \( r \) such that there exist integers \( a, b, c \) with \( 0 < a, b, c \leq 100 \), and a nonzero \( x \in \mathbb{Q} \) satisfying the quadratic \( a x^2 + b x + c = 0 \). Essentially, we seek the largest rational root \( r \) of some quadratic with bounded integer coefficients.

To solve this, we consider the quadratic formula:
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]
A rational root exists iff the discriminant \( D = b^2 - 4ac \) is a perfect square, say \( D = k^2 \).

Further, because the root is rational, the square root must be rational, so \( D \) must be a perfect square. We want \( a, b, c \) within bounds and maximize \( r \).

Since \( a > 0 \), and denominators are \( 2a \), to maximize the root \( r = \frac{-b \pm k}{2a} \), choose the plus sign to maximize the root:
\[
r = \frac{-b + k}{2a}
\]
with \( D = k^2 = b^2 - 4ac \), and \( D \ge 0 \).

The plan:
- For \( a, b, c \) in \( 1..100 \), check if \( b^2 - 4ac \ge 0 \) and a perfect square.
- If yes, compute \( r = \frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \).
- Track the maximum \( r \).

Because the coefficients are small, brute-force enumeration over all \( a, b, c \) is feasible.

```python
import math

max_r = float('-inf')
max_params = None  # to store (a, b, c, numerator, denominator)

for a in range(1, 101):
    for b in range(1, 101):
        for c in range(1, 101):
            D = b*b - 4*a*c
            if D < 0:
                continue
            sqrt_D = int(math.isqrt(D))
            if sqrt_D * sqrt_D == D:
                # Compute the root with maximum value
                numerator = -b + sqrt_D
                denominator = 2 * a
                r = numerator / denominator
                if r > max_r:
                    max_r = r
                    max_params = (a, b, c, numerator, denominator)

if max_params:
    a, b, c, num, denom = max_params
    print(f"Maximum root found: r = ({num}) / {denom} = {num/denom}")
    print(f"Coefficients: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}")
else:
    print("No rational root found with given constraints.")
```
