The problem asks to find all integers n in the range 1 to 2017 such that the product (n - 2) * n * (n - 1) * (n - 7) is divisible by 1001. Since 1001 = 7 * 11 * 13, the product must be divisible by these primes, meaning at least one of the factors must be divisible by each of 7, 11, and 13.

To solve this, we'll analyze the conditions for each prime factor:

- For divisibility by 7: either n ≡ 2 (mod 7), n ≡ 0 (mod 7), n ≡ 1 (mod 7), or n ≡ 7 (which is 0 mod 7).
- For 11: either n ≡ 0 (mod 11), n ≡ 1 (mod 11), or n ≡ 7 (mod 11), etc.
- Similarly for 13.

We will generate candidates that satisfy at least one factor divisible by each prime and check the divisibility condition promptly, printing each qualifying n as we find it.

```python
# Enumerate all n from 1 to 2017
for n in range(1, 2018):
    product = (n - 2) * n * (n - 1) * (n - 7)
    if product % 1001 == 0:
        print(n)
```
