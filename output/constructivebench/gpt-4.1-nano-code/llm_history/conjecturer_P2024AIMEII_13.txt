Since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, each factor simplifies to a constant modulo 1000; the product over all roots relates to cyclotomic polynomial evaluations. The pattern indicates the product’s value modulo 1000 is 321 independent of ω.

. Enumerated Answers: 321. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The error arises because in Lean, comments or explanatory text cannot be directly placed inside an `abbrev` definition without proper comment syntax or string encapsulation. Since the goal is to provide a concise, general answer in Lean, and the explanation is not valid Lean syntax, the best approach is to omit such text from within the `abbrev` definition. Given the pattern and the evaluated product behavior, the final answer should be a constant (specifically 321), matching the enumerated answer.

Conjecture: Based on the nature of roots of unity and previous similar problems, the product's value modulo 1000 remains constant. The pattern or symmetry suggests the answer is 321, independent of the specific root ω chosen.

Final answer: <<<321>>>
