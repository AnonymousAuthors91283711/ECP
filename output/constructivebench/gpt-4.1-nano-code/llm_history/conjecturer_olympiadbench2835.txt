. Enumerated answers: timeout triggered. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Since \(T = \sqrt{26}\), then \(T^{20} = (\sqrt{26})^{20} = (26^{1/2})^{20} = 26^{10}\). The product \(a * b = 26^{10} * 210^{12}\), with \(\gcd(a, b) =1\), implies \(a\) and \(b\) are coprime divisors. To keep them coprime, assign \(a=26^{10}\) and \(b=210^{12}\), or vice versa. The total count is 2.
