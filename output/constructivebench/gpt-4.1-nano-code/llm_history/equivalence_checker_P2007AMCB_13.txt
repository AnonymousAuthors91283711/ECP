theorem P2007AMCB_13 : 
  let cycle := 30 + 3 + 30
  let change_intervals := 3 + 3  -- 3 seconds at end of green (yellow transition), 3 seconds at end of yellow (red transition)
  change_intervals / cycle = P2007AMCB_13_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 1/7
Proposed Answer: 2 / 21
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The cycle length is correctly calculated as 30 (green) + 3 (yellow) + 30 (red) = 63 seconds
2. The change intervals are correctly calculated as 3 (yellow transition) + 3 (red transition) = 6 seconds
3. The ratio is therefore 6/63 = 2/21 when simplified (dividing numerator and denominator by 3)
4. The ground truth answer is 1/7, which would be 9/63 (not matching the problem's parameters)

The proposed answer 2/21 is correct based on the given problem parameters, while the ground truth answer 1/7 is incorrect for this specific setup.
