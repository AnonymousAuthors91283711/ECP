theorem P2021AMCA_19 : 
  Nat.card {x : ℝ | x ∈ Set.Icc 0 π ∧ sin (π/2 * cos x) = cos (π/2 * sin x)} = P2021AMCA_19_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Approximate solution at x = 0.000
Total approximate solutions: 1
At x=0.000: left=1.000000, right=1.000000
At x=1.571: left=0.000000, right=0.000000
At x=3.142: left=-1.000000, right=1.000000. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The solutions show the function equals 1 at x=0, and the zeros occur at x=π/2, π, indicating only the solution at x=0 within [0, π].  
Answer: <<<1>>>.
