The problem involves analyzing expectations over different options, each represented as triples, and checking if a particular value is the least in the set of these expectations. Since the original code references an undefined `omnimath2300_answer`, we'll enumerate the options, compute expected values for each, and identify the least expectations to help in conjecturing the answer.

**Approach:**

- Enumerate the 4 options provided.
- For each option (tuple), simulate or define the function `omnimath2300_answer` (here, we need to approximate or assume a plausible formula based on the context).
- Compute the expectations (outputs).
- Identify the minimum expectation value among these options.
- Output each computed expectation as soon as it is calculated, and finally, identify the least.

Since the explicit formula for `omnimath2300_answer` is not provided, for demonstration, we will assume it is the sum of the three components (or some simple function) to facilitate the enumeration.

```python
# Since the definition of omnimath2300_answer is not provided,
# assume it to be the sum of the three numbers for demonstration.
# The real implementation needs the actual formula.

def omnimath2300_answer(option):
    # Placeholder function: sum of the three components
    return sum(option)

# Enumerate options
options = [
    (1/3, 1/3, 1/3),
    (1/2, 1/4, 1/4),
    (2/5, 3/10, 3/10),
    (3/4, 1/8, 1/8)
]

expectations = []
for i, option in enumerate(options):
    val = omnimath2300_answer(option)
    print(f"Option {i+1}: {option} => Expectation: {val}")
    expectations.append((val, option))

# Find the minimum expectation
min_expectation, min_option = min(expectations, key=lambda x: x[0])
print(f"The least expectation is {min_expectation} for option {min_option}")
```
