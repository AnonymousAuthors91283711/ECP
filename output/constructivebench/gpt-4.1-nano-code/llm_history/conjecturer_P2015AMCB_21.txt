theorem P2015AMCB_21 :
  let possible_steps := Finset.filter (fun n => cozy_jumps n - dash_jumps n = 19 ∧ n > 0) (Finset.range 1000)
  let s := Finset.sum possible_steps id
  (List.sum (Nat.digits 10 s)) = P2015AMCB_21_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Candidate n: 63
Candidate n: 64
Candidate n: 66
Sum of all candidates: 193
Sum of digits of total sum: 13. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Since 63, 64, 66 satisfy cozy_jumps n - dash_jumps n = 19 and sum their difference's digit sum to 13, the total sum is 193; the sum of digits of total is 13. The expected answer matches this digit sum, so the constant sum across candidates is 13.
