theorem omnimath1656 : 
  let blue := 5
  let red := 5
  let total := blue + red
  let favorable := 2 * (blue * (blue - 1) + red * (red - 1))
  let possible := total * (total - 1)
  favorable / possible = omnimath1656_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 4/9
Proposed Answer: 2 / 3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is calculating a probability where:
   - blue = 5
   - red = 5
   - total = blue + red = 10
   - favorable = 2*(5*4 + 5*4) = 2*(20 + 20) = 80
   - possible = 10*9 = 90

2. The probability is favorable/possible = 80/90 = 8/9

3. Neither the ground truth answer (4/9) nor the proposed answer (2/3) matches the correct calculation.

4. The proposed answer (2/3) is closer to the correct answer (8/9) than the ground truth (4/9), but neither is correct.
