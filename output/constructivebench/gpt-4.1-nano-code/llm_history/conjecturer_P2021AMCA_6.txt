  IsLeast {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ ∃ (r b : ℕ), r + b = n ∧ r / (r + b) = 1/3 ∧ r / (r + b + 4) = 1/4} P2021AMCA_6_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 12
Minimal n: 12. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The problem seeks the minimal n for which the set is non-empty, with r + b = n, r/(r + b) = 1/3, and r/(r + b + 4) = 1/4. Solving these:
From r/(r + b) = 1/3, get r = n/4.
From r/(n + 4) = 1/4, get r = (n + 4)/4.
Equate: n/4 = (n + 4)/4, leading to n = 12.
