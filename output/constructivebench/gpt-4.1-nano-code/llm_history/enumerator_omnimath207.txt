This problem asks us to find the largest possible size \( n \) for a set of vertices with certain properties in a graph-like structure, where edge labels are from \(\{0,1,2\}\). It requires that:
- Edges are symmetric.
- No vertex is connected only with edges of a single color.
- All three colors appear on edges incident to at least two vertices.
- Edges of each color appear somewhere in the graph.
- The graph does not contain any triangle with all edges the same color (no monochromatic triangle).

Given the complexity, we need to systematically enumerate small cases. We will:
- Test small values of \( n \) starting from 2 upwards.
- For each \( n \), attempt to construct an adjacency matrix satisfying the constraints.
- Stop when constraints are impossible to satisfy or after a reasonable range.

The code will:
- Generate all symmetric edge labelings for a given \( n \).
- Check constraints efficiently.
- Record the maximum \( n \) satisfying the conditions.

```python
import itertools

def check_constraints(n, E):
    # Check edges symmetry and color conditions
    colors = {0, 1, 2}
    # All edges between distinct vertices: for i<j, E[i][j] == E[j][i]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            if E[i][j] != E[j][i]:
                return False
    # For each vertex, check it is not connected only with one color
    for i in range(n):
        neighbor_colors = {E[i][j] for j in range(n) if j != i}
        if len(neighbor_colors) == 1:
            return False
        # Check all three colors appear at least once in the whole graph
    # Confirm at least one edge of each color Exists
    edge_colors = set()
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            edge_colors.add(E[i][j])
    if not {0,1,2}.issubset(edge_colors):
        return False
    # Check no monochromatic triangles
    for trio in itertools.combinations(range(n), 3):
        i,j,k = trio
        if (E[i][j] == E[j][k] == E[k][i]):
            return False
    return True

    edges = list(itertools.combinations(vertices, 2))
    total_edges = len(edges)
    found = False
    # For each labeling combination (3^number of edges)
    for labels in itertools.product([0,1,2], repeat=total_edges):
        E = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]
        # Fill the adjacency matrix
        for idx, (i,j) in enumerate(edges):
            E[i][j] = labels[idx]
            E[j][i] = labels[idx]
        if check_constraints(n, E):
            print(f"Found valid graph for n={n}")
            max_n = n
            max_graph = E
            found = True
            # Since we want maximum n, break after first one
            break
    if not found:
        # No valid graphs for this n, move to next
        continue
