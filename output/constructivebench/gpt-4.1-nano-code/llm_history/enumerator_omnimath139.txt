The problem involves defining a function `omnimath139_answer` that, given `n ≥ 2`, computes the maximum possible `m` where there exists a finite set `A` of vectors `(Fin n → ℕ)` with specific closure and boundedness properties. The set `A` must satisfy:

- Each element `a` in `A` is pointwise bounded by its index.
- `A` is a subset of all bounded vectors.
- `A` is closed under pointwise maximum and minimum operations.
- `A` is finite with size `m`.
- The theorem claims that `omnimath139_answer n` is the greatest such `m`.

The key is to find the maximum size of such an `A`. Since the conditions imply `A` is closed under `max` and `min`, and all elements are bounded, the largest such set is formed by all vectors taking values in `{0, 1, ..., i}` for some maximum `i`. To maximize `A`, choose `i = n - 1` (since each coordinate is bounded by its index), and consider the set of all vectors with coordinates in `{0, 1, ..., n-1}` bounded by their index coordinate.

Because each coordinate `k` (from `0` to `n-1`) can take values from `0` to `k`, the maximum size is the product over `k` of `(k+1)` (since coordinate `k` has `k+1` choices).

Thus, the size is `∏_{k=0}^{n-1} (k+1) = n!`.

We will implement this logic to compute the factorial, which is the maximum `m`.

```python
import math

def omnimath139_answer(n):
    # Maximum set size is factorial of n
    return math.factorial(n)

# Test cases for small n
for n in range(2, 6):
    print(f"n = {n}, maximum size m = {omnimath139_answer(n)}")
```
