theorem P2008AMCA_15 : 
  (2008^2 + 2^2008)^2 + 2^(2008^2 + 2^2008) ≡ P2008AMCA_15_answer [MOD 10] := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 6. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the expression and the pattern in enumerated answers, the dominant terms for mod 10 are the squares and powers, which influence the last digit. The pattern shows the last digit tends to stabilize around 6 for large exponent combinations.

Hence, the most consistent and logical closed form answer is:

<<<6>>>
