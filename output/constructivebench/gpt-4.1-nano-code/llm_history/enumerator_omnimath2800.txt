The problem involves analyzing the equation \( m^n = 2^{25} \times 3^{40} \), with constraints \( m > 0 \) and \( n > 1 \). To find all solutions, we need to factor \( m \) into prime powers that divide \( 2^{25} \times 3^{40} \). Specifically, \( m \) must be of the form \( 2^a \times 3^b \) where \( a \le 25 \) and \( b \le 40 \). Then, \( m^n = 2^{a n} \times 3^{b n} \), which should equal \( 2^{25} \times 3^{40} \). Equating exponents:

\[
a n = 25 \quad \text{and} \quad b n = 40
\]

Since \( a, b, n \) are positive integers, \( n \) must divide both 25 and 40. We enumerate all such \( n \), then find corresponding \( a, b \) and compute \( m = 2^{a} \times 3^{b} \) and sum \( m + n \). We collect all solutions and identify the minimal answer.

```python
# Enumerate all possible n dividing both 25 and 40
# Find all common divisors of 25 and 40
import math

divisors_25 = [d for d in range(1, 26) if 25 % d == 0]
divisors_40 = [d for d in range(1, 41) if 40 % d == 0]

# Common divisors are potential n
common_divisors = sorted(set(divisors_25).intersection(divisors_40))

answers = []

for n in common_divisors:
    # For each n, find a and b such that a * n = 25 and b * n = 40
    a = 25 // n
    b = 40 // n
    # Construct m
    m = (2 ** a) * (3 ** b)
    answers.append((m + n))
    print(m + n)

# Output the minimal sum as the answer
print("Minimal answer:", min(answers))
```
