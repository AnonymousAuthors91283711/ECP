The problem involves calculating the percentage of acid remaining after mixing certain quantities and then verifying if it matches a specific answer. The key steps are:

- Sum the initial amounts of acid.
- Sum the total amounts before the new mix.
- Subtract the mix amounts to find remaining amounts.
- Compute the remaining acid percentage.

Since the variables have fixed values, and the calculation is straightforward, we can directly perform the arithmetic in Python, ensuring correctness and immediacy of output.

```python
# Define known quantities
A_total = 40.0
A_acid = 0.1 * A_total
B_total = 50.0
B_acid = 0.2 * B_total
C_total = 50.0
C_acid = 0.3 * C_total
new_mix_total = 60.0
new_mix_acid = 0.25 * new_mix_total

# Calculate remaining quantities after mixing
remaining_total = (A_total + B_total + C_total) - new_mix_total
remaining_acid = (A_acid + B_acid + C_acid) - new_mix_acid

# Compute the percentage of remaining acid
remaining_percentage = (remaining_acid / remaining_total) * 100

# Output the result
print(remaining_percentage)
```

This program calculates and outputs the percentage of acid remaining after the specified mixing process.
