Ground Truth Answer: 2
Proposed Answer: 3
Let me analyze this problem carefully:

1. The problem defines a recursive sequence where:
   - For even n: next term is n/2 + 1
   - For odd n: next term is (n+1)/2
2. Starting with 16, we need to compute the 100th term
3. The ground truth answer is 2
4. The proposed answer is 3

Let's compute the first few terms to see the pattern:
- Term 0: 16 (given)
- Term 1: 16/2 + 1 = 9 (since 16 is even)
- Term 2: (9+1)/2 = 5 (since 9 is odd)
- Term 3: (5+1)/2 = 3
- Term 4: (3+1)/2 = 2
- Term 5: 2/2 + 1 = 2 (since 2 is even)
From term 4 onward, the sequence stays at 2 forever.

The proposed answer of 3 is only correct for term 3, but by term 100 the sequence has stabilized at 2. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
