The problem asks to find all triples (a, b, c) of positive integers such that the sum of four gcds equals 199:
\[ 
\gcd(a^2, b^2) + \gcd(a, bc) + \gcd(b, ac) + \gcd(c, ab) = 199 
\]
and to identify the set of such triples.

Key observations:
- Since \( a, b, c > 0 \), gcds are positive.
- \(\gcd(a^2, b^2) = (\gcd(a, b))^2\). So the first term depends on gcd of a and b.
- The other gcd terms involve pairwise gcds scaled by the third variable.

To narrow search:
- Let's consider small values of \( a, b, c \) with manageable gcds.
- Given that total sum is 199, which is odd, and gcds are positive integers, the gcd of any pair must contribute to sum adding up to 199.

The maximum for gcds:
- Since gcds are positive integers, and the sum equals 199, their maximum possible individual gcds are less than or equal to 199.

A straightforward approach:
- Fix small \( a \) and \( b \) (say up to 10), compute their gcd, and attempt various \( c \) to reach the total.

Note:
- Because of symmetry, attempt minimal search space.

```python
from math import gcd

# Threshold for enumeration
max_value = 20

for a in range(1, max_value + 1):
    for b in range(1, max_value + 1):
        g_ab = gcd(a, b)
        g_a2_b2 = gcd(a**2, b**2)
        # Try small c to satisfy the sum condition
        for c in range(1, max_value + 1):
            g_bc = gcd(b, a * c)
            g_ac = gcd(a, b * c)
            g_c_ab = gcd(c, a * b)
            total = g_a2_b2 + g_bc + g_ac + g_c_ab
            if total == 199:
                print((a, b, c))
```

The problem asks to find positive integers (a,b,c) satisfying a specific gcd sum condition, with the total exactly 199. The original Python program enumerates small values (up to 20) for a, b, c. However, it fails to find solutions, which strongly suggests that solutions, if any, require larger values or are not within the small bounds.

**Judgment:**
- The current enumeration limits (max_value=20) may be too small to find solutions, especially if the actual solutions involve larger numbers.
- Since the program outputs nothing, it indicates either no solutions within the small range or that solutions are outside the checked bounds.
- The approach is correct in principle: it's a brute-force search, prioritizing correctness and streaming answers.
- To improve, we should try larger bounds, e.g., 100, to encompass potential solutions.

**Acceptance:**
- The program matches the problem's approach: enumerates possible solutions, outputs immediate results, and runs without input.
- It is safe to accept it as the base, but with an expanded range to potentially find solutions.

**Final decision:**
- Accept the code but improve it by increasing `max_value` to 100 for better coverage.

```python
from math import gcd

# Increased the range to 100 to search for solutions more effectively
max_value = 100

for a in range(1, max_value + 1):
    for b in range(1, max_value + 1):
        g_a2_b2 = gcd(a**2, b**2)
        for c in range(1, max_value + 1):
            g_bc = gcd(b, a * c)
            g_ac = gcd(a, b * c)
            g_c_ab = gcd(c, a * b)
            total = g_a2_b2 + g_bc + g_ac + g_c_ab
            if total == 199:
                print((a, b, c))
```

Let's analyze the situation:

- The problem involves finding positive integers (a, b, c) such that the sum of four gcds is exactly 199.
- The Python code searches within a bounded range (1 to 100) for such solutions.
- The code correctly computes the gcds and checks the sum, printing any matches.
- However, the code produces no output, indicating no solutions found in the range.

Given that the search range is only up to 100, it's possible the solutions involve larger numbers, or perhaps the search is too narrow. Since the problem appears to require solutions with sum exactly equal to 199, and the code yields no solutions in that early range, it suggests solutions may involve larger values.

According to the problem requirements:
- The code should produce solutions if they exist within the searched range.
- The output is expected to be streamed immediately when solutions are found.
- The search range should be extended for better coverage to find solutions, especially since the initial attempts produce none.

**Judgement:**
- The code is correct in logic but perhaps insufficient in search range.
- It is acceptable to extend the search range to improve chances of finding solutions.
- Since the problem is likely constructed so solutions exist within a reasonable range, increasing `max_value` makes sense.

**Therefore:** The original program is too limited and outputs nothing, so it's technically rejected under the criteria that it should find solutions if they exist in some feasible small range.

### Corrected Program:
- Increase the search bounds, e.g., to 200 or 300.
- Print solutions immediately; the code already does this.
- No other modifications necessary.

```python
from math import gcd

# Increased the range to 200 to search more extensively
max_value = 200

for a in range(1, max_value + 1):
    for b in range(1, max_value + 1):
        g_a2_b2 = gcd(a**2, b**2)
        for c in range(1, max_value + 1):
            g_bc = gcd(b, a * c)
            g_ac = gcd(a, b * c)
            g_c_ab = gcd(c, a * b)
            total = g_a2_b2 + g_bc + g_ac + g_c_ab
            if total == 199:
                print((a, b, c))
```

**Summary:**

- **Judgement:** Rejected
