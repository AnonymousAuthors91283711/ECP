theorem P2010AMCB_10 (x : ℝ) : 
  ((List.sum (List.map (fun n => (n + 1 : ℝ)) (List.range 99))) + x) / 101 = 100 * x ↔ x = P2010AMCB_10_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Approximate solution x: 0.49014753936033273
Exact solution x: 4950/10099
LHS: 49.014753936033266, RHS: 49.01475393603327. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern in the enumerated answers suggests that the exact solution is a rational number close to the approximate value, derived from a sum over integers 1 to 99 added to x, then scaled. The sum of numbers 1 to 99 is 99 * 100 / 2 = 4950. Rearranging the equation yields x = (sum + x * 101) / 100 * 101, which simplifies to x = 4950/10099.
