The problem involves calculating the volume of a set in ℝ² defined by inequalities, with the region characterized by the parity of n and the approximation condition involving (p.1 - p.2)/(p.1 + p.2). The candidate answer hints at a weighted sum over odd integers, reflecting the measure contribution according to how the difference-to-sum ratio approximates odd integers.

The incorrect syntax in the existing proposed answer arises because in Lean we can't directly write a set comprehension or summation over ℤ with a filter like {n ∈ ℤ, odd}. Instead, we need to explicitly specify the sum over all odd integers n, using `finset` or sequences, or express the sum as an infinite sum over all odd n.

Based on the pattern, the main contributions come from the neighborhoods of odd integers n, with measure contributions that seem to depend on the approximate proximity to these integers, possibly modeled with indicator functions or the measure of the intersections.

Conjecture:
- The measure is composed of a base value plus a sum over odd n, weighted appropriately.
- The measure's structure suggests summing over all odd integers, with the 1/3 factor, scaled by an indicator that the approximation condition is met.

Approximating the formula:
volume = 2/3 + (1/3) * sum over odd n of the indicator whether the approximation condition holds ((p.1 - p.2)/(p.1 + p.2) is within 1/2 of n), with measure proportional to whether in that neighborhood.

Final form:
Since the sum over all odd n is infinite but the contributions are non-zero only for finitely many n near the values from the enumeration, a compact closed form can be written as:
- A base measure of 2/3
- Plus a sum over all odd integers n (modeled as 2k+1 for k in ℤ), with a coefficient 1/3.

In Lean:
- The sum over odd n can be expressed as sum over all integers k in ℤ, with n := 2k+1.
- We'll write the sum as `∑ k in ℤ, (if odd n then 1 else 0)`.

Since Lean doesn't handle sum over ℤ directly without explicit finite approximation, a closed form sum over all ℤ is formalized via `sum` over ℤ with the indicator function.

Given the pattern and the enumeration, the measure concentrates at specific odd integers, particularly near n = -1, 0, 1, with significant contributions in those neighborhoods, and negligible elsewhere. The pattern suggests that the total measure can be expressed as a sum over odd integers n, with weights corresponding to the measure's concentration near those n, plus a base contribution. Since the measure is approximately 0.1692 near n= ±1, and 0.6597 at n=0, the total measure likely is a weighted sum reflecting these contributions.

By analyzing the enumerated data:
- For n = -1 and 1, measure ≈ 0.1692
- For n=0, measure ≈ 0.6597
- For others, measure ≈ 0

This hints that the total measure equals a base of 2/3 (≈0.6667) plus some correction terms. Considering the symmetry and the pattern, a plausible closed form is:

- sum over all odd n of indicator functions that n is near n (which in the actual sum would contribute only finitely many terms),

but in the context of a formal closed-form answer, and considering the enumeration, the sum is dominated by three terms: n = -1, 0, 1.

Thus, a formal simplified closed form expression in Lean syntax, generalizing from the enumeration, would be:

```lean
(2/3) + (1/3) * (∑' n : ℤ, (if n = -1 ∨ n = 1 then 1 else if n = 0 then 2 else 0))
```

which simplifies to including only those key n, emphasizing the dominant contributions.
