The pattern suggests comparing the product form to a cubic growth with a certain rate. Given P_A and P_B, P_A equals P_B when the compounded growth factors match. Calculate the total growth factor from P_A: (1 - 0.029) * (1 + 0.089) * (1 + 0.069) ≈ 1.0 + r/100 cubed. Solving for r: r ≈ [(1 - 0.029) * (1 + 0.089) * (1 + 0.069) - 1] * 100. 

The approximate growth rate (r): 5.5%. The final answer in Lean:

The core idea is to match the product of growth factors to the cube of a single growth factor, corresponding to the overall growth rate `r`. The calculation involves multiplying the three given factors, subtracting 1, and then converting the resulting total growth factor into a percentage. From the enumerated pattern, the key is to compute:

\[
r = \left( (1 - 0.029) \times (1 + 0.089) \times (1 + 0.069) - 1 \right) \times 100
\]

This expression correctly captures the combined percentage growth from the three individual factors. The approach aligns with the pattern observed in the enumeration, which suggests that the overall growth rate is derived directly from the product of the individual growths.

Thus, the fixed, compilable Lean answer is:

<<<(( (1 - 0.029) * (1 + 0.089) * (1 + 0.069) - 1 ) * 100)>>>
