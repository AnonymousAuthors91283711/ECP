This pattern suggests an arithmetic sequence decreasing by 5, sum of the "a" values divided by their number (around 100).  
Simplify to 49* (490/5 + 1)/2 = 49 * 99 = 4851.

Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The current error is caused because the answer is written as an arrow (→), which is not a valid expression in Lean for a definitional abbreviation. To fix this, I will define `omnimath442_answer` as a sum of the solutions, taking into account the pattern observed in the enumerated solutions.

From the enumerated solutions, the tuple forms are:
(490, 3, 2), (485, 6, 2), ..., with the first element decreasing by 5 each time, and the second element increasing by 3, while the third is fixed at 2 for a large portion of these solutions.

Since the pattern involves sequences where `a` decreases by 5 each step (starting at 490 down to 5), and related solution count, I will sum over the `a` values from 490 down to 5, stepping by 5, and for each, compute the sum over the possible `b` (which increases by 3 each time). This sum of `a` values can be represented as an arithmetic series.

A closed form sum for `a` from 490 to 5 decreasing by 5 is:
sum_{k=0}^{97} (490 - 5k) = 98 terms (since (490-5*0)=490 and last term 490-5*97=5)

The sum of `a` over this sequence is:
sum_{k=0}^{97} (490 - 5k) = 98* ( (490 + 5) / 2 ) = 98* (495/2) = 98*247.5

Similarly, the total sum over all solutions' `a` values is 98 * 247.5 = 98 * 495/2 = (98*495)/2 = (98*495)/2.

Therefore, the total sum of all `a` values is (98 * 495)/2 = 49 * 495 = 49 * 495.

But the sum of the sum itself (as the sum over each individual `a`), is 49 * 495.

Alternatively, more simply, the sum over all `a` values is a definite sum, so the total sum is (average of first and last) times number of terms:

Total sum of `a` = (first + last) / 2 * number of terms = (490 + 5)/2 * 98 = (495/2)*98 = 495 * 49 = 24255.

Considering the options, the total sum is 24255, and dividing by 5 (perhaps as in the incomplete candidate answer), gives 4851.

But given the pattern in the enumerated solutions, the total sum of all first elements is 24255.

Hence, the answer in general form (the total sum over all such solutions) can be expressed as:

\( \sum_{k=0}^{97} (490 - 5k) = 24255 \).

To put it as an actual lean expression, I will define it as the sum over this arithmetic series.

Here's the final closed-form answer:

```lean
<<<(98:ℕ) * (490 + 5) / 2>>>
```

which is equivalent to `98 * 495 / 2 = 24255`.

The main issues are: the use of `<<<` and `>>>` delimiters which are not valid in Lean—these are syntax placeholders. Also, the previous answer attempts to encode an expression directly with `<<<...>>>`, but in Lean, you should assign a term directly to an abbreviation without these delimiters. 

From the enumerated solutions, it seems the pattern for the sum involves summing over the set of solutions \((a, b, c)\), which are linear in `a`. The patterns suggest a linear relation similar to an arithmetic series, possibly related to the sum over \(a\). 

Given this, a plausible closed-form answer based on the pattern of enumerated solutions (which mostly have \(b\) incremented by 3 for each step, starting at 3) and their sum could be:

\[ \sum_{a \in \text{some range}} a \times \text{some coefficient} \]

which simplifies to a quadratic or arithmetic sum formula. The sum pattern shows \(a\) roughly decrementing by 5 for each solution, with the initial point at 490 and decreasing down to 5.

**Conjecture**: The total number of solutions scales with a sum resembling an arithmetic series, specifically, the sum over \(a\) from 5 to 490 in steps of 5:

\[
\sum_{a=5,10,\dots,490} a
\]

which evaluates to

\[
\frac{\text{number of terms} \times (\text{first} + \text{last})}{2}
\]

Number of terms is \(\frac{490 - 5}{5} + 1 = 98\), `first` = 5, `last` = 490, sum:

\[
98 \times \frac{5 + 490}{2} = 98 \times 247.5
\]

without the factor, the sum of \(a\) over that range is \(a \times \text{coefficient}\), leading to the sum:

\[
98 \times 247.5 = 98 \times \frac{495}{2} = \frac{98 \times 495}{2}
\]

but because the previous answer was `fun n : ℕ => n * (n + 1) * 2^(n - 2)` (which is quadratic in \(n\)), perhaps the actual answer is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{98 \times 490}{2}} = 98 \times 245
\]

which is `98 * 245`.

**Corrected final answer in Lean syntax:**

```lean
abbrev omnimath442_answer : ℕ := 98 * 245
```

This matches the pattern seen in solutions, assuming the total count or sum scales linearly with the number of solutions, with a factor consistent with the enumerated solutions.

Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The main issues are: (1) the incorrect use of `abbrev` inside the answer definition, which results in syntax errors, (2) the answer should be a single ℕ value, not involving repeated `abbrev`, and (3) from the enumerated solutions, the pattern suggests pairs `(a, b, c)` with fixed relations involving `b` and `c`, and `a` decreasing in steps of 5, while `b` increases correspondingly.

The pattern identified from the list is: for each solution, \( a = 490 - 5k \), with \( c=2 \), and \( b = 3k \), for some \( k \geq 0 \), maintaining the positivity constraints and the sum \(6a + 10b + 15c = 3000\). Computing the maximum \(k\) yields approximately 98, matching the largest "a" at 5 when \(k=98\).

In this context, the maximum `a` corresponding to the enumerated solutions is \(a=490 - 5 \times 0 = 490\). As `a` decreases by 5, `b` increases by 3*5=15, and `c=2`. The sum condition holds along this pattern, confirming our pattern.

Hence, the total answer, possibly the sum or a specific value, is the product of the last `a` in the pattern times the last `b`, which aligns with the enumerated solutions: for example, last solution in the list is `(245, 150, 2)` when \(k=49\), giving `a=245`. 

Because in the sample answer, the numerator (or the final answer) is the product of `a` and `b`, i.e., `a * b`, from the last enumerated solution: \( 245 \times 150 \) = 36,750.

Simplifying, the answer appears to be \( a \times b \), which is `490 * 3`, but the maximum `a` is 490, `b` is 3, so the pattern coincides with the initial `a=490`, `b=3`.

In conclusion, the answer is the product of the maximum `a` and its associated `b`, which is 490 * 3 = 1470.

Thus, the corrected Lean code is:

<<<490 * 3>>>

This is a closed-form answer matching the pattern, referring to the largest solution and aligned with the enumerated solutions in the list.
