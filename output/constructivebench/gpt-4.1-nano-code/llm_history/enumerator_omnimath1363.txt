The goal is to find the greatest possible integer \(k\) such that there exists a real polynomial \(p\) with degree 2010 (since \(\coeff p 2010 = 1\)), all coefficients either \(-1\) or 1 for indices \(0 \leq i < 2010\), and such that \(p(x) \neq 0\) for all real \(x\). Furthermore, \(k\) counts how many coefficients less than 2010 are equal to \(-1\).

Since direct formal proof is complex, we will empirically construct candidate polynomials with various patterns of coefficients \(-1, 1\) and check the non-vanishing condition numerically. We aim to find configurations that maximize the number of \(-1\) coefficients, especially focusing on the first 2010 coefficients, with the leading coefficient fixed at 1.

For efficiency, we will:
- Fix the highest coefficient as 1
- Vary the number and positions of \(-1\) coefficients among the lower degrees
- Use a polynomial evaluation at several points to verify the non-zero condition

We only print solutions when the polynomial appears to be non-zero at sampled points.

```python
import numpy as np

# Polynomial degree
degree = 2010
max_candidates = 50  # Limit attempts for efficiency

# Function to evaluate polynomial given coefficients
def evaluate_poly(coeffs, x):
    return sum(c * x**i for i, c in enumerate(coeffs))

# Generate candidate coefficient patterns
# Fixed leading coefficient
leading_coeff = 1

# Store best found count and pattern
best_k = -1
best_pattern = None

np.random.seed(42)

for num_neg in range(0, min(degree, max_candidates) + 1):
    # Try multiple random patterns with num_neg negatives
    for _ in range(10):  # 10 tries per count
        coeffs = [1] * degree
        # Choose random positions for -1
        neg_positions = np.random.choice(range(degree), size=num_neg, replace=False)
        for pos in neg_positions:
            coeffs[pos] = -1
        coeffs.append(leading_coeff)  # degree 2010 term at the end
        # Check non-vanishing at several points
        xs = np.linspace(-10, 10, 5)
        if all(abs(evaluate_poly(coeffs, x)) > 1e-3 for x in xs):
            k = num_neg
            print(f"Candidate with {k} negatives: positions {sorted(neg_positions)}")
            # Keep track if it better than previous
            if k > best_k:
                best_k = k
                best_pattern = coeffs

# Output the best found pattern's count
print(f"Maximum negatives encountered: {best_k}")
```
