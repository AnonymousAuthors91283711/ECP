theorem P2022AMCA_4 : 
  ∃! n : ℕ, 0 < n ∧ Nat.lcm n 18 = 180 ∧ Nat.gcd n 45 = 15 ∧ (Nat.digits 10 n).sum = P2022AMCA_4_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n=60, gcd=15, lcm=6*18//6=180, digit_sum=6
Answer: n=60, digit sum=6. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests that n=60 satisfies all conditions, and its digit sum is 6. The answer is independent of the specific value of n, and the digit sum is a fixed property for this n. 

<<<6>>>
