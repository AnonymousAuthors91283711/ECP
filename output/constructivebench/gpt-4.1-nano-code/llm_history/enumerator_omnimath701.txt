The problem involves computing an expected value based on given probability distributions. To understand the sum, we need to evaluate:

\[
\sum_{j \in \{1,2,3\}} \text{jerry\_prob}(j) \times \sum_{n \in \{1,2,3\}} \text{neil\_prob}(j, n) \text{ (only when } n=3)
\]

Since `neil_prob(j, n)` is zero unless \( n \ge j \), for \( n=3 \), it is non-zero only when \( 3 \ge j \), which is always true, so the inner sum simplifies as we only consider \( n=3 \).

The key computations:
- \( \text{jerry\_prob}(j) = 1/3 \) for \( j \in \{1,2,3\} \).
- \( \text{neil\_prob}(j, 3) = (1/3) \times (2/3)^{3 - j} \) for \( j \le 3 \).

Thus, the total sum becomes:

\[
\sum_{j=1}^{3} \frac{1}{3} \times \left( \frac{1}{3} \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{3 - j} \right)
= \sum_{j=1}^{3} \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{3} \times \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{3 - j}
= \frac{1}{9} \sum_{j=1}^{3} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{3 - j}
\]

Calculating this sum over \( j=1,2,3 \), the exponents vary accordingly.

Let's implement the enumeration explicitly.

```python
# Enumerate the sum explicitly over the outcomes
# Using small sample values and summation reasoning
outcomes = [1, 2, 3]
result = 0
for j in outcomes:
    j_prob = 1/3
    # sum over n=3 only, since n=3 is where the inner sum contributes
    n = 3
    if n >= j:
        neil_prob = (1/3) * ((2/3) ** (n - j))
        term = j_prob * neil_prob
        print(term)
        result += term

print("Total sum (approximate):", result)
```
