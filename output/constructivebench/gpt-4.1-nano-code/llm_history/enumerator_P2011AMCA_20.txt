This problem involves a quadratic function \(f(x) = a x^2 + b x + c\) with given constraints at points \(x=1, 7, 8\), and an inequality involving \(f(100)\) that depends on some integer \(k\). The goal is to find a specific \(k\) satisfying the inequalities, potentially involving the value of \(f(100)\).

To approach this:

- We know \(f(1) = 0\), giving \(a + b + c = 0\).
- \(f(7)\) is between 50 and 60.
- \(f(8)\) is between 70 and 80.
  
Given \(f(x)=a x^2 + b x + c\), the constraints at points \(x=7, 8\) translate to inequalities involving \(a, b, c\).

To narrow down possible \(f(100)\), we'll:

- Choose representative small values for \(a, b, c\) satisfying the constraints.
- Use these to compute \(f(100)\).
- For each such \(f(100)\), derive the corresponding \(k\).

Because the problem wants to identify the unique \(k\), we'll check all plausible combinations (here small sample points) and output the consistent \(k\).

Here's the Python code that enumerates candidate solutions consistent with the constraints to facilitate conjecture:

```python
# Enumerate possible quadratic functions consistent with the constraints
# For simplicity, fix small ranges for coefficients and check constraints
for a in range(-10, 11):
    for b in range(-10, 11):
        for c in range(-10, 11):
            # Check f(1)=0 => a + b + c = 0
            if a + b + c != 0:
                continue
            # Calculate f(7)
            f7 = a*7**2 + b*7 + c
            if not (50 < f7 < 60):
                continue
            # Calculate f(8)
            f8 = a*8**2 + b*8 + c
            if not (70 < f8 < 80):
                continue
            # Compute f(100)
            f100 = a*100**2 + b*100 + c
            # For candidate k satisfying inequalities
            for k in range(0, 20):
                lower_bound = 5000 * k
                upper_bound = 5000 * (k + 1)
                if lower_bound < f100 < upper_bound:
                    # Output candidate answer
                    print(f"k = {k}, f(100) = {f100}, a={a}, b={b}, c={c}")
```
