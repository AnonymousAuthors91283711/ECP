The problem involves sums of arithmetic sequences over the interval [1..n], with the sum ratios given for two different sums. We wish to find the value of a similar sum ratio under the same conditions. Because the sums involve sequences like ∑_{i=1}^n c*i = c * n(n+1)/2, we can derive formulas and then try candidate values for n that satisfy the given ratio.

Given the condition:  
(∑_{i=1}^n 3i) / (∑_{i=1}^n 5i) = 4/11, which simplifies to:  
(3 * n(n+1)/2) / (5 * n(n+1)/2) = 4/11

This simplifies further:  
3/5 = 4/11, which is not generally true unless n is constrained or additional conditions are in place. So, in practice, perhaps the ratios are derived for specific values of n that satisfy the fractional condition, and we want to explore those.

We will attempt small n from 1 up to some limit, check which n satisfies the ratio approximately 4/11, and then output the corresponding sum ratios (e.g., for sums involving 2i and 4i).

Since the problem requests efficiency and streaming output, and avoids brute force over large n, we'll limit to small n and check.

```python
# Enumerate candidate n from 1 to 20
for n in range(1, 21):
    sum1_num = 3 * n * (n + 1)
    sum1_den = 2
    sum2_num = 5 * n * (n + 1)
    sum2_den = 2
    ratio = (sum1_num / sum1_den) / (sum2_num / sum2_den)
    if abs(ratio - 4/11) < 1e-6:
        # Compute target sums: (∑ 2i) / (∑ 4i)
        sum_2i = 2 * n * (n + 1) / 2
        sum_4i = 4 * n * (n + 1) / 2
        answer = sum_2i / sum_4i
        print(f"n={n}, ratio={ratio:.4f}, answer={answer}")
        # Store answer for further use
        olympiadbench3040_answer = answer

The problem involves verifying an expression involving sums over an interval from 1 to n and ensuring that the Python code correctly enumerates and matches the problem's given condition. The code is attempting to find an n satisfying the ratio of sums matching 4/11 and then compute the ratio of the sums involving 2i and 4i.

However, the current code has some issues:
- It assumes the sums have a specific closed form, but using `sum1_num`, `sum1_den`, etc., with `n*(n+1)` seems to be deriving sums over the first n integers, which is correct, but the code's summation formula isn't consistent across all sums.
- The code prints no output because it doesn't check properly for matches, and in the current form, it might not find any n up to 20 satisfying the ratio condition, or the ratio comparison might be too strict.
- The code only runs a short range (n=1..20) and might miss the correct n.
- The code's checks and sum calculations need careful attention to ensure correctness.

**Verdict:**  
Given the code doesn't produce any output, it indicates that either no n in 1..20 satisfies the condition, or the ratio test is too strict. The problem asks for streaming answers, but the code only prints when a match is found, and no matches are found.

**Acceptance or rejection?**  
Since the code does not produce any output, and the problem likely expects at least one answer, **the program should be rejected** because it doesn't produce any answer.

**Corrected Program:**  
- The code should try a broader range (say 1..100).
- It should compare ratios more flexibly.
- It should print the computed answer immediately when a match is found.

Here's a corrected, minimal, and efficient version:

```python
# Enumerate candidate n from 1 to 100
for n in range(1, 101):
    sum1 = 3 * sum(i for i in range(1, n+1))
    sum2 = 5 * sum(i for i in range(1, n+1))
    ratio = sum1 / sum2
    if abs(ratio - 4/11) < 1e-6:
        sum_2i = 2 * sum(i for i in range(1, n+1))
        sum_4i = 4 * sum(i for i

This appears to be a formal Lean code involving summations over finite intervals, with a parameter n>0, and a given fractional relation involving sums of 3i and 5i over the interval [1, n]. The goal seems to be to determine the ratio of sums over 2i and 4i, under the given condition.

Since the provided code only contains 'sorry' placeholders and no executable program, no enumeration or evaluation is possible. The only information is the equations and the relation, which can be analyzed mathematically.

Mathematically, we have:

Given:
\[
\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n 3i}{\sum_{i=1}^n 5i} = \frac{4}{11}
\]
and we want to find:
\[
\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n 2i}{\sum_{i=1}^n 4i}
\]

The sums are straightforward:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^n i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\]

Thus:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^n a i = a \cdot \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\]

Calculating the numerator:
\[
3 \cdot \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{3 n(n+1)}{2}
\]
and denominator:
\[
5 \cdot \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{5 n(n+1)}{2}
\]

Therefore, their ratio:
\[
\frac{\frac{3n(n+1)}{2}}{\frac{5 n(n+1)}{2}} = \frac{3n(n+1)/2}{5n(n+1)/2} = \frac{3n(n+1)}{5n(n+1)} = \frac{3}{5}
\]

But this should equal 4/11 as per the problem statement:
\[
\frac{3}{5} = \frac{4}{11}
\]
which is false unless the sums are over a different interval, or the problem involves some other constraint.

Actually, note that the sums over i=1 to n produce ratios independent of n:
\[
\frac{\sum 3i}{\sum 5i} =
