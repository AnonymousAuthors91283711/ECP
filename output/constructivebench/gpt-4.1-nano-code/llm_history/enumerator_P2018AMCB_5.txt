The problem is asking to determine the cardinality of the set of all subsets \(s\) of \(\{2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}\) such that \(s\) contains at least one prime number. 

Steps to solve:
- Find all subsets of \(\{2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}\).
- Filter those that contain at least one prime.
- Count those subsets.

Since the set has 8 elements, total subsets are \(2^8 = 256\). The only subsets excluded are the ones with no primes, which are subsets of non-primes \(\{4,6,8,9\}\). 

Number of non-prime elements: 4. 
Total subsets of non-primes: \(2^4=16\). 
Subsets containing no prime: exactly these 16.

Thus, subsets containing at least one prime: \(256 - 16 = 240\).

```python
# Enumerate all subsets of the set {2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
# Count how many contain at least one prime number
elements = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
non_primes = [4, 6, 8, 9]
total_subsets = 1 << len(elements)  # 2^8 = 256
count_without_primes = 1 << len(non_primes)  # 2^4 = 16
answer = total_subsets - count_without_primes  # 240
print(answer)
```
