This problem involves evaluating a sum related to factorials and then taking a result modulo 1000. To assist with conjecturing the answer, we'll implement an enumeration of partial sums for small values and evaluate the sum explicitly, thus helping identify the pattern or the exact value.

Since the problem references factorials and sum over range 4, we'll compute the sum with small sample values, focusing on the sum:

\[ S = 1 + \sum_{k=0}^{3} 11 \times (11 - k) \times \mathrm{descFactorial}(11, k) \]

Assuming `descFactorial(11, k)` means the falling factorial \(11 \times 10 \times \dots \times (11 - k + 1)\), we'll compute these for k = 0 to 3.

```python
# Helper to compute descending factorial n * (n-1) * ... * (n - k + 1)
def desc_factorial(n, k):
    result = 1
    for i in range(k):
        result *= (n - i)
    return result

# Enumerate for k = 0 to 3
for k in range(4):
    df = desc_factorial(11, k)
    term = 11 * (11 - k) * df
    print(f"k = {k}, desc_factorial(11, {k}) = {df}, term = {term}")

# Compute sum
total_sum = 1 + sum(11 * (11 - k) * desc_factorial(11, k) for k in range(4))
print(f"Total sum: {total_sum}")

# Compute modulo 1000
answer_mod = total_sum % 1000
print(f"Answer mod 1000: {answer_mod}")
```
