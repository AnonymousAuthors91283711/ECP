This problem asks us to find the minimal number n such that for **every** finite subset T of the interval [1, 280] with size n, there exists a subset s of size 5 in T where **all pairs** are coprime. We want the least such n.

**Approach:**
- To find the least n that guarantees such a 5-element coprime subset inside any large enough T, we reason about the maximum size of sets that do **not** contain such a subset.
- As the problem is complex, we'll approximate by constructing large subsets that lack 5 pairwise coprime numbers, then determine when adding more elements inevitably yields such a subset.
- Since the maximal size of a set with no 5-element pairwise coprime subset is what we're after, we perform an enumeration over small candidate sets, focusing on sets avoiding large coprime subsets.

**Implementation plan:**
- Use small sample sets, starting from the largest known sets that avoid having 5 pairwise coprime numbers.
- For each candidate size, generate such sets and check whether they contain a coprime 5-element subset.
- When we find the smallest size where the property always holds, output that size.

**Note:**
- Due to computational constraints, we approximate by testing constructed sets.
- The actual minimal number is theoretically hard to find exactly; this code sketches a search that might help conjecture the minimal value.

```python
import itertools
import math

# Define the interval
interval = list(range(1, 281))

def are_pairwise_coprime(lst):
    for a, b in itertools.combinations(lst, 2):
        if math.gcd(a, b) != 1:
            return False
    return True

def has_coprime_subset_of_size_five(T):
    for subset in itertools.combinations(T, 5):
        if are_pairwise_coprime(subset):
            return True
    return False

# Generate a large subset avoiding a coprime-5 subset
# Strategy: build a set with common prime factors to restrict coprimality
# e.g., all numbers divisible by 2 or 3, avoiding possibility of 5 coprime numbers
candidate_sets = []

# Generate sets avoiding coprime 5-subset by restricting to composite numbers or those sharing factors
# For simplicity, take multiples of 2 and 3 within the interval
set1 = [x for x in interval if x % 2 == 0 or x % 3 == 0]
max_size = len(set1)

# Check if this set avoids a 5-element pairwise coprime subset
# If it does not contain such subset, then size is a candidate
if not has_coprime_subset_of_size_five(set1):
    candidate_sets.append(set1)

# Now test increasing subsets by removing elements, but for brevity, we'll focus on this set
# The size of such a set gives an upper bound for how big T can be without guaranteeing a coprime 5-subset
# Once the size surpasses this, the property must hold

# For demonstration, print the size of the largest set avoiding the property
print("Sample avoiding set size:", max_size)

# As an approximation, we conjecture the minimal n is max_size + 1
print("Conjectured minimal n:", max_size + 1)
