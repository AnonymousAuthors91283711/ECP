441. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The current proposed answer `fun s : ℕ => s = 225` is a function (of type ℕ → Prop) rather than a single natural number (of type ℕ). The abbreviation `P2002AMCB_13_answer` is intended to be a natural number, not a proposition. 

Based on the enumerated answer and standard practices in Lean, the correct fixed answer should directly assign the value 225 as the natural number literal. 

Hence, the corrected answer is just the number 225.
