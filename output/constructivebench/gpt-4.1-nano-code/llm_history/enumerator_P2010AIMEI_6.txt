This problem involves a quadratic polynomial \( P(x) = a x^2 + b x + c \) with provided bounds and a specific value at \( x=11 \). We aim to determine \( P(16) \). The bounds tell us that for all \( x \),
\[
x^2 - 2x + 2 \leq P(x) \leq 2x^2 - 4x + 3,
\]
which constrains the coefficients \(a, b, c\). 

To assist the conjecture, I will sample several \( (a, b, c) \) triplets satisfying the bounds and check the value of \( P(16) \). Since exact bounds are quadratic in \( x \), we can test extremal coefficients at the bounds to find minimum and maximum \( P(16) \) values consistent with the data, then output these. I will limit enumeration to small integer or rational coefficients fitting the bounds.

```python
# Enumeration of quadratic polynomials within bounds, focusing on extremal coefficients at key points.
# The bounds are quadratic functions; find candidate a, b, c satisfying them.
# For simplicity, we choose a small grid of samples for a, then compute corresponding b, c at x=11.
# Evaluate P(16) for each candidate and output the values immediately.

# Bound functions
def lower_bound(x):
    return x**2 - 2*x + 2

def upper_bound(x):
    return 2*x**2 - 4*x + 3

# Candidate coefficients based on bounds at x=11
x_test = 11
low_val = lower_bound(x_test)
high_val = upper_bound(x_test)

# a can be between 0 and 1 for simplicity, similar for other coefficients
candidate_as = [0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1]
answers = []

for a in candidate_as:
    # For fixed a, determine b, c to satisfy both bounds at x=11
    # P(11) = a*121 + 11b + c
    # From bounds:
    # low_val ≤ P(11) ≤ high_val
    # So, bounds for c:
    c_min_from_low = low_val - a*121 - 11*0  # minimal c when b=0
    c_max_from_high = high_val - a*121  # maximal c when b=0

    # Similarly, at x=16, P(16) = a*256 + 16b + c
    # For minimal P(16), pick minimal c compatible with bounds
    # For simplicity, set b=0, then c in [c_min, c_max]
    for c in [c_min_from_low, c_max_from_high]:
        # Check for b bounds at x=11: no explicit bounds on b given directly,
        # but from the bounds at x=11:
        # For a fixed c, b can vary to satisfy bounds at x=11
        # For simplicity, choose b at midpoint
        b = ( (high_val - a*121 - c) + (low_val - a*121 - c) ) / 2

        # Evaluate P(16)
        P16 = a*256 + 16*b + c
        print(P16)
        answers.append(P16)
```
This code generates candidate quadratic polynomials within the bounds, evaluates \( P(16) \), and streams the answers immediately to assist in conjecturing the true value.
