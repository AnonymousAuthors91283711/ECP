This problem involves iterating a function that sums the cubes of the digits of a number. The key is to explore the sequence starting from 2005, applying `digitCubesSum` repeatedly. Since the theorem equates the iterated sequence to an unknown answer, we'll compute the sequence step-by-step, observing the pattern and convergence.

Approach:
- Compute sequence terms starting from 2005, applying `digitCubesSum`.
- Since the sequence likely reduces rapidly in magnitude, generate terms until convergence or repetition.
- Print each intermediate term immediately for insight.
- No hardcoding the answer; just perform the enumeration.

```python
def digit_cubes_sum(n):
    # Sum of cubes of digits of n
    return sum(int(d)**3 for d in str(n))

def sequence_term(n, k):
    # Apply digit_cubes_sum k times to n
    for _ in range(k):
        n = digit_cubes_sum(n)
    return n

# Starting number
start = 2005
k = 2005
current = start

print(f"Initial number: {start}")
# Compute the sequence iteratively, printing each term
for i in range(1, 15):  # Limit iterations to observe pattern
    current = digit_cubes_sum(current)
    print(f"Term {i}: {current}")
    if current == 1 or current == 0:
        break

# Since the sequence reduces quickly, the answer is likely the last term
# observed before reaching a fixed point or cycle.
```
