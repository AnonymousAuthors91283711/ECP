This problem involves enumerating pairs (a, b) where a and b are integers between 1 and 9, inclusive, and counting how many satisfy the inequality \(b > a^2 - b\). 

We are asked to compute the ratio of such pairs to the total pairs. Since the range is small (1 to 9), we can brute-force all pairs, check the condition, and compute the ratio directly. We won't hardcode the answer; instead, we compute and output the resulting fraction.

Here's the approach:
- Generate all pairs (a, b) with a, b in 1..9
- Filter pairs where b > a^2 - b
- Count the filtered pairs and total pairs
- Compute and print the ratio as an exact fraction

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Define the range of values for a and b
values = range(1, 10)

# Generate all pairs
pairs = [(a, b) for a in values for b in values]

# Filter pairs satisfying the condition b > a^2 - b
filtered_pairs = [pair for pair in pairs if pair[1] > pair[0]**2 - pair[1]]

# Count total pairs and filtered pairs
total_pairs = len(pairs)
valid_pairs = len(filtered_pairs)

# Compute the ratio as an exact fraction
ratio = Fraction(valid_pairs, total_pairs)

# Output the ratio as a decimal and as a fraction
print(ratio)
```
