This appears to be a formal statement from Lean's Mathlib, involving a noncomputable function `omnimath4407_answer` and a theorem with conditions on it. Because it uses `sorry` placeholders and involves advanced real analysis and noncomputability, I will interpret this as a hypothetical mathematical problem, possibly related to how the function behaves with respect to parameters and indices.

The core positional points seem to involve:

- The function `omnimath4407_answer a n : ℝ → ℕ → ℝ` perhaps encoding some sequence-dependent real values.
- The theorem's parts indicate:
  - The existence of a uniform bound `C` on the absolute value of `omnimath4407_answer a n`.
  - A separation condition involving all pairs `(i, j)`, with `i ≠ j`, and their images under the function, scaled by `(i - j)^a`.

Because the code and theorem are abstract, I will create a Python script that:

- Suggests possible behaviors of `omnimath4407_answer` for specific small values of `a` and `n`.
- Checks if the absolute values are bounded for some `C`.
- Tests the separation condition for small `i,j`.

Assuming the function may behave similarly to sequences with controlled growth (like bounded oscillation) or polynomial growth, not explicitly known, I will generate sample sequences to illustrate potential answers.
