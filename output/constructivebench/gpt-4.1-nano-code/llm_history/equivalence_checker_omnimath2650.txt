Ground Truth Answer: 1
Proposed Answer: 0
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves summing terms of the form 2^(k*(k+1)/2) modulo 7 from k=0 to 2010.

2. The key observation is that 2^n mod 7 cycles every 3 exponents because of Euler's theorem (since φ(7)=6, but 2^3 ≡ 1 mod 7).

3. The exponent k*(k+1)/2 is the k-th triangular number. We need to examine its behavior mod 3 since 2^3 ≡ 1 mod 7.

4. Looking at triangular numbers mod 3:
   - k ≡ 0 mod 3: T(k) ≡ 0 mod 3
   - k ≡ 1 mod 3: T(k) ≡ 1 mod 3
   - k ≡ 2 mod 3: T(k) ≡ 0 mod 3

5. Therefore:
   - When k ≡ 0 or 2 mod 3, 2^T(k) ≡ 1 mod 7
   - When k ≡ 1 mod 3, 2^T(k) ≡ 2 mod 7

6. In the range 0-2010, there are exactly 670 complete cycles of 3 numbers, plus 1 extra number (2010). Each cycle contributes 2*1 + 1*2 = 4 mod 7. The extra term (k=2010) contributes 1 mod 7.

7. Total sum mod 7 = (670*4 + 1) mod 7 = (2681) mod 7 = 1 mod 7.

The ground truth answer is 1, while the proposed answer is 0. They are not equivalent.
