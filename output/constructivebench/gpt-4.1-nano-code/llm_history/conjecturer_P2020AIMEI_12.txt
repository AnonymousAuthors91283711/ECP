The key is the divisibility condition involving \(149^k - 2^k\). For the divisibility to hold, \(k\) must be a multiple of the least common multiple of the exponents related to the prime factors, considering their orders. Since 3, 5, and 7 are involved with exponents 3, 5, and 7, respectively, and recognizing the pattern, the minimal such \(k\) signifying the intersection point is their least common multiple, which is \(105\).

Thus, the minimal \(k\) satisfying the condition is \(\mathrm{lcm}(3,5,7) = 105\).

Number of divisors of 105: \( (1+1)*(1+1)*(1+1) = 8 \).

Hence, the answer is 8.

<<<8>>>
