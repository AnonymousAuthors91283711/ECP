abbrev omnimath3688_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath3688 (n : ℕ) :
  0 < n ∧ n < 1000 ∧ (List.sum (digits 10 n))^3 = n^2 ↔ n ∈ omnimath3688_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 1
27. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The pattern suggests n is a single digit where n^3 = n, thus n^3 = n implies n = 0 or 1, but n > 0, so n = 1. For larger digits, digit sum cube equals n squared only at n=1. The set consists solely of 1.
