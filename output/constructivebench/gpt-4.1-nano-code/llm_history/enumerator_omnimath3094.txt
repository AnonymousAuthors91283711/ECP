[write_program]
This problem involves solving the linear equation \( 3x + 4 = x + 2 \). To assist with conjecturing, we can write a Python program that enumerates values of \( x \) (likely in a small range) to find solutions both exactly (rational or integer if possible) and approximately (floating point). 

Since the problem asks for stream outputs and indicates that the true answer should not be hardcoded or guessed, our code will systematically check candidate values around the plausible solution. The primary solution to the equation is \( x = -1/2 \).

We will:
1. Print candidate values near the expected solution.
2. Check their exact and approximate equality.
3. Stream solutions as soon as they match the equation well.

Here's the code:

```python
# The equation is 3x + 4 = x + 2
# Algebraically, x = (2 - 4) / (3 - 1) = -2/2 = -1
# But we'll enumerate values around that to verify solutions and assist in conjecture.

import itertools

def close_enough(a, b, tol=1e-8):
    return abs(a - b) < tol

# Enumerate rationals with numerator and denominator small integers
max_den = 10
for denom in range(1, max_den + 1):
    for num in range(-max_den*2, max_den*2 + 1):
        x = num / denom
        lhs = 3 * x + 4
        rhs = x + 2
        if close_enough(lhs, rhs):
            print(f"Candidate x = {x} (exact: {num}/{denom}): {lhs} = {rhs}")
            if lhs == rhs:
                print(f"Exact solution found: x = {x}")
```
