theorem omnimath1175 : 
  Fintype.card { fs : Fin 2010 → (Fin 2 → Fin 2) // 
    ∃ c : Fin 2, ∀ x : Fin 2, (List.ofFn fs).foldr (· ∘ ·) id x = c } = omnimath1175_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 1. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The problem models functions from Fin 2010 to functions from Fin 2 to Fin 2, with a particular fold property linked to a constant c ∈ Fin 2. The key insight suggests that each such function is determined solely by the output of the composition of fold operations, which collapses to either a constant function or variants thereof, resulting in 2 possible behaviors. Since the total count is the number of such functions, the answer is 2.
