Based on the problem statement, the goal is to find all real values of x satisfying the given conditions:
- 5x + 9 > 0 and 5x + 9 ≠ 1
- x + 3 > 0 and x + 3 ≠ 1
- x^2 + 6x + 9 > 0
- 5x^2 + 24x + 27 > 0
- log base (5x + 9) of (x^2 + 6x + 9) plus log base (x + 3) of (5x^2 + 24x + 27) equals 4.

The key observations:
- x^2 + 6x + 9 = (x + 3)^2 > 0 for all x except x = -3, where it equals 0, but the strict inequality suggests we're excluding x = -3.
- The bases and arguments of logs impose domain constraints: bases > 0, bases ≠ 1, and arguments > 0.
- Logarithm base constraints:
  - 5x+9 > 0 → x > -9/5
  - 5x+9 ≠ 1 → x ≠ (1 - 9)/5 = -8/5
  - x+3 > 0 → x > -3
  - x+3 ≠ 1 → x ≠ -2
  - 5x^2 + 24x + 27 > 0 → Since 5x^2 + 24x + 27 factors as (5x + 3)(x + 9), this is positive outside roots at x = -3/5 and x = -9 (both at x > -3/5, x ≠ -3/5).
- The arguments in the logs:
  - x^2 + 6x + 9 = (x + 3)^2 > 0 for all x ≠ -3
  - 5x^2 + 24x + 27 > 0 (see above)
- The base of the first log is 5x+9, which must be > 0 and ≠ 1.
- The base of the second log is x+3, which must be > 0 and ≠ 1.

Because the bases are positive and not 1, we can consider the logarithm functions:
log_(5x+9)((x + 3)^2) + log_(x+3)(5x^2 + 24x + 27) = 4.

We can try small sample ranges for x:
- x > -3 for base positivity.
- Exclude x = -2 (second base).

Let's evaluate candidate points to find solutions numerically, focusing on the domain constraints and the sum of logs.

Below code enumerates potential solutions over a small range, checking the equality condition approximately.

```python
# Enumerate x in small steps over a range of interest, respecting constraints
import math

def check(x):
    # Domain constraints
    if not (x > -3):  # x+3 > 0
        return False
    if x == -2:  # x+3 ≠ 1
        return False
    if (5 * x + 9) <= 0:  # base bases > 0
        return False
    if (5 * x + 9) == 1:  # base bases ≠ 1
        return False
    # Arguments for logs
    arg1 = (x + 3) ** 2
    arg2 = 5 * x ** 2 + 24 * x + 27
    if arg2 <= 0:
        return False
    # Logarithms calculations
    base1 = 5 * x + 9
    base2 = x + 3

    # Compute logs in base e, using change of base
    try:
        val = math.log(arg1, base1) + math.log(arg2, base2)
        # Check if approximately equal to 4
        return abs(val - 4) < 1e-4
    except (ValueError, ZeroDivisionError):
        return False

# Search over x in [ -3.9, 10 ] with step 0.01
for x in [x / 100 for x in range(-390, 1001)]:
    if check(x):
        print(f"x ≈ {x}")
```
