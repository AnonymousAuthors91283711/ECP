Let's analyze the problem: 

The theorem states that \((\sqrt{100} + \sqrt{9}) \times (\sqrt{100} - \sqrt{9})\) equals some answer we want to determine. This expression is a difference of squares: \((a+b)(a-b)=a^2 - b^2\).

Thus, the answer simplifies to:
\[
( \sqrt{100} )^2 - ( \sqrt{9} )^2 = 100 - 9 = 91
\]

Since we need to enumerate possible answers, we can simulate this calculation for different values of radicals close to the given ones, but to keep the code simple and aligned with the task, we focus on directly generating this and similar expressions.

Below is a Python program that computes this specific expression, illustrating the enumeration process for this kind of problem. We will print the candidates (here just the exact value and a close approximation for illustration), and then finalize the answer.

```python
# Enumeration to find the exact value of the given expression
def enumerate_answers():
    candidates = []

    # Exact calculation based on algebraic simplification
    sqrt_100 = 100 ** 0.5
    sqrt_9 = 9 ** 0.5

    # Expression: (sqrt(100) + sqrt(9)) * (sqrt(100) - sqrt(9))
    exact_value = (sqrt_100 + sqrt_9) * (sqrt_100 - sqrt_9)
    print(f"Exact value (calculator): {exact_value}")

    # Since algebraically this simplifies to 100 - 9 = 91,
    # we include the exact integer for reference
    candidates.append((exact_value, "approximate float"))
    candidates.append((100 - 9, "algebraic simplification"))

    # Print all candidates
    for val, description in candidates:
        print(f"{description}: {val}")

    # Return the most precise answer (here, 91)
    return 91

# Run the enumeration
answer = enumerate_answers()
print(f"Answer: {answer}")
```
