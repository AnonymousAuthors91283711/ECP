abbrev omnimath2675_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2675 (x : ℝ) : x + sqrt 81 = 25 ↔ x = omnimath2675_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: x = 15.9, x + sqrt(81) = 24.9
x = 16.0, x + sqrt(81) = 25.0
Solution found: x = 16.0
x = 16.1, x + sqrt(81) = 25.1
x = 16.5, x + sqrt(81) = 25.5
x = 15.5, x + sqrt(81) = 24.5. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<16.0>>>
