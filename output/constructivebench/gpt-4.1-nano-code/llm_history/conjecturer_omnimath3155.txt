Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
Given the recurrence resembles quadratic sequences tied to binomial coefficients, the solutions correspond to n ≥ 0. In particular, the sequence pattern suggests the set of natural numbers starting from 0 to infinity.  
Final answer: <<<Set.range (fun n => n)>>>
