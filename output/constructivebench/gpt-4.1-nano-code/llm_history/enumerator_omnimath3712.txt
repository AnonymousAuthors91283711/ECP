The problem appears to involve a functional equation relating gcd and lcm of a function `f : ℕ → ℕ`. The given property is:

∀ m n, gcd(f m, n) + lcm(m, f n) = gcd(m, f n) + lcm(f m, n)

We are to find all functions `f` satisfying this condition, possibly by enumerating candidate functions to conjecture the true solution.

Since the problem involves natural numbers and gcd/lcm, a natural approach is to test simple functions like constant functions, identity, or linear functions, by systematically checking small values.

Below is a Python program that:
- Defines candidate functions within small ranges (like constant, identity, or linear functions)
- Checks the given property for small m, n (e.g., from 1 to 5)
- Prints potential functions that satisfy the property at all tested points, streaming solutions
- Avoids hardcoding the exact solution; aims to help in conjecturing

The code prioritizes exactness: only functions that satisfy the property for all small tested pairs are printed.

```python
from math import gcd
import itertools

# Small candidate functions
def constant_func(c):
    return lambda x: c

def identity(x):
    return x

def linear_func(a, b):
    return lambda x: a*x + b

# Test a function over small m, n range
def test_func(f, max_val=5):
    for m in range(1, max_val+1):
        for n in range(1, max_val+1):
            lhs = gcd(f(m), n) + (m * f(n)) // gcd(m, f(n)) if gcd(m, f(n)) > 0 else 0
            rhs = gcd(m, f(n)) + (f(m) * n) // gcd(f(m), n) if gcd(f(m), n) > 0 else 0
            if lhs != rhs:
                return False
    return True

solutions = []

# Check constant functions c=0..3
for c in range(4):
    f = constant_func(c)
    if test_func(f):
        print(f"Constant function c={c} is a solution.")
        solutions.append(f)

# Check identity
if test_func(identity):
    print("Identity function is a solution.")
    solutions.append(identity)

# Check some linear functions
for a in range(1,3):
    for b in range(0,3):
        f = linear_func(a, b)
        if test_func(f):
            print(f"Linear function a={a}, b={b} is a solution.")
            solutions.append(f)
```
