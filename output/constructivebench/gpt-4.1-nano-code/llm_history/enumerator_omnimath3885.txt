The problem involves characterizing functions \(f : ℤ \to ℤ\) satisfying a functional equation involving iterates of \(f\): 

\[ f^{a^2 + b^2}(a + b) = a f a + b f b \]

for all integers \(a, b\). To analyze solutions, we consider the possible types of \(f\) and their iterates. Since iterates are involved, a key idea is to test simple functions like constant functions and the identity, as well as linear functions, to find those satisfying the relation for small integer parameters.

Given the complexity of the problem at the high school level, the most straightforward approach is to try constant functions and the identity function at small integers \(a, b\), and then extend the enumeration.

I will choose small values for \(a, b\) within a range (say \(-2\) to \(2\)) and check the functional equation for candidate functions \(f\).

The code will generate functions that are either constant functions or linear functions with small coefficients, check the relation for the given small parameters, and print functions that satisfy the relation at least on those samples, to help conjecture the set of all solutions.

```python
# Enumerate simple candidate functions f: Z -> Z, including constant and linear functions
# Check the functional equation for small samples of (a, b) in [-2, 2]
# Print functions satisfying the samples, to assist in conjecturing solutions

    return lambda x: c

candidates = []

# Constant functions with c in [-2, 2]
for c in range(-2, 3):
    candidates.append(('const', c, f_const(c)))

# Linear functions with small m in [-1, 1] and c in [-2, 2]
for m in range(-1, 2):
    for c in range(-2, 3):
