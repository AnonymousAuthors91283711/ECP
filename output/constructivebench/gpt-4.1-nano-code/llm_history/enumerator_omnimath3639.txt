This problem asks us to find the least natural number \( n \) such that for every \( k \) in the range 0 to 72, the expression \(\frac{k+19}{n+k+21}\) is irreducible. The key is to analyze the irreducibility condition: \(\gcd(k+19, n+k+21) = 1\) for all \(k\).

Our approach:
- Fix small values of \( n \) starting from 1 upwards.
- For each \( n \), check all \( k \in \{0,1,\dots,72\} \) if \(\gcd(k+19, n+k+21)=1\).
- When the first \( n \) satisfies this, output \( n \).

This systematically searches for the minimal \( n \), printing candidates immediately when verified.

```python
import math

# Search for the minimal n starting from 1
n = 1
max_k = 72

while True:
    # Check if for all k in range 0..72, gcd(k+19, n+k+21)==1
    all_coprime = True
    for k in range(max_k + 1):
        numerator = k + 19
        denominator = n + k + 21
        if math.gcd(numerator, denominator) != 1:
            all_coprime = False
            break
    if all_coprime:
        print(n)
        break
    n += 1
```
