The problem defines a set of real triplets (x, y, z) satisfying inequalities and equations, and asks to find the minimal value of |x - y| + |y - z|. Since the constraints specify an ordered triple x ≤ y ≤ z with bounds and quadratic relations, it suggests exploring the solutions explicitly and computing the sum of absolute differences.

A practical approach is:
- Enumerate candidate solutions for x, y, z within the specified bounds and equations.
- For each, compute the sum |x - y| + |y - z|.
- Track the minimal value.

Given the quadratic relations y² + 2 = z² and x ≤ y ≤ z, one can solve for y and z explicitly: z = ±√(y² + 2), but since z ≥ y ≥ x, we focus on the positive root.

Similarly, x is constrained to 0 ≤ x ≤ y, with y ≥ x.

Sample small values for y within [0, 2], because y² + 2 ≤ z² and z ≥ y.

Here's an efficient enumeration that considers suitable values of y, computes corresponding z, and then tries small x in [0, y].

```python
import math

# Initialize minimal difference to a large number
min_diff = float('inf')

# Store candidate for the minimal difference
best_solution = None

# Sample y values from 0 to 2 in steps
for y_int in range(0, 21):  # y from 0 to 20
    y = y_int * 0.1
    z_squared = y ** 2 + 2
    if z_squared < 0:
        continue
    z = math.sqrt(z_squared)
    # Since z ≥ y, consider only the positive root
    # For each y, try x from 0 to y
    for x_int in range(0, int(y*10)+1):
        x = x_int * 0.1
        # Compute sum of absolute differences
        diff = abs(x - y) + abs(y - z)
        print(f"x={x:.2f}, y={y:.2f}, z={z:.2f}, sum={diff:.4f}")
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            best_solution = (x, y, z)

# Output the minimal value found
print(f"Minimum sum of differences: {min_diff:.4f}")
print(f"Corresponding solution: x={best_solution[0]:.2f}, y={best_solution[1]:.2f}, z={best_solution[2]:.2f}")
```
