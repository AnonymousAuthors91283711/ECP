This problem involves exploring all integer solutions to the equation p = x² + 3 y² for a given p, which is a form of representing integers by a quadratic form. To assist in conjecturing, I will enumerate small values of p and find all integer solutions (x, y) with small bounds. I'll then record whether p can be expressed this way, prioritizing exact solutions, and explicitly check small p values up to a threshold.

```python
# Enumerate values p = x^2 + 3 * y^2 for small integers x, y
# and check whether p can be represented in this form.

max_abs = 20  # upper bound for x and y to keep enumeration efficient
results = []

for p in range(1, 100):  # check p from 1 to 99
    found = False
    solutions = []
    for x in range(-max_abs, max_abs + 1):
        for y in range(-max_abs, max_abs + 1):
            if x*x + 3*y*y == p:
                solutions.append((x, y))
                if not found:
                    print(f"p={p} can be represented as x^2 + 3*y^2 with solutions: {solutions}")
                    found = True
    if not solutions:
        print(f"p={p} cannot be represented as x^2 + 3*y^2 within bounds.")
```
