The problem defines a set of real numbers \( x \) satisfying the equation \(\lfloor x/3 \rfloor + \lceil 3x \rceil = \sqrt{11} \, x \) and asks for the greatest such \( x \). To explore potential solutions, I will discretize the problem by testing \( x \) over a range of small values, focusing on candidate points where the floor or ceiling functions change—i.e., at multiples of 3 for \( x/3 \) and at points where \( 3x \) crosses integer boundaries. I will evaluate these candidate points to find the maximum \( x \) satisfying the condition.

```python
import math

# Define the range of x to test based on typical bounds where solutions might appear.
# Since the equation involves square roots, solutions are likely bounded; choose, e.g., x in [0, 10].
candidate_xs = []

# Generate candidate points around key boundaries: multiples of 1/3 and where 3x is integer
for i in range(0, 31):  # x from 0 to 10 with step 1/3
    candidate_xs.append(i / 3)

# Remove duplicates and sort
candidate_xs = sorted(set(candidate_xs))

max_x = None

for x in candidate_xs:
    floor_term = math.floor(x / 3)
    ceil_term = math.ceil(3 * x)
    lhs = floor_term + ceil_term
    rhs = math.sqrt(11) * x
    # Check for equality within floating error
    if abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-7:
        print(f"Solution candidate x = {x}, floor/ceil sum = {lhs}, RHS = {rhs}")
        if (max_x is None) or (x > max_x):
            max_x = x

if max_x is not None:
    print(f"The greatest solution x ≈ {max_x}")
else:
    print("No solutions found in the sampled range.")
```
