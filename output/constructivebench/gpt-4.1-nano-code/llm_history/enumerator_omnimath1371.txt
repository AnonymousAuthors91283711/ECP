The goal is to find all real numbers \( x \) such that there exists a sequence \( a' : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R} \) satisfying the recurrence \( a'(n+2) = 6a'(n) - a'(n+1) \), with initial condition \( a'(0)=1 \), positivity \( a'(n)>0 \), and \( a'(2007)=x \). The problem is to enumerate possible values of \( a'(2007) \) by exploring initial parameters, especially considering that the sequence is determined by the recurrence and initial values.

Since the recurrence involves only initial conditions \( a'(0) = 1 \) and some \( a'(1) > 0 \), and the relation is linear, we can parametrize by \( a'(1) = c > 0 \), compute sequence terms, and find the possible \( a'(2007) \). We will scan over sample \( c \) in a small positive range, compute the sequence up to 2007, and record those \( x \) for which all terms up to 2007 remain positive.

Efficiently, since the recurrence is linear, the sequence can be explicitly computed with initial conditions \( (1, c) \). We will generate a list for \( c \in \{0.1, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2\} \). For each, compute \( a'(n) \) iteratively, check positivity, and record \( a'(2007) \).

```python
# Enumerate possible sequence values for different initial conditions
# Initial value a'(0) = 1 fixed, vary c = a'(1) in a small set
initial_c_values = [0.1, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2]

# Since the recurrence is linear, we can directly compute the sequence
def compute_sequence(c, n_terms=2008):
    a0 = 1
    a1 = c
    seq = [a0, a1]
    for _ in range(2, n_terms):
        a_next = 6 * seq[-2] - seq[-1]
        # Check positivity
        if a_next <= 0:
            return None  # Sequence invalid due to non-positivity
        seq.append(a_next)
    return seq

for c in initial_c_values:
    seq = compute_sequence(c)
    if seq:
        x = seq[-1]
        print(f"c={c}, a'(2007) â‰ˆ {x}")
```
