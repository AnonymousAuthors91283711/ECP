theorem omnimath3108 :
  let a := (-5 : ℝ);
  let b := 6;
  dist a b = omnimath3108_answer :=
sorry
. Enumerated answers: Exact distance: 11
Approximate distance with delta 0: 11
Approximate distance with delta 0.1: 10.9
Approximate distance with delta -0.1: 11.1
dist -5 6 = 11. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Based on the enumerated answers, the exact distance is 11. Since the distance between a = -5 and b = 6 is |a - b| = | -5 - 6 | = 11, the closed-form expression is simply the absolute value of their difference.

<<<abs (a - b)>>>

dist -5 6 = 11. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The error arises because within the definition of 'omnimath3108_answer,' the variables 'a' and 'b' are not in scope; they are locally defined inside the theorem but not accessible at that point. To fix this, we should define 'omnimath3108_answer' as a function of 'a' and 'b,' or more simply, directly substitute the known 'a = -5' and 'b = 6' into the absolute difference 'abs (a - b).'

Given the current context, a cleaner approach is to define 'omnimath3108_answer' as a constant reflecting the actual distance between -5 and 6, which is 11, directly as a real number, since that matches the enumerated answer.

Thus, the correct fixed answer is:

<<<11>>>

This value matches the exact distance and the enumeration provided, and it does not rely on undefined variables or scope issues.

Explanation: Since 'a' and 'b' are given as specific constants within the theorem, and their distance is fixed, defining 'omnimath3108_answer' simply as 11 aligns with the exact distance (| -5 - 6 | = 11) and resolves scope errors.
