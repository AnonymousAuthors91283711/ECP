The problem appears to involve properties of a family of sequences, interpolation between intervals, and bounds related to the supremum of a set defined via inequalities. Since the actual proof and reasoning are complex and involve real analysis and set theory, we focus on generating candidate values that satisfy the constraints for the set of \(d\).

We want to find the least upper bound (supremum) over all \(d > 0\) satisfying certain interval, injectivity, and difference conditions. To assist conjecture, we can:
- Sample small \(d\) values and check whether they satisfy the conditions.
- Incrementally test larger \(d\) values to find where the conditions break or hold.
- For simplicity, assume small sequences (like \(n\) up to 3) to keep computation manageable.
- Use monotonicity insights: as \(d\) increases, constraints may become harder or easier to satisfy.

Below is a Python script that:
- Fixes small \(n\) (say \(n \leq 3\))
- Attempts to find \(d\) values up to a threshold (say 5)
- Checks the key properties with sequences \(a(n)\) within the interval \([0, d]\)
- Prints all \(d\) candidates where the conditions are approximately satisfied, helping us infer the true supremum.

```python
# Enumerate candidate d values to identify the supremum for the set
# We assume small sequences and small d increments for efficiency and clarity
import math

max_d = 5  # upper bound for search
step = 0.1  # increment step

def check_conditions(d):
    n_max = 3  # small sequence length
    # Generate possible sequences a: for simplicity, choose evenly spaced points
    # within [0, d] that are strictly increasing to satisfy injectivity
    for a_vals in [
        [0] + [i * d / n_max for i in range(1, n_max)] + [d]
    ]:
        # Check injectivity
        if len(set(a_vals)) != len(a_vals):
            continue
        # Verify for all n: the interval properties
        valid = True
        for n in range(1, n_max + 1):
            # For each x in [0, d], check existence of i
            # For simplicity, test sample points: start, middle, end
            tests = [0, d/2, d]
            for x in tests:
                # Check if x lies in any interval
                in_interval = False
                for i in range(n + 1):
                    low = 0 if i == 0 else a_vals[i - 1]
                    high = d if i == n else a_vals[i]
                    if low <= x <= high:
                        in_interval = True
                        break
                if not in_interval:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if not valid:
                break
        # Check difference conditions
        for n in range(1, n_max + 1):
            for i in range(n + 1):
                high = d if i == n else a_vals[i]
                low = 0 if i == 0 else a_vals[i - 1]
                diff = high - low
                if diff > 1 / n:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if not valid:
                break
        if valid:
            return True
    return False

# Main enumeration
for d in [i * step for i in range(1, int(max_d / step) + 1)]:
    if check_conditions(d):
        print(f'Candidate upper bound d: {d}')
