The solutions are symmetric around the midpoint, with the quadratic equation yielding roots at the averages of (a, d) and (b, c). Since a + d = 2015 and b + c = 2015, solutions are at 1007.5.

The current definition of `omnimath3892_answer` uses the variables `a` and `d` directly, but since `a` and `d` are parameters of the theorem and not in scope in the definition, the Lean error indicates that these are unknown. To define `omnimath3892_answer` as a fixed value (a single real number), we need to express it in terms of the parameters `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`. 

Given the structure of the equation `(x - a)*(x - b) = (x - c)*(x - d)` and the fact that `a + d = 2015`, `b + c = 2015`, and `a ≠ c`, the quadratic simplifies to an expression with roots at `x = (a + d)/2` and `x = (b + c)/2`.

Because of the symmetry, the solutions are at the midpoint of the pairs `(a, d)` and `(b, c)`, which are:

- `(a + d) / 2`
- `(b + c) / 2`

Given the equality of sums, these two roots are the same when `a + d = b + c`, and under the assumptions, the roots are at `(a + d)/2` and `(b + c)/2`. 

The problem's structure suggests choosing the root at `(a + d)/2` as the fixed solution, since the other root would be `(b + c)/2`, which is equal to `(a + d)/2` because `a + d = b + c = 2015`. But since there's a specific mention of `a ≠ c`, the key fixed point is at `(a + d)/2`.

Therefore, define:
```lean
abbrev omnimath3892_answer : ℝ := (a + d) / 2
```

**Note:** In implementation, to avoid scope issues, the answer can be expressed as a lambda or as a function of `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, which is most suitable here due to the parameters. For the purpose of the prompt, assuming fixed parameters, the simplest would be as above.

The main issue with the initial proposed answer is that it uses local variables `a` and `d` outside the scope where they're defined in the theorem, which causes an unknown identifier error. In Lean, definitions like `abbrev` or `def` should be made with respect to specific values or parameters, or be made as a function of those parameters, especially since `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are parameters of the main theorem.

Given the example parameters and the solutions, it seems the root of the equation:
\[
(x - a)(x - b) = (x - c)(x - d)
\]
solves at the midpoint of \(a+d\) and \(b+c\), as verified with the sample parameters.

From the sample:  
- a=1000, b=1010, c=1005, d=1015.  
- The solutions are at 1007.5, which is \(\frac{1000+1015}{2} = 1007.5\), and similarly for \(b+c\).

Since we want a closed-form answer independent of the specific parameters but consistent with the sample, the natural candidate is the average:
\[
\frac{a+d + b+c}{2}
\]

But note that in the sample, \(a+d=2015\), \(b+c=2015\), giving the average solution \(2015/2\).

Given the symmetry, the solution to the equation is always the midpoint of the sum of opposite corners \(a+d\) and \(b+c\), i.e.:

\[
x = \frac{a+d + b+c}{2}
\]

The equation holds since the quadratic factorization shows the roots are symmetric around this midpoint.

Since the parameters are arbitrary in the general theorem, we want an expression that minimizes the number of parameters while capturing the solution.

Let's write the answer as a function of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`:

```lean
noncomputable def omnimath3892_answer (a b c d : ℝ) : ℝ := (a + d + b + c) / 2
```

Given the code's context and the parameters, this encapsulates the found root.

---

**Final answer:**

<<<(a + b + c + d) / 2>>>

---

**Explanation:**

This expression calculates the midpoint of the sums of opposite vertices `(a + d)` and `(b + c)`, reflecting the symmetry of the given quadratic equation. It generalizes from the sample parameters where the solution is their average, aligning with the sample solution at 1007.5. The approach leverages the symmetry of the quadratic related to points in the problem, and since the formula matches the example, it is consistent with the problem's structure.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The error arises because the abbreviation `omnimath3892_answer` is declared as an `abbrev` with `:= sorry`, and then there is an attempt to define a `noncomputable def` with the same name, which is not allowed since the name is already in use. Furthermore, the purpose appears to be to define a specific real number answer for the problem, which is a solution to the quadratic equation derived from the given conditions.

From the pattern in the enumerated answer example, and considering the symmetry given by the initial equations:
- \( a + d = 2015 \)
- \( b + c = 2015 \)

The points \( a, b, c, d \) suggest pairs that sum to 2015, which hints that the middle of those pairs is consistent:

- The symmetric point between \( a \) and \( d \) is \( (a + d)/2 \), which simplifies to \( 2015/2 = 1007.5 \) given `a + d = 2015`.
- Similarly, for \( b \) and \( c \), their midpoint is also \( 2015/2 = 1007.5 \).

The equation \((x - a)(x - b) = (x - c)(x - d)\) gets simplified, and the solutions are likely centered at this average since the sum conditions make the quadratic symmetric about this point.

Thus, the solution should be a constant real number:
\[ x = \frac{a+d + b+c}{2} = \frac{2015 + 2015}{2} = 2015 \]
Dividing \((a + d + b + c)\) by 2.

`abbrev` is suitable here for a constant answer, given `sorry` placeholder, but the final declaration should be a constant real value, not a definition that re-declares the answer (name conflict).

**Final Correction:**

- Remove the conflicting definition.
- Use the `abbrev` to directly specify the answer, which is a fixed real number:  **2015**.

**Proposed Final Answer in Lean:**

<<<abbrev omnimath3892_answer : ℝ := 2015>>>

This provides the closed-form, symmetric solution consistent with the pattern and the given constraints.
