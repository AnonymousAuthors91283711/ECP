This appears to be a mathematical problem involving equations of the form \(2^a + p^b = n^{p-1}\), where \(p\) is prime, and you want to find or conjecture solutions that satisfy this equation.

Since the problem asks to explore possible solutions without hardcoding the answer, I will:
- Pick small primes for \(p\),
- Enumerate small values for \(a\), \(b\), and \(n\),
- Check if \(2^a + p^b = n^{p-1}\),
- Print solutions immediately upon discovery.

Given the exponential nature, I'll limit exponents to small ranges for efficiency and feasibility.

Here's the Python code implementing this:

```python
# Enumerate small primes for p
def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

primes = [p for p in range(2, 20) if is_prime(p)]  # small primes up to 19

# Search parameters
max_a = 20
max_b = 20
max_n = 20

# Collect and print solutions
for p in primes:
    for a in range(1, max_a + 1):
        for b in range(1, max_b + 1):
            val = 2**a + p**b
            # Check if val is a perfect power n^(p-1)
            exponent = p - 1
            # To avoid floating point inaccuracies, test integers
            for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
                power = n ** exponent
                if power == val:
                    print(f"Solution found: p={p}, a={a}, b={b}, n={n}")
```
