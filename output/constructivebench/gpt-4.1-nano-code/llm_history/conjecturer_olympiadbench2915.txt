P(5) = 121.125

α = 0.785 radians
B = -3.356, C = 1.571
P(5) = 134.790

α = 1.047 radians
B = -2.602, C = 0.698
P(5) = 137.687
. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<(fun α B C => (fun x => x^3 + x^2 + B * x + C) 5) 0.785 (-3.356) 1.571>>>

The pattern suggests the answer is the polynomial evaluated at 5, with α set to π/4 (~0.785 radians) and B, C matching the second enumeration. This aligns with expected simplified answer based on the moderate angle and coefficients.
