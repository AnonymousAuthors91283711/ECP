Based on the enumerated solutions, the pattern suggests that for each a in [1, 2], the quadratic has exactly one solution satisfying the inequality, specifically at x = -a. When a = 1 or 2, the single solution is x = -a. So the set should be all real a between 1 and 2 inclusive, where the solution x = -a makes the inequality hold uniquely. Thus, the set is precisely [1, 2], inclusive.

The current proposed answer, "Set.Icc 1 2", aligns well with the enumerated solutions, which indicate that for both a=1 and a=2, the inequality has exactly one solution at x = -a. The pattern suggested by the enumerated solutions indicates the set of such 'a' is the interval [1,2], inclusive. Since the problem asks for a set in ℝ satisfying the uniqueness condition, and considering the solutions for enumerated a, the set should be all real a in the interval [1,2].

Therefore, the corrected final expression in Lean is:

<<<Set.Icc 1 2>>>

This paradigm matches the enumeration and the logical deduction that the set of parameters a for which the quadratic inequality has exactly one solution at x = -a in the specified range is exactly the interval [1, 2], inclusive.
