Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: { n : ℕ | n = 1 ∨ n = 3 }
<<<None>>>
Since the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's intentionally left undefined in Lean), we cannot verify whether the proposed answer {n : ℕ | n = 1 ∨ n = 3} is equivalent to it. The proposed answer suggests that only n=1 and n=3 satisfy the given condition, but without knowing the actual ground truth, we cannot confirm this. Therefore, the answer is None.
