The problem appears to involve exploring the parameter \( m \) and the inequality relating three positive real numbers \( a, b, c \). The theorem presumably aims to identify the greatest \( m \) such that \( P(m) \) holds, which is characterized by an inequality involving sums of cubes and differences.

Given the structure, we want to identify the maximum \( m \) satisfying the inequality for all positive \( a, b, c \). To do this computationally, we can:
- Fix specific triplets \( (a, b, c) \), especially symmetric or extremal cases.
- For each case, find the maximal \( m \) satisfying the inequality.
- Track the minimal such \( m \) over all tested triplets.

Since computing over all triplets is impossible, we'll sample strategic points, especially symmetric cases \( a = b = c \), and cases where two variables match with the third varied.

We will:
- Implement a function to compute the critical \( m \) for a given triple.
- Sample multiple triplets.
- For each, compute the maximum \( m \) allowed.
- Determine the minimal of these maxima, which approximates the greatest \( m \).

Here's a brief implementation to achieve this:

```python
import math

# Define a function to compute the maximal m for fixed a, b, c
def max_m_for_triplet(a, b, c):
    numerator = a**3 + b**3 + c**3
    denominator = 3 * a * b * c
    diff_sum = abs(a - b)**3 + abs(a - c)**3 + abs(b - c)**3
    if diff_sum == 0:
        # For equal a, b, c, the inequality reduces to numerator >= 3 * a^3, which always holds
        return float('inf')
    return numerator / (diff_sum)

# Sample triplets
triplets = [
    (1, 1, 1),
    (1, 2, 3),
    (0.5, 1, 2),
    (1, 10, 100),
    (0.1, 0.1, 0.1),
    (2, 2, 1),
    (1, 0.5, 0.25),
]

# Compute max m for each triplet
max_ms = []
for a, b, c in triplets:
    m = max_m_for_triplet(a, b, c)
    print(f"Triplet (a={a}, b={b}, c={c}) => max m: {m}")
    max_ms.append(m)

# The greatest m satisfying the condition is at most the minimal of these max_m
candidate = min(filter(lambda x: x != float('inf'), max_ms))
print(f"Approximate greatest m across samples: {candidate}")
```

This code samples key triplets and computes the corresponding maximal \( m \). The minimal among these provides a lower bound on the optimal \( m \), helping conjecture the actual supremum.
