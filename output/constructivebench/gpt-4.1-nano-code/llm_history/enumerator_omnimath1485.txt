The problem involves two equations involving real numbers \(x\) and \(y\):

1. \(x - y = 4\)
2. \(x^3 - y^3 = 28\)

We need to find \(x \cdot y\). Let's analyze the equations:

From the first equation:
\[ x = y + 4 \]

Substituting into the second:
\[ (y + 4)^3 - y^3 = 28 \]

Expanding \((y+4)^3\):
\[ y^3 + 3 \cdot y^2 \cdot 4 + 3 \cdot y \cdot 4^2 + 4^3 - y^3 = 28 \]
\[ y^3 + 12 y^2 + 48 y + 64 - y^3 = 28 \]
\[ 12 y^2 + 48 y + 64 = 28 \]

Simplify:
\[ 12 y^2 + 48 y + 36 = 0 \]

Divide through by 12:
\[ y^2 + 4 y + 3 = 0 \]

Solve quadratic:
\[ y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 - 12}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4}}{2} \]
\[ y = \frac{-4 \pm 2}{2} \]

Thus,
- \( y = \frac{-4 + 2}{2} = -1 \)
- \( y = \frac{-4 - 2}{2} = -3 \)

Correspondingly, find \(x\):
- For \( y = -1 \):
  \[ x = y + 4 = 3 \]
- For \( y = -3 \):
  \[ x = -3 + 4 = 1 \]

Compute \(x y\):
- For \((x,y) = (3, -1)\): \(3 \times (-1) = -3\)
- For \((x,y) = (1, -3)\): \(1 \times (-3) = -3\)

Both produce the same product \(-3\).

Here's a Python program that systematically checks the derived candidate solutions, confirming the result:

```python
# Enumerate solutions to verify the product for each candidate pair
solutions = [
    (3, -1),
    (1, -3),
]

for x, y in solutions:
    product = x * y
    print(f"x = {x}, y = {y}, x*y = {product}")
```

This code reflects the algebraic solutions found, confirming the value of \(x y = -3\).
