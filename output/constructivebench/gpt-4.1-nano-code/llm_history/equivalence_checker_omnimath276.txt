Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: ∃ X : Set ℤ, ∀ n : ℤ, (∃ p : ℤ × ℤ, p.1 + 2 * p.2 = n ∧ p.1 ∈ X ∧ p.2 ∈ X) ∧ (∀ p p' : ℤ × ℤ, p.1 + 2 * p.2 = p'.1 + 2 * p'.2 → p = p')
<<<None>>>
Since the ground truth answer is marked as `sorry` (meaning it's intentionally left undefined in the Lean proof assistant), we cannot determine whether the proposed answer is equivalent to it. The proposed answer appears to be a reasonable formalization of the problem's condition, but without knowing the actual ground truth, we cannot make a definitive comparison.
