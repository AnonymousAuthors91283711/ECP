The problem seems to involve a mathematical expression with powers, sums, and inverses, aiming to find the value of `P2015AMCA_1_answer`. The key expression inside the theorem is:

\[ 5 \times \left( (2^0 - 1 + 5^2 - 0)^{-1} \right) \]

Calculating step-by-step:

- \(2^0 = 1\)
- \(5^2 = 25\)
- The sum inside parentheses: \(1 - 1 + 25 - 0 = 25\)
- Its inverse: \(1/25\)
- Multiplying by 5: \(5 \times 1/25 = 5/25 = 1/5\)

Since the expression simplifies to \(1/5\), the answer is rational and exact. We will write a Python program that enumerates rational numbers close to this value for verification, prioritizing exact fractions, and then confirm the conjecture.

```python
# Program to verify the expression and find possible answers
from fractions import Fraction

# Known exact value of the expression:
# 5 * ( (2^0 - 1 + 5^2 - 0)^(-1) )
# Step-by-step calculation for verification
base_sum = (2 ** 0) - 1 + (5 ** 2) - 0
inverse = Fraction(1, base_sum)
answer = 5 * inverse

print(f"Calculated answer: {answer} (which simplifies to 1/5)")
# Enumerate fractions near 1/5 to verify
candidates = []
for numerator in range(0, 1+1):  # only 0 and 1 for small search
    for denominator in range(1, 6):  # check denominators up to 5
        frac = Fraction(numerator, denominator)
        if abs(frac - answer) < Fraction(1, 100):
            print(f"Candidate near answer: {frac}")
            candidates.append(frac)

# As the exact answer is 1/5, no need for approximation beyond this.
# The main answer is 1/5, confirmed by enumeration.
```
