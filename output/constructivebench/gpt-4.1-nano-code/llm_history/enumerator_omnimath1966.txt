The problem appears to be a mathematical theorem involving infinite series and inequalities, with parameters and conditions. Since the actual proof or answer is complex, and given the task to enumerate potential answers, I will focus on the core structure:

- Parameters: a₀, b₀, ra, rb
- Conditions: positivity and |ra|, |rb|<1
- Series sums: geometric series, sum to 1
- Expression involving sums of squares and products
- Goal: find the minimal c satisfying the conditions

Because enumerating all real possibilities isn't feasible directly, I'll choose small sample parameters respecting the constraints and compute the relevant series summations and products. The minimal a₀, b₀ satisfying series sum = 1 are straightforward when ra, rb are fixed, as they relate to the geometric series sum formula.

I'll generate small sample parameters:
- Set ra, rb close to 0, e.g., 0.1
- Calculate a₀, b₀ from sum formula (a₀/(1−ra)=1 ⇒ a₀=1−ra)

Similarly for b₀, and then compute the sums of squares and products.

Here's the code:

```python
# Enumerate small sample parameters respecting constraints
# For geometric sum: a0 / (1 - ra) = 1 => a0 = 1 - ra
# Choose ra, rb near zero for simplicity
samples = []
for ra in [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]:
    for rb in [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]:
        # Compute a0, b0 based on sum equals 1
        a0 = 1 - ra
        b0 = 1 - rb
        # Sum of squares: sum_{i=0}^∞ (a * r^i)^2 = a^2 / (1 - r^2)
        sum_a2 = (a0 ** 2) / (1 - ra ** 2)
        sum_b2 = (b0 ** 2) / (1 - rb ** 2)
        # Sum of products: sum_{i=0}^∞ a * r^i * b * s^i = a * b / (1 - r * s)
        sum_ab = (a0 * b0) / (1 - ra * rb)
        # Compute the product of sums of squares
        product_of_squares = sum_a2 * sum_b2
        # For this sample, compute the combined sum
        combined_sum = sum_ab
        # The candidate c must be less or equal to a0 (for leastness)
        # We look for c ≥ minimal such c, so candidate answer is c = min(a0, sum_ab / (product_of_squares))
        # For simplicity, just output the relevant candidate
        print(f'ra={ra}, rb={rb}')
        print(f'a0={a0:.2f}, b0={b0:.2f}')
        print(f'sum_a2={sum_a2:.2f}, sum_b2={sum_b2:.2f}')
        print(f'sum_ab={sum_ab:.2f}')
        print(f'product_of_squares={product_of_squares:.2f}')
        # Since the least c is bounded by a0, we can check if sum_ab / (product_of_squares) < a0
        candidate_c = sum_ab / product_of_squares if product_of_squares != 0 else None
        if candidate_c is not None:
            answer = max(candidate_c, 0)  # c should be at least 0
            print(f'Possible c (approximate) = {answer:.2f}\n')
```
