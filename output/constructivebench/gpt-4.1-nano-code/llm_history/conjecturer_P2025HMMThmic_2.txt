The property relates functions of polynomials with composition involving cosine; the matching functions suggest polynomials of the form c·cos t + s·sin t or constant polynomials. The set likely contains all polynomials that are affine linear combinations of cosine and sine. 

Thus, the generalized form is P in span of {X, 1}, but since only cosine appears, we focus on polynomials proportional to cos t with constant coefficient.

The property describes a set of polynomials P such that composition with evaluation at P transforms the cosine function into another cosine function evaluated at a different argument. Functionally, this occurs if and only if P is affine linear, i.e., of form a X + b, since composing cosine with such a polynomial can be expressed as a linear combination involving cosine and sine (via multiple angle formulas). The original contradictions in the proposed answer stem from syntax errors and an incorrect set expression.

Thus, the set of such polynomials should be all affine linear polynomials: P in {a * X + b | a, b ∈ ℝ}. These satisfy the property that:

cos(eval t P) = eval (cos t) Q for some Q when P is of that form.

In Lean notation, the answer set corresponds precisely to the set of all linear polynomials:

The error arises because Lean cannot automatically interpret `a * Polynomial.X` as a polynomial in `ℝ[X]` without explicitly providing the coefficient multiplication. The problem is that `Polynomial.X` is a polynomial, and `a` is a real; `a * Polynomial.X` should be interpreted as scalar multiplication of a polynomial. Since Lean's `Polynomial` library supports scalar multiplication, we need to ensure the scalar multiplication is correctly used.

The original expression `a * Polynomial.X + Polynomial.C b` needs to be written explicitly in terms of scalar multiplication that Lean understands, which is `a • Polynomial.X` rather than `a * Polynomial.X`.

Additionally, for the set notation, using `{ P : ℝ[X] | ... }` directly is acceptable, provided scalar multiplication is properly used.

**Proposed fix:**

Change `a * Polynomial.X + Polynomial.C b` to `a • Polynomial.X + Polynomial.C b`.

This ensures the expression is a polynomial in `ℝ[X]`, avoiding the failed attempt at implicit scalar multiplication.

**Final answer:**

<<<{ P : ℝ[X] | ∃ a b : ℝ, P = a • Polynomial.X + Polynomial.C b }>>>

**Explanation:**

Using the notation `a • Polynomial.X` clearly indicates scalar multiplication, which aligns with Lean's `Polynomial` library conventions. Since a polynomial's scalar multiplication is explicitly defined, this prevents the failed synthesis error and makes the set definition formalized correctly in Lean. The set describes all linear polynomials over ℝ with degree at most 1, matching the structure in the enumerated pattern.
