This problem involves finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two large numbers: \(4^8 - 1\) and \(8^{12} - 1\). To assist in conjecturing the answer, we'll explicitly compute these values and find their GCD. Since the problem emphasizes streaming outputs and efficiency, we'll avoid unnecessary computations and directly compute and compare.

Note:
- \(4^8 - 1 = (2^2)^8 - 1 = 2^{16} - 1\),
- \(8^{12} - 1 = (2^3)^{12} - 1 = 2^{36} - 1\).

We will generate these numbers and compute their GCD to find the exact answer.

```python
import math

# Compute 4^8 - 1 = 2^16 - 1
num1 = 2 ** 16 - 1

# Compute 8^12 - 1 = 2^36 - 1
num2 = 2 ** 36 - 1

# Compute GCD of the two numbers
gcd_result = math.gcd(num1, num2)

# Stream answers
print(f"4^8 - 1 = {num1}")
print(f"8^12 - 1 = {num2}")
print(f"GCD = {gcd_result}")
```
