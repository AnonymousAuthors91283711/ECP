Based on the enumerated solutions, for all tested n, the valid configuration exists when the matrix size is 1×1, and the value equals n, with the only element dividing n. This pattern suggests that the set of such n's is precisely the set of positive integers. Therefore, the set of n satisfying the conditions is all positive integers.

Given the enumerated solutions, which consistently show a valid configuration for all tested n with r=1 and c=1, and the insight that these configurations involve a single-element matrix with the element dividing n, it is reasonable to conjecture that all positive integers n satisfy the conditions, i.e., the set of such n is ℕ \ {0}.

The initial errors in the Lean code originate from using raw English sentences directly as definitions, which is invalid. To fix that, I will define the set as the collection of all positive integers, i.e., those greater than zero. The set is then expressed as `{ n | 0 < n }`, which in Lean syntax is `set.Icc 1 (n+1)` or simply `{ n | 0 < n }`.

Final Lean expression:
```lean
<<< { n | 0 < n } >>>
```
This set captures all positive integers, aligning with the patterns observed in the enumerations and the logical deduction based on the simplest matrix entries dividing n.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The Lean error indicates that the syntax `<<< { n | 0 < n } >>>` is invalid; Lean does not recognize `<<<` as part of expression syntax. To declare a set with a predicate (i.e., the set of all natural numbers greater than zero), the correct way is to write:

```lean
{ n | 0 < n }
```

which is the set comprehension syntax in Lean. Since `IMO2016SLC2_answer` is an abbreviation of type `Set ℕ`, the correct declaration would be:

```lean
abbrev IMO2016SLC2_answer : Set ℕ := { n | 0 < n }
```

which constructs the set of all positive natural numbers. 

Hence, the fix is simply to replace the `<<<` with `{ n | 0 < n }`. Based on the enumeration, it appears that all `n ≥ 1` are the solutions, matching the intuitive conclusion that the set of positive integers fits the problem's criteria.

**Final Answer:**

<<< { n | 0 < n } >>>
