Ground Truth Answer: 6
Proposed Answer: 7
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer.

The problem gives us:
1. Four real numbers A < B < C < D
2. A specific fraction equality (B-A)/(C-B) = (D-A)/(C-D)
3. Two distance conditions: C-A = 3 and D-B = 4
4. Asks to find D-A

The ground truth answer is 6, while the proposed answer is 7.

Let's verify if 7 could be correct:
If D-A = 7, then since C-A = 3, we have D-C = 4
Given D-B = 4, then C-B would have to be 0 (since D-B = D-C + C-B = 4 + C-B = 4 ⇒ C-B=0)
But this contradicts horder (B < C). Therefore, the proposed answer of 7 leads to a contradiction.

The correct answer is indeed 6, which can be verified by setting up the equations properly.
