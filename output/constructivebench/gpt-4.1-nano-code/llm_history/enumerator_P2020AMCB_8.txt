This problem appears to involve analyzing the cardinality of a specific filtered set of integer pairs. The set under consideration is the product of two finite sets, and we're filtering for solutions to the equation:

\[ p_1^{2020} + (p_2 - 1)^2 = 1, \]

where \( p_1 \in \{-1, 0, 1\} \) and \( p_2 \in \{0, 1, 2\} \).

To enumerate the solutions efficiently, we:
- Loop through all possible pairs in the small product range
- Check the equation for each pair
- Count the pairs satisfying the condition and output each as found

Following the instructions, here is a Python script that:
- Simulates this enumeration
- Prints each solution immediately
- Calculates the total count at the end

```python
# Enumerate all pairs: p1 in {-1, 0, 1}, p2 in {0, 1, 2}
# Check if p1^2020 + (p2 - 1)^2 == 1
# Print each solution and count solutions
count = 0
for p1 in [-1, 0, 1]:
    for p2 in [0, 1, 2]:
        val = p1**2020 + (p2 - 1)**2
        if val == 1:
            print((p1, p2))
            count += 1

print("Total solutions:", count)
```
