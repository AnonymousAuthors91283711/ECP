This problem involves analyzing a sum involving integer floors of cubic ratios, and determining when the result is a perfect square. To assist, I'll generate possible L values, compute T(L), and check if T(L) is a perfect square. Since the problem involves summation over an interval from 1 to L, and shares the form of a sum of floors, a practical approach is:

- Fix small values of L (say, up to 20).
- Compute the sum T(L).
- Check if T(L) is a perfect square.
- Output all such L where T(L) is a perfect square, along with the corresponding square root m.

This enumeration will help to conjecture possible L values where T(L) equals a perfect square.

```python
import math

def T(L):
    total = 0
    for n in range(1, L + 1):
        value = n**3 / 9
        total += math.floor(value)
    return total

# Enumerate L from 1 to 20 and check if T(L) is a perfect square
for L in range(1, 21):
    sum_value = T(L)
    m = int(math.isqrt(sum_value))
    if m * m == sum_value:
        print(f"L = {L}, T(L) = {sum_value} = {m}^2")
```
