The problem is to find the minimal number with a product of digits equal to 1728 (which is 2^6 * 3^3), in base 10, and verify the sum of its digits. Since `minimalNumberWithDigitsProd` is not implemented, I will write a brute-force enumeration of numbers up to a certain feasible limit, say 10^6, checking for the digit product condition and recording the minimal such number. I will also output the sum of its digits.

This is not the most efficient method, but it provides a concrete set of answers to help with conjectures and matches the complexity constraints.

```python
# Numerator: Enumerate numbers up to 10^6 to find the minimal number with digits product 1728
# Store candidates and pick the minimal
# For each number, check digit product; if matches, record if smaller than current min

max_limit = 10**6
target_product = 1728
answers = []

def digit_product(n):
    prod = 1
    while n > 0:
        d = n % 10
        if d == 0:
            return 0
        prod *= d
        n //= 10
    return prod

for n in range(1, max_limit):
    p = digit_product(n)
    if p == target_product:
        answers.append(n)

if answers:
    min_n = min(answers)
    sum_digits = sum(int(d) for d in str(min_n))
    print("Minimal number with digit product 1728:", min_n)
    print("Sum of its digits:", sum_digits)
    print("Answer:", sum_digits)
else:
    print("No number found with digit product 1728 up to 10^6.")
```
