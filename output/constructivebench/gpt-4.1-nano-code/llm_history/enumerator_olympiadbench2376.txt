Given the problem's context, it appears to involve the relationship between \( y = \frac{\log(x^4)}{\log 10} \) and \( y = \left(\frac{\log x}{\log 10}\right)^3 \) for \( x > 0 \). Simplifying these, we want to analyze the points where these expressions for \( y \) are equal.

Since both expressions are equal if and only if:
\[
\frac{\log(x^4)}{\log 10} = \left(\frac{\log x}{\log 10}\right)^3
\]
and noting \(\log(x^4) = 4 \log x\), we have:
\[
\frac{4 \log x}{\log 10} = \left(\frac{\log x}{\log 10}\right)^3
\]
Let \( t = \frac{\log x}{\log 10} \). Then the equation becomes:
\[
4 t = t^3 \implies t^3 - 4 t = 0 \implies t(t^2 - 4) = 0
\]
So the solutions are:
\[
t = 0, \quad t = \pm 2
\]
Correspondingly:
- \( t = 0 \Rightarrow \log x / \log 10 = 0 \Rightarrow \log x = 0 \Rightarrow x = 10^0 = 1 \)
- \( t = 2 \Rightarrow \log x / \log 10 = 2 \Rightarrow \log x = 2 \log 10 \Rightarrow x = 10^{2} = 100 \)
- \( t = -2 \Rightarrow \log x / \log 10 = -2 \Rightarrow \log x = -2 \log 10 \Rightarrow x = 10^{-2} = 0.01 \)

Now, the problem involves \(\text{Set}(\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R})\), so the points \((x,y)\) must satisfy the equations derived. The set of solutions is:
\[
\{ (x,y) \mid x = 1, 100, 0.01, \text{ and } y = \frac{\log(x^4)}{\log 10} \text{ or } y=\left(\frac{\log x}{\log 10}\right)^3 \}
\]
but only where these equations coincide, i.e., at the solutions above. We are asked to define an approximation/set of these points.

The code will enumerate these solutions, print them, and define the set.

```python
# Enumerate solutions for t in {-2, 0, 2}
import math

# Base points corresponding to t solutions
x_values = [10**(-2), 1, 10**2]
answers = []

for x in x_values:
    log_x_base = math.log10(x)
    y1 = math.log(x**4) / math.log(10)  # equivalent to 4 * log_x_base
    y2 = (log_x_base)**3
    # These should be equal at solutions, but check and store
    answers.append((x, y1))
    answers.append((x, y2))
    # For clarity, just store the point once (they are equal at solutions)
    # To avoid duplicates, store only once per x
already_stored = set()
for x in x_values:
    log_x_base = math.log10(x)
    y = 4 * log_x_base  # or (log_x_base)**3 at solutions
    point = (x, y)
    if point not in already_stored:
        print(point)
        already_stored.add(point)

# The set of solutions (where the two expressions are equal)
olympiadbench2376_answer = set(answers)
