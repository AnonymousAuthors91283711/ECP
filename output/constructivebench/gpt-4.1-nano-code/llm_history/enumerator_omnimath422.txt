The problem appears to involve characterizing functions \(f : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{Q}\) satisfying a particular functional equation, and relating this to a set \(\operatorname{omnimath422\_answer}(a)\). To assist in conjecturing the solution, I will explore the functional equation for various rational values and identify patterns or candidate functions. 

Specifically, the functional equation:
\[ f(f x + a y) = a f y + x \]
for all rationals \(x, y\), under the condition \(a \neq 0\).

Key observations:
- For \(a=1\), the equation simplifies to \(f(f x + y) = f y + x\), which hints at affine or linear functions.
- For specific \(a\), constant or linear functions could satisfy the equation.

To explore systematically, I will:
- Choose some small rational \(a \neq 0\), e.g., \(a=1\), \(a=-1\), \(a=2\).
- For each, attempt to find all solutions \(f\) consistent with the functional equation using structured candidate functions.
- Since completeness isn't guaranteed without heavy algebra, I will enumerate candidate functions of simple form (linear, affine, constant), and check whether they satisfy the equation for some small sample \(x,y\).

Here's a Python code to help explore candidate solutions:

```python
# Exploring candidate functions f: ℚ -> ℚ satisfying the functional equation for small a
# We'll test linear functions f(x) = m*x + c for various m, c
# and check whether the functional equation holds for sampled (x,y)

from fractions import Fraction

# Sample small rational parameters for a chosen a
test_as = [Fraction(1,1), Fraction(-1,1), Fraction(2,1)]
candidate_ms = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]
candidate_cs = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]

# Sample pairs (x,y) to test the functional equation
sample_points = [(Fraction(x), Fraction(y)) for x in range(-2, 3) for y in range(-2, 3)]

for a in test_as:
    print(f"Testing for a = {a}")
    solutions_found = False
    for m in candidate_ms:
        for c in candidate_cs:
            # Check if f(x) = m x + c satisfies the equation for sampled points
            valid = True
            for x, y in sample_points:
                # Compute both sides
                lhs = None
                try:
                    val1 = m * (m * x + c) + c + a * y
                    val2 = a * (m * y + c) + x
                    # f(f x + a y) = m*(m*x+c)+c + a*y
                    lhs = m * (m * x + c) + c + a * y
                except Exception:
                    valid = False
                    break
                if lhs != val2:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if valid:
                print(f"Found candidate f(x) = {m}x + {c} for a={a}")
                solutions_found = True
    if not solutions_found:
        print(f"No linear solutions found for a={a} in tested range.")
```

This code probes simple affine functions for small rational \(a\) and samples \(x, y\). While it isn't a formal proof, it helps in conjecturing the form of solutions and the set \(\operatorname{omnimath422\_answer}(a)\).

This method might generalize further or reveal more complex solutions, but it provides immediate candidate answers and patterns.
