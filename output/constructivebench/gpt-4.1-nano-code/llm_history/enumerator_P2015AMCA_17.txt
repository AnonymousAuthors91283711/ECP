This problem involves counting the number of functions from a finite set with 8 elements to Bool, with the restriction that no two consecutive elements both map to true. The goal is to find the ratio of this count over the total number of functions (which is 2^8). The numerator is the number of such functions with no two adjacent true values.

First, determine the total number of functions from Fin 8 to Bool:
- Total functions: 2^8 = 256.

Next, count functions with no two consecutive true values:
- This is a standard combinatorial problem: counting binary strings of length 8 with no adjacent 1s.

Number of such strings of length n:
- Known recurrence: P(n) = P(n-1) + P(n-2), with P(1)=2 (strings of length 1: 0,1), P(2)=3 (00,01,10).
- For n=8, compute P(8):

Fibonacci-like sequence:
P(1)=2
P(2)=3
P(3)= P(2)+P(1)=3+2=5
P(4)= P(3)+P(2)=5+3=8
P(5)=8+5=13
P(6)=13+8=21
P(7)=21+13=34
P(8)=34+21=55

So, the number of functions with no two adjacent trues is 55.

Finally, the ratio:
ratio = 55 / 256

Since the theorem involves a ratio and a real quotient, we can hardcode this ratio as a rational number.

```python
# Count functions from a set of size 8 to Bool with no two consecutive trues
# Total functions: 2^8 = 256
# Count of no-adjacent-true functions: 55

# Define the answer as a rational
from fractions import Fraction

answer = Fraction(55, 256)
print(answer)
```
