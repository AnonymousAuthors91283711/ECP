abbrev omnimath2930_answer : ‚Ñù := sorry
theorem omnimath2930 :
  (1 + (3 * 5)) / 2 = omnimath2930_answer :=
sorry

Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: 8
<<<True>>>

Explanation: The proposed answer is correct. Let's evaluate the left side of the equation:
(1 + (3 * 5)) / 2 = (1 + 15) / 2 = 16 / 2 = 8
The ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's intentionally left undefined in Lean), but the proposed answer of 8 correctly solves the given equation.
