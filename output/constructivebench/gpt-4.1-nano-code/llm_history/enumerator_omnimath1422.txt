The problem appears to involve finding the set of real values resulting from a complex polynomial \( P(z) = z^3 + z^2 - z + 2 \), where \( z \) is complex but not real. Specifically, we are asked to find the set of all such real values \( r \) that can be obtained, where \( z \) is complex and not real.

Key observations:
- The polynomial \( P(z) \) is cubic.
- We want \( P(z) \in \mathbb{R} \) but with \( z \notin \mathbb{R} \).

The set involves the images of non-real \( z \)'s under the polynomial \( P \) that are real.

Let's analyze:
- For complex \( z = x + iy \), the polynomial outputs are real if the imaginary part of \( P(z) \) is zero.
- Since \( P(z) = z^3 + z^2 - z + 2 \), we can compute the imaginary part explicitly and find the possible real outputs for \( z \notin \mathbb{R} \).

We will:
- Fix \( x, y \) where \( y \neq 0 \).
- Calculate the imaginary part of \( P(z) \).
- For \( P(z) \) to be real, the imaginary part must be zero.
- Solve for \( y \neq 0 \), then compute \( P(z) \).

The code will:
- Enumerate \( x \) in a small range.
- For each \( x \), try several \( y \neq 0 \) to identify the possible real values \( r \).

This brute-force approach helps approximate the set without hard-coding.

```python
import math

# Enumerate points (x, y) with y != 0 to find real values of P(z)
def imaginary_part_P(x, y):
    # z = x + iy
    # P(z) = (x+iy)^3 + (x+iy)^2 - (x+iy) + 2
    # Extract imaginary part
    return (3*x**2*y - y**3) + (2*x*y) - y

# Store unique real outputs
results = set()

# Sample ranges for x and y
x_values = [i * 0.1 for i in range(-20, 21)]  # x in [-2, 2]
y_values = [i * 0.1 for i in range(1, 20)]  # y in (0.1, 2)

for x in x_values:
    for y in y_values:
        if abs(imaginary_part_P(x, y)) < 1e-2:  # Imag part near zero
            # Compute P(z)
            z = complex(x, y)
            Pz = z**3 + z**2 - z + 2
            # Include Pz.real if close to a real number
            r = Pz.real
            results.add(r)
            print(f"Found real value {r:.3f} from z={z}")

# Output the range of found values
print("\nPotential real outputs from non-real z:")
for val in sorted(results):
    print(f"{val:.3f}")
```
