Solution for n=8: x=3136
Solution for n=9: x=1521
Solution for n=10: x=400
Total solutions count: 11. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests the solutions for x are perfect squares decreasing from 14400 to 400, with specific steps corresponding to perfect squares. Counting solutions from n=0 to n=10 yields 11 solutions. Thus, the total number of solutions is 11.
