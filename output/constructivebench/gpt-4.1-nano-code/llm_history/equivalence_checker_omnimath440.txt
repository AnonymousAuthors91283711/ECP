Ground Truth Answer: {fun _ => 1, fun _ => 2, fun n => n}
Proposed Answer: {
  fun n => 1,
  fun n => 2,
  fun n => 0 * n + 1,
  fun n => 0 * n + 2,
  fun n => 1 * n + 0,
  fun n => 1 * n + 1,
  fun n => 2 * n + 0
}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all functions f: ℕ → ℕ that satisfy:
   - f(n!) = (f(n))! for all n
   - m - n divides f(m) - f(n) for all m ≠ n

2. Ground truth gives 3 simple functions: constant 1, constant 2, and identity.

3. Proposed answer includes:
   - Constant 1 (equivalent to ground truth's first function)
   - Constant 2 (equivalent to ground truth's second function)
   - Linear functions with various coefficients

Analysis:
- The constant functions 1 and 2 are correct and match ground truth.
- The identity function (fun n => n) is correct but appears in different forms in proposed answer (fun n => 1*n + 0).
- The other linear functions (like fun n => 0*n + 1 which is same as constant 1) are redundant but not incorrect.
- Some functions like fun n => 1*n + 1 don't satisfy the conditions (f(n!) = (n+1)! ≠ (n!) + 1 in general).

The proposed answer contains some correct functions but also includes incorrect ones and redundant formulations.
