abbrev omnimath633_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath633 : 
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ ∃ (P Q : ℤ[X]), (X + 1)^n - 1 = (X^2 + 1) * P + 3 * Q} omnimath633_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 8. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests that the minimal n for such a polynomial identity, considering (X + 1)^n - 1 divisible by (X^2 + 1) and expressible as the given form, is n=8, as per the enumeration. Therefore, the minimal n is 8.
