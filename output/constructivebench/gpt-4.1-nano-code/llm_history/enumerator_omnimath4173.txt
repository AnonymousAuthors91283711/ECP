[write_program]
This problem involves a complex logical and set-theoretic statement about sequences of integers and their properties under addition, quadratic equations, and initial conditions. To enable conjecture and potential proof, we can write a Python program that enumerates pairs `(u, v)` of integers based on small sample scenarios that satisfy the given conditions, focusing on manageable ranges.

Our approach:
- Fix small initial values for `u` and `v`.
- Generate sequences starting from either `u` or `v`.
- Expand the sequence by adding new elements, each obtained from the sum of any two existing elements in the sequence.
- Check the quadratic condition for triples `(a, b, c)` in the sequence and verify if the root `x` is also in the sequence.
- For each sequence generated, determine if the required conditions hold.
- Stream outputs whenever promising candidate pairs `(u, v)` are found.

The goal is to output pairs `(u, v)` that satisfy the properties for at least one sequence within the small sample bounds, aiding in constructing the set of solutions. Since the problem involves a logical equivalence, the code helps speculate which pairs belong to the set, without fully solving the theorem.

```python
# Enumerate pairs (u, v) with small integers and sequences that satisfy the conditions
# to assist in conjecture and proof.
max_val = 10  # small range for exploration
results = []

for u in range(-max_val, max_val + 1):
    for v in range(-max_val, max_val + 1):
        # Consider starting sequences from u or v
        initial_seq = [u] if abs(u) <= max_val else []
        initial_seq += [v] if abs(v) <= max_val and v != u else []
        if not initial_seq:
            continue

        # Generate the sequence with expansion
        seq = set(initial_seq)
        frontier = list(initial_seq)

        for _ in range(100):  # limit expansion to avoid infinite loops
            new_elements = set()
            # Generate sum of pairs in current sequence
            for a in seq:

                            new_elements.add(s)
