This problem involves complex numbers and inequalities, and it appears to ask for the least natural number \( K' \) satisfying a certain inequality involving the norm (magnitude) of complex differences. The key steps are to analyze the expression:

\[
\|(15 + 5i) - (1 + K' i)\| \geq 15 \times \frac{8}{5} = 24
\]

Simplify the difference:

\[
(15 + 5i) - (1 + K'i) = (14) + (5 - K')i
\]

Its norm:

\[
\sqrt{14^2 + (5 - K')^2} \geq 24
\]

Square both sides:

\[
14^2 + (5 - K')^2 \geq 576
\implies 196 + (5 - K')^2 \geq 576
\implies (5 - K')^2 \geq 380
\]

Now, since \( (5 - K')^2 \geq 380 \), take square roots:

\[
|5 - K'| \geq \sqrt{380}
\]

Let's approximate:

\[
\sqrt{380} \approx 19.493
\]

Thus,

\[
5 - K' \leq -19.493 \quad \text{or} \quad 5 - K' \geq 19.493
\]

which implies:

\[
K' \geq 5 + 19.493 \approx 24.493 \quad \text{or} \quad K' \leq 5 - 19.493 \approx -14.493
\]

Since \( K' \) is a natural number (\(\mathbb{N}\)), the only relevant solution is:

\[
K' \geq 25
\]

The least such \( K' \) in \(\mathbb{N}\) is 25.

```python
# Enumerate K' from small starting point, confirm the minimal value satisfying inequality
import math

# Threshold for K'
threshold = 25

# Since K' counting from 0 upwards, find minimal satisfying K'
# The inequality reduces to |5 - K'| >= sqrt(380) â‰ˆ 19.493
min_K = None
sqrt_380 = math.sqrt(380)
for K_prime in range(0, 100):  # upper bound for sanity
    if abs(5 - K_prime) >= sqrt_380:
        min_K = K_prime
        print(min_K)
        break
# Output final answer: the minimal K' that satisfies the inequality
print(f"The minimal K' satisfying the condition is: {min_K}")
```
