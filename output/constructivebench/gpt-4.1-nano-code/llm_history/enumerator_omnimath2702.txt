The problem appears to involve finding a 4-digit number \( n \) where each digit satisfies certain parity constraints, likely even digits, under the bounds \( 1000 \leq n \leq 9999 \). The conditions seem to specify that the thousands, hundreds, tens, and units digits are all even, with some parity conditions on the digit segments.

To aid conjecture and proof, we'll enumerate all such four-digit numbers with all even digits: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8. Since the thousands digit can't be zero (to ensure 4-digit number), it must be from {2, 4, 6, 8}. The other digits can be 0, 2, 4, 6, 8.

Here's a Python program that systematically enumerates all such numbers:

```python
# Enumerate all 4-digit numbers with even digits only,
# where the first digit (thousands place) is non-zero
# and all digits are even.
# Printed immediately upon generation.

even_digits = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]

for thousands in [2, 4, 6, 8]:
    for hundreds in even_digits:
        for tens in even_digits:
            for units in even_digits:
                n = thousands * 1000 + hundreds * 100 + tens * 10 + units
                print(n)
```

This code lists all valid candidates efficiently. It can be adapted for further constraints or checks to find min/max or specific patterns as needed.
