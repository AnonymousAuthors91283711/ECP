[write_program]
This problem appears to be a high-level theorem statement involving functions over real numbers with a specific functional equation. The goal is to find all pairs of functions `(f, g)` satisfying the equation:

\[
\forall x, y \in \mathbb{R}, \quad g(f(x + y)) = f x + (2x + y) g y
\]

Since the code includes `import Mathlib` and syntax reminiscent of Lean, but the task is to write a Python program to assist conjecture or find solutions, I will simulate solutions by enumerating simple candidate functions from a small finite family and checking the functional equation. 

Because the task is abstract and requires function enumeration, I will assume potential solutions are linear functions:  
\[
f(x) = a x + b, \quad g(x) = c x + d
\]
with small coefficients, and test all combinations within small bounds. The program should output all candidates that satisfy the equation exactly for all tested \(x, y\).

Furthermore, to limit the output, I will only evaluate over small sample points \(x, y \in \{-1, 0, 1\}\). This will allow me to find consistent solutions, helping conjectures about the general form.

```python
# Enumerate candidate linear functions for f and g
# f(x) = a*x + b, g(x) = c*x + d with small integer coefficients
coeffs = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]
solutions = []

# Test over small sample points
sample_points = [-1, 0, 1]

for a in coeffs:
    for b in coeffs:
        for c in coeffs:
            for d in coeffs:
                # Check the functional equation at all combinations of sample points
                valid = True
                for x in sample_points:
                    for y in sample_points:
                        # Compute both sides
                        left = c * (a * (x + y) + b)
                        right = (a * x + b) + (2 * x + y) * (c * y + d)
                        if left != right:
                            valid = False
                            break
                    if not valid:
                        break
                if valid:
                    # Record the solution
                    solutions.append(((a, b), (c, d)))
                    print(f"f(x)={a}x+{b}, g(x)={c}x+{d}")
```
