Based on the pattern involving minimal n ensuring a certain structure with repeated element a and increments p, q, the conjectured closed form reflects n ≥ max(p, q) and involves powers of 2. The minimal n that satisfies the conditions is often p + q, considering the sum of increments, but since initial constraints are strict, the safest minimal n capturing both p and q is p + q. 

Considering the enumeration pattern, a consistent concise expression involves a power of 2 related to the larger of p, q, plus the sum p + q. 

Final conjecture: 
<<<fun p q => p + q + 2^(max p q - 1)>>>
