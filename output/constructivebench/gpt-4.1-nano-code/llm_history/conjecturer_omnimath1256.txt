theorem omnimath1256 :
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | 1000 < n ∧ n < 2000 ∧ ∀ k ∈ ({2,3,4,5,6,7,8} : Set ℕ), n % k = 1} omnimath1256_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 1681. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
This problem seeks the least \( n \) between 1000 and 2000, where \( n \equiv 1 \mod k \) for each \( k \in \{2,3,4,5,6,7,8\} \). The common solution is the least common multiple of these moduli plus 1, ensuring \( n - 1 \) is divisible by all.

Since \( \operatorname{lcm}(2,3,4,5,6,7,8) = 840 \), the smallest such \( n \) greater than 1000 is \( 840 \times 2 + 1 = 1681 \).

<<<1681>>>
