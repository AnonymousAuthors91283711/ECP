The problem essentially asks for the minimal value of \(z = 2a^2 + b^2\) given the constraints \(a, b \ge 0\) and \(a^3 + b^3 + 6ab = 8\). To find candidates, we can parameterize various pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the constraint and evaluate \(z\). Since the constraint involves symmetric cubic terms, considering some small rational sample points and solving approximate equations will help. We look for minimal \(z\).

```python
import math

# Define the relation: a^3 + b^3 + 6 * a * b = 8
# We will try small rational candidates for a and b that satisfy the constraint approximately.

def evaluate_z(a, b):
    return 2 * a**2 + b**2

# Candidate points (sampled small rational numbers)
candidates = [
    (1, 1),      # test with simple small integers
    (0.5, 1.2),
    (1.2, 0.5),
    (2/3, 4/3),  # given in the problem as a sample point
    (0.8, 1.0),
    (1.1, 0.9),
    (0.4, 1.5),
]

for a, b in candidates:
    # Check if the constraint approximately holds
    lhs = a**3 + b**3 + 6 * a * b
    diff = abs(lhs - 8)
    z = evaluate_z(a, b)
    print(f"a={a:.3f}, b={b:.3f}, a^3 + b^3 + 6ab={lhs:.3f} (diff={diff:.3f}), z= {z:.3f}")

# Since we only sample, we report the minimal found z
# In a real setting, further optimization or solving could be performed.
```
