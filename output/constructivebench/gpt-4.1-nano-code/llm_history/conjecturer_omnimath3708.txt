83. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The problem asks for the greatest x > 0 such that 23^(6 + x) divides 2000!. The maximum power of 23 dividing 2000! determines this. We compute v_{23}(2000!) = ⌊2000/23⌋ + ⌊2000/23^2⌋ + ⌊2000/23^3⌋ + … until the division yields zero. 

This results in 86, consistent with the pattern in enumerated answers where the maximum power is 86. 

Thus, the largest x is v_{23}(2000!) – 6 = 86 – 6 = 80.

Since the problem asks for the maximum x satisfying the divisibility condition, and x ≥ 1, the answer is 80.
