The pattern clearly shows z = 3 * y, and y = 2 * x, with x as the parameter. Thus, z = 3 * (2 * x) = 6 * x. Taking x as an arbitrary real, the general form is 6 * x.

Computed z: 18

x=3, y=6, z=18
x=4, y=8, z=24. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The problem states that z = 3 * y, y = 2 * x, and x = 3. From these, we want to express z in terms of x and find a closed form answer. Computing from the values: y = 2 * x, z = 3 * y, so z = 3 * (2 * x) = 6 * x.

The error in the current proposed answer is that it is a function from ℝ to ℝ, but the answer should be a specific ℝ value, not a function, since in the theorem we want to establish the value of z explicitly given x, y, z.

It appears the template for the answer is a fixed real number. Given the enumerated solutions, for x=3, z=18, which equals 6 * 3. For x=2, z=12, which equals 6 * 2. So the answer is a constant multiple of x, specifically 6 * x.

Since the theorem asserts z = omnimath2700_answer, and the context shows the answer should be a concrete real number, the correct choice is the constant 6 * x with x specified as 3: the specific value z=18 corresponds to x=3, confirming that z = 6 * x.

Hence, the proper answer to match the pattern in the enumeration and the exact relation is:

<<<18>>>

or, equivalently, define as 6 * 3 = 18, the value of z corresponding to x=3.

Final answer:
<<<18>>>

This fixes the type mismatch because it's a specific real number matching computed z, and aligns with the given enumeration.
