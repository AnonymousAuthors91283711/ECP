This appears to be a formal statement from a theorem-proving environment, possibly inspired by Lean or similar proof assistants, involving functions on real numbers. The problem is to understand the functional equation:

\[ \forall x, y,\quad f(f(y)) + f(x - y) = f(x \cdot f(y) - x) \]

and to find all solutions \(f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) satisfying it. The theorem claims that solutions are exactly those equal to some particular function \(\text{omnimath3582\_answer}\), which is left as a placeholder.

Given high-school competition-level analogous problems, a common approach is to hypothesize simple functions and verify whether they satisfy the equation.

**Possible functions to test:**
- \(f(x) = c\), constant functions.
- \(f(x) = x\).
- \(f(x) = -x\).
- \(f(x) = 0\).

Once candidates are identified, we can programmatically check these for the given functional equation over various sample points, then identify a match.

---

**Plan:**
- Implement candidate functions.
- For each candidate, verify the functional equation at multiple sample pairs \((x, y)\).
- Output candidates that satisfy all checks.
- Since the problem asks for a streaming output, we check candidates one by one and print when we find a match.

The code will focus on the core possibilities—probably only a handful—and check their equations over a small set of test points efficiently.

```python
# Candidate functions based on common solutions:
# 1. Constant zero function
# 2. Identity function f(x) = x
# 3. Negative identity f(x) = -x

def check_f(f):
    test_points = [(0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1), (-1,1), (2, -1)]
    for x, y in test_points:
        lhs = f(f(y)) + f(x - y)
        rhs = f(x * f(y) - x)
        if abs(lhs - rhs) > 1e-8:
            return False
    return True

# Define candidate functions
def f_zero(x):
    return 0

def f_identity(x):
    return x

def f_neg(x):
    return -x

# Check each candidate and print if it satisfies the functional equation
if check_f(f_zero):
    print("f(x) = 0 satisfies the equation.")
if check_f(f_identity):
    print("f(x) = x satisfies the equation.")
if check_f(f_neg):
    print("f(x) = -x satisfies the equation.")
```
