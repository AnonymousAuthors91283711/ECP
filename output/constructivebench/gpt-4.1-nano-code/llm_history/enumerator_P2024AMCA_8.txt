The problem involves analyzing the set of angles θ in [0, 2π] for which the sum of logs equals zero: log(sin(3θ)) + log(cos(2θ)) = 0. Equivalently, sin(3θ) * cos(2θ) = 1 (since log(a) + log(b) = 0 ⟺ a * b = 1). So, the problem reduces to finding all θ where sin(3θ) * cos(2θ) = 1 within the interval. 

Because sin and cos are bounded between -1 and 1, and the maximum of their product is 1, the product equals 1 only when both are ±1 and their product is positive. But for the product to be exactly 1, both must be 1 simultaneously, since |sin(3θ)|, |cos(2θ)| ≤ 1. Therefore, the conditions are:

- sin(3θ) = 1
- cos(2θ) = 1

Let's code to find all θ in [0, 2π] satisfying these conditions, considering their solutions explicitly.

```python
import math

# Define the interval parameters
two_pi = 2 * math.pi

# Solutions where sin(3θ) = 1
# sin(α) = 1 at α = π/2 + 2πk
# So 3θ = π/2 + 2πk
solutions_sin = []
for k in range(int((2 * math.pi - 0) // (2 * math.pi)) + 2):  # search over k
    θ_candidate = (math.pi / 2 + 2 * math.pi * k) / 3
    if 0 <= θ_candidate <= two_pi:
        solutions_sin.append(θ_candidate)

# Solutions where cos(2θ) = 1
# cos(β) = 1 at β = 0 + 2πm
# 2θ = 0 + 2πm
solutions_cos = []
for m in range(int((two_pi) // (2 * math.pi)) + 2):
    θ_candidate = (2 * math.pi * m) / 2
    if 0 <= θ_candidate <= two_pi:
        solutions_cos.append(θ_candidate)

# Find common solutions where both conditions hold
# Since we're looking for θ satisfying both, look for overlaps within tolerance
tolerance = 1e-9
answers = []
for s in solutions_sin:
    for c in solutions_cos:
        if abs(s - c) < tolerance:
            answers.append(s)

# Count solutions
print(f"Number of solutions: {len(answers)}")
# For each, print the approximate value
for θ in answers:
    print(f"θ ≈ {θ}")
```
