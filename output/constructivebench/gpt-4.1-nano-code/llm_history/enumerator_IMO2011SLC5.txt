The problem appears to relate to a geometric or combinatorial optimization scenario involving sets of points, directions, and a maximum time parameter t, with the goal to find the greatest t satisfying certain constraints. To assist, I will implement a brute-force enumeration approach to approximate the maximum possible t for various small values of m, considering only discrete increments for t to make the search manageable.

The approach:
- For a fixed m, iterate over plausible t values starting from 0 upwards in small increments.
- For each t, check if the set of constraints (positions remain within bounds and at least one point moves strictly inside the bounding box before t) can be satisfied.
- Since the constraints involve continuous parameters, use rational approximations with small denominators.
- Continue until reaching the maximum t that satisfies the constraints, then print that t.

Given the complexity, I will pick small m values, e.g., m=1, and test t up to a small threshold (e.g., 1 in steps of 0.01), checking constraints at each step.

Here's the code to do this efficiently and stream answers:

```python
# Enumerates possible maximum t for small m by discretizing time in small steps,
# checking constraints for each candidate t, and printing the maximum feasible t found.
import itertools

# Set clear parameters
m = 1
max_time = 1
step = 0.01

# Directions allowed
directions = [(1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1)]

# Generate points p within bounds
def generate_points(m):
    points = []
    for x in range(m+1):
        for y in range(m+1):
            points.append( (x, y) )
    return points

points = generate_points(m)

# Function to check if a given t satisfies the constraints
def feasible(t):
    # For simplicity, assume the set of points is fixed and directions are assigned arbitrarily
    # For each point, assign a direction to satisfy the conditions
    for dir_perm in itertools.product(directions, repeat=len(points)):
        # Check if for all points, the position at time t is within bounds
        within_bounds = True
        strictly_inside = False
        for p, d in zip(points, dir_perm):
            x_new = p[0] + t * d[0]
            y_new = p[1] + t * d[1]
            if not (0 <= x_new <= m and 0 <= y_new <= m):
                within_bounds = False
                break
            if 0 < x_new < m and 0 < y_new < m:
                strictly_inside = True
        if within_bounds and strictly_inside:
            # Check that for all t' < t, some point moves strictly inside at t'
            # Here, we approximate by checking t - step
            t_prime = t - step
            all_inside = True
            for p, d in zip(points, dir_perm):
                x_tprime = p[0] + t_prime * d[0]
                y_tprime = p[1] + t_prime * d[1]
                if not (0 < x_tprime < m and 0 < y_tprime < m):
                    all_inside = False
                    break
            if all_inside:
                return True
    return False

current_max = 0.0
t_value = 0.0
while t_value <= max_time:
    if feasible(t_value):
        current_max = t_value
        print(f"Feasible t found: {t_value:.2f}")
    t_value += step
print(f"Maximum feasible t: {current_max:.2f}")
```

This code discretizes `t` from 0 to `max_time`, checks feasibility under simplified assumptions, and streams feasible values. It provides an approximate maximum t suitable for small m, aligning with the problem's heuristic and efficiency goals.
