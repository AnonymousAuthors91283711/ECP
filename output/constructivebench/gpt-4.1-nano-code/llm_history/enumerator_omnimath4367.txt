This problem seems to involve number theory, specifically about representations of residues modulo N as sums of squares. A classical result related to sums of squares is that for certain values of N, every residue mod N can be represented as a sum of squares of some integers, particularly for N being prime or certain composite forms.

Given the context, the problem likely asks us to determine, for each N, whether every residue class modulo N can be represented as a sum of squares of some initial segment (sum of i^2 for i in range n).

To assist in conjecturing and verifying the statement, I will implement a program that for small N enumerates all residues k < N and checks if each can be represented as a sum of squares of some initial segment.

Considering efficiency, I will:
- For each N up to a small cutoff, iterate over n up to a certain limit (say N+10) to check all sums of squares.
- Record which residues can be attained as sums of the initial segment of i^2.
- Verify whether all residues are covered.
- Print N and whether the property holds or not.

Here's the implementation:

```python
# Enumerate N from 1 to 20 to check the property
# For each N, test sums of i^2 for i in [0, N+10]
# Check if all residues mod N are representable as sum of some initial segment
# Since the sums are cumulative, we only need to check the prefix sums

for N in range(1, 21):
    sums = set()
    sum_i2 = 0
    max_i = N + 10  # limit to avoid excessive computation
    for i in range(max_i + 1):  # include max_i
        if i > 0:
            sum_i2 += i**2
        sums.add(sum_i2 % N)
    
    all_represented = True
    for k in range(N):
        if k not in sums:
            all_represented = False
            break

    print(f"N = {N}: All residues represented as sum of initial squares? {all_represented}")
```
