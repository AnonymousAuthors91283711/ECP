[write_program]
The problem appears to involve defining sequences based on prime calculations, particularly the least prime not dividing a given number (`p(x)`), and the product of primes less than that prime (`q(x)`). We then generate a sequence `x_sequence` that depends on previous terms and these prime computations, with the goal of identifying when the sequence equals a specific value (e.g., 1995). 

Given the placeholders and the context, I will focus on:
- Enumerating possible sequence values by approximating the calculation of `p(x)` and `q(x)` for small values.
- Using small sample computations to find the index `n` such that `x_sequence n = 1995`.
- Printing each candidate answer immediately to assist in conjecture.
- Avoiding hardcoded values; instead, explicitly performing enumerations.

Because the code references `Mathlib` and some lean-style constructs, I'll write a Python approximation that:
- Uses simple primes enumeration
- Stores sequences
- Finds the first `n` with `x_sequence n = 1995` (if it exists within reasonable bounds)

import math

# Function to check if a number is prime
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Generate list of primes less than a given number
def primes_less_than(n):
    return [p for p in range(2, n) if is_prime(p)]

# Compute p(x): least prime not dividing x
def p(x):
    for prime in range(2, 100):  # limit prime search for efficiency
        if is_prime(prime) and x % prime != 0:
            return prime
    return 2  # fallback

# Compute q(x): product of primes less than p(x)
def q(x):
    prime_p = p(x)
    primes_list = primes_less_than(prime_p)
    product = 1
    for prime in primes_list:
        product *= prime
    return product

# Generate the sequence
def x_sequence(max_n):
    sequence = [1]
    for k in range(1, max_n + 1):
        prev = sequence[-1]
        prime_p = p(prev)
        prod_q = q(prev)
        # To avoid division errors, ensure divisible
        val = (prev * prime_p) // q(prev)
        sequence.append(val)
        print(f'n={k}, x={val}')
        if val == 1995:
            print(f"Found n={k} with x={val}")
            return k
    return None

# Search for sequence term equal to 1995 within first 50 terms
index_found = x_sequence(50)
if index_found is not None:
    print(f"The sequence reaches 1995 at n={index_found}")
else:
    print("Sequence does not reach 1995 within 50 terms.")
```
