The problem involves computing the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{2003} \sin \left( \frac{2\pi(k+1)}{4009} \right)\). Since \(4009\) is prime, and the angles are evenly spaced around the circle, this resembles roots of unity and their sine products. Notably, the product over all roots of unity (or related points) often leads to known results related to cyclotomic polynomials.

Given the structure, the roots are at points \(\sin\left(\frac{2\pi (k+1)}{4009}\right)\). This product over the entire set of angles tends to be connected to properties of Chebyshev polynomials and roots of unity, and when symmetrically paired, the product often simplifies to a power of 1/2 or related values.

To conjecture the value, we can test smaller cases or approximate numerically for the given \(\sin\) product over the full set.

Here's a Python script that will approximate this product by evaluating it explicitly for \(k=0\) to 2003, then prints the approximate value, following the instructions to stream answers.

```python
import math

# Parameters
n = 4009
total_terms = 2004  # k from 0 to 2003

# Compute the product of sines
product = 1.0
for k in range(total_terms):
    angle = 2 * math.pi * (k + 1) / n
    sine_value = math.sin(angle)
    product *= sine_value
    print(f"Term {k+1}: sin({angle}) = {sine_value:.6f}, current product â‰ˆ {product:.6f}")

# Output the approximate product
print(f"Approximate product after {total_terms} terms: {product}")
```

This script evaluates the product numerically, streaming each term's contribution and the ongoing product. The approximate value can give insight into the true exact value, suspected to be zero or a simple rational multiple, based on symmetry and existing properties of roots of unity and sine products.
