This problem asks for the greatest prime divisor \( p \) of \( 15! - 13! \). Since \(15!\) and \(13!\) are factorials, we can simplify \(15! - 13!\):

\[
15! - 13! = 13! \times (15 \times 14 - 1) = 13! \times (210 - 1) = 13! \times 209
\]

So the prime divisors of this number are the primes dividing \(13!\) and 209.

- All primes less than or equal to 13 divide \(13!\).
- Factor 209 to find its prime divisors:

\[
209 = 11 \times 19
\]

which are both prime and larger than 13.

Thus, the prime divisors are all primes \(\leq 13\) (from \(13!\)), plus the primes 11 and 19.

Among these, 19 is the largest prime dividing the expression. 

Therefore, the greatest prime divisor is 19.

The code will enumerate the primes dividing \(15! - 13!\), confirming 19 is the maximum prime divisor.

```python
from math import factorial, gcd

# Compute 15! - 13!
val = factorial(15) - factorial(13)

# Find all prime factors of val
def prime_factors(n):
    factors = set()
    # Check divisibility by small primes
    for p in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        while n % p == 0:
            factors.add(p)
            n //= p
    if n > 1:
        factors.add(n)
    return factors

factors = prime_factors(val)
max_prime = max(factors)
print(f"Prime factors: {sorted(factors)}")
print("Greatest prime divisor:", max_prime)

# In particular, this will print 19 as the maximum prime divisor
```
