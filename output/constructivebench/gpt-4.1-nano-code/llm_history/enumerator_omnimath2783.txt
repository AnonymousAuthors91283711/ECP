This problem involves finding a unique natural number \( n \) such that the sum \( n + (n+1) + (n+2) \) equals 27 and the product \( n \times (n+1) \times (n+2) \) equals a certain answer. To assist in the conjecture, we'll enumerate possible values of \( n \), check the sum condition, then output the product if the sum condition is met. We'll search within reasonable bounds (e.g., \( n \) from 0 to 20).

```python
# We search for n in a small range where the sum is likely to be 27
# Since n + (n+1) + (n+2) = 3n + 3, we set 3n + 3 = 27 => n = 8
# We will verify this and also check the product for n=8

for n in range(0, 20):
    sum_value = n + (n + 1) + (n + 2)
    if sum_value == 27:
        product = n * (n + 1) * (n + 2)
        print(f"n = {n}: sum = {sum_value}, product = {product}")
```
