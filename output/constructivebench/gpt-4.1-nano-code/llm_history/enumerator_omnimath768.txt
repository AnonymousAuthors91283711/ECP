Given the problem's structure, it involves sets of 2D grid subregions, and their counts relate to rectangles within a 4x4 grid. We aim to determine the ratio of the count of pairs with non-empty intersection and difference to the total number of pairs of such subsets.

To help find the ratio, we'll:
- Enumerate all rectangles within a 4x4 grid (indices from 0 to 3).
- Count all rectangles.
- Enumerate all pairs of rectangles that are distinct and intersect.
- Calculate the ratio using exact rational arithmetic.

Since the grid size is small (4x4), brute-force enumeration is efficient.

```python
# Enumerate all rectangles in a 4x4 grid:
# Each rectangle is defined by its top-left (r,c) and bottom-right (r2,c2) with r<=r2, c<=c2
# Count total rectangles and pairs that intersect, then compute the ratio

from fractions import Fraction

def enumerate_rectangles():
    rects = []
    for r in range(4):
        for c in range(4):
            for r2 in range(r, 4):
                for c2 in range(c, 4):
                    rects.append(((r, c), (r2, c2)))
    return rects

def rectangles_intersect(r1, r2):
    # Check if two rectangles intersect
    (r1_top, c1_left), (r1_bottom, c1_right) = r1
    (r2_top, c2_left), (r2_bottom, c2_right) = r2
    # rectangles don't intersect if one is completely to the left or above the other
    return not (r1_bottom < r2_top or r2_bottom < r1_top or
                c1_right < c2_left or c2_right < c1_left)

def main():
    rects = enumerate_rectangles()
    total_rects = len(rects)

    total_pairs = 0
    intersecting_pairs = 0

    # Count total pairs (excluding identical pairs)
    for i in range(total_rects):
        for j in range(i + 1, total_rects):
            total_pairs += 1
            if rectangles_intersect(rects[i], rects[j]):
                intersecting_pairs += 1

    ratio = Fraction(intersecting_pairs, total_pairs)
    print(f"Total rectangles: {total_rects}")
    print(f"Total pairs: {total_pairs}")
    print(f"Intersecting pairs: {intersecting_pairs}")
    print(f"Ratio: {ratio.numerator}/{ratio.denominator} â‰ˆ {float(ratio):.4f}")
