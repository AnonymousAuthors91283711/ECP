The problem involves solving the polynomial equation \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0\) over complex numbers. To assist in conjecturing solutions, we should enumerate roots that satisfy this polynomial, looking for exact algebraic solutions or approximations. Since it's a quartic, we can attempt to factor or directly test candidate roots with small magnitudes, perhaps roots of unity or simple algebraic numbers, and then include these in our enumeration.

Below is a Python program that:
- Enumerates complex numbers with small modulus.
- Checks whether they satisfy the polynomial within a small tolerance.
- Reports roots as soon as they are found.
- Uses a coarse grid of candidate angles and radii for efficiency.
- The output is streamed, showing answers immediately.

```python
import cmath

def poly(x):
    return x**4 + 2*x**3 + 2*x**2 + 2*x + 1

# Tolerance for root checking
epsilon = 1e-6

# Limit the magnitude of candidate roots for efficiency
max_radius = 2.0
# Number of angles to sample per radius
num_angles = 360

# Enumerate roots by polar coordinates: r from 0 to max_radius, theta from 0 to 2*pi
for r in [i * max_radius / 100 for i in range(101)]:
    for k in range(num_angles):
        theta = 2 * 3.141592653589793 * k / num_angles
        x = r * cmath.exp(1j * theta)
        val = poly(x)
        if abs(val) < epsilon:
            print(f"Found root: {x}")
```
