The problem defines a function `digitSum` that computes the sum of digits of `n`, and a theorem relating `n` with the equation `(digitSum n * (digitSum n - 1) = n - 1)`. Our goal is to enumerate possible `n` values that satisfy the equation, then identify and conjecture the set of all solutions.

Since the exact theorem is left as `sorry`, we can analyze small `n` values, especially because for large `n`, the sum of digits grows slowly compared to `n`, and the equation involves `n - 1`. We'll search for `n` where `digitSum n * (digitSum n - 1) = n - 1`.

The plan:
- Iterate over `n` from 1 to some upper bound (say 1000), or until solutions are exhaustively found.
- For each `n`, compute `digitSum n`, check if the equation holds.
- Immediately print each solution `n`.
- Finish by outputting the full set of solutions found.

This enumeration approach should efficiently find all candidate solutions within the small range.

```python
# Enumerate values of n from 1 to 1000; check if they satisfy digitSum n * (digitSum n - 1) = n - 1
def digitSum(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

solutions = []
for n in range(1, 1001):
    s = digitSum(n)
    if s * (s - 1) == n - 1:
        print(n)  # Stream solutions as discovered
        solutions.append(n)
# After enumeration, solutions contain all candidate solutions up to 1000; proceed as needed.
```
