The problem appears to involve a ratio expression `(4 * D * S) / Q` where `S`, `Q`, and `D` are natural numbers, with `Q â‰  0`. The goal seems to be to model an answer function `P2018AMCB_6_answer` based on these parameters.

Given the context, the typical task might be to find values or characterize the outcome of `(4 * D * S) / Q`. Without additional constraints or details, a good approach is to explore possible values of this expression for small `S`, `Q`, and `D`, considering that the problem may ask for exact or approximate values, extremal values, or relationships.

To comply with the instructions, I will:
- Enumerate small positive integers for `S`, `Q`, and `D`.
- For each, compute `(4 * D * S) / Q`.
- Stream out exact values (floating point if needed, but handle integer division cleverly).
- Demonstrate how these parameters influence the ratio.

This also aligns with the idea of selecting small sample values to observe the behavior of this ratio.

```python
# Enumerate small values for S, Q, D
max_value = 10  # small threshold for enumeration
for S in range(1, max_value + 1):
    for D in range(1, max_value + 1):
        for Q in range(1, max_value + 1):
            value = (4 * D * S) / Q
            # Print exact ratio as a float, streaming results
            print(f"S={S}, D={D}, Q={Q} => (4*D*S)/Q = {value}")
```
