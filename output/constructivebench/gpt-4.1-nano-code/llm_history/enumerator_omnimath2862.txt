This problem asks to compute the number of integer pairs `(x, y)` satisfying `x > 0`, `y > 0`, and `(x : ℚ) / 4 = 9 / y`. 

Since `(x : ℚ) / 4 = 9 / y`, rewriting gives `x / 4 = 9 / y`, which implies `x = (36) / y`. For `x` to be an integer, `(36) / y` must be integral, so `y` must divide 36. Also, `x > 0`, `y > 0`, and since `x = 36 / y`, `x > 0` if and only if `36 / y > 0`, which is true for all positive divisors of 36.

Therefore, the pairs are all positive divisors `y` of 36, with `x = 36 / y`. Valid pairs are `(36 / y, y)` where `y` divides 36.

We need to find all positive divisors of 36 and count the corresponding pairs.

Let's enumerate divisors of 36 and count:

```python
# Enumerate all positive divisors of 36 and their corresponding x
divisors = []
for y in range(1, 37):
    if 36 % y == 0:
        x = 36 // y
        # Conditions: x > 0, y > 0 (both always true here)
        # Output each pair
        print(f"Pair: (x={x}, y={y})")
        divisors.append((x, y))

# Total number of such pairs:
print(f"Total pairs: {len(divisors)}")
```

Executed, this will list all pairs and their total count.

```python
# Complete code to enumerate solutions
divisors = []
for y in range(1, 37):
    if 36 % y == 0:
        x = 36 // y
        print(f"({x}, {y})")
        divisors.append((x, y))
print(f"Number of solutions: {len(divisors)}")
```
