. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℤ × ℤ → ℝ)
The error in your definition stems from incorrect syntax—specifically, in how the set of functions is declared. Since all candidate functions are constant functions satisfying \(f(x,y) = c \in [0,1]\), the set can be characterized as all functions from \(\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}\) to \(\mathbb{R}\) that are constant with value in \([0,1]\).

The key observation from the enumerates and the recursive satisfaction is that the solutions are exactly the constant functions with values in \([0,1]\) because the value of the function is stable under the recursive relation and boundary conditions.

The correct syntax to define this set is:
```lean
def omnimath23_answer : Set (ℤ × ℤ → ℝ) := {f | ∃ c ∈ set.Icc 0 1, ∀ (x y), f (x, y) = c}
```
This set characterizes all functions that are constant with value \(c\), where \(c \in [0,1]\), which matches the implications from the enumerated solutions and the recursive relation.

Therefore, the fixed answer in Lean syntax is:
```lean
<<<{f : ℤ × ℤ → ℝ | ∃ c ∈ set.Icc 0 1, ∀ (x y), f (x, y) = c}>>>

. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℤ × ℤ → ℝ)
Since the given recursive relation:
\[f(x, y) = \frac{f(x-1, y) + f(x, y-1)}{2}\]
along with the bounds \[0 ≤ f(x, y) ≤ 1\], resembles the conditions for constant solutions and linear interpolations across the domain, and the enumerated solutions include all constant functions within [0, 1], the set of solutions should correspond to all functions that are constant with values in [0, 1].

Furthermore, the recursive relation with identical values at boundary points implies the function must be constant across the entire grid without contradictions. 

Thus, the solution set can be characterized as the set of all constant functions \(f\) with values in \([0, 1]\).

In Lean, this translates to the set of all functions \(f : ℤ × ℤ → ℝ\) such that there exists \(c \in [0, 1]\) with \(f (x, y) = c\) for all \((x, y)\). 

The precise Lean expression is:

. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℤ × ℤ → ℝ)
The primary issue is the incorrect usage of `set.Icc`. In Lean, the correct notation from `Mathlib` is `Set.Icc`, not `set.Icc`. Additionally, the set defines the functions as constant functions bounded between 0 and 1, satisfying the recursive relation, and thus the answer set comprises exactly these constant functions.

Given the recursive relation:
- \(f(x,y) \in [0,1]\),
- \(f(x,y) = (f(x-1,y) + f(x,y-1))/2\),

and considering the boundary conditions and recursive relation, typical solutions are constant functions, with the constant value in [0,1].

Hence, the set of solutions is exactly all functions \(f\) such that \(f(x,y) = c\) for some fixed \(c \in [0,1]\).

Here's the corrected and simplified Lean code:

```lean
{f | ∃ c ∈ Set.Icc 0 1, ∀ (x y : ℤ), f (x, y) = c}
```
