abbrev P2013AIMEI_1_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2013AIMEI_1 :
  ∃ (swim_speed : ℝ), 0 < swim_speed ∧
  let run_speed := 5 * swim_speed
  let bike_speed := 2 * run_speed
  let swim_time := 0.5 / swim_speed
  let bike_time := 30 / bike_speed
  let run_time := 8 / run_speed
  swim_time + bike_time + run_time = 4.25 ∧
  bike_time * 60 = P2013AIMEI_1_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 150.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests that the bike_time * 60 simplifies to a constant independent of swim_speed, and the indicated value in your enumeration is 150.0, matching a fixed relation. Thus, the answer is:

<<<150.0>>>
