[write_program]
This is a formal mathematical problem, but since the request is to write a Python program to assist in conjecturing and proving answers related to such equations, I'll interpret it as needing to find rational solutions that satisfy the equation \(8 \times x = 26\). 

Let's write a Python program that searches over rational numbers with small numerator and denominator to find possible solutions, streaming each candidate as soon as we discover it, and then identifies the exact solution \(x = 26/8 = 13/4\). We'll limit the numerator and denominator to small values to ensure efficiency and manageable output.

```python
# Search for rational solutions to 8 * x = 26 with small numerator/denominator
max_value = 20  # limit for numerator and denominator for efficiency
for numerator in range(-max_value, max_value + 1):
    for denominator in range(1, max_value + 1):
        if numerator * 8 == 26 * denominator:
            # Found a rational solution
            x = numerator / denominator
            print(f"Found candidate: {numerator}/{denominator} = {x}")
```
