The problem asks to count the number of 3-element (or larger) subsets of {0, 1, 2, ..., 9} (represented as Fin 10) that contain three consecutive elements modulo 10, i.e., a sequence x, x+1, x+2 mod 10, with the element x inside the subset s, along with its two neighbors x+1 and x+2.

To tackle this, we enumerate all subsets s of size n (where n ≥ 3), and count those containing some triplet of consecutive numbers modulo 10. The key constraining conditions are:

- Subset size at least 3.
- Contains a triplet x, x+1, x+2 mod 10.

Our goal: Count all such subsets, including the minimal subsets of size 3 that meet the condition, and larger sets that contain such triplets.

Since the total number of subsets is manageable for small n, but directly enumerating all is expensive, we focus on all triplets x (from 0 to 9). For each triplet, count extensions of the minimal triplet by adding other elements arbitrarily, i.e., for any subset containing the triplet, the remaining elements can be freely included or not.

Implement an enumeration over all triplets of consecutive elements modulo 10. For each such triplet, count the number of supersets that include the triplet—these are all subsets that contain these three elements plus any subset of the remaining 7 elements.

The total count is the sum over all such triplets, but to avoid double-counting, since some subsets may contain multiple triplets, we need to note that the problem asks for the total number of subsets satisfying the condition, i.e., count each subset once.

Thus, the approach is:

- Generate all subsets of size ≥ 3 that contain at least one consecutive triplet.
- To avoid double counting, generate all such subsets directly and count them once.

Given the manageable size, we can generate all subsets of {0,...,9} of size ≥ 3, check if they contain any triplet of consecutive elements modulo 10, and count them.

Here's the Python program to enumerate:

```python
# Import itertools for subset generation
import itertools

def contains_consecutive_triplet(s):
    # Check if s contains any consecutive triplet mod 10
    for x in range(10):
        triplet = {(x + i) % 10 for i in range(3)}
        if triplet.issubset(s):
            return True
    return False

count = 0
# Generate all subsets of {0,...,9} with size >= 3
for r in range(3, 11):
    for subset in itertools.combinations(range(10), r):
        s = set(subset)
        if contains_consecutive_triplet(s):
            print(sorted(s))
            count += 1

print("Total subsets satisfying the condition:", count)
```
