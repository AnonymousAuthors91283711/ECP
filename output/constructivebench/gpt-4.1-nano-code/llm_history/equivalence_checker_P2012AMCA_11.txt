Ground Truth Answer: 5/72
Proposed Answer: (1/6) * (1/2)^3 * (1/3)^2 * (2/3)^1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is calculating a multinomial probability with:
   - n = 6 total trials
   - k = [3, 2, 1] counts for outcomes A, M, C
   - p = [1/2, 2/3*(1/2), 1/3*(1/2)] = [1/2, 1/3, 1/6] probabilities

2. The multinomial coefficient is:
   6!/(3!2!1!) = 720/(6*2*1) = 60

3. The probability part is:
   (1/2)³ * (1/3)² * (1/6)¹

4. Total probability:
   60 * (1/8) * (1/9) * (1/6) = 60/432 = 5/36

However, the proposed answer is:
(1/6) * (1/2)^3 * (1/3)^2 * (2/3)^1

This doesn't match because:
1. It's missing the multinomial coefficient (60)
2. The last term should be (1/6)^1 not (2/3)^1
3. The leading 1/6 is incorrect

The ground truth answer 5/72 is correct (5/36 was my miscalculation - actually 60/432 = 5/36 = 10/72, not 5/72).

But regardless, the proposed answer is completely different in structure and value.
