This problem involves computing the factorial of 100 modulo 101. Since 101 is a prime number, Wilson's theorem applies: (p-1)! ≡ -1 mod p. Specifically, for p = 101, we have:
(100)! ≡ -1 mod 101, which is equivalent to 100 mod 101 because -1 ≡ 100 mod 101.

Therefore, the answer is 100, and we can verify this computation directly.

Here's a Python program to enumerate factorials modulo 101 from 1! up to 100! to confirm this result. We will print each intermediate factorial modulo 101 as we compute it, and then output the final result.

```python
# Verify factorial of 100 modulo 101 using enumeration
MOD = 101
factorial_mod = 1
for i in range(1, 101):
    factorial_mod = (factorial_mod * i) % MOD
    print(f"{i}! mod {MOD} = {factorial_mod}")
print(f"100! mod {MOD} = {factorial_mod}")  # Should match the theorem result, expected 100
```
