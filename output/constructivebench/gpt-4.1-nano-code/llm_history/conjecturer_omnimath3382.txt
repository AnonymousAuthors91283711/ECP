  omnimath3382_answer k = 1/6 + 1/(3 * (-2)^k) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: k=1: 0.0
k=2: 0.25
k=3: 0.125
k=4: 0.1875
k=5: 0.15625
k=6: 0.171875
k=7: 0.1640625
k=8: 0.16796875
k=9: 0.166015625
k=10: 0.1669921875. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℝ
Based on the pattern of enumerated answers, which oscillate around 1/6 and involve powers of -2, the formula appears to be a geometric series sum converging to 1/6 with the correction term 1/(3 * (-2)^k). The general function matches the pattern:

<<<fun k => 1/6 + 1 / (3 * (-2) ^ k)>>>
