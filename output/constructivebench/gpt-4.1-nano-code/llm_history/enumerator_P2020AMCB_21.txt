This problem involves identifying natural numbers \( n \) such that \( 0 < n \) and the real number \( \frac{n}{n+1} \) is an integer (since the floor equals the number itself). Since \( n \) is a positive integer, analyze the equation:

\[
\frac{n}{n+1} = k, \quad \text{where } k \in \mathbb{Z}
\]

Given that:

\[
\frac{n}{n+1} = \frac{n+1 - 1}{n+1} = 1 - \frac{1}{n+1}
\]

This is always less than 1 for \( n > 0 \), and approaches 1 from below as \( n \to \infty \). The only possible integer value of \( \frac{n}{n+1} \) is when it's exactly 0 or 1.

- It's never 1 because:

\[
\frac{n}{n+1} < 1
\]

- Is it zero? No, since:

\[
\frac{n}{n+1} > 0
\]

- For it to be an integer, the only possibility is \( \frac{n}{n+1} = 0 \), but this can't happen for positive \( n \). The other possible integer is 1, which isn't attained.

Therefore, the only values satisfying the floor condition are when the number is already an integer. Since

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{n+1} \right\rfloor = 0, \quad \text{for all } n \ge 1,
\]

and

\[
\frac{n}{n+1} < 1,
\]

the condition for equality:

\[
\frac{n}{n+1} = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{n+1} \right\rfloor
\]

is only true when the fraction equals 0, which it doesn't for positive \( n \).

But the most interesting case is when the floor value equals the number itself, i.e., the number is an integer. Since all these fractions are strictly between 0 and 1, the only way for the floor to equal the number is if the number is 0, which isn't the case for \( n > 0 \). But the prompt wants solutions where the floor equals the number itself for \( \frac{n}{n+1} \).

Thus, for positive \( n \), the only way the floor of \( \frac{n}{n+1} \) equals \( \frac{n}{n+1} \) is when \( \frac{n}{n+1} \) is an integer. Since \( \frac{n}{n+1} \) is always less than 1 and positive, the only possibility is if the value equals 0, which is impossible for \( n > 0 \). Either way, mathematically, no such \( n \) exists, but for the purpose of enumeration, we can check positive \( n \) values up to some small limit.

Let's do that: check \( n \) from 1 to 10, see which satisfy the condition, and output the matching \( n \) when the floor equals the value.

```python
# Enumerate positive integers and check when floor(n/(n+1)) == n/(n+1)
# Since n/(n+1) is always <1 for n>0, the only way for the floor to equal n/(n+1) is if both are 0, which is impossible.
# Still, we check for cases where the floor equals the number.

answers = []
for n in range(1, 11):
    val = n / (n + 1)
    floor_val = int(val)  # floor of val
    if floor_val == val:
        print(f"n={n}: value={val}, floor={floor_val}")
        answers.append(n)

# The set of all such n.
abbrev_answer = set(answers)
print("Answer set:", abbrev_answer)
```
