Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {p : ℕ × ℕ | p.1 ≥ 3 ∧ p.2 = p.1 + 1}

The proposed answer suggests that the solution set consists of pairs where the second component is exactly one more than the first, and the first component is at least 3. While this does satisfy the given recurrence relation for Fibonacci numbers (as implied by hF1 and hFn), it's not complete. The problem allows for other pairs that might satisfy the equation 5*F(p.1) - 3*F(p.2) = 1. The proposed answer captures some solutions but not necessarily all possible ones, hence it's partially correct but incomplete.
