theorem olympiadbench2610 (w : ℝ) (hw : w > 0) :
    (∫ x in (0)..w, (⌈x⌉ : ℝ)^2) = 20 * sqrt 7 → ⌈2 * w⌉ = olympiadbench2610_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: w ≈ 4.90, integral = 52.5000
w ≈ 4.91, integral = 52.7500
w ≈ 4.92, integral = 53.0000
w ≈ 4.93, integral = 53.2500
For w ≈ 4.90, ⌈2w⌉ = 10
For w ≈ 4.91, ⌈2w⌉ = 10
For w ≈ 4.92, ⌈2w⌉ = 10
For w ≈ 4.93, ⌈2w⌉ = 10. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the integral's approximate value and the pattern in the enumerated data, when the integral equals 20 * sqrt 7 (≈ 52.915), w is just over 4.91, so ⌈2w⌉ remains 10. The pattern indicates that for the integral value close to that, ⌈2w⌉ = 10. Therefore, the final answer, in a closed form, is the constant 10.
