theorem omnimath2710
(x y : ℝ)
(h1 : (x - y) / (x + y) = 9)
(h2 : (x * y) / (x + y) = -60)
: (x + y) + (x - y) + x * y = omnimath2710_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: -150
. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The equations suggest x and y satisfy a linear system; combining h1 and h2 yields quadratic relations. Given the symmetry, the expression simplifies to a constant. The numeric observation from enumerated answers indicates the value is -150.
