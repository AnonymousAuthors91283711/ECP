This problem appears to involve combinatorics on a 9x9 grid with conditions related to even cardinalities of certain relations. Given the complexity and to assist in conjecturing, we will enumerate small candidate values for the cardinality and check the conditions for specific sample subsets. Without the formal proof, we aim to produce possible counts matching the described set conditions, which involve intricate set relations.

Our approach:
- Fix small sample values for the grid (for example, examine subsets of coordinates).
- Count the number of such subsets where the number of related pairs under the specified conditions is even.
- Stream each candidate answer until the possible range is exhausted.

The program will:
- Generate all subsets of the 81 positions (9x9 grid).
- For each subset, count the related pairs satisfying the conditions.
- Output the subset sizes where the count of related pairs is even.
- Limit enumeration for efficiency.

```python
import itertools

# Generate all positions in a 9x9 grid
positions = [(i, j) for i in range(9) for j in range(9)]

# Function to count related pairs satisfying the conditions
def count_related_pairs(s_set):
    count = 0
    for (s1, s2) in itertools.product(s_set, repeat=2):
        a, b = s1
        c, d = s2
        condition1 = a <= c and b <= d
        condition2 = c <= a and d <= b
        # For relation, we consider pairs where one relation is "less or equal" in both coordinates
        if condition1 or condition2:
            count += 1
    return count

# Generate all subsets up to size 3 for manageability
max_size = 3
for size in range(1, max_size + 1):
    for subset_coords in itertools.combinations(positions, size):
        s_set = list(subset_coords)
        pair_count = count_related_pairs(s_set)
        if pair_count % 2 == 0:
            print(f"Subset size: {size}, related pairs count: {pair_count}, subset: {s_set}")
```

This code enumerates small subsets and prints those with an even number of related pairs, helping in formulating the exact set condition.
