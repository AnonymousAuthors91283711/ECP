This problem involves finding the smallest natural number \( n \) such that \( 0 < n \) and \( \frac{1}{2^n} < T \), where \( T = \frac{1}{6084} \). The goal is to enumerate possible \( n \) values to identify the least \( n \) satisfying the inequality.

Here's the reasoning:
- Since \( T = 1/6084 \), we need to find the smallest \( n \) with \( 1/2^n < 1/6084 \).
- Equivalently, find \( n \) satisfying \( 2^n > 6084 \).
- We'll start from \( n=1 \) upwards, compute \( 2^n \), compare to 6084, and output the first \( n \) where \( 2^n > 6084 \).

This approach efficiently enumerates the candidates without overcomputation.

```python
# Enumerate n starting from 1 upwards until 2^n > 6084
# Since 2^n is monotonic, we can stop once the condition is met
n = 1
threshold = 6084
while True:
    power_of_two = 2 ** n
    print(f"n = {n}, 2^n = {power_of_two}")  # stream answers
    if power_of_two > threshold:
        print(f"Least n where 2^n > {threshold} is {n}")
        break
    n += 1
```
