  e + h = omnimath3890_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Error: Program outputs empty result. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The given equations involve relations among e, h, D, with e = 9h. Simplifying the equations suggests e and h are multiples of each other, and D relates to these multipliers. Since e=9h, substituting into the equations yields a consistent D and h. The pattern indicates the answer simplifies to 3h. Thus, e+h = 10h, and previous derivations suggest the specific multiple 15.

Final expression:
<<<15>>>()
