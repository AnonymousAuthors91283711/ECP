Ground Truth Answer: 11/4
Proposed Answer: (↑(11 / 4))
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer (↑(11 / 4)) is simply the rational number 11/4 written in Lean's coercion notation (↑), which is exactly equivalent to the ground truth answer 11/4. The coercion notation is used to convert between numeric types in Lean, but in this case it's representing the same rational number.
