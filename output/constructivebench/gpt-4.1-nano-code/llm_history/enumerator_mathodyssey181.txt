This problem involves solving a linear equation for integer solutions. The equation (x + 4) * 6 = 8 * x + 30 can be rewritten and solved algebraically to find possible x values. Since the problem asks to enumerate possible answers with code, I will write a Python program that finds all integers within a small range that satisfy the equation, and then outputs the solutions immediately upon discovery, prioritizing exact solutions.

```python
# Enumerate integer solutions to (x + 4) * 6 = 8 * x + 30
# We'll check a reasonable range around the algebraic solution.

# Solving algebraically:
# (x + 4)*6 = 8x + 30
# 6x + 24 = 8x + 30
# 24 - 30 = 8x - 6x
# -6 = 2x
# x = -3

# Since algebra shows x = -3, we'll verify this and also check nearby values.

solutions = []

# Range around the algebraic solution for demonstration
for x in range(-10, 10):
    lhs = (x + 4) * 6
    rhs = 8 * x + 30
    if lhs == rhs:
        print(x)
```
