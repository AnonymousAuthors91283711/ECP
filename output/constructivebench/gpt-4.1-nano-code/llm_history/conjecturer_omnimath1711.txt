. Enumerated answers: Verification candidate: x=-2.5, y=-3, z=-1.5, sum=-7.0
Confirmed sum candidates: [-7.0]. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the equations:
x = y + z + 2,  
y = z + x + 1,  
z = x + y + 4,

substituting and solving yields the consistent sum x + y + z. The pattern from the candidate suggests the sum equals -7.0.  
Final sum: <<<(-7)>>>, which is -7 in Lean notation.
