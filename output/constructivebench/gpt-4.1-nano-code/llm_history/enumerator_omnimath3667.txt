The problem involves finding quadruples \((p, q, a, b)\) of positive integers satisfying \( p > 0, q > 0, a > 1, b > 0 \), with \( p, q \) prime, and the equation \( p^a = 1 + 5 q^b \). This is a typical exponential Diophantine equation with prime constraints.

To assist in conjecturing solutions, I will:
- Choose small prime candidates for \( p \) and \( q \).
- Vary \( a \) and \( b \) within manageable bounds.
- Check whether \( p^a = 1 + 5 q^b \).
- Stream solutions immediately upon discovery.

```python
# Enumerate small primes for p and q
primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23]

# Set bounds for exponents
max_a = 10
max_b = 10

for p in primes:
    for q in primes:
        for a in range(2, max_a + 1):  # a > 1
            for b in range(1, max_b + 1):  # b > 0
                val = p ** a
                target = 1 + 5 * (q ** b)
                if val == target:
                    print((p, q, a, b))
```
