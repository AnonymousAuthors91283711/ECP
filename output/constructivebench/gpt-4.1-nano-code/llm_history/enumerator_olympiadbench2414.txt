The problem involves computing the sum of the floor of (k+1)/3 for k from 0 to 59, i.e., summing ⌊(k+1)/3⌋ for k=0..59. This can be simplified by recognizing the pattern of the floors as k+1 runs from 1 to 60, and analyzing the sum over that range. 

Each value of ⌊(k+1)/3⌋ repeats in intervals of length 3: for (m)*3 to (m)*3+2, the value is m. We can compute the total sum by summing over these intervals and counting how many terms in each interval contribute.

Since this problem entails enumeration and streaming, we'll compute for m=0..19 because 3*20=60, covering all values for (k+1) in 1..60.

Here's an efficient way to code this:

```python
# Enumerate and compute sum of floors for (k+1)/3 from k=0..59
# The sequence (k+1)/3 for k=0..59 is from 1/3 to 60/3=20

def sum_floor_division(limit=60, divisor=3):
    total = 0
    max_m = limit // divisor  # 20 in this case
    for m in range(max_m):
        count = divisor  # 3 terms in each full interval, except possibly last
        total += m * count
        print(total)  # Stream partial results
    return total

answer = sum_floor_division()
print("Answer:", answer)

# For verification, expected sum can be computed directly:
# sum_{k=0}^{59} floor((k+1)/3) = sum_{m=0}^{19} m * number of terms with value m
# which is sum_{m=0}^{19} m * 3 = 3 * sum_{m=0}^{19} m = 3 * (19*20/2) = 3 * 190 = 570
# But note that for m=19, only the last term is for k=58,59, so last interval is full.
# So total sum = 570.

# Let's check with explicit code:
total_check = 0
for k in range(60):
    total_check += (k+1)//3
print("Verified total:", total_check)
```

This code streams partial sums per interval, computes total, and includes verification.
