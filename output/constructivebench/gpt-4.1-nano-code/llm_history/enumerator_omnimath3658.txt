The problem appears to involve finding all integer triples \((a, b, c)\) satisfying the equation:

\[ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = a^2 \cdot b^2 \]

This is a Diophantine-style problem where we need to examine integer solutions. Because the full set might be infinite or large, and the problem is complex, I will restrict to small integers in order to enumerate solutions.

The plan:
- Iterate over small integers for \(a, b, c\) within, say, \(-10\) to \(10\).
- Check the equation and output solutions immediately when they satisfy the condition.
- Collect solutions in a set for completeness.
- Print each solution upon discovery to meet immediate output criteria.

This approach allows us to find potential solutions without exhaustive search over large ranges and can help in formulating conjectures about the solutions.

```python
# Enumerate solutions to the equation a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = a^2 * b^2 over small integers
solutions = set()
for a in range(-10, 11):
    for b in range(-10, 11):
        # Avoid division by zero or degenerate cases if needed
        # but the equation is always defined for integer a, b, c
        for c in range(-10, 11):
            left = a**2 + b**2 + c**2
            right = a**2 * b**2
            if left == right:
                solution = (a, b, c)
                if solution not in solutions:
                    print(solution)
                    solutions.add(solution)
```
