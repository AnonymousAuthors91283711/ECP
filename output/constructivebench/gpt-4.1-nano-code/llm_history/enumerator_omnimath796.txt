The problem asks to find the number of real solutions x to the equation:

\[ |\ |\ |\ |x| - 2| - 2| - 2| = |\ |\ |\ |x| - 3| - 3| - 3| \]

We need to analyze the nested absolute value expressions and find all possible solutions.

Approach:
- Since the equation involves absolute values of |x| shifted by 2 and 3, it makes sense to analyze the equation in terms of \( t = |x| \geq 0 \).
- Rewrite the problem in terms of t, then check values of t where the expressions change form (like at t=2 and t=3), to find solutions.

```python
# Enumerate possible t values at critical points: 0, 2, 3, and beyond,
# since absolute value expressions change form at these points.
import math

def absolute(x):
    return abs(x)

# Break down the nested expressions:
# L(t) = | | | t - 2 | - 2 | - 2 |
# R(t) = | | | t - 3 | - 3 | - 3 |

# For t in [0, ∞), evaluate L(t) and R(t) piecewise at critical points.

def L(t):
    return abs(abs(abs(t - 2) - 2) - 2)

def R(t):
    return abs(abs(abs(t - 3) - 3) - 3)

# To find solutions to L(t) == R(t), analyze segments:
# At t = 0, 2, 3, and very large t.
# Since the functions are piecewise linear inside absolute values, check at critical points and around them.
candidate_t_values = [0, 2, 3]

# Also, consider points where inner absolute values hit zero: t=2 and t=3.
# We can check values slightly less and greater pass these points to find approximate solutions.

solutions = []

# Check for each candidate t in candidate_t_values
for t in candidate_t_values:
    if math.isclose(L(t), R(t), rel_tol=1e-9):
        solutions.append(t)

# Check points around critical points to find other solutions
for delta in [-0.0001, 0, 0.0001]:
    for t0 in [2, 3]:
        t_test = t0 + delta
        if t_test >= 0:
            if math.isclose(L(t_test), R(t_test), rel_tol=1e-9):
                solutions.append(t_test)

# Also, check at very large t, where absolute value expressions tend to stabilize
# For large t, |t - c| ≈ t - c, so:
# L(t) ≈ | |t - 2| - 2 | - 2
# For large t, |t - 2| ≈ t - 2
# So, L(t) ≈ |(t - 2) - 2| - 2 = |t - 4| - 2
# Similarly, R(t) ≈ |t - 6| - 3
# So, for large t, the equation reduces to |t - 4| - 2 = |t - 6| - 3
# Solve for t:
# |t - 4| - 2 = |t - 6| - 3
# |t - 4| - |t - 6| = -1
# For t >=6: (t - 4) - (t - 6) = -1 → 2 = -1 (no)
# For t in [4,6], |t - 4| = t - 4, and |t - 6| = 6 - t
# (t - 4) - (6 - t) = -1 → t - 4 - 6 + t = -1 → 2t - 10 = -1 → 2t= 9 → t=4.5
# Check t=4.5 explicitly:
if math.isclose(L(4.5), R(4.5), rel_tol=1e-9):
    solutions.append(4.5)

# Remove duplicates and keep solutions
solutions = list(set(solutions))
solutions.sort()

# Since |x|=t, solutions for x are ±t (except at t=0 where x=0)
# Collect all x solutions
x_solutions = set()
for t in solutions:
    if t == 0:
        x_solutions.add(0.0)
    else:
        x_solutions.add(t)
        x_solutions.add(-t)

# Print solutions
for sol in sorted(x_solutions):
    print(f"x = {sol}")
```
