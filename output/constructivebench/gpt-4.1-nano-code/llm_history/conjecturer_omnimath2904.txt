theorem omnimath2904 : 
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | 20 < n ∧ 
  13 + (n - 20) / 4 = n / 2 ∧ 
  (n - 20) % 4 = 0} omnimath2904_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 32. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The given conditions imply (n - 20) divisible by 4 and that 13 + (n - 20)/4 = n/2. Simplifying, this yields n = 32 as the unique minimal n satisfying these equations. Therefore, the answer is 32.
