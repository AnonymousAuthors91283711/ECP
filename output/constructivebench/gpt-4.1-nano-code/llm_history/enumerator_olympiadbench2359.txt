The problem involves finding a unique real number \( x \) such that:

- \( x > 0 \),
- \( x \times \lfloor x \rfloor = 17 \),
- and \( x \) equals some answer.

Since the floor function \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) is an integer \(k\), the equation becomes:

\[ x \times k = 17 \implies x = \frac{17}{k} \]

Given \( x > 0 \), \(k > 0\), and \(k\) an integer, we can search over small positive integers \(k\). For each \(k\), check if \(x = 17/k\) satisfies the conditions (i.e., that \(\lfloor x \rfloor = k\)). 

- Since \(\lfloor x \rfloor = k\), and \( x = 17/k \), the condition is \(k = \lfloor 17/k \rfloor\).

We'll enumerate candidate \(k\) values, check the condition, and pick the unique \(x\).

```python
# Enumerate positive integer values for k
for k in range(1, 20):  # small range for efficiency
    x = 17 / k
    if x > 0 and int(x) == k:  # check if floor(x) == k
        print(f"Found x={x} for k={k}")
        # Since the theorem states there is a unique such x, stop here
        olympiadbench2359_answer = x
        print(f"Answer: {x}")
        break
```
