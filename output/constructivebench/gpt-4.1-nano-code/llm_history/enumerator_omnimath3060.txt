Let's analyze the problem:

- We are asked to find the number of pairs `(p.1, p.2)` with:
  - `p.1` in [1, 100]
  - `p.2` in [101, 205]
- such that `(3^{p.1} + 7^{p.2}) % 10 = 0`.
- The goal is to enumerate all such pairs, stream results, and find the total count.

Observations:
- The last digit pattern (mod 10) of powers of 3 and 7 is periodic.
- Period of 3^n mod 10 is 4:
  - 3^1 ≡ 3
  - 3^2 ≡ 9
  - 3^3 ≡ 7
  - 3^4 ≡ 1
  - then repeats.
- Period of 7^n mod 10 is 4:
  - 7^1 ≡ 7
  - 7^2 ≡ 9
  - 7^3 ≡ 3
  - 7^4 ≡ 1
  - then repeats.

We can precompute these cycles, then check all pairs `(p.1, p.2)` efficiently.

Here's the Python code implementing this logic:

```python
# Enumerate last digits of powers based on repeating cycles
def last_digit_power(base, exponent):
    cycle = {
        3: [3, 9, 7, 1],
        7: [7, 9, 3, 1]
    }
    # Determine position in cycle
    index = (exponent - 1) % 4
    return cycle[base][index]

count = 0
# Precompute last digits for powers of 3 and 7
# because cycles repeat every 4
for p1 in range(1, 101):
    last_3 = last_digit_power(3, p1)
    for p2 in range(101, 206):
        last_7 = last_digit_power(7, p2)
        total_mod = (last_3 + last_7) % 10
        if total_mod == 0:
            print(f"Pair: ({p1}, {p2})")
            count += 1

print("Total pairs:", count)
```

This enumerates all pairs efficiently, streaming partial results immediately when a pair matches.
