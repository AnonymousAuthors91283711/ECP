This problem appears to involve specific relationships between variables g, y, r, and total, with given constraints such as divisibility and sum conditions. The goal is to find the value of `omnimath3100_answer`, which seems to depend on the total and the given relationships.

Since the relationships specify that g, y, r are multiples of total / 9, and the sum of g and y is 63, we can iterate over possible total values divisible by 9, compute candidate g, y, r values, check constraints, and identify the answer accordingly.

Here's a Python program to enumerate candidate total values and associated g, y, r, streaming partial answers, limited to reasonable search bounds for efficiency:

```python
# To assist in understanding, we will assume the relationships:
# g = 3 * (total // 9)
# y = 4 * (total // 9)
# r = 2 * (total // 9)
# total divisible by 9
# g + y = 63

for total in range(9, 1000, 9):  # total ranges from 9 up to a limit, stepping by 9 for divisibility
    g = 3 * (total // 9)
    y = 4 * (total // 9)
    r = 2 * (total // 9)
    
    # Check if g + y equals 63
    if g + y == 63:
        # Output the parameters and the computed answer
        answer = r  # Based on the relations, r is directly computed
        print(f"total={total}, g={g}, y={y}, r={r}, answer={answer}")
```
