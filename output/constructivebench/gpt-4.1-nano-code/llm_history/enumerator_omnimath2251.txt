This problem involves solving a system of three equations involving real variables x, y, z:

1) xy + z = 40  
2) xz + y = 51  
3) x + y + z = 19

To find all solutions, we can express z from the third equation, substitute into the first two, and search for rational candidate solutions. Since the variables are real, and the problem likely expects us to enumerate candidate solutions, we'll try small rational values for x and y and compute z accordingly. We focus on small integers or rational numbers within a reasonable range to find solutions.

The plan:
- Iterate over small values for x and y.
- Compute z from the third equation: z = 19 - x - y.
- Check if this z satisfies the first two equations.
- If yes, print the solution immediately.

This brute-force enumeration should be efficient enough given small ranges.

Here's the Python code implementing this approach:

```python
# Enumerate candidate solutions for the system:
# xy + z = 40
# xz + y = 51
# x + y + z = 19

# We'll test small rational values of x and y within -20 to 20,
# and compute z accordingly, then check the constraints.

for x_num in range(-20, 21):
    for y_num in range(-20, 21):
        x = x_num
        y = y_num
        z = 19 - x - y  # from the third equation
        # Check equations 1 and 2
        if abs(x * y + z - 40) < 1e-6 and abs(x * z + y - 51) < 1e-6:
            print((x, y, z))
```
