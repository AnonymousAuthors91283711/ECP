The problem involves understanding the set of real numbers \( z = x'^2 - 6x' + y'^2 \) for all \( x', y' \) satisfying \( |x' + y'| + |x' - y'| = 2 \), under the condition on \( x, y \). The goal is to find the greatest such \( z \).

- The constraint \( |x' + y'| + |x' - y'| = 2 \) describes a specific region in the \( (x', y') \) plane.  
- For different signs of \( x' + y' \) and \( x' - y' \), the equation reduces to linear segments forming a diamond shape.  
- To find the maximum \( z = x'^2 - 6x' + y'^2 \), analyze these boundary conditions.

Let's parametrize boundary lines:
- When \( x' + y' = 2 \), the constraint reduces to \( 2 + |x'- y'| = 2 \Rightarrow |x'- y'|=0 \Rightarrow x' = y' \).
- When \( x' + y' = -2 \), similarly \( x' = - y' \).
- When \( x' - y' = 2 \), \( |x'+ y'| = 0 \Rightarrow x' = - y' \).
- When \( x' - y' = -2 \), \( x' = y' \).

Thus, points satisfy:
- \( x' = y' \) with \( x' + y' = \pm 2 \Rightarrow 2x' = \pm 2 \Rightarrow x' = \pm 1 \), \( y' = \pm 1 \).
- \( x' = - y' \) with \( x' - y' = \pm 2 \Rightarrow 2x' = \pm 2 \Rightarrow x' = \pm 1 \), \( y' = - x' \).

Vertices:
- \( (1,1) \), \( (-1,-1) \), \( (1,-1) \), \( (-1,1) \).

The function \( z = x'^2 - 6x' + y'^2 \) is quadratic, with a minimum at \( x' = 3 \), \( y' = 0 \). Since the vertices are near \( (-1, \pm1) \), the maximum occurs at the vertices or along edges.

Evaluating:
- At \( (1, 1) \):
  \( 1 -6(1) + 1 = 1 -6 + 1 = -4 \)
- At \( (-1, -1) \):
  \( 1 +6 + 1= 8 \)
- At \( (1, -1) \):
  \( 1 - 6(1) + 1 = -4 \)
- At \( (-1, 1) \):
  \( 1 + 6 + 1= 8 \)

Maximum \( z \) is 8 at \( (-1, -1) \) and \( (-1, 1) \).

Since the maximum is achieved at these boundary points, the greatest \( z \) value is 8.

Now, we'll write code to verify these boundary points and find this maximum programmatically.

```python
# Enumerate boundary points and find the maximum value of z = x'^2 - 6 x' + y'^2
# Given the boundary conditions, check vertices and possibly other boundary points.

points = [
    (1, 1),
    (-1, -1),
    (1, -1),
    (-1, 1)
]

max_z = None
max_points = []

for (x, y) in points:
    z = x**2 - 6*x + y**2
    print(f"Point ({x}, {y}) yields z = {z}")
    if (max_z is None) or (z > max_z):
        max_z = z
        max_points = [(x, y)]
    elif z == max_z:
        max_points.append((x, y))

print(f"Maximum z = {max_z} occurs at points: {max_points}")
```
