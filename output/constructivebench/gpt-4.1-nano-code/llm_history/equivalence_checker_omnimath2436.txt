Ground Truth Answer: -18
Proposed Answer: 0
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the least value of a sum of quadratic expressions evaluated at four points forming a unit square (p1 to p4).

2. The expressions being summed are identical for each point: x² + 2x + y² + 4y.

3. The ground truth answer is -18, which suggests that after expanding and simplifying, the minimum value of the total sum is -18.

4. The proposed answer is 0, which would be the value if we simply evaluated all expressions at (0,0), but this doesn't consider the optimization aspect of the problem.

5. To verify, let's compute the sum:
   - For p1: x² + 2x + y² + 4y
   - For p2: (x+1)² + 2(x+1) + y² + 4y
   - For p3: (x+1)² + 2(x+1) + (y+1)² + 4(y+1)
   - For p4: x² + 2x + (y+1)² + 4(y+1)

6. Summing all four gives:
   4x² + 8x + 4y² + 12y + 8
   = 4(x² + 2x) + 4(y² + 3y) + 8

7. Completing the squares:
   = 4[(x+1)² - 1] + 4[(y+1.5)² - 2.25] + 8
   = 4(x+1)² + 4(y+1.5)² - 4 - 9 + 8
   = 4(x+1)² + 4(y+1.5)² - 5

8. The minimum occurs when x=-1 and y=-1.5, giving -5. But this contradicts the ground truth answer of -18, suggesting there might be an error in the problem statement or ground truth answer.

However, based on the given information:
- The proposed answer (0) is clearly not equivalent to the ground truth answer (-18)
- The ground truth answer itself seems questionable based on our calculation
