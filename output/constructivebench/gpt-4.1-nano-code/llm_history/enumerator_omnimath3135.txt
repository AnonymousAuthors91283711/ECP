This problem involves analyzing the set \( S = \{-3, -1, 0, 2, 4\} \) and counting pairs \((a, b)\) with \(a \neq b\) where \(a \times b = 0\). We need to compute the ratio of such pairs to all possible pairs with \(a \neq b\).

Key observations:
- Zero product occurs only when either \(a = 0\) or \(b = 0\).
- Count pairs involving 0, ensuring \(a \neq b\).
- Total pairs with \(a \neq b\): total ordered pairs minus pairs where \(a = b\).

Let's enumerate candidates with small sets and perform the calculations.

```python
# Enumeration of elements in S
S = [-3, -1, 0, 2, 4]

# Count total pairs (a, b) with a != b
total_pairs = 0
favorable_pairs = 0

for a in S:
    for b in S:
        if a != b:
            total_pairs += 1
            # Favorable if product is zero
            if a * b == 0:
                favorable_pairs += 1
                print(f"Favorable pair: ({a}, {b})")  # Stream partial results as they are found

# Output total counts
print(f"Total pairs (a != b): {total_pairs}")
print(f"Favorable pairs (product=0): {favorable_pairs}")

# Compute ratio
ratio = favorable_pairs / total_pairs
print(f"Ratio of favorable pairs to total pairs: {ratio}")
```
