The problem appears to involve finding the smallest `n` such that for any function `f : Fin n â†’ Fin 17` with positive `f(i).val`, there exist `p`, `x`, and `y` with `x.val > y.val` and the inequality `118 * x.val â‰¤ 119 * y.val`, where `f x = p` and `f y = p`. This resembles a pigeonhole principle with a ratio condition, involving some kind of mononicity or crossing point guarantee.

Given the structure, a typical approach is:
- Try small values of `n`.
- For each, check the condition for all functions `f`.
- When the condition always holds, record that `n`.
- Stop at the minimal such `n`.

For demonstration, we'll check small values starting from 1 upwards, enumerate all functions with the given restrictions, and stop when the required property always holds. To prevent excessive combinatorial explosion, we limit `n` to a manageable size (like 20).

Here's a Python program that performs a brute-force search over small `n`, enumerates all functions `f`, and tests whether the property holds:

```python
from itertools import product

# For small n, functions are mappings from {0,...,n-1} to {1,...,17}
# We are seeking the smallest n such that for all such functions with all f(i) > 0,
# there exist x,y, p satisfying the given conditions.

def check_property(n):
    # Generate all functions f: [0, n-1] -> [1,..,17]
    for f_vals in product(range(1, 18), repeat=n):
        f = list(f_vals)
        # For each function, check if the property holds for all pairs
        # The property is: There exist x,y,p with:
        # x > y, f x = p, f y = p, and 118 * x > 119 * y
        # or, equivalently, there's a pair with the specified conditions
        # since the problem states the property should always hold,
        # we verify that for every function, such a pair exists.
        pairs_found = False
        for x in range(n):
            for y in range(n):
                if x != y and f[x] == f[y]:
                    # Check the ratio condition: x > y and 118*x <= 119*y
                    if x > y and 118 * (x+1) <= 119 * (y+1):
                        pairs_found = True
                        break
            if pairs_found:
                break
        # If we find a function where the property does NOT hold, return False
        if not pairs_found:
            return False
    return True

n = 1
while n <= 20:
    if check_property(n):
        print(f"Answer n = {n}")
        break
    n += 1
else:
    print("No answer found up to n=20")
```

This code:
- Checks `n` from 1 to 20.
- For each `n`, enumerates all functions `f`.
- For each `f`, verifies that there exists `x, y, p` satisfying the conditions.
- Stops when it finds the minimal such `n`.

Adjust the upper limit as needed to improve accuracy or efficiency.
