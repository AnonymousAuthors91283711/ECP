Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The candidate values c are of the form -(1024 * k) with k not a sum of two cubes, and for each, both a and b are sums of two cubes, while c is not. The minimal such c is when k = 512, with c = -1024 * 512 = -524288, but since c must be positive, the least positive c fitting all criteria corresponds to the smallest k > 0 where c = 1024 * k and k isn't a sum of two cubes. From enumeration, the minimal positive c fitting the pattern is 524288. 

Final answer:

<<<524288>>>
