The problem models a complex combinatorial set \(S\) of pairs \((i, j)\) within certain constraints and asks for the size (cardinality) of the largest such set. The constraints include ordering, distinctness, bounded sum, and sum uniqueness. 

Key insights:
- Each pair \((i,j)\) satisfies \(i < j\), \(i, j \ge 1\), and \(i + j \le 2009\).
- The pairs in the set must be mutually distinct in all coordinates.
- The sums of pairs in the set are distinct.

To find the maximum size, consider:
- For each possible sum \(s = i + j\), how many pairs \((i,j)\) satisfy I: \(1 \le i < j\), and \(i + j = s\)?
- For fixed \(s\), the pairs are \((i, s-i)\) with \(i < s-i\), i.e., \(i < s/2\).

This is a classic problem of selecting maximum pairs with distinct sums that don't overlap in coordinates. To maximize the number of such pairs, a greedy approach:
- For each possible sum \(s\), take as many pairs as possible without sharing elements in coordinate sets, which corresponds to selecting pairs with unique \(i\) and unique \(j\).
- Since pairs with the same sum share a sum, and sums are distinct, no conflict occurs across different sum groups.

The optimal approach is to take all pairs with the smallest possible \(i\) for each sum \(s\), picking \(i = 1, 2, ..., \lfloor (s-1)/2 \rfloor\), provided that the total constraints on \(i+j \leq 2009\) hold. Because the sums are increasing, the maximum total number of pairs can be summed across all sums \(s\) from 3 up to 2008.

In particular:
- For each sum \(s\) from 3 to 2008, the number of valid pairs is \(\lfloor (s-1)/2 \rfloor\).

The total maximum number of pairs is then \(\sum_{s=3}^{2008} \lfloor (s-1)/2 \rfloor\).

Let's compute this sum efficiently.

```python
# Enumerate the maximum number of pairs (i,j) with sum s in [3..2008], i<j, i,j≥1, i+j ≤ 2009
# Since sum s ranges from 3 to 2008, for each s, count pairs with i<j and i+j=s and i<j
# i must satisfy 1≤i < s-i => 2i < s => i < s/2
# Also, i ≥ 1, and i < s - i, so i ranges from 1 to floor((s-1)/2)
total_pairs = 0
for s in range(3, 2009):
    max_i = (s - 1) // 2
    total_pairs += max_i
    print(f'Sum {s}: {max_i} pairs')
print(f'Total maximum number of pairs: {total_pairs}')
```
