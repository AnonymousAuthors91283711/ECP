abbrev omnimath3004_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath3004 : 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 = omnimath3004_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Cube of 1: 1
Cube of 2: 8
Cube of 3: 27
Cube of 4: 64
Sum of first 4 cubes: 100
. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The sum of the first n cubes is known to be (n(n+1)/2)^2. Applying n = 4 yields (4*5/2)^2 = (10)^2 = 100. 

<<<(4 * (4 + 1) / 2)^2>>>
