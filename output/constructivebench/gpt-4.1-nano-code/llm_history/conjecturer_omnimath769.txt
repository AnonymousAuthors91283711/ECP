. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
Based on the recursive relation and periodic boundary conditions, the sequence a(n) mod 2 resembles a Fibonacci-like pattern with period 60, resulting in the value 2 * a₁ + 4 * a₀. The only feasible sums, considering each a(n) is 0 or 1, are 0 through 7. The pattern indicates the sum 4 * a₀ + 2 * a₁ + a₂ equals 0 or 1, based on initial conditions. Therefore, the set of possible sums is {0, 1}.
