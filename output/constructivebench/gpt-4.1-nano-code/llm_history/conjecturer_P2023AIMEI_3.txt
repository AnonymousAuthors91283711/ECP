Based on the pattern of subtracting weighted combinations in the enumerated answer, and simplifying using binomial identities, the answer consolidates to the total number of pairs minus the weighted sum. The resulting closed form is:

<<<(n * (n - 1) / 2) - (3 * (t3 * (t3 - 1) / 2) + 4 * (t4 * (t4 - 1) / 2) + 5 * (t5 * (t5 - 1) / 2) + 6 * (t6 * (t6 - 1) / 2))>>>[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

. Enumerated Answers: t2 = 607. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The errors stem from referencing identifiers `n`, `t3`, `t4`, `t5`, and `t6` in an abbrev declaration without explicitly binding them first. In Lean, local variables like those in the theorem statement cannot be directly used inside abbrev unless they are parameters or explicitly threaded through. 

In the context of the problem, these variables are constants set in the theorem, so the answer is a closed-form expression derived from those constants. The typical pattern observed in the enumerated answers and the logic of the problem suggest that the answer should be a **fixed numerical value**, as `n=40`, `t3=3`, `t4=4`, `t5=5`, and `t6=6` are specific constants.

Given `t2 = choose n 2 - (3*choose t3 2 + 4*choose t4 2 + 5*choose t5 2 + 6*choose t6 2)`, and knowing `choose` returns natural numbers, the intended answer (according to the enumeration) is `607`.

To encode this correctly in Lean, without references to undefined variables, and since the answer is a constant number, we define:

<<<607>>>

This approach respects the constant values given and matches the enumerated answer thread, fixing the compilation errors caused by undefined identifiers.
