This problem involves summing over the integers from 1 to 18, where for each integer, if it's even, we add its cube; if it's odd, we subtract its cube. To assist in conjecturing and proving the answer, I'll write a Python script that brute-force enumerates the sum term-by-term, printing each partial or final answer. It won't assume anything about the result, only that it follows the pattern described.

```python
# Enumerate the sum over i in [1, 18], adding i^3 if i is even, subtracting if odd
total = 0
for i in range(1, 19):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        total += i ** 3
        print(f"Adding {i}^3 = {i ** 3}; sum so far: {total}")
    else:
        total -= i ** 3
        print(f"Subtracting {i}^3 = {i ** 3}; sum so far: {total}")

print(f"Final sum: {total}")
```
