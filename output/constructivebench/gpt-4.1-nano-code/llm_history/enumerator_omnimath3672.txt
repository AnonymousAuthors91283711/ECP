The problem defines a set of functions \(f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) satisfying the functional equation:

\[
f(x \cdot f y + y) + f(-f x) = f(y \cdot f x - y) + y
\]

Our goal is to explore possible solutions by testing specific functions, especially simple ones like linear functions \(f(x) = c x + d\), constant functions, and possibly others. We will generate candidate functions and verify whether they satisfy the functional equation. Since the problem is complex, enumerating straightforward functions is a good start for conjecturing.

We will:

- Test constant functions \(f(x) = c\).
- Test linear functions \(f(x) = c x\).
- Check whether these satisfy the functional equation for various \(x, y\).
- For computational feasibility, limit \(c\) to small integers (say -3 to 3).
- For each candidate, evaluate the equation at some sample points.

Let's implement this:

```python
# We will test constant and linear functions f(x) = c and f(x) = c*x
# for c in [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]

candidates_constant = [c for c in range(-3, 4)]
candidates_linear = [(c) for c in range(-3, 4)]

# Sample points for x and y
sample_points = [(0,0), (1,1), (-1,1), (0.5, -0.5), (2, -2)]

def check_constant(c):
    for x, y in sample_points:
        left = c + c
        right = c + y
        # f(x) = c, f(y) = c, f(-c) = c
        if left != right:
            return False
    return True

def check_linear(c):
    for x, y in sample_points:
        f_x = c * x
        f_y = c * y
        f_negf_x = c * (-f_x)
        lhs = c * (x * f_y + y) + c * (-f_x)
        rhs = c * (y * f_x - y) + y
        if abs(lhs - rhs) > 1e-8:
            return False
    return True

# Generate candidates and print them if they satisfy the equations
print("Constant functions satisfying the equation:")
for c in candidates_constant:
    if check_constant(c):
        print(f"f(x) = {c}")

print("\nLinear functions satisfying the equation:")
for c in candidates_linear:
    if check_linear(c):
        print(f"f(x) = {c} * x")
```

This code tests simple candidates and outputs those that satisfy the functional equation at sampled points. By analyzing these, we can conjecture whether they are solutions or if more complex solutions exist.
