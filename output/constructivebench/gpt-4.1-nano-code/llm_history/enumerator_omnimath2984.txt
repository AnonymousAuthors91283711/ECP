The task is to find a unique value of \( b \) such that \( 0 = 2 \times (-4) + b \). The equation simplifies to \( 0 = -8 + b \), so \( b = 8 \). Since the problem asks for a program that enumerates possible answers, I will write a Python script that searches over an integer range to find \( b \) satisfying the equation, then outputs the exact value. To ensure efficiency, I'll limit the search range around the obvious solution.

```python
# Enumerate possible values of b in a small range to find the unique b satisfying 0 = 2*(-4) + b
# Since 2*(-4) = -8, the solution is b = 8
# We'll check b in range [-10, 20] for completeness and print matching answers immediately

for b in range(-10, 21):
    if 0 == 2 * (-4) + b:
        print(b)
```
