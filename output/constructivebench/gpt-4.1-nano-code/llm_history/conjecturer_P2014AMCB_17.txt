theorem P2014AMCB_17 :
  ∃ r s, (∀ m, ¬ ∃ x, x^2 = 14 + m * (x - 20) ↔ r < m ∧ m < s) ∧ r + s = P2014AMCB_17_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Approximate bounds where solutions exist:
Lower bound (m): 0.0
Upper bound (m): 80
Sum r + s approximately: 80.0
. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The bounds seem to be between 0 and 80, and the sum r + s approaches 80 as per enumeration. Since the constraints describe a range where solutions do not exist outside (r, s), and the sum matches the approximate total, the explicit bounds in the form appear to be r = 0 and s = 80, giving the sum as 80.
