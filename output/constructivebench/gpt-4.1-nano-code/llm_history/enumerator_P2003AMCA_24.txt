The problem appears to involve analyzing the set {x | x = log_b a (a/b) + log_b b (b/a)} for real numbers a, b with conditions a ≥ b > 1. Since `log_b a (a/b) + log_b b (b/a)` simplifies algebraically, let's examine possible values and their behavior. We can explore specific small examples where `a ≥ b > 1` to find the maximum of this expression, as the theorem states it's the greatest element.

Here's a Python program that:

- Fixes small sample values for `b` and `a` (with `a ≥ b > 1`).
- Computes the expression.
- Enumerates pairs within a small, finite range to approximate the maximum.
- Immediately prints each candidate result, prioritizing exact computations.

```python
# Enumerate small values of b and a satisfying a >= b > 1
# Compute x = log_b(a) (a/b) + log_b(a) (b/a)

import math

# Function to compute the expression for given a, b
def compute_expression(a, b):
    # log_b a = ln(a)/ln(b)
    log_b_a = math.log(a) / math.log(b)
    # log_b (a/b) = log_b a - log_b b = log_b a - 1
    log_b_a_div_b = log_b_a - 1
    # log_b (b/a) = log_b b - log_b a = 1 - log_b a
    log_b_b_div_a = 1 - log_b_a
    return log_b_a_div_b + log_b_b_div_a

# Set sample ranges for a and b
b_values = [2, 3, 4]
a_values = [b for b in b_values] + [b+1 for b in b_values] + [b+2 for b in b_values]

# To avoid duplicates, store results in a set
results = set()

for b in b_values:
    for a in a_values:
        if a >= b > 1:
            val = compute_expression(a, b)
            # Print each value immediately
            print(f"a={a}, b={b} => x={val}")
            results.add(val)

# Optional: find and print the maximum (if needed)
max_val = max(results)
print(f"Approximate maximum value found: {max_val}")
```
