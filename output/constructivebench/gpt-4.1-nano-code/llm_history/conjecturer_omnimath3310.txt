noncomputable abbrev omnimath3310_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3310
: (∃ x : ℝ, x = Real.sqrt (x - 1 / x) + Real.sqrt (1 - 1 / x)) ∧ (∀ y : ℝ, y = Real.sqrt (y - 1 / y) + Real.sqrt (1 - 1 / y) → y = omnimath3310_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: No solution found in search range.
. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<1>>>
This is a special case analysis; the expression suggests setting the square roots' arguments to perfect squares, leading to the solution x = 1.
