theorem omnimath3922 : 
  (∃ (m : Fin 15 → ℤ), ∑ k : Fin 15, (m k : ℝ) * arctan (k.1 + 1) = arctan 16) ↔ omnimath3922_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: timeout triggered. Expected Answer Type: Prop
The pattern suggests the sum involving arctan and increasing k relates to a telescoping sum of arctan differences. Given the sum over k = 0 to 14 and arctan(k+1), the total sum likely simplifies to arctan of a sum involving these terms.

Conjecture: the sum equals arctan(16). For an integer-based function m, the sum telescopes to arctan(16), which uniquely determines such m.
