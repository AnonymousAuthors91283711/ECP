The problem appears to explore functions \(f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) satisfying a set of properties: positivity on positive reals, a functional equation, and a limit condition. To assist in conjecturing the potential solutions, I will explore candidate functions that satisfy the properties, especially focusing on the functional equation:
\[f(x \cdot f(y)) = y \cdot f(x)\]
for all \(x, y > 0\), along with the limit condition \(\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = 0\).

Motivated by similar equations, potential solutions could be power functions like \(f(x) = c x^{k}\). I will check these candidates, specifically \(f(x) = \frac{1}{x}\), which satisfies the limit condition and likely the functional equation.

Since the problem is instructing to output possible functions for the solution set, I will enumerate simple candidate functions and verify their properties, printing each function that potentially satisfies all conditions. For efficiency, I will only test functions of a simple form.

```python
# Enumerate candidate functions: Power functions of the form c * x^k
# For positivity, c > 0 and x > 0 is okay.
# For the limit condition, f(x) = 1/x is promising since it tends to 0 as x -> ∞.
# Check the functional equation:
# f(x * f(y)) = y * f(x)

# Candidate 1: f(x) = 1 / x
# For x, y > 0:
# LHS: f(x * f(y)) = f(x * (1/y)) = 1 / (x * (1/y)) = y / x
# RHS: y * f(x) = y * (1/x) = y / x
# Equal, so candidate satisfies the functional equation.
# Also positive for x > 0, y > 0, tends to 0 as x -> ∞.

# Candidate 2: f(x) = k * x^a (for some parameters), generally the identity and power functions.
# Let's limit to f(x) = 1/x for demonstration.

print('Possible solution function: f(x) = 1 / x')
```
