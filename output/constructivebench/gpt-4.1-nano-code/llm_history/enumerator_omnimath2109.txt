The problem involves analyzing a subset of the unit square [0,1]×[0,1] defined by particular inequalities involving squares and sums. To estimate its area (measure), we need to explore the region satisfying:
- \(0 \leq a, b \leq 1\),
- \(a + b > 1\),
- and at least one of:
  - \(a^2 + b^2 < 1\),
  - \(a^2 + 1 < b^2\),
  - \(b^2 + 1 < a^2\).

The main challenge is to approximate the measure of this set. Since exact symbolic measure might be complex, we can numerically estimate the area by sampling points within the unit square and counting how many satisfy the conditions.

The approach:
- Sample points over the domain [0, 1]×[0, 1],
- Check the inequalities,
- Count points satisfying the combined criteria at a sufficiently fine grid,
- Estimate the area as the proportion of points passing the test multiplied by the total area (which is 1).

This provides an approximate answer to help in conjecturing what `omnimath2109_answer` could be.

```python
import numpy as np

# Set the grid resolution
resolution = 1000

# Generate a grid of points in [0, 1] x [0, 1]
a_vals = np.linspace(0, 1, resolution)
b_vals = np.linspace(0, 1, resolution)

# Initialize count
count = 0
total_points = resolution * resolution

# Iterate over grid points
for a in a_vals:
    for b in b_vals:
        if a + b > 1:
            a2 = a**2
            b2 = b2 = b**2
            cond1 = (a2 + b2) < 1
            cond2 = (a2 + 1) < b2
            cond3 = (b2 + 1) < a2
            if cond1 or cond2 or cond3:
                count += 1

# Estimate the measure (area)
approx_area = count / total_points

print(f"Approximate area: {approx_area}")
print("Estimated measure for the set.")
# Use the approximation as the answer
omnimath2109_answer = approx_area
```
