This problem asks us to find \(x^4 + y^4\) given \(xy=5\) and \(x^2 + y^2=21\). We can approach this by expressing everything in terms of symmetric sums.

Key observations:
- \(x y = 5\)
- \(x^2 + y^2 = 21\)

Using the identities:
\[
(x + y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy = 21 + 2 \times 5 = 21 + 10 = 31
\]
\[
x + y = \pm \sqrt{31}
\]

Next, \(x^2 y^2 = (xy)^2 = 25\).

We want \(x^4 + y^4\). Note that:
\[
x^4 + y^4 = (x^2 + y^2)^2 - 2 x^2 y^2
\]
since:
\[
(x^2 + y^2)^2 = x^4 + 2x^2 y^2 + y^4
\]

Thus:
\[
x^4 + y^4 = 21^2 - 2 \times 25 = 441 - 50 = 391
\]

The value is unique.

```python
# The value of x^4 + y^4 given the constraints
print(391)
```
