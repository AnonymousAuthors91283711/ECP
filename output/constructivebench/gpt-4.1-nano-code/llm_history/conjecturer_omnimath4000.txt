The current proposed answer `{λ _ : ℝ, 0, λ _ : ℝ, x, 0}` is invalid because in Lean, a set (or more precisely, a `set` of functions) is defined by specifying a predicate (a function from `ℝ → Prop`) rather than listing elements directly. The set of solutions should be characterized by an appropriate predicate capturing the solutions described, such as constant or linear functions matching the enumerated solutions: `f(x) = 0` or `f(x) = x`.

Given that the solutions include \(f(x) = 0\), and linear functions with `f(x) = x`, the set should be defined as those functions that satisfy these forms:

```lean
{f : ℝ → ℝ | ∀ x, f x = 0 ∨ ∃ a, f x = a * x}
```

But since the solutions include only \(0\) and \(x\), specifically the constant zero function and the identity, the refined version could be:

```lean
{f : ℝ → ℝ | ∀ x, f x = 0 ∨ f x = x}
```

This captures exactly the enumerated solutions.

**Final answer:**

<<<{f : ℝ → ℝ | ∀ x, f x = 0 ∨ f x = x}>>>
