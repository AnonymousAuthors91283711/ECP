This problem involves a simple algebraic expression involving \( x \) set to 3, and asks for the value of \(- (5x - 6x)\). Let's write a Python script to evaluate this expression explicitly, considering that the value of \(x\) is given as 3 and implementing a systematic enumeration approach to verify the calculation.

Since the task is straightforward, enumerate candidate values of the expression for various \(x\) (though in the problem, \(x=3\) is specified), and print the answer immediately when computed.

```python
# Enumerate possible values of the expression -(5x - 6x) for sample x values
# Prioritize exact evaluation based on the provided x=3
x_values = [3]  # known x from the problem

for x in x_values:
    # Compute the expression
    result = -(5 * x - 6 * x)
    # Print the computed result
    print(f"For x={x}, -(5x - 6x) = {result}")
```
