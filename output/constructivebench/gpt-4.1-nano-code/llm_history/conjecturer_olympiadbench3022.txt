The main issue with the original proposed answer is that it references x from outside its scope, which is not allowed in Lean when defining an abbreviated constant. Since the equation's approximate solution is at x=11, and the theorem statement asks to show an equivalence with x=olympiadbench3022_answer, the answer should be a specific real value independent of x, i.e., a definite number in ℝ, representing the solution.

Looking at the enumerated solutions, it's clear that the critical point for the equation occurs at x=11, where the value of the equation is exactly 1. For that reason, the answer should be:

- The x-value at which the equation is true, i.e., x=11, which is a concrete real number in ℝ.

There is no need for a conditional "if" statement; instead, define `olympiadbench3022_answer` as a real number, specifically `11`. This aligns with the pattern observed and the correctness requirement.

**Final corrected answer:**

<<<11>>>

**Explanation:**  
The answer is a specific real number, 11, matching the approximate solution where the equation holds true. Defining `olympiadbench3022_answer` as the number 11 in ℝ avoids scope errors and provides a concrete, compile-time value that satisfies the equivalence in the theorem.
