The pattern suggests n being divisible by 3, with specific values 12, 15, 18, and their corresponding k's following k = (n^2)/9. These n's satisfy n^2 ≡ 0 mod 9, i.e., n ≡ 0 mod 3. Since 10 < n < 20 and n divisible by 3, the set is {12, 15, 18}. For each, 4k + 5k = 9k = n^2, so k = n^2 / 9.

The core logical deduction from the pattern is that n ranges over values between 10 and 20, divisible by 3, specifically n = 12, 15, 18, which correspond to k values satisfying 9k = n^2. This gives k = n^2 / 9, resulting in k = 16 for n = 12, k = 25 for n = 15, and k = 36 for n = 18. Therefore, the set should be explicitly those n values for which this equation holds with a suitable k, forming a set of solutions.

Because the earlier response failed to properly define the set in Lean syntax, I'll define omnimath4347_answer as the set of n satisfying the constraints 10 < n < 20, n mod 3 = 0, and the existence of such k. The set is {12, 15, 18} explicitly, since these are the only n that satisfy the criterion, and their associated k's are 16, 25, and 36, respectively.

The set \(\text{omnimath4347_answer}\) should be a set of natural numbers corresponding to the specific values of \(n\) (namely 12, 15, 18) that satisfy the given conditions, including the existence of \(\exists k\) such that \(4k + 5k = n^2\) and \(n^2 \equiv 0 \pmod 9\). Since \(4k + 5k = 9k\), the existence of such \(k\) with \(n^2 = 9k\) implies \(n^2\) is divisible by 9, hence \(n\) must be divisible by 3. The listed solutions confirm \(n \in \{12, 15, 18\}\). 

The goal is to write this as a set in Lean syntax. Given the hints, the set of such \(n\) is exactly the set enumerated by those values. Lean syntax for this set can be expressed explicitly as a set containing exactly those elements.

Conjectured answer: 

<<<{ n : ℕ | n = 12 ∨ n = 15 ∨ n = 18 }>>>
