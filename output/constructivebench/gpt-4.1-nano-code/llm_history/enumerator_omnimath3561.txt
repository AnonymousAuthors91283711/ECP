The problem appears to define a set-theoretic condition over integers and seeks the least `k ≥ 2` such that within the interval `[2, k]`, any subset `P` that covers `[2, k]` but is not equal to it must contain elements `a, b, c` with `a * b = c`. The core is to find the minimal `k` where this condition holds—i.e., the minimal length of such an interval where the property that *any* proper subset (covering the interval) must include a product relation holds.

This translates to: we search from small `k` upward for the smallest `k ≥ 2` where no subset `P` (that covers `[2, k]` and is a strict subset) can fail to contain such a product triple.

Strategy:
- For small `k`, explicitly enumerate all subsets `P` that cover `[2, k]` but are not equal to it, and check if any such `P` exists without `a, b, c` satisfying `a * b = c`.
- As soon as we find a `k` where no such subset exists, we output that `k`.

This is computationally feasible for small `k` (e.g., up to 10 or 12).

```python
from itertools import combinations, chain

def all_subsets(s):
    return chain.from_iterable(combinations(s, r) for r in range(len(s)+1))

# Range for testing, starting small
for k in range(2, 20):
    interval = set(range(2, k+1))
    found_counterexample = False

    # Generate all proper subsets P that cover interval: P ⊂ interval, P ≠ interval, and they cover interval
    for size in range(len(interval)):
        for P in combinations(interval, size):
            P_set = set(P)
            # Check if P covers interval
            if not interval.issubset(P_set):
                continue
            # P covers interval
            if P_set == interval:
                continue  # skip full set

            # Check if P lacks a product triple
            has_product_triple = False
            for a in P_set:
                for b in P_set:
                    c = a * b
                    if c in P_set:
                        has_product_triple = True
                        break
                if has_product_triple:
                    break
            if not has_product_triple:
                # Found counterexample, so this k fails the property
                found_counterexample = True
                break
        if found_counterexample:
            break

    if not found_counterexample:
        # For this k, the property holds: minimal k
        print(k)
        break
```
