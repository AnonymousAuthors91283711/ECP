This problem involves solving a system of three equations with three unknowns (cake_price, cupcake_price, bagel_price). The goal is to determine possible values for these prices, particularly focusing on the value of `omnimath3991_answer` which relates the prices.

We will:
- Simplify and solve the equations algebraically.
- Enumerate possible rational solutions systematically.
- Stream answers as soon as they are found.

The equations are:
1. \( 1 \times cake\_price + 2 \times cupcake\_price + 3 \times bagel\_price = 3 \times cake\_price + 1 \times bagel\_price \)
2. \( 3 \times cake\_price + 1 \times bagel\_price = 6 \times cupcake\_price \)
3. \( 2 \times cake\_price + 2 \times bagel\_price = omnimath3991\_answer \times cupcake\_price \)

Let's write Python code to:
- Assign small rational sample values.
- Solve the equations symbolically.
- Compute `omnimath3991_answer`.

```python
import fractions

# Enumerate small rational values for cake_price, cupcake_price, bagel_price
# to find rational solutions for the system
for cake_num in range(1, 6):  # numerator from 1 to 5
    for cake_den in range(1, 6):  # denominator from 1 to 5
        cake_price = fractions.Fraction(cake_num, cake_den)
        for cupcake_num in range(1, 6):
            for cupcake_den in range(1, 6):
                cupcake_price = fractions.Fraction(cupcake_num, cupcake_den)
                for bagel_num in range(1, 6):
                    for bagel_den in range(1, 6):
                        bagel_price = fractions.Fraction(bagel_num, bagel_den)

                        # Check equation 1:
                        lhs1 = cake_price + 2 * cupcake_price + 3 * bagel_price
                        rhs1 = 3 * cake_price + 1 * bagel_price
                        if lhs1 != rhs1:
                            continue

                        # Check equation 2:
                        lhs2 = 3 * cake_price + bagel_price
                        rhs2 = 6 * cupcake_price
                        if lhs2 != rhs2:
                            continue

                        # Solve for omnimath3991_answer using equation 3:
                        numerator = 2 * cake_price + 2 * bagel_price
                        denominator = cupcake_price
                        # Avoid division by zero
                        if denominator == 0:
                            continue
                        answer = numerator / denominator

                        print(f"Found solution with cake={float(cake_price)}, cupcake={float(cupcake_price)}, bagel={float(bagel_price)}")
                        print(f"omnimath3991_answer = {float(answer)}")

The problem involves solving a set of linear equations over rational numbers. The current code performs a brute-force enumeration over small rational values, which is reasonable for discovering solutions in a competition setting, but its current ranges are very limited (1/1 to 5/1). 

Looking at the equations:
1) \( c + 2u + 3b = 3c + b \) simplifies to \( c + 2u + 3b = 3c + b \Rightarrow 2u + 3b = 2c \).
2) \( 3c + b = 6u \).
3) \( (2c + 2b) / u \) determines the answer.

From (1): \( 2u + 3b = 2c \).  
From (2): \( 3c + b = 6u \).

Express c from (2): \( c = (6u - b)/3 \).

Substitute into (1):

\[
2u + 3b = 2 \times \frac{6u - b}{3} \\
2u + 3b = 2 \times \frac{6u - b}{3} \Rightarrow 2u + 3b = \frac{12u - 2b}{3}
\]

Multiply both sides by 3:

\[
3 \times 2u + 3 \times 3b = 12u - 2b \\
6u + 9b = 12u - 2b \\
9b + 2b = 12u - 6u \\
11b = 6u \Rightarrow b = \frac{6u}{11}
\]

Now substitute \( b \) back into c:

\[
c = \frac{6u - b}{3} = \frac{6u - \frac{6u}{11}}{3} = \frac{\frac{66u}{11} - \frac{6u}{11}}{3} = \frac{\frac{60u}{11}}{3} = \frac{60u}{11 \times 3} = \frac{20u}{11}
\]

Finally, the answer:

\[
\text{answer} = \frac{2c + 2b}{u} = \frac{2 \times \frac

The problem appears to involve solving a system of equations with rational parameters for the prices of cake, cupcakes, and bagels, and finding the value of `omnimath3991_answer`. The provided code includes only a theorem statement with `sorry` placeholders, indicating incomplete proof and code.

Since the program is empty (`None`), it does not run at all, and no answers are enumerated. According to the instructions, the code should print partial solutions when found, and the approach should be structured to generate candidate solutions systematically, evaluate them, and print when solutions are found.

**Judgment:** The original program is rejected due to being empty and incomplete. It does not meet the specified requirements for generating or outputting answers.
