To help determine the value of `x` satisfying the equation `5 * log_b 2 x = 40`, we'll analyze and enumerate possible solutions based on properties of logarithms and exponentials. Since the key relation involves logarithms, solving explicitly for `x` gives `x = 2^{(40/5)} = 2^8 = 256`. To assist in this, we'll enumerate candidate `x` values around this root and verify those satisfying the equation within a numerical tolerance, streaming each candidate upon verification.

```python
# Enumerate possible x values around the expected root to assist in problem-solving
import math

# Given the equation: 5 * log_b 2 x = 40
# solve for x: log_b 2 x = 8
# which translates to: x = 2^8 = 256

# Enumerate candidates from 250 to 262 with step 1
for candidate in range(250, 263):
    # Compute the logarithm base 2 of candidate
    log2_candidate = math.log2(candidate)
    # Check if 5 * log2_candidate is close to 40
    result = 5 * log2_candidate
    # Stream results that satisfy the relation within a small tolerance
    if abs(result - 40) < 1e-6:
        print(f"Candidate x = {candidate} satisfies 5 * log2 x â‰ˆ 40")
```
