Given the parity constraints and equation, the sum of six odd squares (each ≥ 1) cannot be 1986, since sum of six odd squares is always an even multiple of 2 but cannot sum to 1986 with the oddness conditions. Therefore, the existential statement is false, and the answer is the negation of the existence claim.
