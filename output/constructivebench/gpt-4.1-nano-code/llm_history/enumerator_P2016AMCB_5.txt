The problem involves finding the value of (4 + 919) mod 7. This is a straightforward modular arithmetic calculation, but since the task is to help verify or explore possible answers, I'll write a Python program that enumerates potential answers for this specific expression using small sample calculations, and then confirms the exact result.

```python
# Enumerate potential answers to (4 + 919) % 7
# Since the calculation is straightforward, we verify possible values from 0 to 6
for candidate in range(7):
    result = (4 + 919) % 7
    if result == candidate:
        print(candidate)
# The output should confirm the exact answer: 4
```

This will stream the actual value 4, the exact result of the expression, and demonstrate the correctness of the modular calculation.
