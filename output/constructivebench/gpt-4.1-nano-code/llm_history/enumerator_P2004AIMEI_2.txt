The problem involves integers \(a, b, m\) with certain sum conditions and an absolute difference condition involving \(a, b, m\). We want to find all such \(m\) satisfying the given relations, particularly focusing on the case where the absolute difference equals 99, and determine the possible \(m\).

Approach:
- For a fixed integer \(m > 0\), find possible \(a, b\) satisfying the sum conditions.
- Derive relations for \(a, b\) from the sum conditions.
- Check the absolute difference condition.
- Enumerate small values of \(m\), since the problem likely involves small solutions.
- When the absolute difference condition is met, print \(m\).

```python
# Enumerate small positive integers m to find solutions where the difference is 99
# The sum over range m: sum of a + k for k in 0..m-1
# sum_{k=0}^{m-1} (a + k) = m * a + (m*(m-1))/2
# sum_{k=0}^{m-1} (b + k) = m * b + (m*(m-1))/2
# For given m, find possible a, b satisfying sum conditions
# Then check the absolute difference condition

max_m = 150  # Upper limit for enumeration, adjustable
results = []

for m in range(1, max_m + 1):
    total_a = 2 * m
    total_b = m
    # From sum_{k=0}^{m-1} (a + k) = total_a
    # => m * a + (m*(m-1))/2 = total_a
    # => a = (total_a - (m*(m-1))/2) / m
    a_num = total_a - (m*(m-1)//2)
    if a_num % m != 0:
        continue
    a = a_num // m
    total_b_calc = m
    b_num = total_b - (m*(m-1)//2)
    if b_num % m != 0:
        continue
    b = b_num // m
    # Compute the absolute difference
    diff = abs((a + m - 1) - (b + 2 * m - 1))
    if diff == 99:
        results.append(m)
        print(f"Found m={m} with a={a}, b={b} satisfying the conditions.")

# If any results found, output them; otherwise, indicate none found within limits
if results:
    print("Possible m values where the difference equals 99:", results)
else:
    print("No solutions found within the enumeration limit.")
