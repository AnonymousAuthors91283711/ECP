This problem involves finding a natural number \( c \) such that the sum \( c + x = 34 \) and the difference \( c - x = 14 \) hold simultaneously, where \( x = P2006AMCB_3_answer \). Since \( P2006AMCB_3_answer \) is a placeholder, the core challenge is to determine possible values for \( x \) and then find \( c \).

The equations:
\[
c + x = 34 \quad (1)
\]
\[
c - x = 14 \quad (2)
\]
Adding (1) and (2):
\[
2c = 48 \Rightarrow c = 24
\]
Substituting back:
\[
24 + x = 34 \Rightarrow x = 10
\]

Thus, the candidate values are \( c=24 \) and \( x=10 \). This neatly satisfies both equations, indicating a consistent solution.

The program will verify these computations systematically, printing potential solutions.

```python
# Enumerate possible x values and check for corresponding c that satisfy the equations
for x_candidate in range(0, 50):  # sample range to find integer solutions
    c_plus_x = 34
    c_minus_x = 14

    # From the equations:
    # c = (c + x + c - x) / 2 = (34 + 14) / 2 = 24
    c = (c_plus_x + c_minus_x) // 2
    # Calculate x from c:
    x = c_plus_x - c

    # Verify if x is within the candidate range
    if x == x_candidate and c * 2 == c_plus_x + c_minus_x:
        print(f"Found solution: c = {c}, x = {x}")
        # For the problem's requirement, assign x to the answer variable:
        P2006AMCB_3_answer = x
        # Check the existence condition:
        if c + P2006AMCB_3_answer == 34 and c - P2006AMCB_3_answer == 14:
            print(f"Validated: c = {c}, x = {P2006AMCB_3_answer}")
```
