This problem involves finding digits \(E, V, I, L\) (each nonzero) such that two specific four-digit numbers formed by these digits satisfy divisibility conditions by 73 and 74, respectively. The goal is to find the value of \(1000L + 100I + 10V + E\). We will enumerate all possible digit combinations with small sample ranges and check the divisibility constraints, streaming solutions as we find valid answers.

Since the digits are non-zero, they range from 1 to 9. To optimize, we iterate over all possible values and immediately print if both conditions are satisfied.

```python
# Enumerate all possible digits for E, V, I, L (1-9, non-zero)
for E in range(1, 10):
    for V in range(1, 10):
        for I in range(1, 10):
            for L in range(1, 10):
                num1 = 1000 * E + 100 * V + 10 * I + L
                num2 = 1000 * V + 100 * I + 10 * L + E
                # Check divisibility conditions
                if num1 % 73 == 0 and num2 % 74 == 0:
                    answer = 1000 * L + 100 * I + 10 * V + E
                    print(answer)
```
