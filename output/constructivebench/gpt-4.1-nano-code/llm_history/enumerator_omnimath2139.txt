This problem involves finding the minimum value of the function \( z = (x y)^2 + (x + 7)^2 + (2 y + 7)^2 \) over all real \( x, y \). To assist in conjecturing the true answer, we'll systematically enumerate candidate solutions around small integers, compute their corresponding \( z \)-values, and keep track of the smallest. This approach helps approximate the minimum numerically without relying on symbolic solutions.

Since the problem is algebraic and continuous, limited brute-force enumeration over small ranges can give us a good candidate for the minimum. We'll check \( x \) and \( y \) over a small grid from -10 to 10.

```python
# Enumerate over a small grid to approximate the minimal value of z = (x*y)^2 + (x+7)^2 + (2*y+7)^2
min_z = float('inf')
min_x, min_y = None, None

# Iterate over small integer ranges for x and y
for x in range(-10, 11):
    for y in range(-10, 11):
        z = (x * y)**2 + (x + 7)**2 + (2 * y + 7)**2
        print(f"x={x}, y={y}, z={z}")  # Stream partial results
        if z < min_z:
            min_z = z
            min_x, min_y = x, y

print(f"Approximate minimal z: {min_z} at x={min_x}, y={min_y}")
```
