This problem appears to involve counting the number of valid 5-tuple combinations of strand choices, where each strand is labeled from a small set, with certain invalid pairs to exclude. The goal is to find the total number of such valid combinations.

The steps involve:
- Defining the bases
- Filtering out invalid consecutive pairs
- Constructing all possible 5-tuple combinations of valid pairs
- Counting these combinations

As the core task is to compute the total number of valid sequences, I will generate code to enumerate all sequences and count them, printing each valid sequence size (streaming), and ultimately output the total count.

Because the total set is small (bases are only 4), enumeration is feasible. We avoid hardcoding and aim for efficiency by filtering invalid pairs upfront and generating sequences systematically.

```python
# Enumerate all valid 5-tuples of strand choices without invalid consecutive pairs.
# Bases and invalid pairs as per problem statement.

bases = ['H', 'M', 'N', 'T']
invalid_pairs = {('H', 'M'), ('M', 'H'), ('N', 'T'), ('T', 'N')}

valid_sequences = []

# Generate all 5-length sequences with the given constraints
for b1 in bases:
    for b2 in bases:
        if b1 != b2 and (b1, b2) not in invalid_pairs:
            for b3 in bases:
                if b3 != b2 and (b2, b3) not in invalid_pairs:
                    for b4 in bases:
                        if b4 != b3 and (b3, b4) not in invalid_pairs:
                            for b5 in bases:
                                if b5 != b4 and (b4, b5) not in invalid_pairs:
                                    sequence = (b1, b2, b3, b4, b5)
                                    print(sequence)  # Stream each valid sequence as found
                                    valid_sequences.append(sequence)

# Output total count
print(f"Total valid sequences: {len(valid_sequences)}")
```
