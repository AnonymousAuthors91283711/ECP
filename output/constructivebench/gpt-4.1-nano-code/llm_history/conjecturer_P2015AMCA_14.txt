theorem P2015AMCA_14 :
    (∀ a > 0, (1 / log 2 a + 1 / log 3 a + 1 / log 4 a = 1) ↔ a = P2015AMCA_14_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Error: Program is empty. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The equation \( \frac{1}{\log_2 a} + \frac{1}{\log_3 a} + \frac{1}{\log_4 a} = 1 \) suggests a common relation involving logs and reciprocals. Testing specific values, the candidate solution simplifies to \( a = 36 \) as it makes each term reciprocally relate with logs of bases 2, 3, and 4. This is consistent with the pattern of solutions where logs convert to standard logs and satisfy the sum condition. 

<<<36>>>
