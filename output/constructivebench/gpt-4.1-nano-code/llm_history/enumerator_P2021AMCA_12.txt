The problem involves examining roots of a polynomial \( p(x) = x^6 - 10x^5 + A x^4 + B x^3 + C x^2 + D x + 16 \) with the given condition that each root is a positive integer \( n \). Since roots are positive integers, and the polynomial has integer coefficients, the roots should be positive divisors of the constant term 16, by the Rational Root Theorem.

Possible positive integer roots: \( 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 \). The roots satisfy \( p(z) = 0 \) for some subset of these. The roots' sum (by Viète's) would be:

\[ \sum z_i = 10 \]

because the coefficient of \( x^5 \) is \(-10\), and \( \sum z_i = 10 \).

Given that, and roots are positive integers, we can attempt to enumerate all possible 6-tuples from the divisors of 16 whose sum is 10. Since roots are distinct (no assumption), but perhaps not necessarily distinct, but they're roots of the polynomial, possibly repeated roots.

To find B, which appears in the polynomial as the coefficient of \( x^3 \), via Viète's formula:

\[ B = (-1)^3 \times \text{sum of products of roots three at a time} = - \sum_{i<j<k} z_i z_j z_k \]

So, our task reduces to enumerating all possible combinations of roots (from \( \{1,2,4,8,16\} \)) with multiplicity—6 roots total, sum of roots =10—and computing the sum of all triplets multiplied as per Viète's formula, then outputting B.

Let's implement that in Python:

```python
# Generate all 6-tuples of roots from divisors of 16
divisors = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16]
results = []

# To reduce computations, precompute all 6 multisets with sum = 10
from itertools import combinations_with_replacement, combinations

# Generate all multisets of size 6 with roots from divisors
for roots in combinations_with_replacement(divisors, 6):
    if sum(roots) == 10:
        # Compute sum of triple products
        triplet_sum = 0
        for triplet in combinations(roots, 3):
            product = triplet[0] * triplet[1] * triplet[2]
            triplet_sum += product
        # B = - (sum of triplet products)
        B = -triplet_sum
        print(f"Roots: {roots}")
        print(f"B: {B}")
        results.append(B)
```

This code enumerates all possible root multisets with sum 10, computes the corresponding \( B \), and outputs each candidate. The dominant criterion is the sum of roots == 10, roots are from divisors of 16, and roots are positive integers. The outputs are immediate when a candidate is found, aiding in the identification of the correct coefficient B.
