open Nat Set

abbrev omnimath2155_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath2155 : 
  Fintype.card {n ∈ Set.Icc 4 2014 | n % 5 = 4 ∧ (Nat.digits 10 n).sum % 2 = 0} = omnimath2155_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 201
Proposed Answer: 90 + 314
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the count of numbers between 4 and 2014 (inclusive) that:
   - Are congruent to 4 modulo 5 (n % 5 = 4)
   - Have an even sum of their decimal digits

2. The ground truth answer is 201.

3. The proposed answer is 90 + 314 = 404.

Analysis:
- The range from 4 to 2014 contains 2011 numbers.
- Numbers ≡4 mod5 occur every 5 numbers, so about 2011/5 ≈ 402 numbers satisfy the first condition.
- The digit sum condition should roughly halve this count, bringing us to ≈201, matching the ground truth.
- The proposed answer 404 is exactly double the correct answer, suggesting it might be counting all numbers ≡4 mod5 without the digit sum condition.
