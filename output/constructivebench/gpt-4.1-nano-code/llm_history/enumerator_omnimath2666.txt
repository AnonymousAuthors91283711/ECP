This problem involves positive real numbers \( x \) and \( y \), and a relation involving their ratio. The theorem's statement is:

\[
\left( \frac{y}{x} = \text{omnimath2666_answer} \right) \iff (x \times 30 = y \times 10)
\]

which simplifies to

\[
\frac{y}{x} = \frac{y \times 10}{x \times 10} = \frac{3x}{x} = 3
\]

from the second condition:

\[
x \times 30 = y \times 10 \implies y = 3x
\]

Substituting back, the ratio is:

\[
\frac{y}{x} = \frac{3x}{x} = 3
\]

Thus, the ratio \(\frac{y}{x}\) that satisfies the equivalence should be 3. To verify and generate possible answers, we'll enumerate possible ratio values around 3 with some small sample values of \( x \) and \( y \) consistent with \( y = 3x \). Since the problem asks for exact values and matching conditions, we'll set:

- \( x = 1, y = 3 \) (ratio = 3)
- \( x = 2, y = 6 \) (ratio = 3)
- \( x = 0.5, y = 1.5 \) (ratio = 3)

And then confirm that the ratio matches.

```python
# Enumeration of positive x and y with the relation y = 3x
sample_xs = [0.5, 1, 2]
for x in sample_xs:
    y = 3 * x
    ratio = y / x
    print(f"x = {x}, y = {y}, y/x = {ratio}")

# Since the ratio = 3, set the answer accordingly
# We avoid hardcoding, but for demonstration, we store the ratio
omnimath2666_answer = 3
print(f"omnimath2666_answer = {omnimath2666_answer}")
```
