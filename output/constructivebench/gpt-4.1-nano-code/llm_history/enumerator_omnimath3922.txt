This problem involves finding a function \( m: \text{Fin}\ 15 \to \mathbb{Z} \) such that the weighted sum of arctan terms equals \(\arctan 16\). A natural approach is to consider the well-known arctan addition formula for telescoping sums involving parameters that sum up correctly. We can attempt to enumerate small integer solutions for \( m(k) \) to satisfy the sum, focusing on small ranges and potential solutions.

```python
# Enumerate small integer combinations for m(k), k=0..14, to satisfy the sum of m(k)*arctan(k+1) = arctan(16)
import itertools
import math

# Precompute arctangent values for k+1
arctans = [math.atan(k + 1) for k in range(15)]

# Set search bounds for m(k)
M_MIN, M_MAX = -3, 3

# Since we seek solutions where sum m(k)*arctan(k+1) = arctan(16),
# and arctan(16) is approx 1.5208, enumerate all m(k) in the small range
for m_tuple in itertools.product(range(M_MIN, M_MAX+1), repeat=15):
    total = sum(m * arct for m, arct in zip(m_tuple, arctans))
    # Check if total is very close to arctan(16)
    # Use a tolerance for floating point comparison
    if abs(total - math.atan(16)) < 1e-6:
        print(f"Candidate m(k): {m_tuple}")
```
