  1000*a + 100*b + 10*c + d = omnimath2519_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 6507. Expected Answer Type: ℤ
The system of equations indicates that a, b, c, d are digits between 0 and 9 satisfying the linear constraints. Solving the linear system yields the unique digits. The enumerated answer set suggests the number is 6507, consistent with the solutions obtained.  
Final answer: <<<6507>>>
