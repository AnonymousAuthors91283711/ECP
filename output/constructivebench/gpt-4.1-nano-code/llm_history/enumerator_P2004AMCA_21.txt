The problem appears to involve an infinite sum of the form ∑ (cos θ)^{2n} equaling 5, which resembles a geometric series with ratio r = (cos θ)^2. Since the series sum is given to be 5, we can analyze this to find possible values for cos θ, and consequently for cos 2θ using the double-angle formula.

Let's analyze:
- The sum of a geometric series ∑_{n=0}^∞ r^n = 1/(1-r), for |r| < 1.
- Our series sums from n=0: ∑ (cos θ)^{2n} = 1/(1 - (cos θ)^2) = 5.
- Therefore, 1/(1 - (cos θ)^2) = 5, implying 1 - (cos θ)^2 = 1/5, so (cos θ)^2 = 4/5.
- Since (cos θ)^2 = 4/5, then cos θ = ±sqrt(4/5) = ±(2/√5).

For each possible value of cos θ, cos 2θ = 2 cos^2 θ - 1.

Calculations:
- If cos θ = 2/√5, then cos 2θ = 2*(4/5) - 1 = 8/5 - 1 = 3/5.
- If cos θ = -2/√5, then cos 2θ = 2*(4/5) - 1 = same as above, but note that cos^2 θ is positive, so cos 2θ depends on the square, but for cos θ negative, cos 2θ can be ±(3/5).

I will implement code to find these possible cosine values and their cos 2θ, ensuring all possible answers are printed.

```python
# Program to enumerate possible cos(2θ) values based on the given infinite series sum
import math

# Given sum of geometric series: sum = 5
# 1 / (1 - r) = 5 --> r = (cos θ)^2
r = 1 - 1/5  # 1 - 1/5 = 4/5
cos_theta_squared_options = [4/5]
# cos θ can be positive or negative sqrt
possible_cos_theta = [math.sqrt(r), -math.sqrt(r)]

# Compute corresponding cos 2θ for each possible cos θ
answers = set()
for c in possible_cos_theta:
    cos_2theta = 2 * c**2 - 1
    answers.add(cos_2theta)

# Print all unique answers
for answer in sorted(answers):
    print(answer)
```
