To assist in conjecturing the true answer for the measure of the set described, we'll consider various possible values of `omnimath2370_answer` within the interval [0, 1000], given the constraints involving the floor functions. By enumerating candidate values and checking the set condition indirectly (e.g., interval partitions where the floor expressions are constant), we streamline the search.

The set conditions involve floors after dividing by 2.5 and 6.25, suggesting the relevant points occur at multiples of these denominators. Since the interval is [0, 1000], we'll examine values at these critical points, compute where the floor functions change, and estimate the measure accordingly. We will output potential values as they are found, with a focus on exact rational approximations and immediate streaming outputs.

```python
# Enumerate candidate measures based on the intervals where the floor conditions are constant.
# Focus on key points: multiples of 2.5 and 6.25 within [0, 1000].

import math

# Step size for critical points
step = 0.5  # smaller steps for accuracy, ensures we capture all change points
max_point = 1000

# Generate critical points where floor*(x/(2.5)) and floor*(x/6.25) change
points = set()
n = 0
while n * step <= max_point:
    points.add(n * step)
    n += 1
sorted_points = sorted(points)

# Function to compute the floor expressions
def floor_divs(x):
    a = math.floor(x / 2.5)
    b = math.floor(x / 6.25)
    return a, b

# For each interval between critical points, the floors are constant, so set measure can be integrated directly.
for i in range(len(sorted_points) - 1):
    left = sorted_points[i]
    right = sorted_points[i + 1]
    # Compute floor values at the start of interval
    a, b = floor_divs(left + 1e-10)  # slight offset to get the correct interval floor
    # Determine where floors change within the interval
    # For simplicity, assume floors stay constant within each small subinterval
    # Measure of the set within [left, right]
    measure = right - left
    # The set is where Nx/Nx equals a and b respectively
    # For this approximate enumeration, consider measure segments where conditions hold
    # The condition:
    # floor(x/2.5)/2.5 = floor(x/6.25)
    # Actually, the problem says:
    # floor((floor(x/2.5))/2.5) equal to floor(x/6.25)
    # Let's check when these are equal in the interval
    if a // 2.5 == b:
        print(f"Possible measure: {measure:.3f} where floors are a={a} and b={b}")
