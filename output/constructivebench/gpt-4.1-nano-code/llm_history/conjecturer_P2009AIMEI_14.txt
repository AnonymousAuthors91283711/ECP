theorem P2009AIMEI_14 :
  IsLeast {S₂ : ℕ | ∃ (a : Fin 350 → ℕ) (_ : ∀ i, a i ∈ ({1, 2, 3, 4} : Set ℕ)) 
    (_ : ∑ i, a i = 513) (_ : ∑ i, (a i)^4 = 4745), S₂ = ∑ i, (a i)^2} 
  P2009AIMEI_14_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Counts: c1=226, c2=85, c3=39, c4=0, S2=917
Counts: c1=215, c2=112, c3=18, c4=5, S2=905
Minimum S2: 905 with counts (215, 112, 18, 5). Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The counts for c1, c2, c3, c4 are minimized when c4=5, leading toward the minimal S2=905. The minimal sum of squares corresponds to these counts, with specific selections summing to total 513 and total 4745 of the fourth powers. Based on enumeration and minimization, the answer is when most of the elements are 1, then 2, 3, with exactly 5 fours to minimize the sum of squares. 

Thus, the minimal S2 with these constraints appears as:

<<<905>>>
