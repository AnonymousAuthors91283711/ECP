The problem involves finding triplets of positive integers (a, b, c) such that:
- a, b, c > 0
- (a + b)^4 is divisible by c
- (b + c)^4 is divisible by a
- (c + a)^4 is divisible by b
- a + b + c is prime

We want to enumerate some solutions to observe their structure, focusing on small values to gain insight.

```python
# Enumerate small positive integers a, b, c
# Check the divisibility conditions and whether a + b + c is prime
import sympy

def is_prime(n):
    return sympy.isprime(n)

# Set maximum bounds for enumeration
max_value = 20

solutions = []

for a in range(1, max_value + 1):
    for b in range(1, max_value + 1):
        for c in range(1, max_value + 1):
            s1 = (a + b) ** 4
            s2 = (b + c) ** 4
            s3 = (c + a) ** 4
            if s1 % c == 0 and s2 % a == 0 and s3 % b == 0:
                total = a + b + c
                if is_prime(total):
                    print(f"Found: (a={a}, b={b}, c={c}), sum={total} (prime)")
```
