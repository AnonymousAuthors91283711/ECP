Ground Truth Answer: fun pairs => ∃ (p : ℚ × ℚ), p ∈ pairs ∧ (73 + 82 + 85 + p.1 + p.2) / 5 < 80
Proposed Answer: fun pairs => ∃ p, p ∈ pairs ∧ p.1 + p.2 < 160
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

The ground truth answer checks for the existence of a pair p in pairs where:
(73 + 82 + 85 + p.1 + p.2)/5 < 80

The proposed answer checks for:
p.1 + p.2 < 160

Let's simplify the ground truth condition:
(73 + 82 + 85 + p.1 + p.2)/5 < 80
=> (240 + p.1 + p.2)/5 < 80
=> 240 + p.1 + p.2 < 400
=> p.1 + p.2 < 160

This is exactly the same as the proposed answer's condition. The algebraic simplification shows they are mathematically equivalent.
