Sum at 0: 1396.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The polynomials P and Q share the same quadratic form with leading coefficient 2 and -2, and their evaluations at 16 and 20 suggest symmetry, leading to their sums at 0 being twice a common constant. The sum at 0 is 2 * 698 = 1396.0. Thus, the closed form, derived from the pattern, is:

<<<2 * (698)>>

/--  
Since the coefficients and evaluations are symmetric, the sum at zero simplifies to twice the constant term 698.

Sum at 0: 1396.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the symmetric evaluations and coefficients, the sum at 0, which is the sum of the constant terms of P and Q, is 2 * 698 = 1396. Therefore, the closed-form answer for the sum at zero is 1396. Since the answer should be a real number (ℝ), we fix the proposal to directly use that value. 

Correct the original answer to be a pure real constant, without unnecessary comments or undefined tokens, and ensure it compiles.

<<<1396>>>
