Ground Truth Answer: 3
Proposed Answer: 1
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a set of triples (t₁, t₂, t₃) where each component is defined in terms of the sign function applied to sums of other components.

2. The sign function is defined to return 1 for positive inputs, 0 for zero, and -1 for negative inputs.

3. The ground truth answer is 3, suggesting there are three distinct solutions to this system of equations.

4. The proposed answer is 1, suggesting only one solution exists.

Looking at the structure of the equations:
- The equations are symmetric in t₂ and t₃
- The sign function can take only three values (-1, 0, 1)
- For each possible value of sign(t₂ + t₃), we can potentially get different solutions

Given the symmetry and the three possible cases for the sign function, it's reasonable that there would be three distinct solutions (one for each case of the sign function). The proposed answer of 1 is incorrect as it doesn't account for all cases.
