theorem P2007AMCB_4 : 
  ∃ (w b r : ℚ), w + b + r = 1 ∧ w / b = 16 / 3 ∧ b / r = 3 / 1 ∧ w = P2007AMCB_4_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Exact solution:
w = 4/5
b = 3/20
r = 1/20
Candidate: w = 0.80000, b = 0.15000, r = 0.05000
Sum: 1
Valid candidate with sum ≈ 1
Candidate: w = 0.81600, b = 0.15300, r = 0.05100
Sum: 51/50
Candidate: w = 0.78400, b = 0.14700, r = 0.04900
Sum: 49/50. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The given ratios suggest a proportional relationship among w, b, r, with w = (16/3) * b, and b = 3 * r. Solving these with the sum constraint w + b + r = 1 yields the exact values w = 4/5, b = 3/20, r = 1/20. The formula established from the pattern is: w = 4/5, b = 3/20, r = 1/20. 

Final expression:
<<<(4/5 : ℚ)>>>
