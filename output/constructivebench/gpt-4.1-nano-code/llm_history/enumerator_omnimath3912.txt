This problem involves a sequence \(a\) over a finite interval with recursive relations, boundary conditions, and a parameter \(n \geq 3\). The goal is to determine for which \(n\) such an \(a\) exists satisfying these relations, particularly whether the conditions are equivalent to \(n\) belonging to some set.

To help analyze the problem, I will examine small values of \(n\) starting from 3 onwards, attempting to construct or disprove the existence of such sequences, focusing on the recurrence relation:

\[ a_{i+2} = a_{i} \times a_{i+1} + 1 \quad \text{for } i=0,1,\ldots,n-1 \]

with boundary conditions:

\[
a_n = a_0, \quad a_{n+1} = a_1
\]

This suggests a closed form or recurring pattern might exist for sequences of length \(n+2\) with these relations.

The plan:
- Fix some small initial values for \(a_0, a_1\),
- Generate the sequence \(a\) using the recurrence rule,
- Check whether boundary conditions \(a_{n} = a_0\) and \(a_{n+1} = a_1\) are satisfied,
- Record the values of \(n\) where these hold.

Efficiency considerations:
- Limit seed values to small rational or integer values (like 1 or 2),
- For each \(n\), verify whether a sequence with the boundary conditions closes properly.

This approach helps identify candidate \(n\) values that satisfy the cyclical boundary conditions, informing conjectures about the set \(\text{omnimath3912_answer}\).

```python
# Search for sequence length n+2 satisfying the recurrence and boundary conditions
# We'll test small initial values for a0 and a1 to find possible n
# For each n from 3 up to a limit (e.g., 20), check if such sequence exists

max_n = 20
initial_values = [(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)]  # test small seeds

def check_sequence(n, a0, a1):
    a = [a0, a1]
    # Generate sequence up to a_{n+1}
    for i in range(n):
        a_next = a[i] * a[i+1] + 1
        a.append(a_next)
    # Check boundary conditions
    return a[n] == a0 and a[n+1] == a1

results = []

for n in range(3, max_n + 1):
    found = False
    for a0, a1 in initial_values:
        if check_sequence(n, a0, a1):
            print(f"n = {n} with seed (a0, a1) = ({a0}, {a1}) satisfies boundary conditions.")
            results.append(n)
            found = True
            break  # no need to check other seeds if one works
    if not found:
        print(f"n = {n} has no sequence with simple initial seeds satisfying conditions.")

print("Candidate n values where such a sequence exists:", results)
```

This code streams solutions for small \(n\), revealing which lengths satisfy the boundary conditions with simple seed values, thus aiding in conjecturing the structure of \(\text{omnimath3912_answer}\).
