. Enumerated answers: Sample c(n) values for n=1..21: {1: 1, 2: 1, 3: -1, 4: 1, 5: 1, 6: -1, 7: 1, 8: 1, 9: 1, 10: 1, 11: -1, 12: -1, 13: -1, 14: 1, 15: -1, 16: 1, 17: 1, 18: 1, 19: -1, 20: 1, 21: 1}
Sum of c(n)*c(n+2) from n=1 to 2013: -1
. Expected Answer Type: ℤ
The pattern suggests c(n) * c(n+2) alternates with n, leading to a total sum of -1 over the range; consistent with convolution behavior and recursive signs.  
Final answer: <<<-1>>>
