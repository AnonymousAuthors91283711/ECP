The problem involves solving a system of equations involving logarithms and variables x, y, z. Although the code snippet appears to be in a formal proof assistant style (like Lean), the core of the problem is to find solutions to these equations:

1. x + log₁₀ x = y - 1
2. y + log₁₀(y - 1) = z - 1
3. z + log₁₀(z - 2) = x + 2

Because of the cyclic structure, we hypothesize that the solutions might be symmetric or exhibit some pattern. Let's try small positive samples respecting domain constraints:

- x > 0 (since log₁₀ x is defined)
- y - 1 > 0 → y > 1
- z - 2 > 0 → z > 2

Our task is to enumerate candidate solutions within a reasonable range and identify which satisfy all equations exactly or approximately.

```python
import math

def equations(x, y, z):
    eq1 = x + math.log10(x) - (y - 1)
    eq2 = y + math.log10(y - 1) - (z - 1)
    eq3 = z + math.log10(z - 2) - (x + 2)
    return eq1, eq2, eq3

# Search space ranges, small for efficiency
x_candidates = [i * 0.1 for i in range(1, 50)]  # x in (0.1, 5.0)
for x in x_candidates:
    for y_int in range(int(1 + 0.1 / 0.01), 100):  # starting y > 1
        y = y_int * 0.1
        if y <= 1:
            continue
        eq1_val = x + math.log10(x) - (y - 1)
        # Determine y approximate matching by solving eq1 ≈ 0
        if abs(eq1_val) > 0.01:
            continue
        for z_int in range(int(2 + 0.1 / 0.01), 100):
            z = z_int * 0.1
            if z <= 2:
                continue
            eq2_val = y + math.log10(y - 1) - (z - 1)
            if abs(eq2_val) > 0.01:
                continue
            eq3_val = z + math.log10(z - 2) - (x + 2)
            if abs(eq3_val) < 0.01:
                print(f"Candidate solution: x={x:.2f}, y={y:.2f}, z={z:.2f}")
```
