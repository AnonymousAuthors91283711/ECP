Ground Truth Answer: 15/4
Proposed Answer: (3/4) + (9/4)
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer (3/4) + (9/4) simplifies to 12/4, which further simplifies to 3. However, the ground truth answer is 15/4 (3.75). Since 3 ≠ 3.75, the answers are not equivalent. 

Wait, I made a calculation error. (3/4) + (9/4) = 12/4 = 3, but the ground truth is 15/4 = 3.75. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.

<<<False>>>
