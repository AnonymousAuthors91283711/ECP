This problem involves analyzing a function \(A(n)\) counting certain integers \(m\) with specific properties linked to \(n\). Given the complexity and the pattern of the properties, a good approach is to explore small values of \(n\) and relevant \(m\), observing the pattern in \(A(n)\) to conjecture whether \(A(n)\) is odd or even, leading to insights about \(\text{omnimath3985_answer}(n)\). 

We'll generate answers for small \(n \geq 2\), check their parity, and print each enumeration. The code will:
- Iterate over small \(n\) (e.g., 2 to 5).
- For each \(n\), find all \(m \leq n^3\) with \(m > 0\) that satisfy the condition.
- Output the set size \(A(n)\) immediately when computed.
- Comment on the pattern to assist in conjecture.

This approach prioritizes correctness, visibility, and efficiency by limiting computation to small ranges.

```python
# Explores the values of A(n) for small n, checks their parity.
# This helps in conjecturing the behavior of omnimath3985_answer(n).

def distance(a, b):
    return abs(a - b)

def satisfies_condition(n, m):
    n_int = n
    n_cubed = n ** 3
    if m == 0 or m > n_cubed:
        return False
    # Compute n' / m and n_cubed / m as integers (integer division)
    if n_int % m != 0 or n_cubed % m != 0:
        return False
    sum_m_in_n = n_int // m
    sum_m_in_n_cubed = n_cubed // m
    return distance(n_int, m * sum_m_in_n) == distance(n_cubed, m * sum_m_in_n_cubed)

for n in range(2, 6):  # small n for exploration
    A_n_set = []
    n_cubed = n ** 3
    for m in range(1, n_cubed + 1):
        if satisfies_condition(n, m):
            A_n_set.append(m)
    A_n = len(A_n_set)
    print(f"n={n}, A(n)={A_n}, m's={A_n_set}")
```
