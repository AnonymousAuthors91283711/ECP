This problem appears to involve a sequence \( t(k) \) defined recursively with a constant difference \( d \), with given values at \( t(3) \) and \( t(n-2) \), and a sum over the sequence. The goal likely is to find \( n \) given these constraints. 

Given the sequence \( t \), where \( t(k+1) = t(k) + d \), for some \( d \), then \( t(k) = t(1) + (k-1)d \). Using the given conditions \( t(3) = 5 \) and \( t(n-2) = 95 \), and the sum constraint, we will attempt to find plausible \( n \).

To facilitate this, I'll:

- Assume the sequence is arithmetic \( t(k) = a + (k-1)d \).
- Express the sum in terms of \( a, d, n \).
- Enumerate small sample values of \( n \) that satisfy the sum constraint.

Here's the Python code implementing the enumeration, based on the above reasoning:

```python
# Enumerate possible sequence parameters and solve for n based on sum constraints
# t(k) = a + (k-1)d, with known t(3)=5 and t(n-2)=95
# sum_{k=0}^{n-1} t(k+1) = 1000

def main():
    results = []
    # Assuming small initial a and d, as large values unlikely given sum constraints
    for a in range(1, 50):
        for d in range(1, 50):
            # From t(3)=a+2d=5 => a=5-2d
            a_candidate = 5 - 2 * d
            if a_candidate <= 0:
                continue  # a should be positive for sequence values
            a = a_candidate
            # From t(n-2)=a+(n-3)d=95 => (n-3)= (95 - a)/d
            if (95 - a) % d != 0:
                continue
            n_minus_3 = (95 - a) // d
            n = n_minus_3 + 3
            if n <= 5:
                continue  # As per hn: 5 < n
            # sum of sequence:
            # sum_{k=1}^{n} t(k) = sum_{k=1}^{n} [a + (k-1)d]
            sum_seq = n * a + d * (n - 1) * n // 2
            if sum_seq == 1000:
                print(f"Found: n={n}, a={a}, d={d}")
                results.append(n)
    if results:
        print(f"Possible n values: {results}")
    else:
        print("No solutions found with small parameters.")

main()
```
