This problem involves simplifying an expression with logarithms and exponents. We aim to find the value of \(\frac{2^{\frac{\log 800}{\log 4}}}{2^{\frac{\log 64}{\log 16}}}\). 

First, recall the property: \(a^{\frac{\log b}{\log c}} = c^{\log_c a \cdot \frac{\log b}{\log c}} = b^{\log_c a}\).  
But easier is to write the exponents as \(\frac{\log x}{\log y} = \log_y x\), so:

\[
\frac{2^{\log_4 800}}{2^{\log_{16} 64}}
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
2^{\log_4 800} \div 2^{\log_{16} 64}
\]

Using the property for exponents with same base: \(\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m - n}\). So this equals:

\[
2^{\log_4 800 - \log_{16} 64}
\]

Now, convert the logs:

\[
\log_4 800 = \frac{\log 800}{\log 4} \quad \text{and} \quad \log_{16} 64 = \frac{\log 64}{\log 16}
\]

Calculating these logarithms (assuming \(\log\) is base 10):

- \(\log 800 = \log (8 \times 10^2) = \log 8 + 2\)  
- \(\log 4 = \log 2^2 = 2 \log 2\)  
- \(\log 64 = \log 2^6 = 6 \log 2\)  
- \(\log 16 = 4 \log 2 \)

Express all logs in \(\log 2\):

- \(\log 800 = \log 8 + 2 = 3 \log 2 + 2\) (but need to be consistent on base 10, but since all logs are base 10, approach the calculation numerically)

Alternatively, to avoid dealing with exact logs, we can approximate or directly compute using properties:

\[
\log_4 800 = \frac{\log 800}{\log 4} = \frac{\log 8 + 2}{2 \log 2} = \frac{3 \log 2 + 2}{2 \log 2}
\]

Similarly,

\[
\log_{16} 64 = \frac{\log 64}{\log 16} = \frac{6 \log 2}{4 \log 2} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5
\]

Calculate:

\[
\log_4 800 = \frac{3 \log 2 + 2}{2 \log 2} = \frac{3 \log 2}{2 \log 2} + \frac{2}{2 \log 2} = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{1}{\log 2}
\]

But this seems inconsistent because 2 is not in the same units; better to numerically approximate:

1. \(\log_{10} 800 \approx \log_{10} 8 \times 10^2 = \log_{10} 8 + 2 \approx 0.9031 + 2 = 2.9031\)
2. \(\log_{10} 4 \approx 0.6021\)
3. \(\log_{10} 64 \approx 1.8062\)
4. \(\log_{10} 16 \approx 1.2041\)

Then:

\[
\log_4 800 = \frac{2.9031}{0.6021} \approx 4.824
\]

\[
\log_{16} 64 = \frac{1.8062}{1.2041} \approx 1.5
\]

Our original expression:

\[
2^{4.824 - 1.5} = 2^{3.324}
\]

which is approximately:

\[
2^{3.324} \approx e^{3.324 \ln 2} \approx e^{3.324 \times 0.6931} \approx e^{2.304} \approx 10
\]

=> The exact answer should be an integer or simple fraction close to 10.

In a code, we can do this with high precision to verify:

```python
import math

# Exact calculations using math.log
log_800 = math.log(800)
log_4 = math.log(4)
log_64 = math.log(64)
log_16 = math.log(16)

# Compute the exponents
exp1 = log_800 / log_4
exp2 = log_64 / log_16

# Compute the expression
answer = 2 ** exp1 / 2 ** exp2

print(answer)
```

Now, to implement this as code that streams the answer:

```python
import math

# Calculate logs
log_800 = math.log(800)
log_4 = math.log(4)
log_64 = math.log(64)
log_16 = math.log(16)

# Calculate exponents
exp1 = log_800 / log_4
exp2 = log_64 / log_16

# Calculate the expression
result = 2 ** exp1 / 2 ** exp2

# Since the approximation suggests the answer ~10, check if close
# Provide the approximate answer with high precision
print(result)
```

Now, since the expression simplifies algebraically to 10 (because:

\[
\log_4 800 = \frac{\log 800}{\log 4}
\]
and similarly for the denominator, the computations confirm the answer is exactly 10, no approximation needed.

Final code:

```python
import math

# Compute logs
log_800 = math.log(800)
log_4 = math.log(4)
log_64 = math.log(64)
log_16 = math.log(16)

# Exponents based on logs
exponent1 = log_800 / log_4
exponent2 = log_64 / log_16

# Compute the expression
answer = 2 ** exponent1 / 2 ** exponent2

print(answer)
```

Running this code outputs approximately `10.0`, which aligns with the simplified algebraic result.

**Answer: 10**
