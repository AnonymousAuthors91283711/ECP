This problem involves finding all positive integer pairs (x, y) satisfying the equation:

\[ 9(x^2 + y^2 + 1) + 2(3xy + 2) = 2005 \]

Expanding and simplifying:
\[ 9x^2 + 9y^2 + 9 + 6xy + 4 = 2005 \]
\[ 9x^2 + 9y^2 + 6xy = 2005 - 13 = 1992 \]

Divide both sides by 1 (no change). The left can be reorganized as:
\[ 9x^2 + 6xy + 9y^2 = 1992 \]

Factor out 3:
\[ 3(3x^2 + 2xy + 3y^2) = 1992 \]
\[ 3x^2 + 2xy + 3y^2 = 664 \]

Now, the approach:
- Iterate over small positive integers x and y up to a limit where the expression exceeds 664.
- For each pair, check if the equation holds.
- Print matching pairs immediately.

Here's the code:

```python
# Enumerate positive integer pairs (x, y) satisfying the given equation
# Equation: 9(x^2 + y^2 + 1) + 2(3xy + 2) = 2005
# Simplified form: 9x^2 + 9y^2 + 6xy = 1992

max_value = 40  # upper bound for x, y to limit search
for x in range(1, max_value + 1):
    for y in range(1, max_value + 1):
        val = 9 * (x**2 + y**2 + 1) + 2 * (3 * x * y + 2)
        if val == 2005:
            print((x, y))
```

This code searches efficiently over small ranges, printing all solutions as it finds them.
