Ground Truth Answer: 11 / 65
Proposed Answer: 65
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives two equations involving x and y, and asks for the value of |x| + |y|.

2. The ground truth answer is 11/65 ≈ 0.1692

3. The proposed answer is 65, which is vastly different from 11/65.

4. The proposed answer doesn't make sense in context because:
   - |x| + |y| is a sum of absolute values, which should be non-negative
   - But 65 is much larger than what we'd expect from the given equations
   - The equations suggest the solution should involve fractions with denominators related to 56² + 33² = 3136 + 1089 = 4225 = 65²

5. The correct answer (11/65) comes from solving the system and recognizing that the magnitude of the solution vector is 11/65.

The proposed answer is completely different from the correct answer, so they are not equivalent.
