The set of n satisfying the conditions is all n between 1 and 24 excluding perfect squares (since n = a² - b²). Non-square n can be written as a difference of two squares iff n ≡ 2 or 3 mod 4. The only non-square n in (0,25) are those ≡ 2 or 3 mod 4, excluding perfect squares. Counting n = 2,3,6,7,10,11,14,15,18,19,22,23 (12 in total). The pattern suggests the answer is the largest such n, which is 23.

Therefore:

<<<23>>>
