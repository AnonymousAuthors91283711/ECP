The problem involves computing the value of the expression \( 9901 \times 101 - 99 \times 10101 \). We can directly compute these products and the difference to find the answer. Since the task is to list possible answers and be explicit, I'll write a Python script that calculates and prints the answer, ensuring clarity and correctness.

```python
# Calculate the expression: 9901 * 101 - 99 * 10101
# Compute each term separately for clarity
term1 = 9901 * 101
term2 = 99 * 10101
answer = term1 - term2

# Print the computed answer
print(answer)
```
