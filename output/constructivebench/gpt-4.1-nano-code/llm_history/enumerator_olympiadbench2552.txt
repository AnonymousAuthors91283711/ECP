The given proof involves rational numbers and a sum of fractions. Our goal is to compute the sum and present the exact answer. Since the problem wants to derive the answer step-by-step and output answers immediately, weâ€™ll perform rational addition, simplify, and output the result directly. The problem doesn't specify parameters or a range; it simply asks to compute this sum.

Let's compute the sum:

(2/5) + (5/2) + 1/(2*5) = 2/5 + 5/2 + 1/10.

We can convert everything to a common denominator (say, 10):

- 2/5 = 4/10,
- 5/2 = 25/10,
- 1/10 stays the same.

Sum = 4/10 + 25/10 + 1/10 = (4 + 25 + 1)/10 = 30/10 = 3.

Therefore, the answer is 3.

Here's the Python program that computes and streams this answer:

```python
# This program computes the sum of fractions and outputs the result immediately.
from fractions import Fraction

# Calculate each term
term1 = Fraction(2, 5)
term2 = Fraction(5, 2)
term3 = Fraction(1, 2 * 5)

# Sum the fractions
total = term1 + term2 + term3

# Output the answer immediately
print(total)
```
