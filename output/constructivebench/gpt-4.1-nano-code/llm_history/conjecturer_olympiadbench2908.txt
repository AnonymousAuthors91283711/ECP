abbrev olympiadbench2908_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem olympiadbench2908 : 
  2^(log 800 / log 4) / 2^(log 64 / log 16) = olympiadbench2908_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 10.000000000000002. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The expression simplifies to (800^(1/log4)) / (64^(1/log16)). Recognizing 800 = 8 * 100, and rewriting logs, the ratio simplifies to 10.

<<<10>>>
