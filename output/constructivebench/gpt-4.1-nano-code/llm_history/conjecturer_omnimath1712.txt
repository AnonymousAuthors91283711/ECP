Given the pattern, \( f \) is exponential: \( f(x) = a^x \). With \( f(19) = 524288 \times k \), i.e., \( a^{19} = 524288 \times k \), so \( a = (524288 \times k)^{1/19} \). Then \( f(4) = a^4 = ( (524288 \times k)^{1/19} )^4 = (524288 \times k)^{4/19} \). Since \( 524288 = 2^{19} \), the formula simplifies to \( 2^{(19) \times (4/19)} \times k^{4/19} = 2^{4} \times k^{4/19} = 16 \times k^{4/19} \).

The core idea is to express the answer as the explicit function \(f(4)\) in terms of \(k\), given that \(f\) is exponential and satisfies the functional equation \(f(x+y) = f(x)f(y)\) with positivity. From the pattern, \(f(19) = 524288 \times k\), and since \(f\) is exponential, this allows us to infer \(f(4) = (f(19))^{4/19} = (524288 \times k)^{4/19}\). Recognizing \(524288 = 2^{19}\), we deduce:

\[f(4) = (2^{19} \times k)^{4/19} = 2^{(19 \times 4/19)} \times k^{4/19} = 2^{4} \times k^{4/19} = 16 \times k^{4/19}.\]

The correct Lean expression should be a lambda function over \(\mathbb{R}\) taking \(k\) to \(16 \times k^{4/19}\), which aligns with the pattern observed in the enumerated answers and the exponential form of \(f\).
