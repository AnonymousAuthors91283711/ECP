The problem appears to involve counting permutations of 7 elements with a specific property related to inequalities involving elements and their images under the permutation. To understand the question better, it’s about the set of permutations σ of {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} (indices as Fin 7) where for each i in {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} (Fin 6), the permutation satisfies σ(i) ≤ σ(i+1) + 1.

In simpler terms: for each position i from 0 to 5, the image of i under the permutation is at most 1 greater than the image of i+1. We want to count how many such permutations exist.

Approach:
- Enumerate all permutations of 7 elements.
- Count how many satisfy the conditions.
- Since the total number of permutations is 7! = 5040, a brute-force enumeration is feasible.
- Additionally, to improve efficiency, check the conditions as we generate permutations (backtracking).

Here's a Python script that enumerates all permutations of [0,1,2,3,4,5,6], checks the condition, and counts the valid ones while printing each valid permutation. It focuses on understanding the count, which directly gives us the answer to the problem.

```python
from itertools import permutations

def is_valid(perm):
    # Check the inequality condition for positions 0..5
    for i in range(6):
        if perm[i] > perm[i+1] + 1:
            return False
    return True

def main():
    count = 0
    answer = None
    for p in permutations(range(7)):
        if is_valid(p):
            count += 1
            print(p)  # Stream each valid permutation
    answer = count
    print("Total valid permutations:", answer)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code enumerates all permutations, prints each one that satisfies the condition, and outputs the total count. This total is the answer to the cardinality of the set described in the problem.
