This problem asks us to compute the sum of reciprocals of all positive divisors of 144, i.e., \(\sum_{d\mid 144, d>0} \frac{1}{d}\). Our goal is to enumerate potential answers and help formulate or verify the exact value.

Since 144's divisors are finite, let's iterate over all positive divisors of 144, compute their reciprocals, and sum.

```python
# Enumerate all positive divisors of 144
def divisors(n):
    divs = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divs.append(i)
    return divs

# Compute sum of reciprocals
n = 144
divs = divisors(n)
results = []

sum_reciprocals = 0
for d in divs:
    reciprocal = 1 / d
    print(f"Divisor: {d}, Reciprocal: {reciprocal}")
    sum_reciprocals += reciprocal

print(f"Sum of reciprocals: {sum_reciprocals}")
```
