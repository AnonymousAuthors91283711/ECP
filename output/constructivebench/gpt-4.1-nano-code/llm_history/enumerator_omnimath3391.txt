The problem involves verifying whether \(9^4 = 6561\). To assist in conjecturing, we'll generate candidates for \(9^4\), compare with known powers, and print possible matches or approximate values. Since the question explicitly states the equality, our enumeration will confirm the exact value, without hardcoding, by computing \(9^n\) for small \(n\) and comparing to \(6561\).

```python
# Enumerate small powers of 9 to confirm 9^4, approximate others
for n in range(1, 10):
    value = 9 ** n
    print(f"9^{n} = {value}")
    if value == 6561:
        print(f"Found exact match at 9^{n}")
```
