This problem appears to be a high-level set-theoretic and functional analysis question involving real numbers, functions, and properties like scaling and composition. To assist with conjecturing the answer, I will create a Python script that enumerates potential values of the parameter \( a \), the function \( f \), and relevant points \( x \) satisfying the given properties. Since the problem involves real-valued functions and parameters, and the functional equations suggest linear or quadratic forms, I will test small sample values for \( a \), and simple functions \( f \), to get an idea of the solutions.

Specifically, the code will:
- Examine small sample values of \( a \) (like 0, 1, -1, 2, 0.5).
- For each \( a \), especially those where properties simplify, test candidate functions \( f \) such as linear functions \( f(x) = c x \).
- Check if the conditions (existence of \( x \) with \( f x \neq x \), the scaling relation, and the compositional relation) hold.
- Print all candidates meeting the conditions for exploration.

This approach aims to find possible solutions, aiding in conjecture generation.

```python
import math

# Sample parameter values for 'a'
a_values = [0, 1, -1, 2, 0.5]

# Function to test a candidate linear function f(x) = c * x
def test_linear_function(a, c):
    # Condition 1: Exists x such that f(x) ≠ x
    # Choose x = 1 for simplicity
    x = 1
    if c != 1:
        exists_x_with_f_x_not_x = True
        test_x = x
    else:
        exists_x_with_f_x_not_x = False
        test_x = None
    
    # Condition 2: f(a * x) = a^2 * f(x)
    # For linear f, f(a*x) = c * (a * x) = c * a * x
    # a^2 * f(x) = a^2 * c * x
    # So the condition reduces to c * a * x == a^2 * c * x
    # For x ≠ 0, divide both sides by c * x (if c != 0)
    # c * a == a^2 * c => always true if c ≠ 0 or both sides zero
    condition2 = True
    if c == 0:
        # f constant zero always satisfies the scaling? Let's verify
        # f(a*x) = 0, a^2 * f(x) = 0
        condition2 = True
    
    # Condition 3: f(f(x)) = a * f(x)
    # For linear f: f(f(x)) = c * (c * x) = c^2 * x
    # a * f(x) = a * c * x
    # So c^2 * x = a * c * x
    # For x ≠ 0: c^2 = a * c => c(c - a) = 0
    # solutions: c = 0 or c = a
    c_solutions = [0, a]
    
    # Confirm if current c matches the solution
    if c not in c_solutions:
        return False
    
    # Return all info
    return {
        'a': a,
        'c': c,
        'exists_x_with_f_x_not_x': exists_x_with_f_x_not_x,
        'condition2': condition2,
        'condition3': True
    }

# Enumerate candidate solutions
for a in a_values:
    for c in [a, 0, 1, -1]:  # Test some plausible c's
        result = test_linear_function(a, c)
        if result:
            print(f"Found candidate for a={a}, c={c}: {result}")
```
