The probability that at least one value occurs ≥ 3 times among four independent choices from 6 options is 1 minus the probability that all are ≤ 2 times. Counting only those with count ≥ 3 gives 6 choices where 'd d' is fixed at value x, totaling 6/6^4; summing these as the measure results in 1/6^3, which simplifies to 1/216.
