[write_program]
This problem involves solving a system of equations involving absolute values and differences of real numbers. The goal is to enumerate possible solutions and conjecture the value of \(|a - d| + |b - c|\).

Observations:
- The given equalities involve sums of absolute differences:
  1. \( |a - b| + |c - d| = 99 \)
  2. \( |a - c| + |b - d| = 1 \)

- We need to find potential values for \( |a - d| + |b - c| \).

To explore systematically, I'll choose small sample values for \(a, b, c, d\) satisfying the constraints and compute the target expression. Since the challenge is to handle absolute values, I'll test particular configurations that satisfy the constraints, paying particular attention to situations where the sums are minimal or maximal, expecting the quantities are constrained.

Here's a small enumeration focusing on key cases, especially considering the symmetry and potential relations between the variables.

```python
# Enumerate potential solutions by assigning small values that satisfy the constraints
# and compute |a - d| + |b - c| for each case.

# To cover the possibilities, pick some small integers for a,b,c,d satisfying the constraints.
# Since the sums are fixed, choose values to satisfy them, then find corresponding d.

# List to store computed values for |a - d| + |b - c|
results = set()

# Try different configurations of a,b,c:
for a in range(-100, 101):
    for b in range(-100, 101):
        for c in range(-100, 101):
            # For each (a, b, c), find d satisfying the constraints
            # From h1: |a - b| + |c - d| = 99
            # Thus, |c - d| = 99 - |a - b|

            diff_ab = abs(a - b)
            remaining = 99 - diff_ab
            if remaining < 0:
                continue
            # For |c - d| to be remaining, d must satisfy: |c - d| = remaining
            # So d can be c + remaining or c - remaining
            for delta in [remaining, -remaining]:
                d = c + delta
                # Check h2: |a - c| + |b - d| = 1
                if abs(a - c) + abs(b - d) == 1:
                    # Compute |a - d| + |b - c|
                    val = abs(a - d) + abs(b - c)
                    print(val)
                    results.add(val)

# Output all distinct answers found
# (Will be a small finite set due to bounded enumeration)
```

This code exhaustively searches within feasible small integer ranges, checking the constraints and recording the values of \(|a - d| + |b - c|\). It enables us to observe the possible values this sum can take, offering data to conjecture and eventually prove the true answer.

The enumeration is designed to provide runtime efficiency by limiting the search space and avoiding redundant calculations.

Full code (consistent with the instructions) is above.
