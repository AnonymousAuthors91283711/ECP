This problem appears to involve analyzing pairs of positive integers \(a, b\) satisfying a specific logical condition involving their order and a certain equation. The goal is to find the least sum \(s = a + b\) for which such a pair exists, given the condition encoded in \(P a b\).

Given the statement:
- \(a, b > 0\),
- \(a \neq b\),
- Depending on whether \(a < b\) or not, the relationship:
\[
\begin{cases}
(a - 20)(b + 23) = a b & \text{if } a < b, \\
(b - 20)(a + 23) = a b & \text{if } a > b,
\end{cases}
\]
must hold.

We seek the minimal sum \(s = a + b\) among all such pairs.

Approach:
- Loop through small positive integers \(a, b\), perhaps up to a certain threshold.
- For each pair, check if it satisfies the conditions.
- Keep track of the minimal \(a + b\).

This is a brute-force enumeration, prioritizing finding the minimal sum, and can be efficiently limited.

```python
# Enumerate small pairs (a, b) to find the minimum sum satisfying the conditions
# We assume positive integers up to some limit (say 200) for feasibility
limit = 200
min_sum = None
answer_pairs = []

for a in range(1, limit+1):
    for b in range(1, limit+1):
        if a == b:
            continue
        if a > 0 and b > 0:
            if a < b:
                # Check the first condition
                if (a - 20) * (b + 23) == a * b:
                    s = a + b
                    print(s)
                    if min_sum is None or s < min_sum:
                        min_sum = s
                        answer_pairs = [(a, b)]
                    elif s == min_sum:
                        answer_pairs.append((a, b))
            else:
                # Check the second condition
                if (b - 20) * (a + 23) == a * b:
                    s = a + b
                    print(s)
                    if min_sum is None or s < min_sum:
                        min_sum = s
                        answer_pairs = [(a, b)]
                    elif s == min_sum:
                        answer_pairs.append((a, b))
# After enumeration, min_sum holds the minimal sum among all pairs satisfying the condition.
```
