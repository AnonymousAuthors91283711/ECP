abbrev P2016AMCB_2_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem P2016AMCB_2 : 
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | ∀ k : ℕ, |(2 * 1 * 2016) / (1 + 2016 : ℝ) - n| ≤ |(2 * 1 * 2016) / (1 + 2016 : ℝ) - k|} P2016AMCB_2_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Value: 1.9990084283589489
Candidates: [1, 2]
Closest integer: 2. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The value is approximately 1.999, which is closer to 2 than to 1, so the least integer satisfying the condition is 2.  
Answer in Lean: <<<2>>>
