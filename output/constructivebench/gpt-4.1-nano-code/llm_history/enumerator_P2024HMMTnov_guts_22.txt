The problem involves finding all integers k between 1 and 50 such that there exist positive integers a, b with a > b, a - b = k, and where the gcd of a^3 - b^3 and (a - b)^3 is only divisible by 1 (i.e., gcd is 1), implying they're coprime. Since a and b are positive with a > b, a - b = k, and p (a prime) does not divide the gcd squared, we're essentially looking for cases where the gcd of a^3 - b^3 and k^3 is 1.

Note: For given k, the gcd divides both a^3 - b^3 and k^3. Because a - b = k, we can express a = b + k and analyze the gcd behavior over this parametric form.

Let's systematically enumerate k from 1 to 50:
- For each k, pick small values of b and compute gcd((a^3 - b^3), k^3), where a = b + k.
- Print out those k where the gcd is 1 for at least some (a, b).

This is an efficient approach since the search space is small (only small b's).

```python
import math

# Function to check if gcd of a^3 - b^3 and k^3 is 1 for some b
def find_k_values():
    results = []
    for k in range(1, 51):
        found_coprime = False
        for b in range(1, 50):  # limit b to keep runtime reasonable
            a = b + k
            val = math.gcd((a**3 - b**3), k**3)
            if val == 1:
                print(f'k={k} (a={a}, b={b}), gcd={val}')
                found_coprime = True
                break
        if found_coprime:
            results.append(k)
    print(f'Candidates with coprime gcd for some (a,b): {results}')

find_k_values()
```
