Let's analyze the inequality \( x^3 < x^2 \). 

Rearranging, we get \( x^3 - x^2 < 0 \Rightarrow x^2(x - 1) < 0 \). This inequality depends on the signs of \( x^2 \) and \( x - 1 \). Since \( x^2 \geq 0 \) for all real \( x \), the product \( x^2(x - 1) \) is less than zero only when \( x^2 > 0 \) (so \( x \neq 0 \)) and \( x - 1 < 0 \), i.e., \( x < 1 \). 

At \( x = 0 \), the value of \( x^3 - x^2 = 0 \). For \( x \neq 0 \), the sign switches at \( x = 0 \). Specifically, for \( 0 < x < 1 \), \( x^2 > 0 \) and \( x-1 < 0 \), so the product is negative, satisfying the inequality. For \( x > 1 \), product > 0, so inequality does not hold.

Including the boundary points, the solution set is \( x \in (-\infty, 0) \cup (0, 1) \). 

Let's write a Python program that enumerates some of these solutions or points close to the boundary, using small sample values, to help understand the solution set.

```python
# Enumerate sample values around the critical points 0 and 1
samples = [-2, -1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 0.999, 1, 1.5, 2]

# Find x where x^3 < x^2
for x in samples:
    left_side = x**3
    right_side = x**2
    if left_side < right_side:
        print(f"x = {x}: {x**3} < {x**2}")
```
