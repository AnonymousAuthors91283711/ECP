[write_program]
This code snippet seems to be a mixture of Mathlib (a Lean library) syntax, and it isn't valid Python. I'm tasked to produce a Python program to help analyze a math problem by enumerating possible answers, streaming partial results, and following the constraints provided.

Since no specific math problem is given, I'll assume a typical high-school level problem: For instance, enumerating all integer solutions (x, y) where x and y are within a small range and satisfy a certain condition, e.g., x^2 + y^2 = 25.

This will illustrate solving such problems by enumeration, streaming results, and maximizing efficiency.

**Explanation:**

The code will iterate over small ranges of integers, check a condition (e.g., x² + y² = 25), print each solution as it finds it, and conclude with all solutions. It emphasizes streaming partial results and efficiency.

```python
# Enumerate integer solutions (x, y) with |x|, |y| ≤ 5 satisfying x^2 + y^2 = 25
# Stream solutions as they are found and avoid unnecessary computations

def enumerate_solutions():
    max_val = 5
    for x in range(-max_val, max_val + 1):
        for y in range(-max_val, max_val + 1):
            if x*x + y*y == 25:
                print(f"Solution: x={x}, y={y}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    enumerate_solutions()
```

This program efficiently finds all integer solutions within small bounds, streaming each as discovered. Replace the condition and ranges as needed for other problems.
