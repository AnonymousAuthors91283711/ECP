theorem P2022AIMEII_2 :
  ∃ (p q : ℕ), Nat.Coprime p q ∧ 
  -- There are 3 possible match pairings in semifinals
  -- Case 1: Azar vs Carl and Jon vs Sergey
  let case1 := (2/3 : ℚ) * (3/4) * (3/4) + (1/3) * (3/4) * (1/4)
  -- Case 2: Azar vs Jon and Carl vs Sergey
  let case2 := (3/4) * (3/4) * (2/3) + (1/4) * (3/4) * (3/4)
  -- Case 3: Azar vs Sergey and Carl vs Jon
  let case3 := (3/4) * (3/4) * (2/3) + (1/4) * (3/4) * (3/4)
  -- Total probability is average of all cases
  (case1 + case2 + case3) / 3 = p / q ∧ q = P2022AIMEII_2_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Candidate fraction: 22/45 (approx 0.4889)
Candidate fraction: 23/47 (approx 0.4894)
Candidate fraction: 24/49 (approx 0.4898)
Exact probability: 47/96 (which is 0.4896)
. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<(47 : ℕ)>>>

The probability approximates 47/96; the numerator is 47.
