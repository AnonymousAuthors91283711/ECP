This appears to be a problem involving solving an exponential equation: \(512^x = 64^{240}\) with real \(x\).

Let's analyze it:
- \(512 = 2^9\),
- \(64 = 2^6\).

So the equation becomes:
\[
(2^9)^x = (2^6)^{240}
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
2^{9x} = 2^{6 \times 240}
\]
\[
2^{9x} = 2^{1440}
\]

Equate exponents:
\[
9x = 1440
\]

Thus:
\[
x = \frac{1440}{9} = 160
\]

We will write a Python script to verify and generate candidate solutions, including the explicit solution.

```python
# We analyze the exponential equation 512^x = 64^240
# Convert bases to powers of 2 for easier comparison:
# 512 = 2^9, 64 = 2^6
# So the equation becomes 2^{9x} = 2^{6*240}
# Which simplifies to 9x = 6*240
# Thus, x = (6*240)/9

# Generate candidate solutions
candidates = []

# Exact solution
exact_x = (6 * 240) / 9
print(exact_x)
candidates.append(exact_x)

# For testing, generate nearby rational approximations (e.g., numerator/denominator)
# Since the exact answer is rational, no need for approximations here.

# Output the solutions
for candidate in candidates:
    print(candidate)
```
