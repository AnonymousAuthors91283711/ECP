The problem appears to involve summing the prime factors of composite numbers greater than 1 and not prime, i.e., composite numbers. To enumerate possible answers, I will generate composite numbers within a small range, compute the sum of their prime factors, and print these sums. This can help conjecture the possible values of r. Since the problem's actual set is not known, I will print all sums for composite n within a reasonable small bound, say up to 100. This approach aligns with the instructions for enumeration, streaming results, and efficiency.

```python
# Enumerate composite numbers greater than 1 up to 100
# For each composite, compute the sum of its prime factors
# Print each sum immediately upon calculation

import math

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def prime_factors(n):
    factors = []
    # Factor out 2s
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors.append(2)
        n //= 2
    # Factor out odd factors
    for i in range(3, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1, 2):
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n //= i
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors

max_n = 100
# Use a set to avoid duplicate sums
sums_of_factors = set()

for n in range(4, max_n + 1):
    if not is_prime(n):  # n is composite
        factors = prime_factors(n)
        sum_factors = sum(set(factors))
        sums_of_factors.add(sum_factors)
        print(sum_factors)
```
