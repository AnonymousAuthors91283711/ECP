theorem P2011AMCA_14 :
  let pairs := Finset.product (Finset.Icc 1 9) (Finset.Icc 1 9)
  let count := pairs.filter (fun (a, b) => b > a * a - b * 1)
  (count.card : ℚ) / (pairs.card : ℚ) = P2011AMCA_14_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 22/81. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The count of pairs (a, b) with b > a^2 - b simplifies, when dividing by total pairs, to the proportion of b > a^2 / (b + 1). As a and b range from 1 to 9, the ratio is symmetric and follows the pattern from enumerations. The final fraction simplifies to 22/81. 

<<<(22 : ℚ) / 81>>>
