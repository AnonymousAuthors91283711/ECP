This problem involves characterizing the number of coprime positive integer pairs `(a, b)` satisfying `a * b = T^20 * 210^12` where `T = sqrt(26)`. Since `T` involves an irrational number, the key is to analyze the algebraic form to understand how to form `a` and `b` in terms of their prime factorizations, especially focusing on coprimality and exponents.

To assist, I'll consider small sample values of `T` and the right side, then enumerate candidate pairs `(a, b)` with `a, b > 0` that satisfy the properties.

Because the problem is complex and most of the algebra depends on prime factorizations, the code will restrict to small exponents to identify possible coprime pairs `(a, b)`. This enumeration will generate some candidate pairs and approximate the count. The approach:
- Fix small sample values for `T` (here, `sqrt(26)`).
- Compute `a * b` for a small range based on integer factors.
- Check coprimality using `gcd`.
- Output each candidate pair immediately upon validation.

```python
import math

# T is sqrt(26), so T^20 = (26)^{10}
T = math.sqrt(26)
target = T ** 20 * 210 ** 12

# Since T involves an irrational, the exact product is irrational, so in reality,
# the only relevant integer pairs (a, b) satisfying the equation as integers are likely only when the irrational parts cancel.
# For demonstration, we approximate and assume potential integer solutions are formed when the product is close to integer values.

# To help conjecture, we focus on factor pairs of the approximate value
target_int_approx = round(target)

# Limit search for potential pairs up to factors of target_int_approx
limit = int(target_int_approx ** 0.5) + 1

for a in range(1, limit):
    if target_int_approx % a == 0:
        b = target_int_approx // a
        if math.gcd(a, b) == 1:
            print(f"Candidate pair: a={a}, b={b}")
```
