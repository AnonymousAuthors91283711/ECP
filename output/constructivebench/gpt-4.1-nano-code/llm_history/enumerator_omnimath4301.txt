The problem appears to involve finding the greatest natural number N such that there exists an n with digits in base 10 of length N, satisfying a complex property about sublists and counts of digits. To enumerate possible candidates, I will focus on small N values by generating numbers with length N and checking whether the property can hold. I'll define the set of numbers with digit length N, then test the property.

Given the complexity, straightforward brute-force enumeration is preferred. We'll generate all n with the given length N (e.g., for small N) and verify the property condition. We aim to find the maximum such N.

```python
# Enumerate n by length N, check the property for each candidate, and find the maximum N where property holds.
from itertools import product

def count_d(d, s):
    return s.count(d)

def has_property(n_digits):
    s = list(n_digits)
    # check that s is a sublist of digits of n (which is n_digits),
    # here since s is a sublist of n_digits, it's trivial
    # verify s is not empty
    if not s:
        return False
    # for each sublist s, check the property:
    # exists a digit d in s with count 1 in s
    for d in set(s):
        if count_d(d, s) == 1:
            return True
    return False

max_N_found = 0
max_n = None

# Test N from N_max down to 1 to find the greatest N satisfying the property
# limit N to small values (e.g., 6) for feasible computation
for N in range(6, 0, -1):
    found_for_N = False
    # Generate all N-digit numbers (excluding leading zero)
    for digits in product(range(1,10) if N > 1 else range(0,10), repeat=N):
        # check the property
        if has_property(digits):
            print(f"Found for length N={N}: {digits} -> {''.join(map(str, digits))}")
            max_N_found = N
            found_for_N = True
    if found_for_N:
        print(f"Maximum N with property is at least {N}")
        break

print(f"Final maximum N: {max_N_found}")
```
