Ground Truth Answer: {2, 5, 13}
Proposed Answer: {n : ℕ | ∃ p : ℕ, p.Prime ∧ p ∣ n ∧ ∀ q : ℕ, q.Prime → q ≤ Real.sqrt n → q ∣ n}
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for natural numbers n that can be expressed as a sum of squares of two coprime numbers (a² + b² = n with gcd(a,b)=1), with the additional condition that every prime ≤ √n divides a*b.

2. The ground truth answer {2, 5, 13} gives specific numbers that satisfy this condition:
   - 2 = 1² + 1² (gcd(1,1)=1)
   - 5 = 1² + 2² (gcd(1,2)=1)
   - 13 = 2² + 3² (gcd(2,3)=1)

3. The proposed answer describes numbers n that have at least one prime factor p where all primes q ≤ √n divide n. This is different from the original condition.

The proposed answer would include numbers like:
- 4 (p=2, but 4 can't be expressed as sum of two coprime squares)
- 9 (p=3, same issue)
- 25 (p=5, same issue)

These don't satisfy the original condition, so the answers are not equivalent.
