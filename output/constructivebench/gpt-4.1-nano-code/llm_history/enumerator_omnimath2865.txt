The problem appears to be related to finding four digits (m, n, p, q), each between 1 and 9, such that their sum is some value. The structure suggests exploring sums of four digits in that range to determine possible values, possibly seeking either the minimum, maximum, or specific sums.

Given the constraints and the goal, I will enumerate all quadruples (m, n, p, q) with the specified bounds, compute their sums, and find the maximum sum. This approach aligns with maximizing the total sum of four digits between 1 and 9.

```python
# Enumerate all quadruples of digits m, n, p, q with 1 ≤ digit ≤ 9
# Find and print all possible sums, focusing on maximum sum
# This helps in deducing the maximum total of four digits in the range

max_sum = 0
for m in range(1, 10):
    for n in range(1, 10):
        for p in range(1, 10):
            for q in range(1, 10):
                total = m + n + p + q
                # Streaming output: print each total relevant
                print(f"Sum of ({m}, {n}, {p}, {q}) = {total}")
                if total > max_sum:
                    max_sum = total
# After enumeration, output the maximum sum found
print("Maximum sum:", max_sum)
```
