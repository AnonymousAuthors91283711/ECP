  olympiadbench2792_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 4097. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the pattern and the enumerated answer 4097, the minimal n satisfying the properties appears to be \(2^{12} + 1\), ensuring the floors of roots for k=1..8 are all distinct. The value \(2^{12}+1=4097\) fits the pattern, as 2^n+1 is known for such minimal bounds.
