The problem appears to involve counting the number of functions `f : Fin 10 → Fin 3` such that for any two elements `a, b : Fin 10`, if `a.val - b.val` is odd, then `f a ≠ f b`. 

Let's interpret this condition:
- For any pair `(a, b)`, if the difference in their indices is odd, then the function values are different.
- Therefore, the only pairs where the same value can occur are those where their indices differ by an even number; in other words, the function must assign values so that indices with the same parity may share the same value, but indices with different parity must not.

Analysis:
- The domain `{0, 1, 2, ..., 9}` can be partitioned into two parity classes:
  - Even indices: `0, 2, 4, 6, 8` (5 elements)
  - Odd indices: `1, 3, 5, 7, 9` (5 elements)

- For pairs `(a, b)` with `a - b` odd:
  - Means that `a` and `b` are of different parity. So for each such pair, `f a ≠ f b`.
 
- Implication:
  - All even indices must get the same value (since if some even indices had different values, then pairwise differences would violate the rule with odd indices).
  - All odd indices must get the same value (independent of each other unless they violate the condition).

- Further:
  - Because `f a ≠ f b` whenever `a` and `b` are of different parity, the values assigned to even and odd indices **must differ**.

Thus:
- We choose a value for all even indices: 3 choices (since `Fin 3`)
- We choose a value for all odd indices, different from the even ones: 2 choices (remaining options)
- Since the assignments are uniform within each parity class, total number of functions:
  
  `Number of choices for even class * Number of choices for odd class`
  
  = `3 * 2 = 6`

**We should verify this:**

Because:
- The only restrictions are between indices of different parity.
- Indices with same parity can have the same or different values; the condition only constrains different-parity pairs.
- Assigning values such that even indices share one value and odd indices share a different value satisfies all constraints.

Here's a small Python script that enumerates these functions explicitly:

```python
# Enumerate all functions from {0,...,9} to {0,1,2}
# with the condition: for every pair with difference odd, the function values differ.
# This reduces to assigning one value for even indices and a different one for odd indices.

from itertools import product

even_indices = [0,2,4,6,8]
odd_indices = [1,3,5,7,9]
values = [0,1,2]

results = []

for even_val in values:
    for odd_val in values:
        if even_val != odd_val:
            # Build the function mapping
            f = [None]*10
            for i in range(10):
                if i in even_indices:
                    f[i] = even_val
                else:
                    f[i] = odd_val
            # Output the function
            print(f"Function: {f}")
            results.append(f)

# Total count:
print(f"Total functions: {len(results)}")
```
