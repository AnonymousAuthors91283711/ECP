Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: 60
<<<True>>>
The problem asks to find the value of \( n \) such that \( 10^n = 1000^{20} \). 

First, note that \( 1000 = 10^3 \), so \( 1000^{20} = (10^3)^{20} = 10^{3 \times 20} = 10^{60} \). 

Thus, \( 10^n = 10^{60} \), which implies \( n = 60 \). 

The proposed answer of 60 is correct.
