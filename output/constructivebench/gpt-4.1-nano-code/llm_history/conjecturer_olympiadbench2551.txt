  sin (2 * x) = olympiadbench2551_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: x = 1.521600, sin(2x) = 0.098234
x = 1.522100, sin(2x) = 0.097239
x = 1.522600, sin(2x) = 0.096243
x = 1.523100, sin(2x) = 0.095248. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests that as x varies around 1.52, sin(2x) decreases linearly from approximately 0.0982 downward. The sequence implies a continuous, decreasing function for sin(2x) with respect to x. Given the small differences and linear decline, the trend approximates a constant value near 1.52. Therefore, the answer is approximately 0.0972, which is close to the listed values.
