The problem appears to involve finding two complex numbers \(z_1\) and \(z_2\) that satisfy quadratic equations, with the goal of determining the value of \(\text{Re}(z_1) \times \text{Re}(z_2)\). To assist, I will formalize the steps:

- Rewrite the equations \(z^2 + 2z = i\), which simplifies to \(z^2 + 2z - i = 0\).
- Find roots of this quadratic for various sample parameters.
- Explore all possible real parts of roots, then compute their products.
- Enumerate candidate real parts to identify possible products.

I will implement a simple enumeration over small rational approximations of potential real parts of roots, derive their corresponding imaginary parts, and compute the product of real parts.

```python
# Enumerate possible real parts of roots z1 and z2
# for roots of the quadratic z^2 + 2z - i = 0.
# Given the quadratic: z^2 + 2z = i,
# roots are z = (-2 ± sqrt(4 - 4i))/2 = -1 ± sqrt(1 - i).
# We approximate sqrt(1 - i) over small sample real parts.

import math
import cmath

# Function to approximate sqrt of (a + bi)
def complex_sqrt(a, b):
    r = math.sqrt(a**2 + b**2)
    theta = math.atan2(b, a) / 2
    return r**0.5 * math.cos(theta), r**0.5 * math.sin(theta)

# Explore candidate real parts for sqrt(1 - i)
for real_part in [x/10 for x in range(-20, 21)]:  # from -2 to 2
    a = 1
    b = -1
    re, im = complex_sqrt(a, b)
    # Roots:
    z1 = -1 + complex(re, im)
    z2 = -1 - complex(re, im)
    re_z1 = z1.real
    re_z2 = z2.real
    product = re_z1 * re_z2
    print(f"re(z1)={re_z1:.3f}, re(z2)={re_z2:.3f}, product={product:.3f}")
```
