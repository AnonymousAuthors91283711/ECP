This problem appears to involve combinatorial or graph coloring concepts, focusing on the minimal integer \(k\) such that a certain property holds for functions \(f: \mathbb{Z} \to \text{Finset.Icc } 1\,k\) with restrictions related to distances (5, 7, 12). 

Given the description, the key is to find the smallest \(k > 0\) where we can assign to each integer an interval from 1 to \(k\) such that for any two points with difference 5, 7, or 12, their assigned intervals are different. This resembles a coloring problem with forbidden distances.

To empirically approach this, we will:
- Choose small \(k\) values (say, from 1 up to 20).
- For each \(k\), try to construct a valid coloring function \(f\) that satisfies the constraints.  
- Implement a backtracking search to verify the existence of such a function for each \(k\).
- Stream results as soon as a valid coloring is found.
- Report the least such \(k\).

Let's implement that now:

```python
# This script finds the minimal k such that there exists a coloring of integers with k colors
# satisfying the distance constraints (distances 5,7,12 must connect different colors).

def is_valid_coloring(k, max_int):
    """
    Attempt to assign colors to integers 0..max_int with k colors, satisfying
    that for pairs with difference 5,7,12, colors differ.
    """
    colors = [-1] * (max_int + 1)

    def backtrack(i):
        if i > max_int:
            return True
        for c in range(1, k + 1):
            # Check constraints w.r.t previous positions with forbidden differences
            valid = True
            for d in [5, 7, 12]:
                prev_index = i - d
                if prev_index >= 0 and colors[prev_index] == c:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if valid:
                colors[i] = c
                if backtrack(i + 1):
                    return True
                colors[i] = -1
        return False

    return backtrack(0)

max_k = 20  # limit the search for efficiency
for k in range(1, max_k + 1):
    # Try to find a coloring for integers 0..(k+5) to ensure enough complexity
    if is_valid_coloring(k, max_int=30):
        print(k)
        break
```
