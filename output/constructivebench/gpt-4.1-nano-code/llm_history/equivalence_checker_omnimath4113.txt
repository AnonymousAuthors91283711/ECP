Ground Truth Answer: 1/667
Proposed Answer: (3 - 2000 / 667)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the least positive rational number k that can be expressed as 3 - m/n where m is a natural number ≤ 2000, and n is a positive natural number.

2. To minimize k = 3 - m/n while keeping k > 0, we need to maximize m/n under the constraint m ≤ 2000.

3. The maximum occurs when m is largest (2000) and n is smallest possible while keeping k > 0.

4. For m=2000, we need to find the smallest n such that 3 - 2000/n > 0 ⇒ 2000/n < 3 ⇒ n > 2000/3 ≈ 666.666 ⇒ n=667.

5. Then k = 3 - 2000/667 = (2001 - 2000)/667 = 1/667.

The proposed answer is (3 - 2000/667), which simplifies to 1/667, exactly matching the ground truth answer.
