The given theorem involves positive real numbers x and y satisfying the relation 1/(x + y) = 1/x - 1/y. We need to find the value of (x/y + y/x)^2. To do this, let's analyze the problem:

- From the relation: 1/(x + y) = 1/x - 1/y
- Simplify the RHS: 1/x - 1/y = (y - x)/(xy)
- So, 1/(x + y) = (y - x)/(xy)
- Cross-multiplied: xy = (x + y)(y - x)
- Expand RHS: xy = y^2 - x^2 + xy - xy (since (x + y)(y - x) = y^2 - x^2)

Wait, that seems inconsistent unless carefully expanded. Let's do proper algebra:

*(x + y)(y - x) = y * y - y * x + y * y - x * x = y^2 - xy + y^2 - x^2, but this is incorrect because (x + y)(y - x) = x * y - x^2 + y^2 - xy.*

Actually, expanding (x + y)(y - x):

x * y - x * x + y * y - y * x = xy - x^2 + y^2 - xy = y^2 - x^2

So, from earlier: xy = (x + y)(y - x) = y^2 - x^2

Rearranged: xy = y^2 - x^2

Rearranged: y^2 - xy - x^2 = 0

This is quadratic in y:

y^2 - x y - x^2 = 0

Solve for y:

Discriminant D = (x)^2 - 4 * 1 * (-x^2) = x^2 + 4 x^2 = 5 x^2

So,

y = [x ± sqrt(5 x^2)] / 2 = x [1 ± sqrt(5)] / 2

Since y > 0 and x > 0, take positive root:

y = x (1 + sqrt(5))/2

Now, compute (x/y + y/x)^2:

Let’s set y = k x, with k = (1 + sqrt(5))/2.

Then:

x / y = 1 / k

y / x = k

Sum: (1 / k) + k

Compute:

(1 / k) + k = (1 + k^2) / k

But, since k = (1 + sqrt(5))/2, then k is positive, and:

Calculate:

k = (1 + sqrt(5))/2

k^2 = [(1 + sqrt(5))/2]^2 = (1 + 2 sqrt(5) + 5)/4 = (6 + 2 sqrt(5))/4 = (3 + sqrt(5))/2

Therefore:

(1 / k) + k = (1 + k^2)/k

= [1 + (3 + sqrt(5))/2] / [(1 + sqrt(5))/2]

Calculate numerator:

1 + (3 + sqrt(5))/2 = (2/2) + (3 + sqrt(5))/2 = (2 + 3 + sqrt(5)) / 2 = (5 + sqrt(5))/2

Denominator: (1 + sqrt(5))/2

Thus:

(1 / k) + k = [(5 + sqrt(5))/2] / [(1 + sqrt(5))/2] = (5 + sqrt(5)) / (1 + sqrt(5))

Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 - sqrt(5)) to rationalize:

Numerator:

(5 + sqrt(5))(1 - sqrt(5)) = 5(1 - sqrt(5)) + sqrt(5)(1 - sqrt(5))
= 5 - 5 sqrt(5) + sqrt(5) - 5
= (5 - 5) + (-5 sqrt(5) + sqrt(5))
= 0 - 4 sqrt(5) = -4 sqrt(5)

Denominator:

(1 + sqrt(5))(1 - sqrt(5)) = 1 - (sqrt(5))^2 = 1 - 5 = -4

Therefore:

(1 / k) + k = (-4 sqrt(5)) / (-4) = sqrt(5)

Finally,

(x / y + y / x)^2 = [ (1 / k) + k ]^2 = (sqrt(5))^2 = 5

**Streamed answer:** THE value of (x/y + y/x)^2 is 5.

**Python code to verify this:**

```python
import math

# Determine the constant k = (1 + sqrt(5))/2
k = (1 + math.sqrt(5)) / 2

# Compute (x/y + y/x), which simplifies to (1 / k) + k
value = (1 / k) + k

# Square of the value
result = value ** 2

print("Computed (x/y + y/x)^2:", result)

# Verify that result is approximately 5
# since it's exact algebraic derivation, print directly
assert abs(result - 5) < 1e-10, "Result deviates from 5"
```
