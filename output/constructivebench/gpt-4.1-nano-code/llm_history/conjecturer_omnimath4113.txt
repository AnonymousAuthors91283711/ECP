theorem omnimath4113 :
  IsLeast {k : ℚ | ∃ (m n : ℕ), 0 < m ∧ m ≤ 2000 ∧ 0 < n ∧ k = 3 - (m : ℚ)/n ∧ 0 < k} omnimath4113_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: m = 2000, n = 667, k = 0.0014992503748127994. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The minimal positive value of \(k = 3 - \frac{m}{n}\) occurs at the maximum \(m\) (2000) with \(n\) just over \(\frac{m}{k}\). For \(k > 0\), minimizing \(k\) sets \(k = 3 - \frac{2000}{n}\), approaching 0 when \(n\) is just over \(\frac{2000}{k}\), i.e., \(n = 667\). Thus, the minimal \(k\) is approximately \(\frac{1}{667}\). 

Final answer:
<<<(3 - 2000 / 667)>>>
