This problem asks for a list of three distinct natural numbers chosen from [2, 3, 4, 6], such that their sum is 11, and their product is to be determined.

Given the small size of the list (length 3), we can enumerate all 3-element subsets of [2, 3, 4, 6] with no repetitions and check their sums and products.

We want to find all such lists with sum 11 and then compute their products. Then, we can output the list(s) and the product(s).

```python
from itertools import combinations

# Candidate numbers
nums = [2, 3, 4, 6]

# List to hold solutions
solutions = []

# Enumerate all 3-element combinations without repetition
for combo in combinations(nums, 3):
    if sum(combo) == 11:
        product = 1
        for num in combo:
            product *= num
        # The list must be of length 3 with no duplicates
        solutions.append((list(combo), product))
        print(f"Found list: {list(combo)}, sum=11, product={product}")

# If multiple solutions, we could choose to test min/max product
if solutions:
    min_product = min(p for _, p in solutions)
    max_product = max(p for _, p in solutions)
    print(f"Minimum product among solutions: {min_product}")
    print(f"Maximum product among solutions: {max_product}")
```
