[write_program]
This problem appears to involve a simple algebraic expression `2^3 - 2 + 3` and asks for the answer, potentially in the form of an integer. Since the problem is straightforward, I will write a program that computes this value explicitly and prints it immediately. To align with the instructions, I'll treat the problem as if looking for all possible answers, though in this simple case there's only one.

```python
# Compute the expression 2^3 - 2 + 3 and print the result
value = 2**3 - 2 + 3
print(value)
```
