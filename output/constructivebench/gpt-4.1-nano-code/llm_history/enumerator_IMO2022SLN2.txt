The problem appears to involve factorial divisibility and the product of primes within an interval, likely related to a number theory statement for the IMO 2022 problem #2. For enumeration, it makes sense to choose small values of n > 2 up to a manageable limit, list all prime pairs (p, q) with p < q within [2, n], and check the divisibility condition.

The goal is to generate candidate values of n that satisfy the divisibility condition by enumerating prime pairs and their products, identifying the n's for which the divisibility holds. We'll keep n up to, say, 20, for efficiency, and list all satisfying n's directly.

```python
import math
from sympy import primerange

# Generate small primes up to 20 for testing
primes = list(primerange(2, 21))

def divides(a, b):
    return b % a == 0

# List to hold n values satisfying the condition
solutions = []

# Enumerate n from 3 to 20
for n in range(3, 21):
    # Collect primes within [2, n]
    prime_list = [p for p in primes if p <= n]
    # Check if n! divides the product of (p * q) over prime pairs p<q
    # Compute n!
    factorial_n = math.factorial(n)
    # Generate all prime pairs with p < q
    prime_pairs = [(p, q) for i, p in enumerate(prime_list) for q in prime_list[i+1:] if p < q]
    # Compute product of all p * q
    prod_pairs = 1
    for p, q in prime_pairs:
        prod_pairs *= p * q
    # Check divisibility
    if divides(factorial_n, prod_pairs):
        print(f"n = {n} satisfies the divisibility condition.")
        solutions.append(n)

print("Solutions (n values satisfying the condition):", solutions)
```
