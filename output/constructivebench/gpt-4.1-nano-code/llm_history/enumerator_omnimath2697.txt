This problem involves finding the unique rational number \( w \) such that \( \frac{3}{5} \times w = \frac{1}{3} \). The question asks for the value of \( w \). To solve the equation exactly, we can solve for \( w \) algebraically: \( w = \frac{1/3}{3/5} \).

The Python code will enumerate rational candidates for \( w \) close to the expected value, then find the exact value, and finally verify the equation. To assist in conjecture, the code explicitly computes and prints the candidate solutions, prioritizing exact matches.

```python
# Enumerate rational numbers w within a small range
# and verify the equation: (3/5)*w == 1/3
from fractions import Fraction

# Range of numerator and denominator for enumeration
max_denominator = 20

# Store solutions
solutions = []

for denom in range(1, max_denominator + 1):
    for num in range(0, max_denominator + 1):
        w = Fraction(num, denom)
        if (Fraction(3, 5) * w) == Fraction(1, 3):
            print(f"Candidate w: {w}")
            solutions.append(w)

# Compute the exact solution algebraically for confirmation
exact_w = Fraction(1, 3) / Fraction(3, 5)
print(f"Exact solution: {exact_w}")

# Verify the solution
if exact_w in solutions:
    print(f"Verified solution: {exact_w}")
```
