This problem involves finding the minimum value of a sum of squared expressions involving real trigonometric functions. The expression is:

\[ y = (2 \cos \alpha + 5 \sin \beta - 8)^2 + (2 \sin \alpha + 5 \cos \beta - 15)^2 \]

Our goal is to determine the least possible value of \( y \).

Given the structure, the problem resembles the sum of squared linear forms involving trigonometric functions, which can often be analyzed through vector methods or optimization techniques. To assist in conjecturing the true minimum, I'll try discretizing \(\alpha, \beta\) over the interval \([0, 2\pi]\), sampling points at small intervals, and compute the minimal value.

The code will systematically iterate over sampled \(\alpha, \beta\), evaluate the expression, and immediately print each result, looking for the lowest value observed. Since the problem scope is small, sampling at, say, 100 points per angle provides enough detail.

```python
import math

# Define the sampling resolution
n_samples = 100
min_value = float('inf')

# Iterate over sampled angles alpha, beta
for i in range(n_samples + 1):
    alpha = 2 * math.pi * i / n_samples
    for j in range(n_samples + 1):
        beta = 2 * math.pi * j / n_samples
        term1 = 2 * math.cos(alpha) + 5 * math.sin(beta) - 8
        term2 = 2 * math.sin(alpha) + 5 * math.cos(beta) - 15
        y = term1 ** 2 + term2 ** 2
        print(y)
        if y < min_value:
            min_value = y

# After enumerating, output the minimal value found
print("Approximate minimum y:", min_value)
```
