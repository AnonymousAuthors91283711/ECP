The problem appears to be a statement about complex numbers \(x, y, z\) satisfying certain symmetric conditions: their sum is 3, and the sum of their cubes is 3. The goal is to find the set of all triples \((x, y, z)\) satisfying these conditions.

Given symmetric sums, the key is recognizing that the elementary symmetric sums relate to roots of a cubic polynomial. Let \(s_1 = x + y + z\), \(s_2 = xy + yz + zx\), \(s_3 = xyz\). We know \(s_1 = 3\).

From the identity:
\[ x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = (x + y + z)^3 - 3(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) + 3xyz \]

Substituting \(s_1, s_2, s_3\):
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = s_1^3 - 3s_1 s_2 + 3 s_3
\]

Given \(s_1 = 3\), and the sum of cubes is 3:
\[
3 = 3^3 - 3 \times 3 \times s_2 + 3 s_3 \Rightarrow 3 = 27 - 9 s_2 + 3 s_3
\]
\[
\Rightarrow 3 s_3 = 3 - 27 + 9 s_2 \Rightarrow 3 s_3 = -24 + 9 s_2
\]
\[
\Rightarrow s_3 = -8 + 3 s_2
\]

All triples \((x, y, z)\) are roots of:
\[
t^3 - s_1 t^2 + s_2 t - s_3 = 0 \Rightarrow t^3 - 3 t^2 + s_2 t - s_3 = 0
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
t^3 - 3 t^2 + s_2 t - (-8 + 3 s_2) = 0
\]
\[
t^3 - 3 t^2 + s_2 t + 8 - 3 s_2 = 0
\]

Note that the roots \(x, y, z\) depend on \(s_2\), which is not fixed. But for each \(s_2\), the roots are solutions to this cubic.

**Approach in code:**

- Choose small \(s_2\) values within some range (e.g., from \(-5\) to 5).
- For each \(s_2\), compute \(s_3\), as \(s_3 = -8 + 3 s_2\).
- Find roots of the cubic polynomial \(t^3 - 3 t^2 + s_2 t + 8 - 3 s_2 = 0\).
- Print the roots as solutions.

This enumeration helps to find triples satisfying the original conditions, considering the symmetry.

```python
import numpy as np

# Enumerate small s_2 values
for s2 in np.linspace(-5, 5, 21):
    s3 = -8 + 3 * s2
    # Coefficients of cubic: t^3 - 3 t^2 + s2 t + (8 - 3 s2) = 0
    coeffs = [1, -3, s2, 8 - 3 * s2]
    roots = np.roots(coeffs)
    for root in roots:
        # Print each solution (x, y, z) by permuting roots to account for symmetry
        # Since roots are symmetric in x, y, z, we just output the roots directly
        print(f"Solutions for s2={s2:.2f}: {roots}")
```
