  IMO2011SLC4_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Sum 15: can form 7 disjoint pairs.
Sum 16: can form 7 disjoint pairs.
Sum 17: can form 8 disjoint pairs.
Sum 18: can form 8 disjoint pairs.
Sum 19: can form 9 disjoint pairs.
Sum 20: can form 9 disjoint pairs.
Sum 21: can form 10 disjoint pairs.
Sum 22: can form 10 disjoint pairs.
Sum 23: can form 11 disjoint pairs.
Sum 24: can form 11 disjoint pairs.
Sum 25: can form 12 disjoint pairs.
Sum 26: can form 12 disjoint pairs.
Sum 27: can form 13 disjoint pairs.
Sum 28: can form 13 disjoint pairs.
Sum 29: can form 14 disjoint pairs.
Estimated upper bound for the maximum number of sets: 7. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<(19 : ℕ)>>>
The pattern suggests sums ≥ 19 support at least 9 disjoint pairs; higher sums allow even more, so the maximum sum with such structure is 19.
