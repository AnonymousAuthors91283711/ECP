This problem appears to be a logic and inequality reasoning problem involving real numbers and parameters, rather than a pure numeric computation. The theorem seems to involve the inequality \((x + \varepsilon) - (y - \varepsilon) > x - y\), which simplifies to an inequality involving \(x, y, \epsilon\). The question is likely about characterizing when this inequality holds.

The inequality:
\[
(x + \varepsilon) - (y - \varepsilon) > x - y
\]
simplifies to:
\[
x + \varepsilon - y + \varepsilon > x - y
\]
\[
x - y + 2 \varepsilon > x - y
\]
which is equivalent to:
\[
2 \varepsilon > 0
\]
Since \(\varepsilon > 0\), this inequality always holds true regardless of \(x\) and \(y\). Thus, for any \(x, y, \varepsilon > 0\), the inequality holds, and the logical statement is true universally under the assumptions.

Our task is to define a property `P2012AMCB_6_answer x y ε` that captures this logical fact. Since the property always holds when the assumptions are true, we can set:
```lean
abbrev P2012AMCB_6_answer : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ → Prop := λ x y ε, true
```
or, just a proposition that is always true under the assumptions.

Now, let's write the corresponding Lean code for the enumeration and verification:
- We just need to specify sample parameters satisfying the hypotheses.
- We can check the inequality numerically for small sample values and confirm it always holds.

I'll prepare a Python script to generate sample values for \(x, y, \varepsilon\) satisfying \(x > y > 0\), \(\varepsilon > 0\), and verify that \((x + \varepsilon) - (y - \varepsilon) > x - y\).

```python
# Program to enumerate example parameters satisfying the hypotheses
# and verify the inequality (x + ε) - (y - ε) > x - y always holds given ε > 0

import itertools

def verify_inequality(x, y, epsilon):
    lhs = (x + epsilon) - (y - epsilon)
    rhs = x - y
    return lhs > rhs

# Sample small positive values satisfying x > y > 0 and epsilon > 0
x_values = [1, 2, 3]
y_values = [0.5, 1, 1.5]
epsilon_values = [0.1, 0.5, 1]

for x in x_values:
    for y in y_values:
        if y > 0 and x > y:
            for epsilon in epsilon_values:
                if epsilon > 0:
                    result = verify_inequality(x, y, epsilon)
                    print(f"x={x}, y={y}, ε={epsilon} → inequality holds: {result}")
```

This script:
- Chooses small positive values for \(x, y, \varepsilon\) (with the constraints).
- Checks the inequality numerically.
- Demonstrates that it always holds, confirming the logical deduction.

The entire code adheres to the constraints and maximizes clarity.

# Program to confirm the inequality always holds for positive epsilon
def verify_inequality(x, y, epsilon):
    # check if (x + ε) - (y - ε) > x - y
    return (x + epsilon) - (y - epsilon) > x - y

# Sample parameters satisfying the hypotheses:
x_values = [1, 2, 3]
y_values = [0.5, 1, 1.5]
epsilon_values = [0.1, 0.5, 1]

for x in x_values:
    for y in y_values:
        if y > 0 and x > y:
            for epsilon in epsilon_values:
                if epsilon > 0:
                    result = verify_inequality(x, y, epsilon)
                    print(f"x={x}, y={y}, ε={epsilon} → inequality holds: {result}")
