The problem asks to find the least positive integer \( n \) such that \( 13 \mid n^2 + n + 1 + n^3 \). We want to enumerate small candidates to identify the minimal \( n \) satisfying the divisibility condition.

Since we are looking for the smallest \( n > 0 \) where the divisibility holds, we will iterate through positive integers starting from 1, check the divisibility, and print each success immediately. The first such \( n \) encountered will be the answer.

```python
# Enumerate positive integers starting from 1 to find the least n satisfying the condition
for n in range(1, 500):  # limit to 500 for efficiency, can increase if needed
    total = n**2 + n + 1 + n**3
    if total % 13 == 0:
        print(f"n = {n}, n^3 + n^2 + n + 1 = {total} is divisible by 13")
        print(f"Answer: {n}")
        break
```
