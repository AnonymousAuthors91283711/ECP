The problem asks us to find the least natural number \( s = x + y \cdot z \) subject to the conditions:
- \( x, y, z \) are positive integers,
- \( x \cdot y + z = 160 \),
- and we want to minimize \( s = x + y \cdot z \).

To approach this enumeratively in Python:
- For all \( y \) and \( z \) with \( y, z \ge 1 \), since \( z = 160 - x y \), and \( x \ge 1 \),
- For each \( y, z \) satisfying \( z \ge 1 \) and \( z = 160 - x y \),
- Determine the minimal \( x = (160 - z) / y \) such that \( x \) is a positive integer,
- Then calculate \( s = x + y \cdot z \),
- Keep track of the minimum \( s \).

Because \( y, z \) must satisfy \( x = (160 - z)/ y \) being an integer at least 1, the enumeration will focus on feasible \( y, z \).

Below is a Python script to find and output the minimal such \( s \):

```python
# Enumerate all feasible y, z to find the minimum s = x + y*z
min_s = None
best_xy_z = None

# Limit y to a reasonable range; since y*z <= 160, y can't be larger than 160
for y in range(1, 161):
    for z in range(1, 161):
        # Check if x = (160 - z) / y is an integer and positive
        if (160 - z) % y == 0:
            x = (160 - z) // y
            if x >= 1:
                s = x + y * z
                print(f"Found candidate: x={x}, y={y}, z={z}, s={s}")
                if min_s is None or s < min_s:
                    min_s = s
                    best_xy_z = (x, y, z)

# After enumeration, output the minimum s found
print(f"The least s = {min_s} with (x, y, z) = {best_xy_z}")
```
