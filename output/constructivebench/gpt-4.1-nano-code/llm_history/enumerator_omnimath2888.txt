The problem appears to involve analyzing a sequence defined by a specific recurrence relation, likely aiming to find some property or limit. To assist in conjecture and potential proof, I will enumerate sequence values starting from an initial value, observing the behavior, particularly looking for fixed points or cycles, and collecting values up to a certain limit. Since the sequence involves conditional halving and incrementing, we will generate the sequence iteratively for a fixed number of steps and print each result immediately as it is computed.

Here's a sample manageable implementation to explore the sequence starting from 16, for 100 iterations, matching the example in the question:

```python
# Enumerates next term based on current n
def nextTerm(n):
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return n // 2 + 1  # Even case
    else:
        return (n + 1) // 2  # Odd case

# Generate the sequence starting from init for k steps
def omnimath_sequence(init, k):
    sequence = [init]
    for _ in range(k):
        n = sequence[-1]
        next_n = nextTerm(n)
        print(next_n)  # Print each term immediately
        sequence.append(next_n)
    return sequence

# Start from initial value 16, generate 100 terms
omnimath_sequence(16, 100)
```
