The problem seems to involve a functional equation for `f : ℤ → ℤ → ℤ` with some conditions, and asks to find `f 1000 (3^2021)` based on these rules. The conditions specify how `f a b` behaves depending on inequalities involving `a`, `b`, and manipulations like `2 * a`. My approach is to analyze the recursion and pattern by considering small sample cases, then generalize.

I'll implement a recursive enumeration for `f`, handling the conditions, and explicitly compute `f 1000 (3^2021)` by mimicking the recursion with small sample values for parameters, and print all candidates to assist in conjecture.

Since the original problem is complex and involves inequalities that partition the domain, I'll simulate the recursion with small sample inputs to explore the behavior and guess the answer.

```python
# Python program to simulate the recursive definition with small sample values
# and print potential answers for the specific case of f(1000, 3^2021).

import math
import sys
sys.setrecursionlimit(10**7)

# For the purpose of enumeration, we define a small memoization cache
memo = {}

def f(a, b, depth=0):
    # Use memoization to avoid repeated calculation
    if (a, b) in memo:
        return memo[(a, b)]
    # Base case: if a <= 0 or b <= 0 (not specified in the problem), or limit to small values
    if a <= 0 or b <= 0:
        result = 0
        print(f"{'  '*depth}f({a}, {b}) = {result} (base)")
        memo[(a, b)] = result
        return result
    # Apply the conditions based on inequalities
    # Condition 1: a > b -> f a b = b
    if a > b:
        result = b
        print(f"{'  '*depth}f({a}, {b}) = {result} (a > b)")
        memo[(a, b)] = result
        return result
    # Condition 2: a ≤ b and f(2a, b) < a -> f a b = f(2a, b)
    # Condition 3: a ≤ b and not(f(2a, b) < a) -> f a b = f(2a, b) - a
    else:
        # Compute f(2a, b)
        val_for_2a_b = f(2*a, b, depth+1)
        if val_for_2a_b < a:
            result = val_for_2a_b
            print(f"{'  '*depth}f({a}, {b}) = {result} (a ≤ b and f(2a, b) < a)")
            memo[(a, b)] = result
            return result
        else:
            result = val_for_2a_b - a
            print(f"{'  '*depth}f({a}, {b}) = {result} (a ≤ b and not(f(2a, b) < a))")
            memo[(a, b)] = result
            return result

# Small tests: try with small b to observe pattern
print("Sample evaluations:")
print(f"f(1,1): {f(1,1)}")
print(f"f(2,3): {f(2,3)}")
print(f"f(100,50): {f(100,50)}")
print(f"f(10,20): {f(10,20)}")
print(f"f(1000, 3^3): {f(1000, 27)}")  # Small power, for pattern exploration

# Now, attempt to evaluate or approximate f(1000, 3^2021)
# Since 3^2021 is large, and recursive evaluation won't terminate reasonably,
# we instead estimate behavior based on pattern deductions.

# Observations:
# 1. If a > b, f a b = b
# 2. When a ≤ b, the recursion depends on whether f(2a, b) < a.
# 3. For large b, doubling a repeatedly: 2a, 4a, 8a,... until surpassing b.
# 4. The pattern resembles the Euclidean division:
#    - The recursion reduces b by multiples of a, similar to modulo operation.

# We hypothesize:
# - When 'a' divides 'b', the recursion reduces to a pattern involving modular arithmetic.
# - Since in the end, the values resemble floor divisions or remainders.

# Approximate the answer based on the behavior:
# For large arguments, the pattern suggests f(a, b) approximates b % a,
# because repeated doubling aligns with reduction mod a.

# Compute an approximation for f(1000, 3^2021):
large_b = 3 ** 2021

approximation = large_b % 1000

print(f"Approximate value for f(1000, 3^2021) based on pattern analysis: {approximation}")

# We stream partial results and hypotheses; in practice, further proofs would confirm.
# This code provides conjectural answers and insight based on recursive behavior.
