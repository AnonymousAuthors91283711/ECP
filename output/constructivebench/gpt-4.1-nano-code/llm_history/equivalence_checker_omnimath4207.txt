Ground Truth Answer: fun n => {s | ∃ k : ℕ, k < n ∧ s = 2^k}
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => {x | x ∈ Set.range (fun i => (fib i)) ∧ x ≤ 25000}
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a set of natural numbers with:
   - Exactly 100 elements (n=100)
   - All elements between 1 and 25000
   - Unique sums property (any two pairs with same sum must be identical)

2. Ground truth answer uses powers of 2:
   - {2⁰, 2¹, ..., 2⁹⁹} (100 elements)
   - All ≤ 2⁹⁹ ≈ 6.34e29 (but problem requires ≤25000)
   - Has unique sums property (binary representation uniqueness)

3. Proposed answer uses Fibonacci numbers:
   - Fibonacci sequence grows exponentially but slower than powers of 2
   - First 100 Fibonacci numbers go up to F₁₀₀ ≈ 3.54e20 (>>25000)
   - Fibonacci numbers have unique sums property

The proposed answer fails because:
- It doesn't respect the n=100 constraint (it would include all Fibonacci numbers ≤25000, which are fewer than 100)
- It doesn't guarantee exactly 100 elements
- The Fibonacci numbers ≤25000 are only up to F₂₃=28657 (just 23 numbers)
