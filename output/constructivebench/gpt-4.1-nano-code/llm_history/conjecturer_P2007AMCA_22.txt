The pattern suggests the sum involving the number, its digit sum, and the second digit sum varies slightly around 2000 but not in a straightforward sequence, implying the underlying structure involves the largest possible n that satisfies the sum condition. Since the answer options are close to 2000 and the enumeration indicates the dominant candidate is 2001, the most consistent choice is 2001.
