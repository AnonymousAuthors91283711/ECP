[write_program]
This problem appears to involve a simple algebraic expression, likely related to calculating a percentage or ratio. To assist in verifying the expression, I will write a Python program to evaluate and print the answer for `(30 / (100 - 25)) * 100` exactly and approximated.

The program will:
- Calculate the expression precisely using `fractions.Fraction` for exactness.
- First print the exact fractional result.
- Then print the decimal approximation for reference.
- Since the problem focuses on this specific calculation, no iteration or parameterization is needed.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Calculate the expression exactly
exact_value = Fraction(30, 100 - 25) * 100

# Print the exact fractional result
print("Exact value:", exact_value)

# Print the decimal approximation
print("Decimal approximation:", float(exact_value))
```
