  omnimath550_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Minimal cost meeting conditions: None. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern indicates increasing beans by 1 or 5, with beans mod 100 = 42, and beans > 2008. The minimal beans satisfying these are 2009 + 42 = 2051 (adding 1 to 2008, but 2008 mod 100 ≠ 42), so the smallest beans > 2008 with mod 100=42 is 2051. Cost equals the number of steps; minimal steps are when we reach 2051:
- Starting with 0.
- To reach 2008 > 2008, we need at least 2008 - 0 = 2008 steps in total if all are +1 (which costs 1 per step).
- Since beans mod 100=42, the minimal beans number is 2051 (2051 - 2008 = 43), achieved by adding 1 exactly 43 times after reaching 2008, or similar.
- In the minimal case, total steps = 2008 + 43 = 2051.

Cost is total steps, which equals total steps, i.e., 2051. But counting steps carefully:
- Moving from 0 to 2051 with steps of +1 or +5.
- Using +5 moves: 2051 = 5 * 410 + 1, so minimal number of +5 steps is 410, plus one +1 step for the last increment, totaling 411 steps.

Thus, total cost is 411.

Final expression: <<<410 + 1>>>
which simplifies to 411. 

But to match the pattern, generalize as number of +5 steps plus 1 (+1 step to make total mod 100=42). Total steps = 410 + 1 = 411, total beans = 5 * 410 + 1 = 2051.

Answer: <<<411>>>
