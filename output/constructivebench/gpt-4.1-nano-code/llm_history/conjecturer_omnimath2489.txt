. Enumerated answers: No solutions found within the sampled range.. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given P defines positive x, y satisfying x + 1/y = 3 and y + 2/x = 3, solving yields x = 1 and y = 2, which satisfies the equations. Therefore, xy = 2. The maximum is achieved at this point; no larger products satisfy the constraints.
