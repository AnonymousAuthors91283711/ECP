This problem involves analyzing the set of real numbers `r = d / a`, where `a` and `d` are real numbers satisfying the quadratic relation `a^2 - 6 a d + 8 d^2 = 0`, with `a ≠ 0`.

Let's interpret the set:
- The equation: `a^2 - 6 a d + 8 d^2 = 0`.
- We want to find all `r = d / a` for which there exist `a, d` satisfying the above with `a ≠ 0`.
- Express `d` as `r a`. Substitute into the equation:
  
  `a^2 - 6 a (r a) + 8 (r a)^2 = 0`
  
  Simplify:
  
  `a^2 - 6 r a^2 + 8 r^2 a^2 = 0`
  
  Factor `a^2`:
  
  `a^2 (1 - 6 r + 8 r^2) = 0`
  
- Since `a ≠ 0`, the quadratic factor must vanish:
  
  `1 - 6 r + 8 r^2 = 0`.

- Solve quadratic in `r`:
  
  `8 r^2 - 6 r + 1 = 0`

- Find roots:
  
  `r = [6 ± √(36 - 4*8*1)] / (2*8) = [6 ± √(36 - 32)] / 16 = [6 ± √4] / 16 = [6 ± 2] / 16`

- Roots:
  
  `r = (6 + 2)/16 = 8/16 = 1/2`
  
  `r = (6 - 2)/16 = 4/16 = 1/4`

Hence, the set of all `r` is `{1/4, 1/2}`.

```python
# Enumerate the possible answers; in this case, exact roots from the quadratic.
# The set of all possible r is {1/4, 1/2}.
# We'll verify that these values satisfy the original equation for some a, d with a ≠ 0.

# For r = 1/4:
# Set d = r * a = (1/4) * a
# Plug into the original relation:
# a^2 - 6 a d + 8 d^2 = 0
# Substitute d:
# a^2 - 6 a * (a/4) + 8 * (a/4)^2 = 0
# a^2 - (6 a^2)/4 + 8 * (a^2/16) = 0
# a^2 - (3 a^2)/2 + (8 * a^2)/16 = 0
# a^2 - (3 a^2)/2 + (a^2)/2 = 0
# Combine:
# (a^2) - (3 a^2)/2 + (a^2)/2 = a^2 - (2 a^2)/2 = a^2 - a^2 = 0
# Valid for any a ≠ 0.

# For r = 1/2:
# d = (1/2) * a
# Similar substitution:
# a^2 - 6 a * (a/2) + 8 * (a/2)^2 = 0
# a^2 - 3 a^2 + 8 * (a^2/4) = 0
# a^2 - 3 a^2 + 2 a^2 = 0
# (a^2 - 3 a^2 + 2 a^2) = 0
# (0) = 0
# Valid for any a ≠ 0.

# Therefore, the set of possible r values is {1/4, 1/2}.

# Outputting the set as a list of decimal approximations for clarity.
