Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: fun y => (y - 1)^2 + 1
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer carefully.

Problem Breakdown:
1. We have two functions f and g: ℝ → ℝ
2. f is defined as f(x) = 2x + 1 (given by hf)
3. g is defined by the property that g(f(x)) = 4x² + 1 for all x (given by hg)
4. We need to find an explicit expression for g

Proposed Answer:
g(y) = (y - 1)² + 1

Verification:
Let's check if this satisfies hg:
g(f(x)) = g(2x + 1) = ((2x + 1) - 1)² + 1 = (2x)² + 1 = 4x² + 1
This exactly matches the given condition hg.

The proposed answer correctly satisfies all given conditions and is indeed the unique solution to this functional equation.
