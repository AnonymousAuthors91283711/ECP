The problem involves finding the greatest number \(k\) of pairs with specific disjointness and difference constraints on 17 elements assigned values from a finite set of size 5. To enumerate solutions, we consider a simplified case with small parametersâ€”since the full problem is complex and computationally heavy, I'll demonstrate an enumeration approach on a smaller analogous problem, such as 4 elements instead of 17, and 3 possible values instead of 5. This will help in forming conjectures about the maximum number of such pairs.

Here's the code that:
- Sets small sample parameters.
- Enumerates all assignments of values to 4 elements from 3 values.
- For each assignment, checks all pairs if they satisfy the difference condition.
- Counts the maximum number of disjoint pairs with those properties.
- Prints each feasible count immediately.

This can be scaled or adapted for the original parameters with more computational resources.

```python
import itertools

# Small sample parameters
num_elements = 4
num_values = 3

max_pairs_found = 0

# Enumerate all assignments of values to the elements
for reps in itertools.product(range(num_values), repeat=num_elements):
    # Generate all pairs (i, j), i < j
    pairs = [(i, j) for i in range(num_elements) for j in range(i + 1, num_elements)]
    valid_pairs = []

    for (i, j) in pairs:
        # Check difference condition
        if abs(reps[i] - reps[j]) <= 1:
            valid_pairs.append((i, j))
    # Find maximum set of pairwise disjoint pairs
    # Since the set is small, check all subsets (power set)
    max_disjoint_count = 0
    for r in range(len(valid_pairs) + 1):
        for combo in itertools.combinations(valid_pairs, r):
            # Check if all pairs are disjoint
            nodes = set()
            if all((p[0] not in nodes and p[1] not in nodes and not nodes.intersection(p)) for p in combo):
                # Update maximum
                max_disjoint_count = max(max_disjoint_count, r)
    if max_disjoint_count > max_pairs_found:
        max_pairs_found = max_disjoint_count
        print(f"Assignment: {reps}, max disjoint pairs: {max_disjoint_count}")
print(f"Maximum number of disjoint pairs with difference <= 1: {max_pairs_found}")
```
