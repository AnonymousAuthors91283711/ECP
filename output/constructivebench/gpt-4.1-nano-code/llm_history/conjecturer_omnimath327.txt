  IsLeast {k : ℕ | ∃ (G : SimpleGraph (Fin n)) (_ : DecidableRel G.Adj),

    (omnimath327_answer n) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: For n=4, estimated minimal k: 4
For n=5, estimated minimal k: 5
For n=6, estimated minimal k: 6. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
The pattern suggests that for n = 4, 5, 6, the minimal k equals n. As the structure is symmetric and the minimal such k appears equal to n for these cases, the conjecture is that for any n, the minimal k is n.
