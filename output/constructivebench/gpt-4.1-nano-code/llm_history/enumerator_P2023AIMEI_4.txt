The problem involves factorizations related to the factorial 13! and certain perfect square conditions. The key is to analyze the divisors of 13! that are perfect squares, then express their square roots in terms of prime exponents. The primes are small, and the exponents in 13! are well-known:  
13! = 2^10 * 3^5 * 5^2 * 7^1 * 11^1 * 13^1.  
We seek positive integers m dividing 13! such that m * k^2 = 13! for some integer k, with m being a perfect square, i.e., all exponents in m are even.

We will enumerate all possible m by considering all combinations of the exponents (from 0 to their maximum in 13!) that are even and do not exceed the maximum exponents. For each such m (corresponding to exponents for each prime), we will compute the sum of exponents of m (for the prime factorization) and the sum of primes times their exponents.

Since m must divide 13! and be a perfect square, exponents in m must be even and ≤ the prime exponents in 13!, i.e.:

- For 2: exponents 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
- For 3: exponents 0, 2, 4
- For 5: exponents 0, 2
- For 7, 11, 13: exponents 0, 1 (But since m is a perfect square, these must be 0 or 1? Actually, perfect squares have even exponents, so for these primes, exponents are 0, 1, but only even ones: 0 only, since 1 is odd. So exponents are 0 only for these primes)

We will generate all such combinations, compute their sum of exponents, and corresponding sum of prime-weighted exponents.

```python
# Enumerate all perfect square divisors m of 13! by prime exponents
# prime factors and their maximum exponents in 13!
primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]
max_exponents = [10, 5, 2, 1, 1, 1]

# For each prime, list possible exponents (even numbers ≤ max exponent)
exponent_options = []
for max_exp in max_exponents:
    options = [e for e in range(0, max_exp + 1, 2)]  # only even exponents
    exponent_options.append(options)

results = []

# Generate all combinations
from itertools import product
for exps in product(*exponent_options):
    # sum of exponents
    sum_exps = sum(exps)
    # sum of prime * exponent for the prime factorization
    sum_prime_exp = sum(p * e for p, e in zip(primes, exps))
    print(f"Exponents: {exps} | Sum exponents: {sum_exps} | Sum prime*exp: {sum_prime_exp}")
    results.append((sum_exps, sum_prime_exp))
```
