(5, 5). Expected Answer Type: Prop
The pattern suggests the pairs are either equal or differ by at most 1, i.e., |a - b| ≤ 1, including cases where both are zero.  
Expressed as a Prop, the value holds if and only if a = b or one of them is 0 and the other is 1, covering all pairs in the enumeration.  
Final answer in Lean: <<<∀ a b : ℕ, (a = 0 ∧ b ≤ 1) ∨ (b = 0 ∧ a ≤ 1) ∨ (a = b)>>>
