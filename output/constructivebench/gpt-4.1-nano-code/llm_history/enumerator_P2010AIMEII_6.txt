The problem appears to relate to finding the least positive integer \( n \) such that there exist polynomials \( P, Q \) with positive degree satisfying specific coefficient conditions:
- \((P \times Q).coeff(4) = 1\)
- \((P \times Q).coeff(1) = -n + 63\)

Since the prompt is analogous to an algebra/systems problem, we can approach by testing small degrees and candidate polynomials to find the minimal \( n \) that satisfies the conditions.

The key is to systematically enumerate possible polynomial degrees and coefficients, then compute the product and check coefficients. To keep computations efficient, we limit degrees to small values and coefficients to small integers.

Here's a Python script that:
- Enumerates small degrees for \( P, Q \) (e.g., degrees 1 or 2).
- Enumerates plausible coefficients for these polynomials.
- Checks the resulting product's coefficients at positions 1 and 4.
- Tracks the minimal \( n \) satisfying the conditions.
