This Lean theorem involves analyzing a sequence \( t(n) = 555 - 7n \) and a partial sum \( S(n) = \sum_{i=1}^n t(i) \). The goal is to find the least \( n \) such that \( S(n) < 0 \). To solve this numerically, we can write a Python program to enumerate \( n \), compute \( S(n) \), and identify the minimal \( n \) where the sum becomes negative.

Since the sequence is linear, the sum \( S(n) \) can be computed explicitly:

\[
S(n) = \sum_{i=1}^n (555 - 7i) = 555n - 7 \sum_{i=1}^n i = 555n - 7 \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\]

We seek the smallest \( n \) such that \( S(n) < 0 \). We will enumerate \( n \), compute \( S(n) \), and find the minimal \( n \) satisfying this.

```python
# Enumerate n from 1 upward to find the least n such that S(n) < 0
# Using the explicit formula: S(n) = 555 * n - 7 * n * (n + 1) / 2

n = 1
while True:
    S_n = 555 * n - (7 * n * (n + 1)) // 2
    print(f"n={n}, S(n)={S_n}")  # Output each candidate
    if S_n < 0:
        print(f"Least n with S(n) < 0 is n={n}")
        break
    n += 1
```
