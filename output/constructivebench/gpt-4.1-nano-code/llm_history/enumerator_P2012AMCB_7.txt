This problem involves analyzing the pattern of red lights based on a repeating pattern and positions within a sequence. The key steps are:
- Determine the indices of red lights based on pattern and total length.
- Identify specific red light positions: the third and the twenty-first.
- Compute the difference between these positions, multiplied by 6, then divided by 12 to get the answer.

We will enumerate the red light positions for small sample sizes and explicitly find the third and twenty-first red light's positions to verify the value of the expression. We avoid hardcoding, and since the pattern repeats every 5 lights, we examine the positions up to a reasonable multiple of totalRedLights (here, 21).

```python
# Python enumeration to find specific red light positions based on pattern
pattern = [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
total_red_lights = 21
max_range = 5 * total_red_lights  # maximum position to consider

# Collect positions where pattern n % 5 matches a 'red' (non-zero)
red_positions = []
for n in range(max_range):
    if pattern[n % 5] != 0:
        red_positions.append(n)

# Find the third and twenty-first red positions if they exist
third_red = red_positions[2] if len(red_positions) > 2 else 0
twenty_first_red = red_positions[20] if len(red_positions) > 20 else 0

# Compute the expression: ((twentyFirstRed - thirdRed) * 6) / 12
result = ((twenty_first_red - third_red) * 6) / 12

# Output intermediate results for conjecture
print("Pattern:", pattern)
print("Total red lights considered:", total_red_lights)
print("Red positions (sample):", red_positions[:25])
print("Third red light position:", third_red)
print("Twenty-first red light position:", twenty_first_red)
print("Result of expression:", result)
```
