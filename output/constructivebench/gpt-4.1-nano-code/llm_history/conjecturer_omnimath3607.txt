n = 16 yields pairwise coprime list starting from [2, 3, 5,
Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern shows the minimal n is 1. Larger n do not further reduce the minimal n, and the starting list remains {2, 3, 5, 7, 11} for all n ≥ 1, since it's already pairwise coprime geometrically. Therefore, the least such n is 1.
