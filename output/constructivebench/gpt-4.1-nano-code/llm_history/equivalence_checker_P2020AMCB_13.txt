Ground Truth Answer: sqrt (log 6 / log 2 + log 6 / log 3)
Proposed Answer: sqrt (log 3 / log 2) + sqrt (log 2 / log 3)
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

The ground truth answer is: √(log6/log2 + log6/log3)
The proposed answer is: √(log3/log2) + √(log2/log3)

Let's simplify the ground truth answer:
√(log6/log2 + log6/log3) = √(log6(1/log2 + 1/log3)) = √(log6(log3 + log2)/(log2 log3)) = √(log6(log6)/(log2 log3)) = √((log6)²/(log2 log3)) = log6/√(log2 log3)

Now let's square the proposed answer:
(√(log3/log2) + √(log2/log3))² = log3/log2 + 2 + log2/log3 = (log3² + log2² + 2log2log3)/(log2 log3) = (log3 + log2)²/(log2 log3) = (log6)²/(log2 log3)

Taking square root gives us: log6/√(log2 log3)

Thus, the ground truth answer equals the square root of the square of the proposed answer, meaning they are not equivalent but related through a square operation.
