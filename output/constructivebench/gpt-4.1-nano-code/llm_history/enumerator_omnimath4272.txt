The problem appears to be a formal theorem involving natural numbers, divisors, sums, and powers of 2, but it's incomplete due to `sorry` placeholders. To assist in conjecturing and proving potential answers, I will write a Python program enumerating small natural numbers and their divisors, calculating the sum of divisors, and checking for conditions involving powers of 2. 

Since the exact question isn't fully specified, I will assume you want to find all `n` such that the sum of divisors of `n` equals some power of 2, e.g., `2^m`.

This enumeration helps in analyzing the property for small `n`:

- For each `n` from 1 to a small limit (say 50),
- Find all divisors,
- Sum the divisors,
- Check if the sum is a power of 2,
- If yes, print the `n`, divisors, sum, and the power of 2.

This approach reveals potential patterns and conjectures. It prioritizes exact powers of 2, streams partial results, and limits output length.

```python
import math

def is_power_of_two(x):
    return x > 0 and (x & (x - 1)) == 0

def divisors(n):
    results = set()
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            results.add(i)
            results.add(n // i)
    return sorted(results)

max_n = 50  # small sample for manageable enumeration
for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
    divs = divisors(n)
    s = sum(divs)
    if is_power_of_two(s):
        # Find m such that s == 2^m
        m = s.bit_length() - 1
        print(f"n={n}, divisors={divs}, sum={s} = 2^{m}")
```
