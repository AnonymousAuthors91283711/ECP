This problem appears to involve combinatorics and permutations, centered around a condition on functions from Fin n to Fin n. The condition resembles an ordering or a specific permutation-related property, where for all i < j, the image of j is less than the image of i plus (j - i). 

Given the context, it likely involves counting permutations with certain properties that resemble "almost decreasing" sequences or some variant of orderings. Because the expected answer depends on n, we should identify and enumerate all functions satisfying the condition for small n. 

We will:
- Fix small values of n (say n=1,2,3) to understand the pattern.
- Generate permutations of size n.
- Check the condition.
- Count how many satisfy it.

Because the enumeration must be efficient and streaming, we'll output results immediately as we find them, for each n.

```python
# Enumerate permutations of {0,...,n-1} and count those satisfying the property.
from itertools import permutations

def count_valid(n):
    count = 0
    for perm in permutations(range(n)):
        valid = True
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i+1, n):
                if perm[j] >= perm[i] + (j - i):
                    valid = False
                    break
            if not valid:
                break
        if valid:
            print(f"Valid permutation for n={n}: {perm}")
            count += 1
    return count

# For small n, enumerate and print results
for n in [1, 2, 3]:
    print(f"Counting solutions for n={n}")
    cnt = count_valid(n)
    print(f"Total for n={n}: {cnt}")

# The counts can help conjecture the pattern; further analysis may be needed for the formula.
```
