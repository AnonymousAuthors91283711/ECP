This problem involves counting the probability that a randomly chosen permutation \(f : \{1,\dots,9\} \to \{1,\dots,9\}\) (a bijection) has the property that, for each pair \((i,j)\) in \(\{0,1,2\}\), the sums over the row and column are both odd. 

Given small domain and codomain size, we will fix sample values, enumerate all permutations, and check the properties directly. We choose \(\Omega\) as all permutations of size 9, and \(A\) as the subset satisfying the conditions.

The enumeration:
- Generate all permutations of 9 elements (factorial 9 = 362880 permutations).
- For each permutation, verify the parity conditions for all relevant rows and columns.
- Count how many permutations satisfy these conditions.
- Compute the probability as the count over total.

Note: For efficiency, we can terminate early when checking conditions for each permutation.

```python
from itertools import permutations
from math import factorial
from fractions import Fraction

# Total permutations
total = factorial(9)
count_success = 0

# Generate all permutations of 1..9
for p in permutations(range(1, 10)):
    # Reshape with indices for easier 2D access
    matrix = [p[i*3:(i+1)*3] for i in range(3)]
    valid = True
    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(3):
            # Sum over row i
            row_sum = sum(matrix[i][k] for k in range(3))
            # Sum over column j
            col_sum = sum(matrix[k][j] for k in range(3))
            # Check if both sums are odd
            if (row_sum + 1) % 2 == 0 or (col_sum + 1) % 2 == 0:
                valid = False
                break
        if not valid:
            break
    if valid:
        count_success += 1

# Compute probability as a rational number
probability = Fraction(count_success, total)
print(f"Probability: {probability}")
```
