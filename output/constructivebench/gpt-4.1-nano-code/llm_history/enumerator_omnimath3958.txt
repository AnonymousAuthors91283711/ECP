This problem involves exploring quadruples (a, b, c, d) of real numbers satisfying certain symmetric equations. To assist in conjecturing the solutions, we will generate candidate quadruples by testing small integer values and rational approximations to observe potential patterns or solutions.

We'll:
- Fix small sample values for some variables.
- Use nested loops to generate possible quadruples.
- Check the three equations for equality, within a small numerical tolerance.
- Stream output each quadruple when the equations hold (approximately or exactly under the tolerance).

By restricting values to a small set, the code remains efficient and manageable while providing potential solutions or patterns to guide further proof.

```python
# Enumerate small rational/integers for a, b, c, d to find quadruples satisfying the equations
tolerance = 1e-8
values = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]  # Small sample set

for a in values:
    for b in values:
        for c in values:
            for d in values:
                lhs1 = (a + b) * (a**2 + b**2)
                lhs2 = (a + c) * (a**2 + c**2)
                lhs3 = (a + d) * (a**2 + d**2)
                rhs1 = (c + d) * (c**2 + d**2)
                rhs2 = (b + d) * (b**2 + d**2)
                rhs3 = (b + c) * (b**2 + c**2)
                if (abs(lhs1 - rhs1) < tolerance and
                    abs(lhs2 - rhs2) < tolerance and
                    abs(lhs3 - rhs3) < tolerance):
                    print(f"Possible solution: (a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d})")
```
