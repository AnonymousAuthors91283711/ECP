Ground Truth Answer: 25
Proposed Answer: 6
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us two distinct triples (x₁,y₁,z₁) and (x₂,y₂,z₂) with identical sums, sum of squares, and sum of cubes.

2. The ground truth answer is 25, which suggests that y₁ + y₂ = 25 is the correct conclusion.

3. The proposed answer is 6, which would be the sum of all three variables (x+y+z), not specifically y₁ + y₂.

4. The problem specifically asks for y₁ + y₂, not the sum of all variables.

5. The proposed answer of 6 is incorrect because:
   - It doesn't match the ground truth
   - It's answering a different question (total sum vs y-component sum)
   - The value 6 is already given as a condition (h1 and h4)

<<<False>>>
