The problem involves finding a unique digit \( d \) (from 0 to 9) such that there exist digits \( a \) and \( b \) with:

- \( a \) between 1 and 9 (inclusive),
- \( b \) between 0 and 9 (inclusive),
- \( x = 10a + b \),
- \( y = 10b + a \),
- \( y - x = 54 \),
- \( |a - b| = d \),
- and a uniquely determined \( d \).

Our goal is to find all possible \( a \) and \( b \) satisfying these and then find the corresponding \( d \). Since the problem asks for the unique \( d \), and the constraints on \( a, b \) are small, we can enumerate all \( a, b \) pairs within the bounds.

```python
# Enumerate all a (1 to 9) and b (0 to 9), check the conditions, and find the unique d
for a in range(1, 10):
    for b in range(0, 10):
        x = 10 * a + b
        y = 10 * b + a
        if y - x == 54:
            d = abs(a - b)
            print(f"a={a}, b={b}, x={x}, y={y}, y - x={y - x}, d={d}")
            # Since the problem states âˆƒ! (d), ensure only one unique d found
            # but here, we just list all such pairs; the uniqueness would be inferred
```
