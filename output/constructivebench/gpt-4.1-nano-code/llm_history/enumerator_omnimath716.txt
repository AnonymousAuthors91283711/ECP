[write_program]
This problem involves complex number theory and polynomial evaluation conditions, but the main task is to list primes p that satisfy certain divisor and range conditions based on roots of a cubic polynomial. To assist, I will write a Python script that:

- Considers specific small parameter values for a, b, c,
- Constructs the polynomial P,
- Evaluates P at these points,
- Checks the divisibility conditions,
- Finds primes p satisfying the conditions, and
- Enumerates such primes (streaming as they are found).

Since the full parameter space is huge, I will choose sample values for a, b, c within the given bounds to generate candidates, and for each candidate, check suitable primes p.

```python
import math

# Function to check if a number is prime
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    if n in (2, 3):
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(5, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1, 6):
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Evaluate polynomial P at point x: P(x) = x^3 + c10*x^2 + c_rs1*x + c_rs2
def evaluate_polynomial(x, c10, c_rs1, c_rs2):
    return x**3 + c10 * x**2 + c_rs1 * x + c_rs2

# Define sample parameters for c10 and c_rs
c10_samples = [10]
# For c_rs1 and c_rs2, choose small integers satisfying constraints: 0 <= a < b < c, c/3
a_b_c_samples = [
    (0, 1, 2),
    (1, 2, 4),
    (2, 3, 7),
]

# For each tuple, compute roots, evaluate, and find primes p
for (a, b, c) in a_b_c_samples:
    # c/3 must be > b and > a, etc.
    root_candidates = [a, b, c]
    for c10 in c10_samples:
        for c_rs1 in range(-5, 6):
            for c_rs2 in range(-5, 6):
                # Evaluate polynomial at a, b, c
                evals = [
                    (Polynomial_eval := evaluate_polynomial(x, c10, c_rs1, c_rs2))
                    for x in (a, b, c)
                ]
                # Determine candidate primes p
                min_eval = min(evals)
                max_eval = max(evals)
                # Search for primes p within a range, e.g., from 2 up to max_eval + 20
                for p in range(2, max_eval + 21):
                    if not is_prime(p):
                        continue
                    # Check divisibility conditions
                    divides_all = True
                    for val in evals:
                        if abs(val) == 0:
                            # Zero division, skip
                            divides_all = False
                            break
                        if (abs(val) % p) != 0:
                            divides_all = False
                            break
                    if divides_all:
                        print(f'Prime p: {p}, at params a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, c10={c10}, c_rs1={c_rs1}, c_rs2={c_rs2}')
```
