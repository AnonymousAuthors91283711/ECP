. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
Given the constraints, the problem suggests a set with a size related to the sum of its elements, specifically the sum of k elements forming each element in the set, each summing to itself. The pattern indicates that for each k, valid n follows the sum of the first k-1 natural numbers plus k, which is (k−1)·k/2 + k. Therefore, a closed-form formula extends to all n≥k+1, giving n = (k−1) * k / 2 + k, simplifying to n = k * (k + 1) / 2. 

Final answer:

<<<fun k : ℕ => k * (k + 1) / 2>>>
