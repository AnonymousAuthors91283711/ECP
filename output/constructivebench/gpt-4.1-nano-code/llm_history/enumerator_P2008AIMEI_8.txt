The problem involves solving a sum of arctan expressions equal to π/4, and identifying the specific value of n that satisfies this. The key insight is the arctan addition formula which can simplify the sum, but for the purpose of enumeration, we'll test candidate values of n and check the sum's value against the target (π/4), focusing on exact matches or close approximations. The approach is to attempt small n values, print those that satisfy the relation, and identify the unique solution.

```python
import math

# Function to compute sum of arctan values
def arctan_sum(n):
    return math.atan(1/3) + math.atan(1/4) + math.atan(1/5) + math.atan(1/n)

# Target value for comparison
target = math.pi / 4
tolerance = 1e-12

# Explore n from 1 to 1000 for possible solutions
for n in range(1, 1001):
    total = arctan_sum(n)
    # Check if total matches target within tolerance
    if abs(total - target) < tolerance:
        print(f"n = {n} yields sum = {total} (approx. π/4)")
        # Since the problem implies a unique solution, we can break after finding one
        break
```
