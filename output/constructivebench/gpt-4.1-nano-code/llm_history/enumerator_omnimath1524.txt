The problem asks to compute the number of integers n between 1 and 1997 (inclusive) that are coprime to 1547. Since 1547 is fixed, and the bounds are small, we can explicitly enumerate candidates, check their gcd with 1547, and count those coprime to 1547.

Steps:
- Use small sample range (1 to 1997).
- For each n, check gcd(n, 1547) == 1.
- Count those values.
- Immediately print each coprime n as we find it.
- Assign the total count to omnimath1524_answer.

Let's implement this:

```python
import math

count = 0
for n in range(1, 1998):
    if math.gcd(n, 1547) == 1:
        print(n)  # streaming answers
        count += 1

print("Total coprime count:", count)
# Assign the total count to the answer variable
omnimath1524_answer = count
```
