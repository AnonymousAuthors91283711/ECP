. Enumerated answers: Candidate: a=1, b=1, sum=2
Candidate: a=2, b=8, sum=10
Candidate: a=3, b=27, sum=30
Candidate: a=4, b=64, sum=68
Candidate: a=24, b=54, sum=78
Maximum sum: 78. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests that a and b satisfy a * b = (lcm a b / gcd a b)^2 with a, b ≤ 100. Examining the enumerated candidates, the maximum sum after checking candidate values appears at (a, b) = (24, 54), summing to 78. The pair maximizes the sum under the constraints.
