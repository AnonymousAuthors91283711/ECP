This problem appears to involve finding all functions \(f:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}\) satisfying the functional equation 

\[
 (f (f x - y)) \times (f (x + f y)) = x^2 - y^2,
\]

for all real \(x, y\). The goal is to generate candidate solutions \(f\) that satisfy this property, to help conjecture the form of \(f\).

### Approach:

- Test linear functions \(f(x) = ax + b\),
- Verify if they satisfy the equation for various parameters,
- Use small sample values for parameters and enumerate candidate solutions.

Since the problem asks for a program that enumerates possible solutions, we'll generate candidate functions rather than trying to solve symbolically. For simplicity, I'll test functions of the form \(f(x) = a x + b\) with a few small values of \(a, b\). Then, for each candidate, verify whether the functional equation holds for some test points.

This approach is heuristic but will quickly rule out many functions, guiding us toward possible solutions.

### Implementation:

- Iterate over small candidate parameters \(a, b\),
- For each, test the functional equation on a small set of test values \((x, y)\),
- Output the functions that satisfy the equation for all test points, as candidate solutions.

Here's the code:

```python
# Enumerate linear functions f(x) = a x + b with small parameters
# and test whether they satisfy the functional equation for sample points.

def test_function(a, b, test_points):
    for x, y in test_points:
        # Define the candidate function
        def f(t): return a * t + b

        # Compute left side
        try:
            left = f(f(x) - y) * f(x + f(y))
        except Exception:
            return False

        # Compute right side
        right = x ** 2 - y ** 2

        # Check equality with some tolerance for floating point
        if abs(left - right) > 1e-6:
            return False
    return True

# Small sample points
sample_points = [
    (0, 0),
    (1, 0),
    (0, 1),
    (1, 1),
    (-1, 1),
]

# Enumerate candidate functions
for a in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
    for b in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
        if test_function(a, b, sample_points):
            print(f"Candidate solution: f(x) = {a} * x + {b}")
```
