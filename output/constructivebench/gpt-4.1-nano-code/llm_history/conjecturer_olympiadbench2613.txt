. Enumerated answers: u(7) = 232.99999999999997. Expected Answer Type: ℤ
The recurrence relation suggests sequence u follows a linear recurrence similar to a shifted Fibonacci sequence. The solution to u(n+2) = 3 u(n+1) - u(n), with initial values u(3)=5, u(6)=89, implies u(n) can be expressed in closed form as a linear combination of powers of roots of its characteristic equation.

Given u(3)=5, u(6)=89, and T=7, we compute the pattern:

u(n) = A * r1^n + B * r2^n, where r1 and r2 are roots of x² - 3x + 1=0, roots are (3 ± √5)/2.

Solving yields:

u(7) = (U₁ * r1^7 + U₂ * r2^7) ≈ 233.

Since the sequence is integer-valued, u(7) = 2^8 - 1 = 255 - 22, but from calculation matches more precisely to 233 or 234.

Given the proximity and integer expectation, the closed form:

u(7) = ( (u(3) * (r1)^4) + (u(6) * (r2)^1) ), but exact closed form reduces to:

u(7) = 2^8 - 1 = 255, but numerically it's 232.9999 close to 233, aligned with the exponential form.

Thus, the closed form integer approximation is:

<<<(7 / 1)^3 + 1>>>

which simplifies to 8 + 1 = 9, not matching. Alternatively, setting directly from the sequence:

Answer: 233.

But as the problem asks for a closed form, matching the pattern and based on the exponential solution, the closed form in terms of n is:

u(n) = ( (3 + √5)/2 )^n + ( (3 - √5)/2 )^n )

At n=7:

u(7) = ((3 + √5)/2)^7 + ((3 - √5)/2)^7 ≈ 233.

Given the need for an integer answer:

<<<(2^7) - 1>>>
