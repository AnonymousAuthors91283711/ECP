The enumerations suggest that the solutions are monomials and constants, possibly symmetric functions of x^k. The pattern indicates that the polynomials are of the form: P = x^k or constants, and relate to n and k in a way that generalizes over all n > 1. Since all solutions involve simple monomials and constants (including -1, 0, 1), the core candidate leads to P being a monomial or a constant, independent of n. The general form is thus:

<<<fun n k => if k = 0 then (1 : ℝ[X]) else X^k>>>
