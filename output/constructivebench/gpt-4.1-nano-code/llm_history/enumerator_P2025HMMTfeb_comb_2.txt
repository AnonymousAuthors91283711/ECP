This problem involves analyzing a 3x3 grid and counting subsets of size 4 that satisfy certain path constraints, specifically avoiding a path from start to home under certain adjacency rules. The code defines a set of valid removals (subsets of 4 grid points) that do not contain a path from (0,0) to (2,2). To enumerate possible answers, we will generate all such subsets and check the path existence constraints.

Given the small grid, the enumeration is feasible. Our approach:
- Fix the grid points.
- Generate all subsets of size 4.
- For each subset, check the path existence constraints.
- Count how many satisfy the constraints (no path exists).

We will implement this enumeration and print all valid solutions.

```python
from itertools import combinations
from collections import deque

# Define the grid
grid_points = [(x, y) for x in range(3) for y in range(3)]
start = (0, 0)
home = (2, 2)

# Function to check if two points are adjacent based on adjacency rules
def is_adjacent(a, b):
    return (
        (a[0] == b[0] and abs(a[1] - b[1]) == 1) or
        (a[1] == b[1] and abs(a[0] - b[0]) == 1)
    )

# Check if there's a path from start to home avoiding the subset s
def path_exists(s):
    # Nodes are points not in s
    nodes = [p for p in grid_points if p not in s]
    if start not in nodes or home not in nodes:
        return False
    # BFS from start to home
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([start])
    while queue:
        current = queue.popleft()
        if current == home:
            return True
        for neighbor in nodes:
            if neighbor not in visited and is_adjacent(current, neighbor):
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append(neighbor)
    return False

# Generate all subsets of size 4
valid_subsets = []
for subset in combinations(grid_points, 4):
    s = set(subset)
    # Ensure start and home are not in the subset
    if start in s or home in s:
        continue
    # Check if path exists without points in s
    if not path_exists(s):
        print(f"Valid removal subset: {s}")
        valid_subsets.append(s)

print(f"Total valid removal sets: {len(valid_subsets)}")
```
