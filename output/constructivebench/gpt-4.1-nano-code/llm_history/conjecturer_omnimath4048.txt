The error occurs because in Lean, the syntax for defining a set using an anonymous function (lambda) with a property is `{λ f, P f}` instead of `{λ f : ℚ → ℝ, P f}`. The explicit type annotation `: ℚ → ℝ` inside a constant set definition is invalid. Instead, we should write the set as `{f : ℚ → ℝ | ∃ a : ℝ, a > 2 ∧ ∀ x : ℚ, f x = a * x}`. This syntax uses the bounded quantifier syntax `|` which Lean recognizes as the definition of a set.

Given the problem's constraints and the enumerated solutions, the functions satisfy the form `f(x) = a * x` with some real `a > 2`. The functional equation and the positivity conditions suggest that the only solutions are linear functions with slope `a > 2`. The specific candidate answer in Lean can be represented as:

```lean
{f : ℚ → ℝ | ∃ a : ℝ, a > 2 ∧ ∀ x : ℚ, f x = a * x}
```

This set captures exactly those functions, and the syntax fixes the token error.

**Final Answer:**
<<<{f : ℚ → ℝ | ∃ a : ℝ, a > 2 ∧ ∀ x : ℚ, f x = a * x}>>>
