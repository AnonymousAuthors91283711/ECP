The problem appears to involve summing binomial coefficients with a specific pattern based on modular arithmetic. Given the sum over k from 0 to n+1 of choose(n, k), where we only sum terms when k ≡ 1 (mod 3), the pattern suggests focusing on the coefficients where k mod 3 = 1.

The sum can be viewed as extracting every k where k mod 3 = 1 from the binomial expansion of (1 + x)^n and evaluating at x=1, possibly using roots of unity to filter these terms. Since the sum involves binomial coefficients and a modular restriction, roots of unity filters are a typical approach.

For small n, enumerating the sum directly can help identify a pattern. We'll write a Python script that:
- Fixes n=2003, as in the theorem.
- Computes the sum explicitly for k where k ≡ 1 mod 3.
- Observes the value for that n.

Let's implement the enumeration for n=2003 and compare the result:

```python
# Enumerate the sum of choose(n, k) for k ≡ 1 (mod 3) when n=2003
from math import comb

n = 2003
total = 0
for k in range(n + 1):
    if k % 3 == 1:
        total += comb(n, k)
print(total)
```

Running this code yields the sum value, and from properties of binomial sums over roots of unity, the sum simplifies to (1/3) times the sum over all binomial coefficients at the roots of unity. The pattern for such sums is known: when summing over k ≡ 1 (mod 3), the sum is:

( (1 + ω)^n + (1 + ω^2)^n + (1 + 1)^n ) / 3,

where ω is a primitive 3rd root of unity.

Since for n=2003 (odd), (1 + ω)^n and (1 + ω^2)^n have complex conjugate values, their sum simplifies; however, since the problem asks only to enumerate for n=2003, we will directly compute the sum via Python.

```python
# Calculate the sum directly for n=2003
from math import comb

n = 2003
result = sum(comb(n, k) for k in range(n + 1) if k % 3 == 1)
print(result)
```

This confirms the sum value. The exact pattern for the sum is complicated to derive here explicitly but can be approximated or computed directly for validation.

```python
# Implementation to compute the sum for n=2003 with explanation
from math import comb

n = 2003
sum_k_mod_1 = sum(comb(n, k) for k in range(n + 1) if k % 3 == 1)
print(sum_k_mod_1)
```
