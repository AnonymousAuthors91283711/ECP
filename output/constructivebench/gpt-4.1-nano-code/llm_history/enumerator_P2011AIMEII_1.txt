The problem asks to find integers \(m, n\) satisfying specific coprimality and equation constraints, and to determine the sum \(m + n\). We can search through small values to find all solutions that meet the conditions and identify the minimal sum, which seems to be the goal.

Since the problem involves coprimality and a specific linear equation, we'll enumerate small positive integers for \(m\) and \(n\), check the conditions, and print the sums when the constraints are satisfied. We will stop once all possible solutions with reasonable bounds are tested.

```python
# Enumerate small positive integer pairs (m, n) to find solutions satisfying given conditions.
# Conditions:
# - m and n are coprime
# - 0 < m, 0 < n
# - (n - m) * 9 == 2 * (n // 2 - 2 * m)
# - Record m + n for solutions found.

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

results = set()
# Use small bounds to avoid unnecessary computation
for m in range(1, 50):
    for n in range(1, 50):
        if gcd(m, n) == 1:
            lhs = (n - m) * 9
            rhs = 2 * (n // 2 - 2 * m)
            if lhs == rhs:
                total = m + n
                print(f"Solution: m={m}, n={n}, sum={total}")
                results.add(total)

# Optional: find minimum sum if desired
if results:
    print(f"Minimum sum found: {min(results)}")
```
