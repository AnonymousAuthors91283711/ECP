The problem involves finding the number of real solutions to the equation arctan(x) = x^2 - 1.6, which is a continuous function problem. To assist in conjecturing the answer, I will implement a numerical enumeration over the real line within a reasonable interval—say, from -10 to 10—sampling points densely, checking where the function crosses zero, and counting the solutions. Given that solutions can be isolated roots, I will use binary search to refine their locations. This approach is efficient for a high school level problem.

```python
import math

# Define the function f(x) = arctan(x) - (x^2 - 1.6)
def f(x):
    return math.atan(x) - (x**2 - 1.6)

# Parameters for sampling
xmin, xmax = -10, 10
samples = 10000  # high density for accuracy
delta = (xmax - xmin) / samples
tolerance = 1e-6  # for root refinement

# List to hold roots
roots = []

# Sample and find sign changes to locate roots
x_values = [xmin + i * delta for i in range(samples + 1)]
f_values = [f(x) for x in x_values]

for i in range(samples):
    if f_values[i] * f_values[i + 1] <= 0:
        # Sign change indicates a root between x[i] and x[i+1]
        a, b = x_values[i], x_values[i + 1]
        # Binary search to refine root
        for _ in range(100):
            c = (a + b) / 2
            fc = f(c)
            if abs(fc) < tolerance:
                break
            if f(a) * fc < 0:
                b = c
            else:
                a = c
        root = (a + b) / 2
        # Avoid duplicates: check if close to existing roots
        if not roots or all(abs(root - r) > 1e-4 for r in roots):
            roots.append(root)
            print(f"Found root at x ≈ {root}")

# Output the total number of solutions
print("Total solutions:", len(roots))
```
