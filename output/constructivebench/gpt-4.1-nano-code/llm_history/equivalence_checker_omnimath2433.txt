Ground Truth Answer: 72576000
Proposed Answer: 720 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7
Let's analyze the proposed answer and compare it to the ground truth:

1. The ground truth answer is 72,576,000
2. The proposed answer calculates as: 720 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 = 720 * 5040 = 3,628,800

The proposed answer (3,628,800) is exactly half of the ground truth answer (72,576,000 / 2 = 36,288,000), so they are not equivalent. The proposed answer seems to be missing a factor of 20 (since 3,628,800 * 20 = 72,576,000).

<<<False>>>
