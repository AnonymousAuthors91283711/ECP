This problem appears to be about a Fibonacci-like sequence, with initial conditions \(F(1) = 1, F(2) = 1\), and the recurrence \(F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)\) for \(n \geq 3\). The goal is to compute \(\sum_{n=1}^{10} F(n)\).

Since the sequence is Fibonacci, the sum of the first \(n\) Fibonacci numbers from \(F_1\) to \(F_n\) is known to be \(F_{n+2} - 1\).

We need to find \(\sum_{n=1}^{10} F(n) = F_{12} - 1\).

Let's enumerate Fibonacci numbers until \(F_{12}\):
- \(F_1=1\)
- \(F_2=1\)
- \(F_3=2\)
- \(F_4=3\)
- \(F_5=5\)
- \(F_6=8\)
- \(F_7=13\)
- \(F_8=21\)
- \(F_9=34\)
- \(F_{10}=55\)
- \(F_{11}=89\)
- \(F_{12}=144\)

Therefore,
\(\sum_{n=1}^{10} F(n) = F_{12} - 1 = 144 - 1 = 143\).

This direct computation aligns with properties of Fibonacci sums.

```python
# Enumerate Fibonacci numbers directly to confirm the sum
fib = [0, 1, 1]  # F_0=0 (not used), F_1=1, F_2=1
for n in range(3, 13):
    fib.append(fib[-1] + fib[-2])

sum_F_1_to_10 = fib[1] + fib[2] + fib[3] + fib[4] + fib[5] + fib[6] + fib[7] + fib[8] + fib[9] + fib[10]
print("Sum of F(n) for n=1 to 10:", sum_F_1_to_10)

# Alternatively, using the Fibonacci sum formula
F12 = fib[12]
answer = F12 - 1
print("Answer based on Fibonacci sum formula:", answer)
```
