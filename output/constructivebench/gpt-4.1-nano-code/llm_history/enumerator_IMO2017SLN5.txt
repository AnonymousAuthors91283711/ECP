[write_program]
This problem involves prime numbers p and q with p > q, and an expression involving powers and division. The goal is to find all pairs (p, q) satisfying the given algebraic condition.

To explore possible solutions, I'll pick small prime values for p and q with p > q, evaluate the expression, and check whether the equality holds for some integer k. Because the expression involves potentially large exponents, I'll limit q and p to small ranges, like q ≤ 10 and p ≤ 20, to keep computations manageable.

The code will:
- Iterate over small primes q and p with p > q.
- Compute the numerator and denominator of the given fraction.
- Check if the division yields an integer.
- Print the pair (p, q) along with the computed k when the equality is satisfied.

```python
import math

# List of small primes to iterate over
primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]

# Function to check if a number is prime (for small numbers, given list)
def is_prime(n):
    return n in primes

# Iterate over q and p with p > q
for q in primes:
    for p in primes:
        if p > q:
            # Compute powers
            p_plus_q = p + q
            p_minus_q = p - q
            numerator = (p_plus_q)**p_plus_q * (p_minus_q)**p_minus_q - 1
            denominator = (p_plus_q)**p_minus_q * (p_minus_q)**p_plus_q - 1
            # Check if division yields an integer
            if denominator != 0 and numerator % denominator == 0:
                k = numerator // denominator
                print(f"p={p}, q={q}, k={k}")
```
