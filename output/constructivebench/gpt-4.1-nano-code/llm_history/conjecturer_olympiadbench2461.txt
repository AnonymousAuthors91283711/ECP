theorem olympiadbench2461 (x : ℝ) :
    log (2^(x - 1) + 3^(x + 1)) / log 2 = 2 * x - log (3^x) / log 2 ↔ x = olympiadbench2461_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Error: Program is empty. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Based on the structure, simplify the log expression: log(2^(x−1) + 3^(x+1)) / log 2. As logs are base 2, rewrite the sum as 2^{x−1} + 3^{x+1} = 2^{x−1} + 3*3^{x} = 2^{x−1} + 3 * 3^x, leading to dominant term 3^{x+1}. Equating the expressions suggests x related to these powers; the solution simplifies to the point where both sides are equal when x = 1. 

Final answer: <<<1>>>
