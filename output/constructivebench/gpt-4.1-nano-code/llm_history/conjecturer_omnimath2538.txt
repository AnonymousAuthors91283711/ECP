  IsLeast {n : ℕ | 10 < n ∧ sumDigits 17 n = sumDigits 10 n} omnimath2538_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 153. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern and enumerated answer (153) suggest the minimal n above 10 where the digit sums in base 17 and base 10 are equal. Testing small candidates yields n=153, which satisfies the criteria. The minimal such n is 153, as it meets the constraints and the digit sum equality.
