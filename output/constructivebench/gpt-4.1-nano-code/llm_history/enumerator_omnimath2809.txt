The problem asks to find the smallest natural number \( n \) such that:

\[
0 < n, \quad \exists k \in \mathbb{N}: 75n = k, \quad \text{and} \quad 783n = 10 \left(k + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3(n-3)\right).
\]

Let's analyze the equations step-by-step:

1. Since \( 75n = k \), \( k \) must be divisible by 75.
2. Substitute \( k = 75n \) into the second equation:
   \[
   783n = 10 \left(75n + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3(n-3)\right).
   \]

3. Simplify inside the parentheses:
   \[
   75n + (6 + 5 + 4 + 3(n - 3)) = 75n + (15 + 3n - 9) = 75n + (6 + 3n) = 75n + 6 + 3n.
   \]

4. Thus:
   \[
   783n = 10(75n + 6 + 3n) = 10(78n + 6) = 780n + 60.
   \]

5. Rearrange:
   \[
   783n - 780n = 60 \implies 3n = 60 \implies n = 20.
   \]

Check the constraints:

- \( n > 0 \): yes, \( n=20 \).
- \( k=75n=75*20=1500 \), which is an integer.
- Verify the second condition:
  
  \[
  783 \times 20 = 15,660.
  \]
  
  Plug into the right side:
  
  \[
  10 (1500 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 (20 - 3)) = 10 (1500 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 \times 17) = 10 (1500 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 51) = 10 (1566) = 15,660.
  \]
  
Matches perfectly.

Therefore, the minimal \( n \) is 20.

```python
# Enumerate n starting from 1 upwards to find the least valid n satisfying the conditions
for n in range(1, 101):  # Upper limit to ensure discovery
    if n <= 0:
        continue
    k = 75 * n
    # Compute the right side of the second condition
    lhs = 783 * n
    rhs_inner = k + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3*(n - 3)
    rhs = 10 * rhs_inner
    if lhs == rhs:
        print(n)  # Stream answer as soon as found
        break
```
