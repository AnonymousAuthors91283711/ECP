This problem asks for the number of 3-element subsets of the 6x6 grid such that no two points share the same row or column. In other words, we're counting the number of subsets of size 3, where each pair is in distinct rows and columns, i.e., choosing 3 positions such that no two are in the same row or column.

The approach:
- Fix the parameters: small sample values with 6 rows and 6 columns.
- Enumerate all possible combinations of 3 rows and 3 columns.
- For each such combination, count the number of ways to select positions with the restriction that the points form a matching between chosen rows and columns, i.e., selecting 3 pairs, one for each row and column, with no overlaps.
- Since the points are in a grid, this reduces to counting permutations (since each selected row must be matched to distinct columns).

The number of such subsets:
- Choose 3 rows out of 6: C(6,3)
- Choose 3 columns out of 6: C(6,3)
- For each such pair of sets, match rows to columns in all permutations: 3! ways

Total count = C(6,3) * C(6,3) * 3!

Implement this counting directly.

```python
from math import comb, factorial

# Choose 3 rows out of 6
rows_choice = comb(6, 3)
# Choose 3 columns out of 6
columns_choice = comb(6, 3)
# Number of ways to match chosen rows to columns without repetition
matchings = factorial(3)

# Total number of such subsets
total_subsets = rows_choice * columns_choice * matchings
print(total_subsets)
```
