The problem involves identifying the greatest possible value of `k` such that there exists a set `C` with `k` elements, and a unique subset `T` of `C` with size `n`, satisfying some conditions about distinctness of coordinates. To help analyze this, I will generate small sample sets and explore how many maximum elements `k` can be while maintaining the existence of such a subset `T`. 

I will:
- Fix small values of `n`, such as 1, 2, 3.
- Enumerate potential sets `C` with increasing size `k`.
- Check if there exists a unique subset `T` of `C`, with size `n`, and with the specified properties.
- Stream possible `k` values directly upon discovery.

Since the problem is combinational and constraints are complex, we'll brute-force small cases for illustration.

```python
# Enumerate possible values of k for small n
def test_case(n, max_k=10):
    results = []
    for k in range(n, max_k+1):  # k must be at least n
        found = False
        # Generate all sets C with size k (simulate by generating tuples)
        # For small exploration, generate C as a set of points with small coordinates
        # For simplicity, set coordinate ranges
        for i in range(1, 4):
            for j in range(1, 4):
                C = {(i, j)}
                # Continue expanding C until size k
                # For small cases, manually create or extend sets
                # Here, just a heuristic to generate C of size k
                # For illustration, assume C contains points with varying coordinates
                # For simplicity, just pick the first k points in a grid
                C_points = {(x // 2 + 1, y // 2 + 1) for x in range(k*2) for y in range(k*2)}
                C_points = list(C_points)[:k]
                # Now, check existence of a unique subset T with size n
                from itertools import combinations
                valid_Ts = []
                for T in combinations(C_points, n):
                    # Verify properties:
                    # 1. T has size n
                    # 2. All elements in T are distinct points
                    # 3. Elements differ either in first coordinate or second coordinate
                    if all(i != j for idx1, i in enumerate(T) for idx2, j in enumerate(T) if idx1 != idx2):
                        continue
                    # Check the condition in the problem:
                    # ∀ (i, j) in T, i ≠ j → i.1 ≠ j.1 ∧ i.2 ≠ j.2
                    # i.e., elements are mutually distinct in at least one coordinate
                    def pairwise_condition(points):
                        for p1 in points:
                            for p2 in points:
                                if p1 != p2:
                                    if p1[0] == p2[0] and p1[1] == p2[1]:
                                        return False
                        return True
                    if pairwise_condition(T):
                        valid_Ts.append(T)
                # Check if exactly one such T
                if len(valid_Ts) == 1:
                    print(f"Found k={k} with a unique T for n={n}")
                    results.append(k)
                    found = True
                    break
        if not found:

    # Output maximum k found
    if results:
        print(f"Maximum k for n={n} is {max(results)}")
