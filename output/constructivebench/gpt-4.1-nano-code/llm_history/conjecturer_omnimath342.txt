theorem omnimath342 :
  IsLeast {k : ℕ | 0 < k ∧ ∀ (V : Type) [Fintype V] (hV : Fintype.card V = 2016) 
    (E : V → V), Injective E → 
    ∃ (P : V → Fin k), ∀ (v w : V), P v = P w → 
    ∀ n ≤ 28, (E^[n]) v ≠ w} 
  omnimath342_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Trying k=1
Trying k=2
Found candidate k=2 sufficient for the partitioning constraints.
Minimal k satisfying the constraints is approximately 2.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<2>>>
