The main error occurs because 'even' is not a predefined identifier in Lean 3's Mathlib. Instead, 'even n' should be replaced with 'n % 2 = 0' to represent that n is even. Additionally, the notation for the sum should be updated to match the deprecation warning. 

The set of all even natural numbers can be expressed as: { n | n % 2 = 0 }.

Assuming from the problem and enumerations, the set of all integers k for which the property holds are precisely the even integers (2, 4, 6, ...), which matches the pattern observed in the enumerations.

Therefore, the final answer, generalized, is the set of all n ≥ 2 where n is even, i.e., n % 2 = 0.

**Final proposed answer in Lean:**

<<<fun n : ℕ => n % 2 = 0>>>

This defines the set of all even natural numbers, aligning with the enumeration and fixing the initial missing 'even' identifier.
