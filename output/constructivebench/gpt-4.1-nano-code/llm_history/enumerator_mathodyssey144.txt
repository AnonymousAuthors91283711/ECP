This problem asks us to find the greatest natural number \( n \) such that there exists a finite set \( s \) of integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), with \( |s|=n \), satisfying the property that for any distinct \( a, b \in s \), the scaled least common multiple divided by the greatest common divisor is not a perfect square. 

In simpler terms:
- \( s \subseteq \{1, 2, \dots, 100\} \),
- \( |s|=n \),
- For every distinct pair \( a, b \), the number \( \frac{\operatorname{lcm}(a, b)}{\gcd(a, b)} \) is **not** a perfect square.

Since \(\frac{\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)}{\gcd(a,b)} = \frac{a b}{\gcd(a, b)^2}\), the condition is that this ratio should **not** be a perfect square.

The best way to solve this is to generate the largest subset satisfying this property, which involves checking pairs for the perfect square condition. For efficiency and simplicity in enumeration, we will attempt to build such a set greedily, starting from the largest number and including smaller numbers if they do not violate the property with the already included members.

Here's a Python program that performs this process:

```python
import math

def is_perfect_square(n):
    root = int(math.isqrt(n))
    return root * root == n

def check_pair(a, b):
    g = math.gcd(a, b)
    numerator = a * b
    denominator = g * g
    value = numerator // denominator
    return not is_perfect_square(value)

def build_largest_set():
    s = []
    # Start from the largest number
    for num in range(100, 0, -1):
        if all(check_pair(num, x) for x in s):
            s.append(num)
            print(f"Added: {num}, current set length: {len(s)}")
    return s

largest_s = build_largest_set()
print("Final set size:", len(largest_s))
print("Set:", sorted(largest_s))
```

This code:
- Iterates from 100 down to 1
- Tries to include each number if it does not violate the property with already included numbers
- Prints each number as it is added, streaming partial results
- Outputs the final set size and contents at the end

This approach should produce a large set satisfying the property, allowing us to identify or conjecture the maximum \( n \).
