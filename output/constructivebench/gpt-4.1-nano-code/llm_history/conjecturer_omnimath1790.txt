theorem omnimath1790 : 
  IsGreatest {p : ℕ | p.Prime ∧ p ∣ 101101101101 ∧ p ≥ 1000 ∧ p ≤ 9999} omnimath1790_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 9901
Greatest prime divisor in range: 9901. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The problem seeks the greatest prime divisor of 101101101101 between 1000 and 9999. The enumeration suggests 9901 is the answer, and 9901 is prime. Therefore, the closed form answer is 9901.
