Ground Truth Answer: 100
Proposed Answer: 1000 * 4 * 5^3
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

Problem Breakdown:
1. We're looking for 4-digit numbers (1000-9999)
2. All digits must be even (0,2,4,6,8)
3. The number must be divisible by 5
4. We need to count how many such numbers exist

Analysis:
1. For a 4-digit number, first digit (thousands place) must be even and can't be 0 → options: 2,4,6,8 (4 choices)
2. Next three digits can be any even digit including 0 → options: 0,2,4,6,8 (5 choices each)
3. Divisible by 5 constraint means last digit must be 0 or 5. But since all digits must be even, only 0 is possible (1 choice for units digit)

Calculation:
- Thousands digit: 4 choices
- Hundreds digit: 5 choices
- Tens digit: 5 choices
- Units digit: 1 choice (must be 0)
Total numbers = 4 × 5 × 5 × 1 = 100

The proposed answer (1000 * 4 * 5^3) would equal 1000 × 4 × 125 = 500,000, which is clearly incorrect. The ground truth answer of 100 is correct.
