theorem omnimath257 (n : ℕ) (h : 1 < n) :
  (∃ (a : ℕ → ℤ), (∀ k, a k ≠ 0) ∧ (∀ k, ∑ i in Finset.range n, (i + 1) * a ((i + 1) * k) = 0)) ↔ n ∈ omnimath257_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Candidates for n: []. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
From the pattern and the constraints, for all k, sum over (i+1)*a((i+1)*k)=0 with all a(k) ≠ 0 suggests n must be divisible such that the sum can cancel out. The only n satisfying this for all such a(k) is n=1, but since h:1<n, n ≥ 2. Given no candidates, the empty set is the logical answer.
