The problem involves analyzing quadratic polynomials with specific relationships between their coefficients and roots. We are given:

- P(x) = x^2 + T*x + 800 with roots r1 and r2,
- Q(x) = x^2 + (r1 + r2 + 2)*x + (r1*r2 + r1 + r2).

The theorem asks us to compute the sum of the coefficients of Q: Q.coeff 0 + Q.coeff 1 + Q.coeff 2.

Since the roots r1 and r2 satisfy P(r1) = 0 and P(r2) = 0, with P(x) = x^2 + T*x + 800:

- Sum of roots: r1 + r2 = -T,
- Product of roots: r1 * r2 = 800.

The coefficients of Q are:

- Q.coeff 2: 1 (coefficient of x^2),
- Q.coeff 1: (r1 + r2 + 2),
- Q.coeff 0: (r1*r2 + r1 + r2).

Therefore,

sum of coefficients of Q = Q.coeff 0 + Q.coeff 1 + Q.coeff 2
= (r1*r2 + r1 + r2) + (r1 + r2 + 2) + 1
= (r1*r2 + r1 + r2) + r1 + r2 + 2 + 1
= r1*r2 + 2*(r1 + r2) + 3.

Substituting:

- r1 + r2 = -T,
- r1 * r2 = 800,

then:

sum = 800 + 2 * (-T) + 3 = 803 - 2*T.

We want to determine the possible values of this sum, which depends on T.

Assuming T is a real parameter, the key is that the roots are real only if the discriminant of P is non-negative:

Discriminant D = T^2 - 4*800 = T^2 - 3200 ≥ 0,

so T satisfies:

|T| ≥ √3200 ≈ 56.57.

To explore the range of possible sums:

- For T in [-∞, -56.57] and [56.57, +∞], sum = 803 - 2*T.

- As T approaches ±∞, sum approaches ∓∞.

- The minimum sum occurs at T = 56.57, maximum at T = -56.57.

Let's explicitly enumerate sums for T in a small sample:

- T = 56 (just above 56.57), then sum ≈ 803 - 112 = 691,
- T = 57, sum = 803 - 114 = 689,
- T = -56, sum ≈ 803 + 112 = 915,
- T = -57, sum = 803 + 114 = 917.

We will enumerate these approximate values.

Here's the Python code:

```python
# Enumerate possible sums of coefficients of Q based on T values satisfying root conditions
import math

discriminant_threshold = 3200
T_min = math.sqrt(discriminant_threshold)
T_values = [56, 57, -56, -57]  # Slightly above/below roots
results = []

for T in T_values:
    if abs(T) >= T_min:
        sum_coeffs = 803 - 2 * T
        # print immediate answer
        print(f"T={T}, sum of Q coefficients ≈ {sum_coeffs}")
        results.append(sum_coeffs)

# For exact T=±√3200, roots are real, sum = 803 - 2*T
# The results are approximate due to sample points.
```

This script enumerates the sums for small sample T values near the threshold, illustrating the range of possible sums for real roots.
