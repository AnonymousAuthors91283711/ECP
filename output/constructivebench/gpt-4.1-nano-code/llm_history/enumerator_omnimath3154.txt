This problem asks us to find the number of integers \( n \) in the interval \([1, 100]\) for which there exists an integer \( m \) satisfying \( m^2 = n^3 + 5n^2 \). To assist in conjecturing and proving, we'll enumerate candidate values \( n \) from 1 to 100 and check whether \( n^3 + 5n^2 \) is a perfect square. We'll print each \( n \) for which the condition holds, as well as the corresponding \( m \). No pruning is necessary since the range is small, and this approach is straightforward.

```python
import math

# List to hold solutions
solutions = []

for n in range(1, 101):
    val = n**3 + 5*n**2
    m = int(math.isqrt(val))
    if m * m == val:
        solutions.append((n, m))
        print(f"n={n}, m={m}")

# Report the total count
print(f"Total solutions: {len(solutions)}")
```
