Given the specific values: a=96, b=60, c=12, then (a + b)/c = (96 + 60)/12 = 156/12 = 13.0. The pattern suggests the answer is a constant value, independent of other variables, derived from the provided example. Thus, the closed form is 13.0.

The key error is that the attempted abbreviation `omnimath2772_answer` is defined with `sorry`, and then the detailed reasoning or comments are mistakenly included directly in the abbreviation definition, which is invalid syntax in Lean. To fix these errors and produce a proper closed-form answer, I should: 

1. Remove the verbose comments and reasoning from the abbreviation definition.
2. Assign a constant value directly to `omnimath2772_answer`. 
3. Based on the example (a=96, b=60, c=12), the computed value is 13.0, and the pattern suggests this is a constant.

Since the problem involves specific examples leading to the value 13.0 and the question asks for a closed form, I will set it as that constant in Lean syntax.

Here's the corrected and proper answer:

<<<13.0>>>
