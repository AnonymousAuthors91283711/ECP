Given the recurrence relations, initial conditions, and the pattern of enumerated answers, the sum \( a n + g n \) exhibits a linear pattern related to \( n \). Based on typical solutions to such recurrence systems and the pattern of values, the closed form for \( n \ge 1 \) is proportional to \( n - 1 \) with constant factors. The final answer simplifies to a linear expression involving \( n - 1 \).
