Ground Truth Answer: fun n => if n = 2 then 4 else if n = 3 then 6 else 7
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => n * (n - 1) / 2 + 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the minimal number of triples (subsets of size n) needed to cover all pairs from a 2n-element set.

2. Ground truth:
   - For n=2: 4 (correct, known as the "four triples" problem)
   - For n=3: 6 (correct, matches known combinatorial results)
   - For n>3: 7 (this seems to be a constant upper bound)

3. Proposed answer: n*(n-1)/2 + 1
   - For n=2: 2*1/2 + 1 = 2 (should be 4)
   - For n=3: 3*2/2 + 1 = 4 (should be 6)
   - For n=4: 4*3/2 + 1 = 7 (matches ground truth)

The proposed answer is incorrect for n=2 and n=3, but happens to match for n=4. The formula doesn't correctly represent the combinatorial requirements of the problem.
