The problem involves finding two degree 3 polynomials p and q with specified evaluation constraints and a symmetry condition: for all x, p(q(x)) = q(p(x)). We are to find the values of p(3) and q(6).

Since the code is formal (Lean), and the problem is mathematical, I'll write a Python script to enumerate possible polynomial coefficients satisfying the constraints and symmetry, then output the values p(3) and q(6). Because the degree is 3, the polynomials are:

p(x) = a_p x^3 + b_p x^2 + c_p x + d_p
q(x) = a_q x^3 + b_q x^2 + c_q x + d_q

Constraints:
- p(0) = d_p = -24
- q(0) = d_q = 30
- p.degree = 3, q.degree = 3 (so their leading coefficients are nonzero)

Symmetry condition:
- p(q(x)) = q(p(x)) for all x

To fulfill the symmetry, I will assume some small ranges for the coefficients to find solutions that satisfy the conditions approximately, then check the symmetry condition at some sample x points (since exact polynomial functional equation for all x is complex).

The code:
- Sets small ranges for coefficients.
- Checks the constraints.
- Tests the symmetry at x=-1,0,1 for simplicity.
- Prints solutions with p(3) and q(6).

```python
# Enumerate polynomial coefficients with constraints, check symmetry at sample points
import itertools

# Ranges for coefficients (small to keep search feasible)
coeff_range = range(-20, 21)

solutions = []

for a_p, b_p, c_p, a_q, b_q, c_q in itertools.product(coeff_range, repeat=6):
    d_p = -24
    d_q = 30
    # Leading coefficients non-zero
    if a_p == 0 or a_q == 0:
        continue

    # Define polynomials
    def p(x):
        return a_p * x**3 + b_p * x**2 + c_p * x + d_p

    def q(x):
        return a_q * x**3 + b_q * x**2 + c_q * x + d_q

    # Check symmetry at sample points
    sample_xs = [-1, 0, 1]
    symmetric = True
    for x in sample_xs:
        if abs(p(q(x)) - q(p(x))) > 1e-6:
            symmetric = False
            break
    if not symmetric:
        continue

    p3 = p(3)
    q6 = q(6)
    print(f"Found solution: p(3)={p3}, q(6)={q6}")
    solutions.append((p3, q6))
```

This code enumerates potential solutions satisfying the given constraints and symmetry condition approximately at selected points. It prints each found solution immediately, aiding in conjecture.
