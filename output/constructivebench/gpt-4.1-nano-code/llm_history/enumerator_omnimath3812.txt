This problem defines a functional equation: for all real numbers x, y, the function f satisfies 
f(x^2 + f(y)) = y + (f(x))^2. 

The task is to explore possible functions that satisfy this relationship by enumerating candidate solutions, ideally converging toward the true solution set or specific solutions, without hardcoding or assuming the answer. We interpret and search for simple functions that could satisfy this.

Key ideas:
- Try polynomial-like or constant functions.
- For each candidate, verify if it satisfies the functional equation.
- Because the equation involves compositions and squares, test basic functions:
  - Constant functions: f(x) = c
  - Identity functions: f(x) = x
  - Linear functions: f(x) = ax + b
- For a few small parameter choices, check whether the equation holds for arbitrary x, y.

Here's a program that exhaustively tests simple candidate functions within expected forms, prints solutions when they satisfy the relation:

```python
# Enumerate constant functions and linear functions (f(x) = a*x + b)
# Check if functional equation holds for sampled points.
# Print candidate solutions when found.

def check_function(f):
    # test for multiple pairs (x,y)
    test_points = [(-1, -1), (0, 0), (1, 1), (2, -2), (-2, 2)]
    for x, y in test_points:
        lhs = f(x**2 + f(y))
        rhs = y + (f(x))**2
        if lhs != rhs:
            return False
    return True

# Enumerate constant functions f(x)=c
for c in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
    def f_const(x, c=c):
        return c
    if check_function(f_const):
        print(f'Constant solution: f(x)={c}')

# Enumerate linear functions f(x)=a*x + b
for a in [-1, 0, 1]:
    for b in [-1, 0, 1]:
        def f_lin(x, a=a, b=b):
            return a*x + b
        if check_function(f_lin):
            print(f'Linear solution: f(x)={a}*x+{b}')
```
