The problem seems to involve finding the greatest natural number \( n \) that satisfies two conditions simultaneously:
1. \( n = k^2 + 5 \) for some \( k \in \mathbb{N} \).
2. \( n = m \times (m + 7) \) for some \( m \in \mathbb{N} \).

Our goal is to find all such \( n \) and identify the greatest one. To do so efficiently, we'll:
- Iterate over a small range of \( k \) (since both expressions grow quadratically or quadratically-like).
- For each \( k \), compute \( n = k^2 + 5 \).
- Check if \( n \) can be written as \( m(m + 7) \) for some \( m \in \mathbb{N} \). Since \( n = m^2 + 7m \), solving for \( m \) yields:

\[
m^2 + 7m - n = 0
\]

Discriminant:

\[
\Delta = 49 + 4n
\]

If \( \Delta \) is a perfect square, say \( s^2 \), then \( m = \frac{-7 \pm s}{2} \). Since \( m \ge 0 \), only the positive solution matters:

\[
m = \frac{-7 + s}{2}
\]

must be a non-negative integer.

We'll generate candidate \( k \), compute \( n \), and check for perfect square discriminant and integer \( m \).

Here's the code:

```python
import math

# Search bounds for k; assuming small enough for efficient search
max_k = 100  # arbitrary, can be enlarged if needed
answers = []

for k in range(max_k + 1):
    n = k * k + 5
    delta = 49 + 4 * n
    s = int(math.isqrt(delta))
    if s * s == delta:
        m_numerator = s - 7
        if m_numerator % 2 == 0:
            m = m_numerator // 2
            if m >= 0:
                # n = m*(m+7), check matches
                answers.append(n)
                print(n)
# Print the maximum answer found
if answers:
    print("Greatest answer:", max(answers))
```
