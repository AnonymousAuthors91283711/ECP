The problem involves quadratic functions \(f\) and \(g\), their roots, and certain relationships between their roots, including a symmetry condition \(g = -f(100 - x)\). The key is to analyze these functions with their roots and the given constraints to derive possible values for \(x_4 - x_1\), which equals \(m + n \sqrt{p}\) with some squarefree \(p\).

Since the code is presented in Lean and the problem is a high school level math challenge, the goal here is to explore algebraically feasible root configurations, especially focusing on the structure of quadratic functions and the symmetry property involving \(g\) and \(f\). The constraints involve roots and the translation \(x_3 - x_2 = 150\), hinting at relationships between roots.

To assist in conjecturing the "true answer", we'll choose sample parameters consistent with the problem structure and enumerate possible configurations of \(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\). Under these constraints, the key is to analyze the structure of roots and how they might relate via the symmetry, which often results in quadratic equations that can yield solutions involving square roots.

Our code explores plausible root arrangements considering the symmetry, roots, and the gap, and computes \(x_4 - x_1\) as \(m + n \sqrt{p}\) with small squarefree integers \(p\). It enumerates all such candidate solutions, prioritizing exact algebraic forms, and outputs them immediately.

            return False
    return True

# f(x) = a x^2 + b x + c with a != 0
# g(x) = d x^2 + e x + k with d != 0
# Given symmetry: g(x) = -f(100 - x)

# From g = -f(100 - x), comparing quadratic forms:
# g(x) = -f(100 - x) => d x^2 + e x + k = -a (100 - x)^2 - b (100 - x) - c

[refine_program]
The program attempts a brute-force search over roots and coefficients to find solutions matching the problem constraints, but it has several issues:

- It searches over roots with a fixed step size but doesn't account for floating point precision, leading to no matches.
- The key condition is to produce an answer x4 - x1 as m + n * sqrt(p), with small p, and only print when matching algebraic forms approximately.
- The code doesn't properly verify if the difference approximates such an algebraic expression and the problem asks for streaming partial results, not min/max after all.

Given the above, the code's enumeration produces no output, indicating it either isn't triggered or can't find solutions with the current approach. The problem demands immediate streaming outputs when answers are found (streaming partial results), and the code doesn't handle that.

**Judgement:**  
The program outputs nothing, which doesn't match problem requirements and is unlikely to satisfy the enumeration constraints. Also, the code's approach is inefficient and doesn't incorporate the problem's algebraic structure properly.
