  max (max a b) (max c d) = omnimath3009_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 59
59. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The system of equations deduces the values of a, b, c, d by solving the linear system, with the maximum being d (since 40, 44 are highest averages). Given the enumerated answer is 59, the maximum of a, b, c, d is 59. 

Thus, the closed form answer consistent with the enumeration is:

<<<59>>>
