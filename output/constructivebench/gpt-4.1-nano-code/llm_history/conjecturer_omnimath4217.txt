Solution: x=5, y=0. Expected Answer Type: Prop
The pattern indicates solutions where |x| + |y| = 5, capturing all pairs with sum of absolute values equal to 5. Therefore, the prop should state that (x,y) satisfy |x| + |y| = 5.

The error in your Lean code is caused by the extraneous "⟩" token at the end of the definition, which is not valid syntax in Lean. Since your goal is to define a proposition `omnimath4217_answer` capturing the solutions where the sum of the absolute values of `x` and `y` is 5, the correct way is to write an assertion about that set of solutions. This can be expressed as a statement that "there exist `x` and `y` with `|x| + |y| = 5`." If you intend to specify all solutions explicitly, you can state the propositional content as an instance that explicitly lists all such pairs, but the simplest and common expression of the solution set as a Prop is to define the property that such pairs exist.

Given the enumerated solutions, the key point is that the solutions are exactly those pairs `(x, y)` satisfying `|x| + |y| = 5`. A natural proposition is:

```lean
∀ x y : ℤ, (|x| + |y| = 5)
```

which states that "for all integers `x`, `y`, the sum of their absolute values is 5," which is false except for the solutions. Alternatively, you could specify that "there exist `x` and `y` such that `|x| + |y| = 5`," i.e.,

```lean
∃ x y : ℤ, |x| + |y| = 5
```

but to precisely encapsulate the solutions, the statement is:

```lean
∀ x y : ℤ, |x| + |y| = 5
```

which matches the pattern from the enumeration: solutions involve pairs with absolute values summing to 5, matching the listed solutions.

Therefore, the corrected markup, replacing the erroneous "⟩" with proper syntax, would be:

<<<
∀ x y : ℤ, |x| + |y| = 5
>>>

This captures the solution set that all pairs `(x, y)` satisfy `|x| + |y| = 5`. If you wanted to express the exact particular solutions explicitly, you could do so, but this general form aligns better with the typical proposition style.

**In conclusion, the answer is:**

<<<
∀ x y : ℤ, |x| + |y| = 5
>>>
