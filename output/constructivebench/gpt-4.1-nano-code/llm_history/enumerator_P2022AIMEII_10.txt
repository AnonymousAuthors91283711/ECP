This problem involves summing a sequence and taking the result modulo 1000. The key parts are the binomial coefficients \(\binom{i}{2}\) and \(\binom{\binom{i}{2}}{2}\), summed over \(i\) from 3 to 40. To conjecture the answer, we will enumerate the sum directly in Python, compute each term, and output the intermediate values, focusing on exact calculations. Since the range is small, efficiency is not critical; correctness and streaming results are prioritized.

```python
# Enumerate over i from 3 to 40, inclusive
# Compute binomial coefficients using a simple function
def choose(n, k):
    if k > n or k < 0:
        return 0
    result = 1
    for j in range(1, k+1):
        result = result * (n - j + 1) // j
    return result

total_sum = 0
for i in range(3, 41):
    inner = choose(i, 2)
    outer = choose(inner, 2)
    total_sum += outer
    print(f"i={i}, choose(i,2)={inner}, choose(choose(i,2),2)={outer}, running sum={total_sum}")

# Output the total sum modulo 1000
answer = total_sum % 1000
print(f"Total sum mod 1000: {answer}")
```
