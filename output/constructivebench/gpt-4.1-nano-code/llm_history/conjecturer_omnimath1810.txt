. Enumerated answers: Found solution: x = -4.0, y = -4.0
Found solution: x = 3.0, y = 3.0. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ × ℝ)
The solutions are the points where x equals y, and x satisfies x^2 + x = 12, i.e., x^2 + x - 12 = 0. Factoring gives (x - 3)(x + 4) = 0, so solutions are x = 3 or x = -4. Correspondingly, (x, y) = (3, 3) or (-4, -4).
