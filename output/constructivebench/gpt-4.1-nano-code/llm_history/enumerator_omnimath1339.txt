[write_program]
This problem involves finding the supremum of the set of real numbers \(k\) satisfying a given relation involving positive \(x, y\). To assist in conjecturing the answer, I will write a Python program that numerically searches for values of \(k\) where the equation holds, sampling positive \(x, y\) values and searching for the maximum \(k\).

The approach:
- Fix small ranges for \(x\) and \(y\).
- For each pair \((x, y)\), check the feasible \(k\) values that satisfy the equation.
- Record all such \(k\) found and track the maximum value.
- Since the equation involves polynomial and reciprocal expressions, we will try a range of \(k\).

This will help in conjecturing the supremum value. Maximize, with a somewhat dense sampling, to ensure coverage.

```python
import numpy as np

# Set parameter sampling limits
x_vals = np.linspace(0.1, 2.0, 20)
y_vals = np.linspace(0.1, 2.0, 20)
k_candidates = []

# For each pair (x, y), attempt to solve for k
for x in x_vals:
    for y in y_vals:
        q = (x / y) + (y / x)
        r = (x**2 / y**2) + (y**2 / x**2)
        # Equation: k^2 * r + k * q = 3
        # Quadratic in k: r k^2 + q k - 3 = 0
        a, b, c = r, q, -3
        discriminant = b**2 - 4 * a * c
        if discriminant >= 0:
            sqrt_disc = np.sqrt(discriminant)
            for sign in [1, -1]:
                k = (-b + sign * sqrt_disc) / (2 * a)
                # Record all real solutions
                print(k)
                k_candidates.append(k)

# Output the maximum found k, as an estimate for the supremum
if k_candidates:
    print("Maximum candidate for k:", max(k_candidates))
else:
    print("No solutions found.")
```
