This problem involves finding a function \(x : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) such that for each \(n \in \{0, 1, 2, \ldots, 123\}\),

\[
(4 + n)^{x(n)} = 5 + n,
\]

and then evaluating the product \(\prod_{n=0}^{123} x(n)\).

To explore, we start by examining the relation:

\[
(4 + n)^{x(n)} = 5 + n.
\]

This implies:

\[
x(n) = \frac{\ln(5 + n)}{\ln(4 + n)}.
\]

Our approach:

- For all \(n\) from 0 to 123, compute \(x(n) = \frac{\ln(5 + n)}{\ln(4 + n)}\).
- Compute the product \(\prod x(n)\).

Since the expressions involve continuous real numbers, and the product may be reasonable, we will compute and output the product directly.

```python
import math

# Range of n
N = 124

product = 1.0
for n in range(N):
    numerator = math.log(5 + n)
    denominator = math.log(4 + n)
    x_n = numerator / denominator
    print(f"n={n}, x(n)={x_n}")
    product *= x_n

print(f"\nProduct of x(n) for n=0 to 123: {product}")
```
