[write_program]
This math problem involves nested square roots and a comparison or calculation leading to an answer. To assist in conjecturing, we'll enumerate possible values for the expression `sqrt((sqrt(81) + sqrt(81))/2)`.

Since √81 = 9, the inner sum is 9 + 9 = 18, divided by 2 gives 9. Then √9 = 3. The exact value is 3, but to help in conjecturing, I'll write a program that approximates and confirms the exact value, printing the step-by-step results.

```python
# Enumerate possible candidate answers to help conjecture the value of the expression
def main():
    sqrt81 = 81 ** 0.5
    print(f"sqrt(81) = {sqrt81}")
    
    sum_sqrt = sqrt81 + sqrt81
    print(f"sqrt(81) + sqrt(81) = {sum_sqrt}")
    
    avg = sum_sqrt / 2
    print(f"((sqrt(81) + sqrt(81)))/2 = {avg}")
    
    # Enumerate approximations of sqrt(avg), from close to 0 up to 5
    for candidate in [i * 0.1 for i in range(0, 50)]:
        # To check if candidate^2 approximates avg
        approx = candidate ** 2
        print(f"Candidate answer: {candidate}, approximately {approx}")
        # If very close to avg, print exact and break
        if abs(approx - avg) < 1e-6:
            print(f"Found candidate close to sqrt({avg}): {candidate}")
            break
    
    # Confirm the exact value
    exact_value = ( (sqrt81 + sqrt81) / 2 ) ** 0.5
    print(f"Exact value of sqrt((sqrt(81) + sqrt(81))/2): {exact_value}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
