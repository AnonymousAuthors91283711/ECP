abbrev P2015AMCB_1_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem P2015AMCB_1 : (2 : ℚ) - (-2 : ℚ)^(-2 : ℤ) = P2015AMCB_1_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Answer as a rational: 7/4
Approximate decimal: 1.75. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The pattern suggests that the answer is rational and consistent with the given enumeration. Since the enumeration explicitly states 7/4 and the calculation aligns with that, the most straightforward closed-form answer is:

<<<(7 : ℚ) / 4>>>
