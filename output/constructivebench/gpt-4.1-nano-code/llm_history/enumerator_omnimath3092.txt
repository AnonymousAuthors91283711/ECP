The problem involves finding natural numbers \( t \) and \( s \) that satisfy the system:

1. \( 3 + t = 5 \)
2. \( t + s = 7 \)
3. \( t + t + t + s + s = \text{answer} \)

Let's analyze step-by-step:
- The first equation implies \( t = 2 \).
- The second gives \( s = 7 - t = 7 - 2 = 5 \).
- The third sum becomes \( 3t + 2s = 3 \times 2 + 2 \times 5 = 6 + 10 = 16 \).

The code will just explicitly check values (here, there's only one solution), but to match your requirement, we'll enumerate possible \( t,s \) candidates around the solution (say within Â±3), then compute the sum and print findings as we go.

```python
# Enumerate candidate values for t and s within a small range around the known solution (t=2, s=5)
# Check which satisfy the first two equations, then compute the sum

for t in range(0, 6):  # small sample around t=2
    for s in range(0, 8):  # small sample around s=5
        # Conditions based on the system
        if 3 + t == 5 and t + s == 7:
            answer = 3 * t + 2 * s
            print(f"t={t}, s={s}, answer={answer}")
```
