The problem asks for the number of positive divisors of 900 that are perfect squares. To approach this, we factor 900, find all divisors, check which are perfect squares, and count them.

Steps:
1. Factor 900 into its prime factors.
2. Generate all divisors based on the prime factor exponents.
3. Check which divisors are perfect squares.
4. Count and print each qualifying divisor.

```python
# Prime factorization of 900: 900 = 2^2 * 3^2 * 5^2
# Divisors are formed by 2^a * 3^b * 5^c, with a,b,c in {0,1,2}
# A divisor is a perfect square if all exponents are even.

# Generate all divisors
for a in range(3):  # 0 to 2
    for b in range(3):
        for c in range(3):
            divisor = (2 ** a) * (3 ** b) * (5 ** c)
            # Check if divisor is a perfect square: all exponents are even
            if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0 and c % 2 == 0:
                print(divisor)
```
