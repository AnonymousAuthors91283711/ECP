theorem omnimath2664 :
  let pairs := [(1,6), (2,3), (3,2), (6,1)]
  let values := pairs.map fun (x,y) => 2^(2 * y)
  values.sum = omnimath2664_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Pairs: [(1, 6), (2, 3), (3, 2), (6, 1)]
Values (2^(2*y)): [4096, 64, 16, 4]
Total sum: 4180. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<16 * 2^4 + 64 + 4 + 4096>>>
