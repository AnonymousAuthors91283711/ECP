This problem references some properties involving real numbers, integers, and an unknown function `omnimath3731_answer`. The statement involves equivalence between a universal statement over integers involving powers of `x`, and the existence of an integer `y` meeting certain conditions. 

Given the structure, the key idea seems related to solving equations involving `x^n + x^{-n}`. This expression is reminiscent of Chebyshev polynomials or trigonometric identities involving cosines or hyperbolic cosines. Specifically:
- For real `x`, the expression `x^n + x^{-n}` can be written as `2 cosh(n t)` where `x = e^t`.
- The condition `|y| ≥ 2` and the expressions involving `y` resemble the quadratic formulas derived from such identities.

The problem asks us to find possible answers (values of `x`) that satisfy these relations for integer `n`. It involves parameters `y` with absolute value at least 2 and specific algebraic expressions involving square roots.

Since the code snippet suggests an algebraic form involving solving quadratic equations, I'll:
- Pick small integer values for `y` with `|y| ≥ 2`.
- For each `y`, compute the corresponding `x`:
  - `x = y` (trivial case), or
  - `x = (y - sqrt(y^2 - 4))/2`

Enumerate some small `y` values to generate candidates for `x`.

Here's a Python script that does the enumeration, noting the two forms of `x` derived from `y`:

```python
# Enumerate small y with |y| >= 2
for y in range(-10, 11):
    if abs(y) >= 2:
        # Candidate 1: y itself
        x1 = y
        print(f"x = {x1}")
        # Candidate 2: (y - sqrt(y^2 - 4)) / 2
        discriminant = y*y - 4
        if discriminant >= 0:
            x2 = (y - discriminant**0.5)/2
            print(f"x = {x2}")
        # Also check the symmetric expression (in case y-negative)
        if y != 0:
            x3 = (y + discriminant**0.5)/2
            print(f"x = {x3}")
```

This code prints candidate solutions for `x` based on selected `y`. It matches the algebraic structure, respects the bounds `|y| ≥ 2`, and is efficient by limiting the enumeration to small `y`. It can be extended or refined as needed for the problem context.
