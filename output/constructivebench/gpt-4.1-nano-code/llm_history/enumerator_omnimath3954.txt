The problem involves exploring a functional equation with boundedness conditions, aiming to identify or approximate the function `f`. To assist in conjecturing and proving, we will instantiate candidates for `f` over a small sample domain, check the constraints, and stream the possible solutions while ensuring efficiency and clarity.

The core elements:
- `f` is bounded above by some `M`.
- `f` satisfies a specific functional equation.

Since the actual form of `f` is not specified, a reasonable approach is to test simple functions like constants, linear functions, or small polynomials approximating potential solutions. For each candidate, we verify the functional equation over a sampled set of points in `ℝ`, constrained to small integers for simplicity.

This approach allows us to explore plausible solutions and observe patterns that may guide a formal proof.

```python
# Enumerate simple candidate functions (constants and linear)
# over small input sampled points, and check the functional equation.
# Stream solutions when the equation holds.

# Define a small set of sample inputs to test the functional equation.
sample_points = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]

# Candidate functions: constant and linear functions with small coefficients.
candidate_functions = []

# Generate constant functions: f(x) = c for c in {-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3}
for c in range(-3, 4):
    candidate_functions.append(('constant', c))

# Generate linear functions: f(x) = a*x + b with small a, b in {-1, 0, 1}
for a in [-1, 0, 1]:
    for b in [-1, 0, 1]:
        candidate_functions.append(('linear', a, b))

# Test each candidate function:
for fname in candidate_functions:
    # Define the function based on candidate type
    if fname[0] == 'constant':
        c = fname[1]
        def f(x, c=c):
            return c
    else:
        a, b = fname[1], fname[2]
        def f(x, a=a, b=b):
            return a*x + b

    # Check the functional equation for sampled points
    equation_holds = True
    for x in sample_points:
        for y in sample_points:
            lhs = f(x * f(y))
            rhs = x * f(y) + f(x * y)
            if abs(lhs - rhs) > 1e-6:
                equation_holds = False
                break
        if not equation_holds:
            break

    # If the candidate satisfies the equation over sample points, print it
    if equation_holds:
        if fname[0] == 'constant':
            print(f"f(x) = {c}")
        else:
            a, b = fname[1], fname[2]
            print(f"f(x) = {a} * x + {b}")
