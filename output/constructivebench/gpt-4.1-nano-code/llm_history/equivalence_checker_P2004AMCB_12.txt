Ground Truth Answer: fun n => if n % 6 = 0 then 0 else 2004 - (n % 6)
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => 2002 + ((-1 : ℤ) ^ (n - 3)).natAbs * ((n - 3) / 2 + 1)
Let's analyze the problem and the two answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive function f with initial values f(0)=2001, f(1)=2002, f(2)=2003, and a recurrence relation for n≥3.

2. The ground truth answer shows a periodic pattern with period 6, where f(n)=0 when n is divisible by 6, and otherwise follows a linear pattern based on n mod 6.

3. The proposed answer attempts to express the solution using powers of -1 and integer division.

Looking at the first few values:
- For n=3: ground truth gives 2003 (since 3 mod 6=3, 2004-3=2001), but the recurrence gives f(3)=f(1)+f(0)-f(2)=2002+2001-2003=2000. The answers don't match.
- For n=4: ground truth gives 2002 (2004-2), recurrence gives f(4)=f(2)+f(1)-f(3)=2003+2002-2000=2005. Again mismatch.

The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth behavior, which we can verify by checking the first few values. The ground truth shows a clear periodic pattern while the proposed answer doesn't capture this behavior correctly.
