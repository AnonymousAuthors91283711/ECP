This problem involves calculating the square root of the sum of three cubes of 3, which is \( \sqrt{3^3 + 3^3 + 3^3} \). Since \( 3^3 = 27 \), the expression becomes \( \sqrt{27 + 27 + 27} = \sqrt{81} \). The exact value is 9. Our task is to write a Python program that enumerates possible answers for this calculation.

The program will:
- Compute the sum of three 3^3's.
- Calculate the square root.
- Since the value is a perfect square, the exact answer is 9.
- The program outputs the answer immediately upon computing.

```python
import math

# Calculate the sum of three cubes of 3
sum_cubes = 3**3 + 3**3 + 3**3  # 27 + 27 + 27 = 81

# Compute the square root
answer = math.sqrt(sum_cubes)

print(f"Calculated answer: {answer}")

# Since the sum is a perfect square, answer should be 9
# Stream the exact value
# Compose the answer to match goal: real sqrt value
print(f"Exact answer: {answer:.15g}")

# Provide the integer exact answer
if answer.is_integer():
    print(f"Integer answer: {int(answer)}")
```
