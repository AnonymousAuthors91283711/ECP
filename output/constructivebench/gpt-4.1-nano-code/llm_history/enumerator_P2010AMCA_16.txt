This problem involves generating certain 3-element subsets from the ranges {1..9} for Bernardo and Silvia, calculating their respective three-digit numbers, then counting pairs where Bernardo's number is greater than Silvia's. To assist in conjecturing and proving the answer, we'll enumerate all possible pairs systematically. Since the numbers involve factorials and set operations, we'll handle the generation carefully, prioritize exact matches, and limit enumeration to feasible ranges. We'll print each candidate as we go, then compute the resulting ratio.

```python
# Enumerate all 3-element subsets of {1..9} and compute their corresponding 3-digit numbers.
# For each pair, count how many Bernardo numbers are greater than Silvia numbers.
# Print each pair and number to observe patterns.
from itertools import combinations

def factorial(n):
    return 1 if n <= 1 else n * factorial(n - 1)

bernardo_numbers = []
silvia_numbers = []

# Generate Bernardo numbers
for s in combinations(range(1, 10), 3):
    l = sorted(s, reverse=True)
    num = l[0] * 100 + l[1] * 10 + l[2]
    bernardo_numbers.append(num)

# Generate Silvia numbers
for s in combinations(range(1, 10), 3):
    l = sorted(s, reverse=True)
    num = l[0] * 100 + l[1] * 10 + l[2]
    silvia_numbers.append(num)

total_pairs = len(bernardo_numbers) * len(silvia_numbers)
favorable_count = 0

# Iterate over all pairs
for b in bernardo_numbers:
    for s in silvia_numbers:
        print(f"Bernardo: {b}, Silvia: {s}")  # Stream individual pairs
        if b > s:
            favorable_count += 1

# Compute ratio
ratio = favorable_count / total_pairs

print(f"Total pairs: {total_pairs}")
print(f"Favorable pairs (b > s): {favorable_count}")
print(f"Ratio: {ratio}")
```
