This problem involves counting three-digit numbers (from 100 to 999) whose digits sum to 24, then computing the proportion over all three-digit numbers. To assist with the enumeration, we will generate all three-digit numbers, filter those with digit sum 24, and count them. Then, divide by the total number of three-digit numbers (900). We will print each answer immediately when found.

```python
# Enumerate all three-digit numbers, count those with digit sum 24
answers = []

for n in range(100, 1000):
    digits = [int(d) for d in str(n)]
    if sum(digits) == 24:
        answers.append(n)
        print(f"Found number: {n} with digits {digits}, sum to 24.")

# Count total three-digit numbers and those with sum 24
total_numbers = 900  # from 100 to 999 inclusive
matching_count = len(answers)

# Compute the proportion
proportion = matching_count / total_numbers
print(f"\nTotal three-digit numbers with digit sum 24: {matching_count}")
print(f"Proportion: {proportion}")
```
