theorem omnimath39 :
  {a : ℕ | a > 0 ∧ ∃ X : Finset ℤ, X.card = 6 ∧ ∀ k ∈ Icc 1 36, ∃ x ∈ X, ∃ y ∈ X, 37 ∣ a * x + y - k} = omnimath39_answer :=

. Enumerated answers: 6
6
6. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
Since the problem involves divisibility conditions involving the set elements and all values between 1 and 36, and the enumerated answer is 6 (repeated), the consistent interpreted solution is that `a` must be 6 to ensure `37` always divides `a * x + y - k` for some `x, y` in a 6-element set.

<<<{a : ℕ | a = 6}>>>
