[write_program]
The given problem appears to involve a recursive or iterative process applying a "switcheroo" operation to a vector repeatedly, and finding the least number of such operations needed to restore the original vector. Since the full implementation details are missing, I will assume the key components:

- `switcheroo` is some operation that rearranges or transforms a vector of length \(2^n\).
- The goal is to find, for each \(n\), the minimum number of applications of the combined operation until the vector returns to its original state.

Given the constraints, I will:

- Sample small \(n\) values (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
- For each, enumerate candidate \(m\) to find the minimal \(m > 0\) satisfying the condition.
- Use small vectors to manually verify small cases, assuming the operation is a permutation with finite order.

Note: Since the operation `switcheroo` is not provided, I will mock a reasonable behavior: it will be a permutation where I could test for cycles. The core idea is to discover how many applications are needed for a vector to return to original form.

Here's the Python code:

```python
import itertools

# Mock switcheroo: for demonstration, perform a simple permutation on indices
def switcheroo(n, k, w):
    size = 2 ** n
    # Example permutation: swap pairs at position k
    new_w = list(w)
    for i in range(0, size, 2):
        if i + 1 < size:
            new_w[i], new_w[i + 1] = new_w[i + 1], new_w[i]
    return new_w

# Function to find order of the permutation
def find_order(n, w):
    original = w
    current = w
    count = 0
    while True:
        count += 1
        # apply the combined transformation using switcheroo on all k in range(n)
        for k in range(n):
            current = switcheroo(n, k, current)
        if current == original:
            return count
        if count > 100:
            # prevent infinite loop in case of non-cyclic, limit
            return None

# For small n, test all vectors (e.g., all binary vectors)
def minimal_return_time(n):
    size = 2 ** n
    min_m = None
    # Generate all vectors
    for bits in itertools.product([0, 1], repeat=size):
        w = list(bits)
        m = find_order(n, w)
        if m is not None:
            if min_m is None or m < min_m:
                min_m = m
    return min_m if min_m is not None else 0

# Enumerate for small n
for n in range(1, 4):
    answer = minimal_return_time(n)
    print(f"For n = {n}, minimal return time: {answer}")
```

This code:

- Defines a mock `switcheroo` (permutation swap).
- Enumerates all vectors of size \(2^n\).
- Finds the minimal number of transformations needed to return the vector to its original.
- Prints the minimal return time for each small \(n\).

Adjust `switcheroo` as needed to match the actual operation once known.
