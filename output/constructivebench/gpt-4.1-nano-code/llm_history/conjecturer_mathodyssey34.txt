The key is to find the greatest \(k\) such that \(1991^k \mid 1990^{19911992} + 1992^{19911990}\). Using number theory patterns, note that \(1990 = 1991 - 1\) and \(1992 = 1991 + 1\). The expression resembles a sum involving consecutive powers; the divisibility by powers of \(1991\) depends on the valuation of the sum modulo (a small power) of \(1991\). It turns out that the sum is divisible by \(1991\) only once, i.e., \(k=1\). 

Thus, the maximum \(k\) with the divisibility property is 1.
