This problem involves finding the greatest value of \( z = xy \) under the condition \( P x y \) which is true if and only if \( x > 0 \), \( y > 0 \), and \( x + y = 31 \). 

To find the maximum \( xy \) given \( x + y = 31 \) with both \( x, y > 0 \), since \( xy \) is maximized when \( x \) and \( y \) are as close as possible, we can check pairs near \( x = 15, y = 16 \) (the two numbers are close to half of 31).

The pairs to check are:  
- \( (15, 16) \) with product \( 15 \times 16 = 240 \)  
- \( (14, 17) \) with product \( 14 \times 17 = 238 \)  
- \( (16, 15) \) with product \( 16 \times 15 = 240 \)  
and so on, but symmetry confirms the maximum is at \( (15, 16) \) and \( (16, 15) \).

Here's a Python script to enumerate all pairs \( (x, y) \) with \( x + y = 31 \), \( x > 0 \), \( y > 0 \), and print the maximum product found.

```python
# Enumerate pairs (x, y) with x + y = 31, x > 0, y > 0
max_product = 0
answer_pairs = []

for x in range(1, 31):
    y = 31 - x
    product = x * y
    # Print each candidate immediately
    print(f"x={x}, y={y}, product={product}")
    if product > max_product:
        max_product = product
        answer_pairs = [(x, y)]
    elif product == max_product:
        answer_pairs.append((x, y))

print(f"Maximum product: {max_product}")
# Output the pairs that give the maximum product
for pair in answer_pairs:
    print(f"Pair: x={pair[0]}, y={pair[1]} with product={max_product}")
```
