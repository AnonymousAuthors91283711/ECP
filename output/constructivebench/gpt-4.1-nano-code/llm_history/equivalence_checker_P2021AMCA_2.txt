Ground Truth Answer: fun a b => a * b = 0 ∧ a + b ≥ 0
Proposed Answer: fun a b : ℝ => (a ≥ 0 ∧ b = 0) ∨ (a = 0 ∧ b ≥ 0)
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

Ground Truth: a*b = 0 ∧ a + b ≥ 0
- This means either a=0 or b=0 (or both), and their sum is non-negative

Proposed Answer: (a ≥ 0 ∧ b = 0) ∨ (a = 0 ∧ b ≥ 0)
- This is more restrictive than the ground truth
- It requires exactly one of them to be zero and the other to be non-negative
- It excludes cases where both are zero (which is allowed in ground truth)
- It also excludes cases where one is negative and the other is positive with sufficient magnitude to make a+b ≥ 0 (e.g., a=-1, b=2)

The proposed answer is a subset of the ground truth, but not equivalent to it. It misses some valid cases that satisfy the ground truth condition.
