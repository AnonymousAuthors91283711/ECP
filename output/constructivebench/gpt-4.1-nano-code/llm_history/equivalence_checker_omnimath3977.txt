Ground Truth Answer: {(9, 3), (6, 3), (9, 5), (54, 5)}
Proposed Answer: fun p => ∃ n ≥ 1, p = (3^(n-1), n)
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem is asking to find all pairs (m,n) of natural numbers that satisfy the equation m² + 2*3ⁿ = m*(2ⁿ⁺¹ - 1).

The ground truth provides four specific solutions: (9,3), (6,3), (9,5), and (54,5).

The proposed answer suggests that all solutions are of the form (3ⁿ⁻¹, n) for n ≥ 1.

Let's test the proposed solution pattern against the ground truth:

1. For n=3: m=3²=9 → (9,3) matches ground truth
2. For n=5: m=3⁴=81 → (81,5) but ground truth has (9,5) and (54,5)
3. The proposed form doesn't generate (6,3) or (54,5) at all

The proposed answer only captures one of the four solutions (9,3) and misses the others. It also incorrectly suggests (81,5) would be a solution when it's not in the ground truth.
