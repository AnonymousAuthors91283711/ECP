Given the equations: n(2a + (n - 1)d) = 1430 and n(2a + (n - 1)d) + n^2 = 1672, subtracting yields n^2 = 242. Since n is natural, n = 11. Then, 11(2a + 10d) = 1430 implies 2a + 10d = 130 / 11, which is not integral, so revisit assumptions; look for integral solutions where n divides 1430 and 1672. The consistent solution with n = 10 yields a + 4d = 143 / 10, not integral, so testing n = 11 again confirms understanding. With n=11, 11(2a + 10d) = 1430 implies 2a + 10d = 130. Then, a + 5d = 65. The sum a + (a + 10d) + (a + 5d) = 3a + 15d = 3(65 - 5d) + 15d = 195 - 15d + 15d = 195. So, the sum simplifies to 195. The correct answer is 195.

<<<195>>>
