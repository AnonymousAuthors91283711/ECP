Count: 21. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the inequality |2 * x| ≤ 7 * π, solving for integral x yields the range from -⌊(7 * π) / 2⌋ to ⌊(7 * π) / 2⌋, inclusive. Since π ≈ 3.14159, compute ⌊(7 * 3.14159) / 2⌋ ≈ ⌊10.995 / 2⌋ = 5. The integers from -5 to 5 are within bounds, totaling 11 elements. Revised to match the enumerated answer count, the approach finds all integers x where |2x| ≤ 7π, i.e., x ∈ [-10,10]. Thus, the count is 21. The answer is:

Count: 21. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The current answer `Finset.Icc (-10) 11` produces a type mismatch because `Finset.Icc` creates a finite set of integers, but the target `P2024AMCB_3_answer` is of type ℕ (natural number). The key is that the problem's current statement involves the cardinality of a set of integers with an inequality constraint, and the answer `P2024AMCB_3_answer` should be the cardinality (number of elements) of that set.

The set consists of integers x such that |2x| ≤ 7π. Since |2x| ≤ 7π, then:

- 2|x| ≤ 7π  ⇒  |x| ≤ (7π) / 2.

Given π's approximation, but to stay within the bounds, we handle it symbolically. Because the set involves integers satisfying this inequality, and the absolute value bounds create an interval of x values:

- x ∈ [-⌊(7π)/2⌋, ⌈(7π)/2⌉].

The total number of integers in this interval is twice the integer part plus possibly one if the interval includes zero.

In Lean, since π is a real number, and the set is the set of integers satisfying an absolute value inequality, its cardinality is approximately 2 * ⌊(7π)/2⌋ + 1, counting all integers from -⌊(7π)/2⌋ up to +⌊(7π)/2⌋.

Given the enumeration specifies the values from -10 up to 10 inclusive—total 21 elements—it suggests that the exact count is 21. Also, 7π ≈ 21.9911, so (7π)/2 ≈ 10.9955, and its floor is 10.

Thus, the elements x satisfying |2x| ≤ 7π are x ∈ [-10, 10], inclusive, totaling 21 elements.

Therefore, the `P2024AMCB_3_answer` is 21.

Final code:

<<<21>>>

This is a natural number and matches the enumeration.
