This problem involves counting the number of bijective functions from Fin 5 to Fin 5 (permutations of 5 elements) with an additional restriction: for any pair (i, j), if |i.val - j.val| ≥ 3, then f j < f i.

The set {i : Fin 5} is {0,1,2,3,4}. The restriction applies to pairs where their indices differ by at least 3: so (0,3), (0,4), (1,4), and their reverses. The constraint essentially orders certain pairs of images.

To enumerate solutions:
- Generate all permutations of 5 elements.
- For each permutation, check the forbidden pairs: if for any pair with index difference ≥ 3, the image of j (f j) is less than that of i (f i).
- Count and print each permutation that satisfies the condition.

Here's a Python script implementing this enumeration:

```python
from itertools import permutations

# Generate all permutations of [0,1,2,3,4]
elements = list(range(5))
count = 0  # Count the number of valid permutations

for perm in permutations(elements):
    # perm[i] is the image of i
    valid = True
    # Check all pairs with index difference >= 3
    for i in range(5):
        for j in range(i+3, 5):
            # If the restriction is violated, perm[j] < perm[i]
            # But the condition states: if |i - j| >= 3, then f j < f i
            if not (perm[j] < perm[i]):
                valid = False
                break
        if not valid:
            break
    if valid:
        print(perm)
        count += 1

print(f"Total valid permutations: {count}")
```

This code streams each valid permutation immediately upon discovery, counts total solutions, and is efficient by only checking relevant pairs. The total number of such permutations corresponds to the output of the theorem.
