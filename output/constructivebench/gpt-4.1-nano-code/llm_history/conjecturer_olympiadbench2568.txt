theorem olympiadbench2568 (k : ℝ) (hk : k ≠ 0) :
    (∃ x, k * x^2 + (5 * k + 3) * x + (6 * k + 5) = 0 ∧
        2 * k * x + (5 * k + 3) = 0) ↔ k ∈ olympiadbench2568_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: k = -1 satisfies the system with x = -1.0. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
The given system reduces to the linear equation for x: 2 k x + (5 k +3) = 0, which yields x = -(5 k + 3)/(2 k). Substituting into the quadratic, the condition simplifies to whether this x satisfies k x^2 + (5 k + 3) x + (6 k + 5) = 0. Simplification shows this holds when k = -1. For k ≠ 0, only k = -1 satisfies both equations with x = -1. Therefore, the set contains only k = -1.
