[write_program]
This problem appears to involve summing over all functions from a 7-element finite set to the natural numbers, then evaluating the sum of values divided by 3 raised to the sum of these values. We want to find all possible sums and then analyze the sum of the entire expression for these functions.

The key parts:
- Enumerate all functions \(a : Fin 7 \to \mathbb{N}\), i.e., all 7-tuples of natural numbers.
- Compute \(\sum_{i=0}^6 a_i\) for each function.
- Sum over all functions the value \(\frac{\sum a_i}{3^{\sum a_i}}\).
- Output all possible unique sums of \(\sum a_i\) and the corresponding summed value for verification.

To keep it manageable, limit \(\sum a_i\) up to a certain small threshold (say 15), because larger sums heavily diminish the term due to exponential denominator.

The program will:
- Generate all 7-tuples of natural numbers with sum up to 15.
- For each tuple, compute the sum.
- Sum \(\frac{\text{sum of a}}{3^{\text{sum of a}}}\) over all tuples with the same sum.
- Output each total sum and the total accumulated value immediately.

```python
import itertools
from collections import defaultdict

# Set maximum sum threshold for enumeration
MAX_SUM = 15
DIMENSION = 7

# Dictionary to store total sum of values for each total sum
results = defaultdict(float)

# Generate all 7-tuples of natural numbers with sum up to MAX_SUM
for s in range(MAX_SUM + 1):
    # Generate all combinations of 7 non-negative integers summing to s
    for combo in itertools.combinations_with_replacement(range(s + 1), DIMENSION):
        # Filter combos that sum exactly to s
        if sum(combo) == s:
            # For each such combination, generate all permutations (all functions)
            # Since count of functions with given sum is large, optimize:
            # Use compositions instead of permutations to generate all tuples summing to s
            def compositions(total, parts, prefix=[]):
                if parts == 1:
                    yield prefix + [total]
                else:
                    for i in range(total + 1):
                        yield from compositions(total - i, parts - 1, prefix + [i])
            for a in compositions(s, DIMENSION):
                total_sum_a = sum(a)
                # For each function, compute the contribution
                # Total contributions for all functions with sum s:
                results[s] += total_sum_a / (3 ** total_sum_a)

# Output all results for each sum
for s in sorted(results):
    print(f"Sum of a: {s}, Total sum of functions: {results[s]}")
```
