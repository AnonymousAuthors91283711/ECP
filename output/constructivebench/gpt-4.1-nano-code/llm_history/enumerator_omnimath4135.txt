The problem appears to involve exploring the relationship between the number of digit '1's and '7's in a number, along with the primality of that number, for varying values of n. Our goal is to find all n for which, whenever a number k has exactly (n-1) ones and exactly one 7 in its decimal digits, then k must be prime.

To assist in conjecture, I will:
- Enumerate small positive n.
- For each n, generate numbers with (n-1) ones and exactly one 7 in their digits.
- Check the primality of each such number.
- Record n if it satisfies the property that all such numbers are prime.

Here's the Python code implementing this:

```python
import itertools

def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5)+1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# We test small n values, say from 2 up to 10
omnimath4135_answer = set()

for n in range(2, 11):
    all_primes = True
    # Generate all digit strings with (n-1) '1's and exactly one '7'
    # Positions for '7'
    for pos in range(n):
        digits = ['1'] * n
        digits[pos] = '7'
        num_str = ''.join(digits)
        k = int(num_str)
        prime_check = is_prime(k)
        if not prime_check:
            all_primes = False
            break
    if all_primes:
        print(f"n = {n} satisfies the property.")
        omnimath4135_answer.add(n)

print("Answer set:", omnimath4135_answer)
```
