Ground Truth Answer: 9 / 100
Proposed Answer: (1/4) * (sqrt (1 - 0.4^2) * sqrt (1 - 0.5^2) - 0.4 * 0.5)
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer.

The problem involves evaluating the product of two sine terms involving arcsines. The ground truth answer is 9/100 (0.09).

The proposed answer uses trigonometric identities:
1. For sin(A+B)sin(A-B), we can use the identity sin(A+B)sin(A-B) = sin²A - sin²B
2. Alternatively, we can expand using angle addition formulas

The proposed answer appears to be using a different approach, perhaps expanding the product directly. However, let's evaluate it numerically:

Ground truth: 9/100 = 0.09

Proposed answer calculation:
sqrt(1-0.4²) = sqrt(0.84) ≈ 0.9165
sqrt(1-0.5²) = sqrt(0.75) ≈ 0.8660
(0.9165 * 0.8660 - 0.4*0.5) = (0.7937 - 0.2) = 0.5937
Then 1/4 * 0.5937 ≈ 0.1484

This doesn't match 0.09, so the proposed answer is incorrect.
