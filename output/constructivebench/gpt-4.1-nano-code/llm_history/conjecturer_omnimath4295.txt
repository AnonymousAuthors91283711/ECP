The current proposal `{λ c : ℝ, ∀ x : ℝ, f x = c} ∣ c = 1}` is invalid because in Lean, a set of functions is typically expressed as a set comprehension, e.g., `{f | ... }`, but here the syntax is mixed with an attempt to form a set of constant functions directly which is not correct. Moreover, the main goal appears to be to characterize the solution set of functions `f` satisfying the functional equation.

From the hints and the enumerated answers, the solutions include constant functions `f(x) = 1`, and possibly other solutions like linear functions. Given the structure, the constant solution `f(x) = 1` is clearly part of the solution set.

Since the set of solutions matching the pattern `{ f | ... }` can be expressed as the union of the set of constant functions and the set of more general solutions (like linear functions), an appropriate answer involves explicitly constructing these solutions.

In Lean, to represent the set of solutions consisting of:
- Constant functions with value 1, i.e., `λ x, 1`
- Possibly other solutions like linear functions, e.g., functions of the form `f(x) = x + c`. 

The core issue is correct syntax for defining a set of functions.

**Fix:**

- Use set notation `Set (ℝ → ℝ)` with comprehension `| ...` for defining the set.
- The set of constant functions with value 1 can be written as `{f | ∀ x, f x = 1}`.
- Similarly, the set of solutions can be unified as the union of the constant function with value 1 and the set of linear functions with a certain form.

An improved answer in Lean would be:

```lean
{f | ∀ x, f x = 1} ∪ {f | ∃ c : ℝ, ∀ x, f x = x + c}
```

This captures both the constant solution `f(x) = 1` and the linear solutions of the form `f(x) = x + c`.

**Final Answer:**

<<<{f | (∀ x, f x = 1)} ∪ {f | ∃ c : ℝ, ∀ x, f x = x + c}>>>
