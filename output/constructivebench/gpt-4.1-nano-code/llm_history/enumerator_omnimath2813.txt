This problem involves counting integers \(x\) satisfying the strict inequalities:

\[
\frac{5}{7} < x < \frac{28}{3}
\]

converted into integer form, this becomes:

\[
x \in \mathbb{Z} \text{ such that } \frac{5}{7} < x < \frac{28}{3}
\]

Since \( \frac{5}{7} \approx 0.714\) and \( \frac{28}{3} \approx 9.\overline{3} \), we're counting all integers \(x\) in the interval \((0.714, 9.333)\), i.e., integers \(x = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\).

The total count is the number of integers with \(x \ge 1\) and \(x \le 9\).

```python
# Enumerate all integers x such that 5/7 < x < 28/3
# We convert the bounds to float for comparison but ultimately count integers fitting the inequalities.
lower_bound = 5 / 7
upper_bound = 28 / 3

answers = []
# Since inequality is strict, start from the smallest integer greater than lower_bound
start = int(lower_bound) + 1 if lower_bound != int(lower_bound) else int(lower_bound) + 1
# For upper_bound, include integers less than upper_bound
for x in range(1, int(upper_bound) + 1):
    if lower_bound < x < upper_bound:
        answers.append(x)
        print(x)
# Count of such integers:
print(f"Total count: {len(answers)}")
```
