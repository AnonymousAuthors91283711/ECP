This problem appears to involve solving a simple exponential equation: \(3 \cdot 8^x + 5 \cdot 8^x = 2^{61}\). Combining like terms gives \((3 + 5) \cdot 8^x = 2^{61}\), or \(8^x = \frac{2^{61}}{8}\). Since \(8 = 2^3\), then \(8^x = 2^{3x}\). Substituting, we get \(2^{3x} = 2^{61} / 2^3 = 2^{58}\). Therefore, \(3x = 58\) and \(x = \frac{58}{3}\).

We'll write a Python program to verify this solution and any nearby candidates, especially exploring fractional and integer exponents for completeness. Since the fractional exponent is the true solution, we'll output it explicitly and also verify that no integer \(x\) satisfies the equation.

```python
# Python script to confirm the solution and explore nearby values for x
import math

def evaluate_expression(x):
    return 3 * (8 ** x) + 5 * (8 ** x)

target = 2 ** 61

# Exact solution based on algebra:
exact_solution = 58 / 3  # Derived analytically

# Check if the exact solution satisfies the equation
value_at_exact = evaluate_expression(exact_solution)
print(f"x = {exact_solution} \t=> evaluate_expression(x) = {value_at_exact}")

# Check nearby integers around the exact solution
for candidate in range(int(math.floor(exact_solution)) - 2, int(math.ceil(exact_solution)) + 3):
    val = evaluate_expression(candidate)
    print(f"x = {candidate} \t=> evaluate_expression(x) = {val}")

# Determine if any integer solution matches the target (unlikely)
for candidate in range(0, 100):  # limit range for efficiency
    val = evaluate_expression(candidate)
    if abs(val - target) < 1e-6:
        print(f"Found integer solution: x = {candidate}")
```
