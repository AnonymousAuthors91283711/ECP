Given the problem statement and the enumerated answer indicating maximum N = 0, along with the natural interpretation of the set involving pairs of indices with a condition on the determinant— which corresponds to coprime pairs with a positive determinant (i.e., the absolute value of the determinant equals 1)— the set essentially forms the set of invertible 2x2 matrices over ℤ with entries chosen from pairs indexed by finite sets. 

Since the maximum N such that this set is nonempty is 0 (i.e., no such pairs exist for larger N), the problem's maximum N is 0. The discrepancy in the code arises from the attempt to assign a string literal using triple chevrons, which is invalid in Lean. Instead, we should directly assign the number 0.

Thus, the correct answer is simply 0, and the corrected code is:

<<<0>>>

This agrees with the enumerated answer, and it terminates the proof with a concrete value.
