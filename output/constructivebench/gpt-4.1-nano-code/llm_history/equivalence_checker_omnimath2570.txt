theorem omnimath2570 : 
  (∑ k in Finset.range 50, (2 * k + 1)^2) % 1000 = omnimath2570_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 650
Proposed Answer: 950
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the sum of squares of the first 50 odd numbers (from 1 to 99) modulo 1000.

2. The sum of squares of first n odd numbers is given by the formula: n(2n+1)(2n-1)/3

3. For n=50:
   Sum = 50 * 101 * 99 / 3 = 50 * 101 * 33 = 166650

4. 166650 mod 1000 = 650 (ground truth answer)

5. The proposed answer is 950, which is incorrect.

The correct answer should be 650, not 950. The proposed answer is wrong.
