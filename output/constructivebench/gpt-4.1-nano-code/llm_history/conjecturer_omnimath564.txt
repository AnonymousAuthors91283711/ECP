. Enumerated answers: n = 5, with divisor k = 4, m = 7, expression = 49
n = 37, with divisor k = 36, m = 7, expression = 49. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The pattern suggests solutions occur at n = k + 1, where n - 1 divides the quadratic expression evenly, and yields a perfect square m^2. For the solutions: n = 5 and n = 37. Both fit the pattern n = k + 1 with k dividing the numerator (k*(k+2)+136). Generalizing, the pattern points to n = 36 + 1 = 37, or n = 4 + 1 = 5. Thus, the set of solutions is {5, 37}.
