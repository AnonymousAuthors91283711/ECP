The problem defines a set `s` of real numbers such that for each `x` in `s`, the relation `⌊x/2⌋ - ⌊x/3⌋ = x/7` holds, and for those not in `s`, this relation does not hold. We want to find the sum of all such `x`, i.e., the answer to the problem.

This relation involves floor functions, rational expressions, and set constraints. To explore solutions computationally, we can focus on a small interval, analyze the behavior over integer ranges, and identify candidate solutions that satisfy the equation tightly (since the relation involves floors, the solutions are likely to be rational or rational approximations).

Here's a small discrete search over some sample intervals for `x` (say between 0 and 100), checking if the condition holds approximately for rational points, and summing those satisfying the equality exactly or closely.

```python
import math

# Function to check if ⌊x/2⌋ - ⌊x/3⌋ == x/7
def condition(x):
    lhs = math.floor(x / 2) - math.floor(x / 3)
    rhs = x / 7
    return math.isclose(lhs, rhs, rel_tol=1e-9, abs_tol=1e-9)

# Collect solutions in a small interval (e.g., 0 to 100) for x with granularity 0.01
sums = 0
for i in range(0, 10000):  # 0 to 9999
    x = i * 0.01
    if condition(x):
        print(f"Solution x = {x:.5f}")
        sums += x

print(f"Sum of solutions in interval: {sums:.5f}")
```

This approach enumerates possible solutions with reasonable granularity, filtering those satisfying the relation. You can extend or refine the search interval or precision as needed.
