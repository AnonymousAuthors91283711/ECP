The problem asks to find the least natural number `n` such that `1/2 < n/9`. To do this systematically, we'll enumerate candidate values of `n` starting from the smallest, check the inequality, and stop when the condition is first satisfied. Since \( 1/2 < n/9 \) is equivalent to \( n > 9/2 = 4.5 \), the minimal integer satisfying this is `n = 5`, but we'll verify our enumeration programmatically for clarity.

Here's a Python script to systematically find the least such `n`:

```python
# Enumerate natural numbers starting from 1
n = 1
while True:
    # Check the inequality 1/2 < n/9
    if 0.5 < n / 9:
        print(n)
        break
    n += 1
```

Running this code will immediately output `5`, confirming the minimal natural number satisfying the inequality.
