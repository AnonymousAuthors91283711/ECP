abbrev P2001AIMEI_2_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2001AIMEI_2 (S : Finset ℝ) (hS : S.Nonempty) :
    (let n := card S; 
     (∑ x in insert 1 S, x) / (n + 1) = (∑ x in S, x) / n - 13) ∧ 
    (let n := card S;
     (∑ x in insert 2001 S, x) / (n + 1) = (∑ x in S, x) / n + 27) → 
    (∑ x in S, x) / card S = P2001AIMEI_2_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: No solutions found within the search bounds.. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the failure to find solutions, the sum averages are inconsistent with real values, suggesting no such set exists.  
Hence, the answer is zero or an empty set.  
Final answer: <<<0.0>>>
