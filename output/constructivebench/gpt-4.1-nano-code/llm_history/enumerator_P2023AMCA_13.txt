This problem involves algebraic relationships and finding the minimal natural number \( n \), where \( n = L + R \), subject to the constraints involving total games and wins. The setup resembles a scenario where two teams with scores \( wins_L \) and \( wins_R \) participate in total \( total_games = n(n-1)/2 \), with a specific ratio \( 5*wins_L = 7*wins_R \).

To solve, we will:
1. Express \( wins_L \) and \( wins_R \) in terms of a parameter.
2. Use the ratio \( 5*wins_L = 7*wins_R \) to find their relationship.
3. Search for integer solutions where all variables are natural numbers.
4. Minimize \( n \) by testing small values systematically.

Here's the code that enumerates minimal \( n \) satisfying the conditions:

```python
# Enumeration code for minimal n based on given constraints
def find_min_n(limit=100):
    min_n = None
    result = None
    for n in range(1, limit + 1):
        total_games = n * (n - 1) // 2
        # Iterate over possible wins_L
        for wins_L in range(total_games + 1):
            # From 5*wins_L = 7*wins_R, wins_R = (5/7)*wins_L
            if wins_L * 7 % 5 != 0:
                continue  # wins_R not integer
            wins_R = (wins_L * 7) // 5
            # Check if wins sum matches total games
            if wins_L + wins_R == total_games:
                # Both wins count are integers, check n
                # Since n = L + R, and L,R are not specifically given, but n indirectly related
                # Conclude this n is found
                if min_n is None or n < min_n:
                    min_n = n
                    result = (n, wins_L, wins_R)
                print(f"n={n}, wins_L={wins_L}, wins_R={wins_R}")
    if min_n:
        print(f"Minimal n={min_n} with wins: {result[1]} and {result[2]}")
    else:
        print("No solution found within limit.")

# Run enumeration
find_min_n()
```
