abbrev omnimath2876_answer : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath2876 (a n : ℕ) (ha : a = 15) (hn : n = 51) :
    omnimath2876_answer a n = 218 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun a n => 
    match n with
    | 0 => a
    | n + 1 => 
      if Odd (omnimath2876_answer a n) then 
        (omnimath2876_answer a n) + 3 
      else 
        (omnimath2876_answer a n) + 5
Proposed Answer: fun a n => if a = 15 then n else a
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for a function `omnimath2876_answer` that takes two natural numbers `a` and `n` and returns a natural number. The theorem shows a specific case where `a=15` and `n=51` should return 218.

2. The ground truth answer provides a recursive definition:
   - Base case: when n=0, return a
   - Recursive case: if previous result is odd, add 3; else add 5

3. The proposed answer is a simple conditional that returns `n` when `a=15`, otherwise returns `a`.

Comparison:
- The ground truth answer defines a recursive sequence where each step depends on the parity of the previous term.
- The proposed answer doesn't match this behavior at all - it's just a simple conditional with no recursion or parity checks.
- For the specific case in the theorem (a=15, n=51), the ground truth would produce 218 through its recursive process, while the proposed answer would simply return 51 (n's value).
