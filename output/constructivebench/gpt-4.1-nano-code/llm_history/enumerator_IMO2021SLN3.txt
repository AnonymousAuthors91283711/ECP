This problem appears to be related to an Olympiad-level question involving divisors, permutations, and sums being perfect squares. The goal is to find all positive integers n such that there exists a permutation of the divisors of n with the property that for every prefix length, the sum of the elements is a perfect square.

Given the complexity, a practical approach is to:
- For small n (like n up to 50), generate its divisors.
- For each permutation of divisors, check prefix sums for perfect squares.
- Collect all n for which such a permutation exists.
- You can set an upper limit for n (say, 50) for enumeration to keep runtime manageable.

This code will implement this logic efficiently, stream the candidates immediately, and avoid unnecessary calculations beyond the threshold. It avoids hardcoding the answer and is adaptable for testing small n values.

```python
import math
from itertools import permutations
import math

def is_square(n):
    return int(math.isqrt(n)) ** 2 == n

# Find divisors of n
def divisors(n):
    divs = set()
    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divs.add(i)
            divs.add(n // i)
    return sorted(divs)

# Check if there's a permutation with all prefix sums perfect squares
def has_special_permutation(n):
    divs = divisors(n)
    for perm in permutations(divs):
        prefix_sum = 0
        if all(is_square(prefix_sum := prefix_sum + x) for x in perm):
            return True
    return False

# Enumerate n up to 50
result_set = set()
print("n, divisors")
for n in range(1, 51):
    if has_special_permutation(n):
        print(n)
        result_set.add(n)

# Output possible n values
print("Candidate n with the property:", sorted(result_set))
```
