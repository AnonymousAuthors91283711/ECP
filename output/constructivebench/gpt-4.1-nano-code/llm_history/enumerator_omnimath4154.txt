Given the problem, the goal is to find all triplets \((p, x, y)\) of natural numbers where:
- \(p\) is a prime,
- \(x > 0\),
- \(y > 0\),
- there exist \(a, b \in \mathbb{N}\) such that:
  \[
  x^{p-1} + y = p^a
  \]
  \[
  x + y^{p-1} = p^b
  \]

We'll set a small sample limit for \(p, x, y\) (say, up to 20), and enumerate possible combinations, checking the conditions. This approach aids in conjecturing actual solutions.

The code will:
- print each valid triplet immediately when found,
- only check prime \(p\) up to 20 for efficiency,
- verify the equations for all combinations within the bounds.

```python
import math

# Generate small primes up to 20
def is_prime(n):
    return n > 1 and all(n % d != 0 for d in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1))

primes = [p for p in range(2, 21) if is_prime(p)]

# Set bounds for search
max_val = 20

for p in primes:
    for x in range(1, max_val + 1):
        for y in range(1, max_val + 1):
            # Compute potential a, b from the first equation
            denom1 = p**0  # placeholder, no division, just check equations directly
            # check if x^(p-1) + y is a power of p
            val1 = x**(p-1) + y
            val2 = x + y**(p-1)
            # check if val1 and val2 are powers of p
            def is_power_of(n, base):
                if n < base:
                    return False
                # logarithmic check
                exp = math.log(n, base)
                return abs(round(exp) - exp) < 1e-9
            if is_power_of(val1, p) and is_power_of(val2, p):
                a = int(round(math.log(val1, p)))
                b = int(round(math.log(val2, p)))
                # confirm the equations hold
                if p**a == val1 and p**b == val2:
                    print((p, x, y))
```
