Ground Truth Answer: {(1, 2, 5), (1, 3, 5), (2, 2, 4), (2, 6, 4)}
Proposed Answer: {
  (x, y, z) | (x = 1 ∧ y = 2 ∧ z = 5) ∨ (x = 1 ∧ y = 3 ∧ z = 5) ∨ (x = 2 ∧ y = 2 ∧ z = 4) ∨ (x = 2 ∧ y = 6 ∧ z = 4)
}
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is exactly equivalent to the ground truth answer. Both present the same set of tuples (x, y, z) that satisfy the given conditions, just expressed in different formats (set enumeration vs. set builder notation). The four solutions are identical in both answers.
