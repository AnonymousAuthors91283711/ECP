The polynomial is quartic with dominant term \(x^4\) and large constants, likely having roots close to large values. Approximate roots: around \(\pm 10^{10}\), with small adjustments. The pattern suggests roots near \(\pm 10^{10}\) and \(\pm 1\), with asymptotic behavior. The solution set includes these roots, so the set comprises four real roots near these approximate values: \(\pm 10^{10}\) and \(\pm 1\). Thus, the answer is the set of these four roots.
