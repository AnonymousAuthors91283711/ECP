  omnimath1495_answer a b = 128 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun a b => a ^ (logb 2 a) * 2 ^ (b ^ 2)
Proposed Answer: fun a b : ℝ => 2 * b * 2^b
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us two equations:
   - a * 2^b = 8
   - a^b = 2
   And asks us to find an expression that equals 128 under these constraints.

2. Ground Truth Answer: a^(log₂ a) * 2^(b²)
   - This is a complex expression that uses logarithmic relationships
   - When evaluated with the constraints, it does equal 128

3. Proposed Answer: 2 * b * 2^b
   - This is a much simpler expression
   - It doesn't incorporate the logarithmic relationship from the ground truth
   - There's no clear reason why this would equal 128 under the given constraints

The two answers are completely different in form and approach. The proposed answer doesn't seem to satisfy the problem's requirements or use the given constraints properly.
