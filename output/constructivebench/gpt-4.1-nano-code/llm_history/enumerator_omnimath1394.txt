The problem involves finding the greatest prime divisor of a specific number \( n = 7999999999 \), with the additional detail that \( n \) has at most two prime divisors. Our goal is to identify all prime factors of \( n \), then determine the greatest one.

Since the number is large but manageable with trial division up to reasonable bounds, we will:

- Enumerate prime candidates up to \( \sqrt{n} \).
- Test divisibility.
- Collect prime divisors.
- Track the greatest prime factor found.

Because only up to 2 prime factors are involved, once we find at most two, we can output the maximum. We will print each discovered prime factor immediately, and then output the greatest after enumeration.

```python
import math

n = 7999999999
prime_factors = []

# Function for trial division to find prime divisors
for p in range(2, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1):
    if n % p == 0:
        # Check if p is prime (candidate from range, typically prime, but verify if needed)
        # Since p divides n, p is prime factor
        if all(p % d != 0 for d in range(2, int(math.sqrt(p)) + 1)):
            prime_factors.append(p)
            print("Prime factor found:", p)
            # Divide out all instances of p to find remaining factors
            while n % p == 0:
                n //= p
            if len(prime_factors) >= 2:
                break

# After division, if remaining n > 1, it's prime
if n > 1:
    prime_factors.append(n)
    print("Prime factor found:", n)

# Print the greatest prime factor
if prime_factors:
    max_factor = max(prime_factors)
    print("Greatest prime factor:", max_factor)
```

This code:
- Performs trial division efficiently.
- Prints each prime divisor immediately.
- Handles the case where the remaining \( n \) after division is prime.
- Finds the maximum prime factor among the discovered divisors.
- Prioritizes immediate output to assist conjecturing.
