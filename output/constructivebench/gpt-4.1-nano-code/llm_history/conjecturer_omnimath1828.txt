abbrev omnimath1828_answer : ℂ → ℂ := sorry
theorem omnimath1828 (x : ℂ) (hx : x ≠ 0) :
    (∃ (r : ℂ), r = x + x⁻¹ ∧ eval r (X^3 + X^2 - 2*X - 1) = 0) ↔ 
    x^7 + x⁻^7 = omnimath1828_answer x := by sorry. Enumerated answers: r = -1.800, x^7 + x^-7 ≈ 2.000, polynomial value = 0.008
r = -0.500, x^7 + x^-7 ≈ 1.961, polynomial value = 0.125
r = -0.400, x^7 + x^-7 ≈ 1.974, polynomial value = -0.104. Expected Answer Type: ℂ → ℂ
The pattern suggests that \( x + x^{-1} \) is related to specific real values generating certain sums \( x^7 + x^{-7} \). Given the approximate numeric values and their behavior, the simplest closed-form for the expression \( x^7 + x^{-7} \) based on these specific roots is \( 2 \), corresponding to the case when \( r = -1.8 \). Therefore, I conjecture that the answer function maps \( x \) to 2 for all valid \( x \).
