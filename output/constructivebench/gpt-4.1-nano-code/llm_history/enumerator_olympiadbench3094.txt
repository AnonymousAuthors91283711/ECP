[write_program]
To assist in conjecturing and verifying the sum of the series, I'll implement a Python script that:
- Calculates the parameters T and K based on the provided formulas.
- Implements the sequence definition: for each n, if n divisible by 3, output -term; else output term, where term depends on n.
- Summates the sequence over n from 0 up to floor(K) inclusive.
- Prints each partial sum immediately upon calculation.
- Checks for any identifiable pattern or exact sum.

I will use small sample sizes and avoid unnecessary computations, prioritizing approximate calculations to match the problemâ€™s boundaries and goals.

```python
import math

# Parameters from the problem
T = 72 * math.sqrt(2)
K = (T / 12) ** 2

# Sequence function: returns value based on n
def seq(n):
    term = 0.5 + 0.5 * (n - 1)
    if n % 3 == 0:
        return -term
    else:
        return term

# Sum from n=0 up to floor(K)
limit = int(math.floor(K))
total_sum = 0.0

for n in range(limit + 1):
    val = seq(n)
    total_sum += val
    print(f"n={n}, seq={val:.4f}, partial sum={total_sum:.4f}")
```
