[write_program]
This problem involves probability calculations with combinatorics, specifically binomial coefficients, and summing over certain ranges. Since the problem simplifies to a sum involving binomial terms, it resembles the expectation calculation for a binomial distribution multiplied by a linear factor.

To aid in conjecturing and potentially proving the answer, I'll write a Python program that:
- Enumerates all possible `k` values in `0..coins`.
- Calculates the summand exactly for each `k`.
- Prints each partial result as it's computed.
- Uses small sample values (coins=3, p=1/2).
- Outputs the total sum at the end, so we can verify or conjecture its closed form.

This approach should give insight into what the sum evaluates to.

```python
# This script computes the sum for coins=3, p=1/2 as in the problem
# It enumerates each term, prints partial results, and sums them up

from math import comb

coins = 3
p = 0.5
total = 0.0

print("Enumerating terms for coins=3, p=1/2:")
for k in range(coins + 1):
    # Calculate each binomial coefficient and the related probabilities
    binom_coins_k = comb(coins, k)
    prob_k = binom_coins_k * (p ** k) * ((1 - p) ** (coins - k))
    # Compute (coins - k) choose 1, which is just (coins - k)
    binom_remainder = (coins - k)
    term = prob_k * binom_remainder
    print(f"k={k}: C({coins},{k})={binom_coins_k}, P(X={k})={prob_k:.4f}, (coins - k)={binom_remainder}, term={term:.4f}")
    total += term

print(f"Sum of all terms: {total:.4f}")
```
