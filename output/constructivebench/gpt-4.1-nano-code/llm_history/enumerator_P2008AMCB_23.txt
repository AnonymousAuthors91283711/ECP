The problem involves finding all natural numbers n such that for every divisor d of 10^n, the base-10 logarithm of d equals 792. Since log_b(d) is monotonically related to d, and the divisors of 10^n are the powers of 2 and 5, the key is recognizing the divisors of 10^n are all of the form 2^a * 5^b where 0 ≤ a,b ≤ n. 

To satisfy log10(d) = 792 for all divisors d, it must be the case that each divisor d = 2^a * 5^b has log10(d) = a + b = 792. The set of divisors corresponds to all pairs (a,b) with a,b in [0, n], but not necessarily all pairs satisfy a + b = 792 unless n is at least 792. 

The only way for *all* divisors to satisfy log10(d) = 792 is if the *only* divisors are those with a + b = 792, meaning n must be at least 792, and every pair (a,b) with 0 ≤ a,b ≤ n must satisfy a + b = 792. Thus, the divisors are precisely the pairs where a + b = 792, i.e., the divisors are all those of the form 2^a * 5^b with a + b = 792.

The divisors of 10^n are all pairs with a, b ≤ n; for all these divisors to satisfy a + b = 792, it must be that n ≥ 792. Additionally, since we want all divisors with a,b ≤ n and a + b = 792, for this to include all the pairs, we need n ≥ 792. 

Thus the only valid n is exactly 792 because for n > 792, some divisors have exponents greater than n, which do not satisfy the property that log10(d) = 792. For n < 792, the divisor with a=0,b=n or a=n,b=0 could have a + b ≠ 792, so the property wouldn't hold for all divisors.

The answer is n=792.

Below is the code to verify and generate possible n's.

```python
# Enumerate n values to identify when all divisors d = 2^a * 5^b with 0 ≤ a, b ≤ n satisfy log10(d) = 792
# key insight: all pairs (a, b) with a + b = 792 must be within the bounds [0, n], so n ≥ 792
# For n > 792, there exist divisors with a + b ≠ 792, so the condition fails
# For n < 792, not all divisors satisfy log10(d)=792
# So the only n satisfying the property is n=792

n_candidate = 0
for n in range(788, 796):  # small range around 792 to verify
    valid = True
    for a in range(0, n+1):
        b = 792 - a
        if b < 0 or b > n:
            # divisor with a + b ≠ 792 is outside the divisor set
            continue
        if a + b != 792:
            valid = False
            break
    if valid:
        print(n)  # output qualifying n immediately
```
