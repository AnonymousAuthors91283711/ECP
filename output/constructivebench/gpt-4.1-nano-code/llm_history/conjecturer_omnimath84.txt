The pattern suggests the critical value is related to the maximum number of summations or steps. The strategy involves summing over indices with a cutoff at 10, accumulating a total that grows with the range of the strategy, bounded by 80 and 10. Since the recursive sum bases 20 such steps (80 divided by 4 or similar), the answer should reflect the total maximum accumulation. 

Given the enumerated answers and the pattern, the final closed form is:

<<<80 * 10>>>

This corresponds to the cumulative sum over all steps when summing up to the maximum index, scaled by the maximum value per step.
