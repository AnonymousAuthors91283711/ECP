The relation \quad 3 \left(\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} a i\right)^2 = \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} (a i)^3 \quad suggests \(a_i\) are all equal, since constant sequences satisfy this. For \(m= n=2017\), the sum becomes proportional to \(a_0\). The formula simplifies to find constant value \(a_i\). Equating sums, the constant \(a_i\) is 1. The derived explicit value for \(a_{1337}\) is 1.
