Minimal sum: 305
Answer: (4, 36, 256, 9, 305). Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The key issue in your proposed answer is the misuse of an `if ... then ...` structure within an `abbrev`, which is invalid syntax in Lean. Instead, the answer should be a pure `ℕ` value representing the minimal sum, derived from the provided example that `(a, b, c, d) = (256, 9, 4, 36)` yields the sum `305`. Since the minimal sum identified in the enumeration is indeed 305, the answer should be the constant `305`.

Here's my reasoning: Given the data, the minimal sum with the specified constraints appears to be 305, for the tuple `(a, b, c, d) = (256, 9, 4, 36)`. Our goal is to define a closed-form answer in Lean, which is just that number. The example with `a=4, c=256, b=36, d=9` is just one example leading to the sum 305, but the minimal sum value itself is 305 and independent of particular selections.

Thus, the corrected answer is simply `305`.
