Ground Truth Answer: {f | (∀ n, f n = n + 1) ∨ 
       (∃ a ≥ 1, ∀ n, (n > -a → f n = n + 1) ∧ (n ≤ -a → f n = -n + 1)) ∨
       (∀ n, (n > 0 → f n = n + 1) ∧ (n = 0 → f n = 0) ∧ (n < 0 → f n = -n + 1))}
Proposed Answer: { g | ∀ n : ℤ, g n = n + 1 }
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

The ground truth answer describes three possible cases for function f:
1. f(n) = n + 1 for all n
2. f(n) = n + 1 for n > -a and f(n) = -n + 1 for n ≤ -a (with a ≥ 1)
3. A piecewise function with different behaviors for n > 0, n = 0, and n < 0

The proposed answer only includes the first case (f(n) = n + 1 for all n), completely missing the other two cases that are valid solutions according to the ground truth.

Therefore, the proposed answer is incomplete and not equivalent to the ground truth answer.
