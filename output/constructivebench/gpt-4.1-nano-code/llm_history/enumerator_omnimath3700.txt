This problem appears to involve a functional equation with constraints over real and integer values, and it seems inspired by high-school or early undergraduate math reasoning (though it was presented in a formal style). Since the goal is to "enumerate possible answers" (i.e., functions \( f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{Z} \)) satisfying a given equation, a practical approach is to look for constant solutions or simple piecewise solutions over small integer values. 

Given the complexity of arbitrary functions over reals, a reasonable approach is:
- Consider constant functions \( f(x) = c \) for some integer \( c \).
- Check if the constant solution satisfies the functional equation for all \( x, y \).
- Enumerate small integer values \( c \) (e.g., from -10 to 10) and test the equation.
- If constant solutions donâ€™t satisfy the condition for all \( x, y \), consider simple affine functions or small lookup tables, but due to complexity, focusing on constant solutions suffices for demonstration.

This approach is simplified, as the problem is quite complex; the code will try various constant functions and verify if they satisfy the functional equation universally. It outputs those solutions immediately when found.

```python
# Enumerate constant functions f(x)=c for c in a small range, checking the functional equation.
# Since the functional equation holds for all x, y, test a few sample pairs to verify.
# For simplicity, verify for a small set of sample pairs to tentatively classify solutions.

def check_constant_solution(c):
    # Test the functional equation for a small set of sample pairs (x,y)
    sample_points = [0, 1, -1, 0.5, -0.5]
    for x in sample_points:
        for y in sample_points:
            f_x = c
            f_y = c
            f_f_y_minus_x = c  # since f(y)=c, f(f(y)-x)=f(c - x)=c (constant)
            lhs = (f_f_y_minus_x)**2 + f_x**2 + f_y**2
            rhs = f_y * (1 + 2 * f_f_y_minus_x)
            if lhs != rhs:
                return False
    return True

# Enumerate c from -10 to 10
for c in range(-10, 11):
    if check_constant_solution(c):
        print(f'f(x) = {c}')
```
