This appears to be a mathematical problem involving polynomial roots and an unknown parameter `a`. The theorem asks for a unique `a` such that the polynomial `X^2 + C a * X + 1` has 1 as a root. To assist conjecturing and verifying the value of `a`, we can analyze the condition that 1 is a root and then enumerating small integer values of `a`.

Since the polynomial is `X^2 + C a * X + 1`, plugging in `X=1` yields:
`1^2 + C a * 1 + 1 = 0`  
which simplifies to:  
`1 + C a + 1 = 0`  
or  
`C a + 2 = 0`  

If `C` is an unknown constant, and `a` is an integer parameter, then:
`a = -2 / C`

Given the theorems involve integers, to proceed, assume `C` is a small known constant (e.g., `C=1`) for enumerations.

The program will iterate over small integer values for `a`, check the root condition, and print candidates.

```python
# Enumerate small integer values of a to find where X=1 is a root
# For the formula derived: 1 + C*a + 1 = 0 => C*a = -2
# Assuming C=1 for simplicity, then a = -2
# We'll check integers a in a small range around this value to confirm
# and systematically list candidates.

C = 1  # assume C=1 unless specified
candidate_answers = []

# Search over a range of integers
for a in range(-10, 11):
    # Check if 1 is a root for X^2 + C*a*X + 1
    # Polynomial value at X=1:
    poly_at_1 = 1**2 + C * a * 1 + 1  # 1 + C*a + 1
    if poly_at_1 == 0:
        print(f"Candidate a: {a} (since 1 is a root)")
```
