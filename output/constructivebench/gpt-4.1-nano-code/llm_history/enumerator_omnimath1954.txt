This problem appears to be a mathematical conjecture relating to a parameter \( D \in \mathbb{Z} \) with a certain property involving real numbers \( a, b \). Specifically, we seek the cardinality of the set of all \( D \) that satisfy the inequality:

\[
|a^2 - D b^2| < 1
\]

for all \( a, b \in \mathbb{R} \) with \( -\frac{1}{4} < a, b < \frac{1}{4} \).

Key observations:
- \( a, b \) are restricted in a small interval around 0.
- The problem seems to involve quadratic forms and Diophantine approximations.

Since we're asked to enumerate possible answers for the size of this set (cardinality), and the problem involves repeated intervals, a typical approach is:
- To test a small set of integers \( D \) within a range.
- For each \( D \), check whether the inequality holds for all \( a, b \) in the specified interval.
- Because the actual universal quantifier "for all" is over continuous intervals, an approximation is to test the extremal points or a dense grid.

Here, I will:
- Choose small integers \( D \) in a reasonable range.
- For each \( D \), check the maximum of \( |a^2 - D b^2| \) over the interval \( |a|, |b| < 1/4 \).
- If the maximum is less than 1, include that \( D \) in the set.
- Count how many such \( D \) satisfy the condition.

Let me implement this now.

```python
import math

# Define the bounds for a and b
a_min, a_max = -0.25, 0.25
b_min, b_max = -0.25, 0.25

# Range of D to test -- choose small integers for feasibility
D_candidates = range(-10, 11)

# Store valid D's that satisfy the inequality
valid_Ds = []

for D in D_candidates:
    max_value = 0
    # Sampling points within the interval to approximate the supremum
    num_samples = 20
    for a_i in range(num_samples + 1):
        a = a_min + (a_max - a_min) * a_i / num_samples
        for b_j in range(num_samples + 1):
            b = b_min + (b_max - b_min) * b_j / num_samples
            val = abs(a**2 - D * b**2)
            if val > max_value:
                max_value = val
    # Check if the maximum value over the grid is less than 1
    if max_value < 1:
        print(f"Found D = {D} with max |a^2 - D*b^2| over grid = {max_value}")
        valid_Ds.append(D)

# Output the count of such D's as the answer
omnimath1954_answer = len(valid_Ds)
print("Total valid D's:", omnimath1954_answer)
```
