The problem defines a function `repDigit` that creates a number by repeating a digit `d` exactly `n` times, and a theorem involving the square root of the difference of two such repeated-digit numbers. To explore solutions, we want to look for small values of `n` that satisfy the equation `(repDigit x (2n) - repDigit y n).sqrt = repDigit z n`, where `x, y, z` are digits 0-9.

Since the core challenge is to find all `(x, y, z)` satisfying the property, the code will:

- Enumerate small `n` (say up to 20 to keep computations reasonable).
- For each `(x, y, z)` with digits 0-9, check whether the condition holds for any `n`.
- Collect such `(x, y, z)` into a set.

This approach helps in discovering candidate solutions associated with the problem without hardcoded answers. We implement it directly below, printing actual solutions during enumeration, and defining the set of candidates accordingly.

```python
# Enumeration to find all (x,y,z) for which the given condition holds for some small n
# The condition involves checking if the square root of the difference is a repeated-digit number.
# We limit to n up to 20 for efficiency and clarity.

def rep_digit(d, n):
    return int(str(d) * n) if n > 0 else 0

answers = set()

for x in range(10):
    for y in range(10):
        for z in range(10):
            found = False
            for n in range(1, 21):
                n1 = 2 * n
                n2 = n
                num1 = rep_digit(x, n1)
                num2 = rep_digit(y, n2)
                diff = num1 - num2
                if diff < 0:
                    continue
                sqrt_diff = diff ** 0.5
                # Check if sqrt_diff is approximately an integer and matches rep_digit(z, n)
                if abs(sqrt_diff - round(sqrt_diff)) < 1e-9:
                    s = int(round(sqrt_diff))
                    rep_s = rep_digit(z, n)
                    if s == rep_s:
                        print(f"Found: x={x}, y={y}, z={z}, n={n}")
                        answers.add((x, y, z))
                        found = True
            # Optional: break early if found for any n
            # if found:
            #     continue

# Convert answers to a form suitable for your theorem or further analysis.
# For example, answer set could be used as omnimath4305_answer
print("Candidates (x,y,z):", answers)
