Ground Truth Answer: 1344
Proposed Answer: 4038
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n such that there exist divisors a, b, c of n with a < b < c and a + b + c = 2022.

2. Ground truth answer is 1344:
   - Possible divisors: 336, 448, 1238 (336 + 448 + 1238 = 2022)
   - All divide 1344 (1344/336=4, 1344/448=3, 1344/1238≈1.085 - WAIT, 1238 doesn't divide 1344)

Hmm, there seems to be an issue with the ground truth answer itself. The proposed answer 4038:
   - Possible divisors: 6, 673, 1343 (6 + 673 + 1343 = 2022)
   - Check divisibility: 4038/6=673, 4038/673=6, 4038/1343=3.007 - not exact

Neither answer seems correct upon closer examination. The ground truth answer's divisors don't actually work, and neither do the proposed answer's.

<<<False>>>
