The task involves examining the set of triples \((a, b, c)\) of positive integers satisfying specific sum and product-sum relations parameterized by \(k\). To analyze this for small parameters, identify all such triples for small \(k\), and observe when the set becomes non-empty, ultimately aiming to verify the statement that for \(k > 0\), the set matches a particular form.

Here's the reasoning:
- \(a, b, c > 0\)
- \(a + b + c = 3k + 1\)
- \(ab + bc + ca = 3k^2 + 2k\)

We'll examine small values of \(k\) (say, \(k=1,2,3\)) and enumerate all positive triples \((a, b, c)\) within reasonable bounds where these equations might hold. This helps verify the theorem's claim that the set is non-empty iff \(k > 0\).

```python
# Enumerate all positive integer triples (a,b,c) for small k
# and check the given equations
def enumerate_triples(k, max_value=20):
    sum_target = 3 * k + 1
    prod_sum_target = 3 * k**2 + 2 * k
    for a in range(1, max_value + 1):
        for b in range(1, max_value + 1):
            for c in range(1, max_value + 1):
                if a + b + c == sum_target and a*b + b*c + c*a == prod_sum_target:
                    print(f"k={k}, (a,b,c)=({a},{b},{c})")

# Test small k values
for k in range(0, 5):
    enumerate_triples(k)
```
