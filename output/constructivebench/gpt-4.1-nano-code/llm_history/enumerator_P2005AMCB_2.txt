This appears to be a problem involving solving a simple algebraic equation involving real numbers. The goal is to determine the value of \( x \) satisfying \( \frac{x}{100} \times x = 4 \).

The key is to solve the equation:
\[
\frac{x}{100} \times x = 4
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
\frac{x^2}{100} = 4
\]
or
\[
x^2 = 400
\]

Since we're working with real numbers and \( x > 0 \) (from hypothesis `hx : 0 < x`), the positive root applies:
\[
x = \sqrt{400} = 20
\]

The program should verify this and directly output \(20\) as the answer.

```python
# The main goal is to find x > 0 such that (x / 100) * x = 4
# Simplify: x^2 / 100 = 4 => x^2 = 400
# Since x > 0, x = sqrt(400) = 20

print(20)
```
