abbrev omnimath2691_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath2691 : 
  let exe_wye_ratio := 29
  let zed_exe_ratio := 16
  zed_exe_ratio * exe_wye_ratio = omnimath2691_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 464. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Since  zed_exe_ratio * exe_wye_ratio = 16 * 29 = 464, the answer is a constant. 

My conjecture based on the pattern is that the answer is 464. 

<<<464>>>
