theorem mathodyssey72 :
  Fintype.card {f : Fin 10 → Fin 10 | 
    f ∘ f = id ∧ 
    ∀ i : Fin 10, Int.natAbs ((f i).val - i.val : ℤ) = 2} = mathodyssey72_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Total perfect matchings (involutions): 0. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the constraint that for all i, |f(i).val - i.val|=2 and that f∘f=id, the only involutions satisfying the absolute difference of 2 are those swapping pairs at distance 2, such as (i, i+2) or (i, i−2), while fixing points are impossible due to the difference. Considering index boundaries (0..9), valid swaps are { (0,2), (1,3), (2,4), (3,5), (4,6), (5,7), (6,8), (7,9) }. Each can be either fixed or swapped independently, leading to 2^8 options.  
Answer:

<<<2^8>>>
