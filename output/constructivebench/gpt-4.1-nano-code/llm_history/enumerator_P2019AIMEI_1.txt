This problem appears to involve summing the digits of a number \( N \). From the example given, where \( N = 123456789 \), the sum is \( 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45 \). The theorem claims that the answer for any \( N \) is precisely the sum of its digits in base 10.

Given the goal to verify and explore solutions, and to assist with conjecture and proof, I will write a Python script that enumerates all numbers with certain constraints and computes their digit sums efficiently. Since the example suggests handling large \( N \), but for the demonstration, I'll focus on small sample numbers, possibly up to 999,999, to illustrate the pattern.

To maximize utility:
- The script will generate all numbers up to a small limit.
- For each number, it will compute the digit sum.
- It will print the number and its digit sum immediately when computed.
- It will explicitly output minimal and maximal digit sum values in the range to assist in understanding the behavior.

```python
# Enumerate numbers up to a small limit, computing their digit sums to explore possible answers.
max_num = 999999  # small sample to keep the output manageable

# Initialize variables to track min and max digit sums
min_sum = float('inf')
max_sum = float('-inf')

for num in range(1, max_num + 1):
    # Compute the sum of digits
    digit_sum = sum(int(d) for d in str(num))
    print(f"Number: {num}, Digit Sum: {digit_sum}")
    # Track extremal values
    if digit_sum < min_sum:
        min_sum = digit_sum
    if digit_sum > max_sum:
        max_sum = digit_sum

# Output the minimum and maximum digit sums found
print(f"Minimum digit sum in range: {min_sum}")
print(f"Maximum digit sum in range: {max_sum}")
```
