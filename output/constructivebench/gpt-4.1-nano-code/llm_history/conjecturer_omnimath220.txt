The solutions satisfy n^2 + 3^n = m^2, with n ≥ 1. We observe solutions at n=1, n=3, and corresponding m. The pattern suggests n must be odd, with n^2 + 3^n being perfect squares for odd n, specifically n=1,3,..., (2k+1). For these, m^2 = n^2 + 3^n. Since 3^n grows quickly, and m^2 - n^2 = 3^n, the difference factors as (m - n)(m + n) = 3^n, restricting both factors to powers of 3. For the solutions given, m = 2^{(n + 1)/2} * 3^{(n - 1)/2}.

The pattern indicates that the solutions occur when n is odd and positive, with m expressed in terms of powers of 2 and 3. Specifically, for odd n = 2k + 1 ≥ 1, it seems that m = 2^{(n + 1)/2} * 3^{(n - 1)/2}. Indeed, this matches the enumerated solutions: for n=1, m=2, and for n=3, m=6. Because n≥1 and n odd, we can define n as 2k+1 with k≥0, then m in terms of k as 2^{k+1} * 3^{k}.

The proposed answer contains an unbound identifier `m` in the definition of `omnimath220_answer`, leading to the compilation error. The key is to express the set explicitly in terms of `n` only, since the goal is to define a set of natural numbers that satisfy the given relation involving `m`.

From the enumeration, the solutions to \( m^2 = n^2 + 3^n \), for `n ≥ 1`, are \((n,m) = (1, 2)\) with \( m^2=4 \), and \( (3,6) \) with \( m^2=36 \). We also note that for these `n`, the values follow a pattern: \( n=2k+1 \) for \(k = 0,1\), corresponding to odd `n`. For such `n`, the corresponding \( m \) are powers of 2 times powers of 3, specifically \( m=2^{k+1} \times 3^k \).

Hence, the set can be described as the set of odd `n` of the form \( n = 2k + 1 \) with \( k \in \mathbb{N} \), and \( m = 2^{k+1} \times 3^{k} \) satisfying \( n^2 + 3^n = m^2 \). Since `m` is not part of the set definition (the set is over `n`), I will define it in a closed form:

The set of all such `n` is:
\[
 \left\{ n \in \mathbb{N} \mid n \ge 1, \exists k \in \mathbb{N}, n = 2k + 1, \text{and } (n^2 + 3^n) \text{ is a perfect square} \right\}
\]
but to match the enumeration, it's better to specify the exact pattern observed:
\[
 \left\{ 1, 3 \right\}
\]
corresponding to \(k=0,1\), since these are the only solutions in the enumeration.

Therefore, the complete closed form in Lean should describe these solutions explicitly:

<<<{ n : ℕ | n = 1 ∨ n = 3 }>>>

This encapsulates the observed solutions, which matches the enumerated case solutions and ensures a closed form. It avoids the error of using an unbound `m` and aligns with the expected set of solutions.

---

**Note:** You could also write a more general set defining all `n` obtained by \( n=2k+1 \), with \(k \in \mathbb{N}\), checking whether \( n^2 + 3^n \) is a perfect square, but given the enumeration, explicitly listing solutions is the most straightforward and reliable.
