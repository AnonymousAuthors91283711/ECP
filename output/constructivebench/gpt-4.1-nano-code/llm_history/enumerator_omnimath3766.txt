The problem involves solving the equation \(\frac{(p_1 + p_2 - 1)(p_1 + p_2)}{2} - p_1 + 1 = 2015\), with constraints \(p_1, p_2 > 0\). The goal is to enumerate small positive integer solutions that satisfy this, likely to find the unique solution.

To simplify, let \(s = p_1 + p_2\). The equation becomes:

\[
\frac{(s - 1)s}{2} - p_1 + 1 = 2015
\]

Rearranged:

\[
\frac{s(s - 1)}{2} + 1 - p_1 = 2015
\]

\[
p_1 = \frac{s(s - 1)}{2} + 1 - 2015
\]

\[
p_1 = \frac{s(s - 1)}{2} - 2014
\]

Since \(p_2 = s - p_1\), both must be positive:

\[
p_1 > 0 \Rightarrow \frac{s(s - 1)}{2} - 2014 > 0
\]
\[
s(s - 1) > 2 \times 2014 = 4028
\]

We look for integer \(s\) starting from the smallest satisfying this inequality:

\[
s^2 - s > 4028 \Rightarrow s^2 - s - 4028 > 0
\]

Solve for \(s\):

\[
s = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4 \times 4028}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 16112}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{16113}}{2}
\]

Approximate \(\sqrt{16113} \approx 126.97\), so:

\[
s \gtrsim \frac{1 + 126.97}{2} \approx 64
\]

Since \(s\) must be an integer greater than this, start from \(s=65\).

Check \(p_1\), \(p_2\):

```python
# Enumerate candidate s starting from 65 upwards.
# For each, compute p_1 and p_2, check positivity and the original equations.

for s in range(65, 150):  # upper bound to limit search
    p1 = s * (s - 1) // 2 - 2014
    p2 = s - p1
    if p1 > 0 and p2 > 0:
        # Verify original equation
        lhs = ((s - 1) * s) // 2 - p1 + 1
        if lhs == 2015:
            print(f"s={s}, p1={p1}, p2={p2}")
```

This code searches for exactly one potential solution and prints it.

```python
for s in range(65, 150):
    p1 = s * (s - 1) // 2 - 2014
    p2 = s - p1
    if p1 > 0 and p2 > 0:
        print(f"s={s}, p1={p1}, p2={p2}")
```

This approach efficiently enumerates small candidate solutions without excessive computation and streams the answers immediately as they are found.

The problem involves finding a unique pair (p₁, p₂) of positive integers satisfying a specific equation involving their sum (s). The code attempts to do so by iterating over possible s-values, computing p₁ and p₂, and verifying the conditions. 

**Judgement:**
- The code starts from s=65, which might be reasonable, but there's no immediate guarantee that the correct solution is within this range.
- It computes p₁ based on s, then derives p₂, and checks positivity and the main equation.
- It prints only when conditions are satisfied, but as the comment indicates, no output is generated in the provided range, possibly suggesting no candidate is found within 65..150.
- The core problem might be that the initial s range is too narrow or that the formula used for p₁ isn't aligned with the mathematical derivation.

Given the problem's nature (finding a unique positive solution satisfying an equation), and that the code outputs nothing, this suggests either:
- The true solution is outside the specified range, or
- The formula for p₁ is incorrect or misaligned with the problem's logic.

**Acceptance:**
- Since the code produces no output in the tested range, it does not find the unique valid pair, which means it's incomplete or incorrect for the problem.
- The problem asks to identify whether the program works, and the answer is that it does not produce any answers, so the original program should be rejected for failing to find the solution.

**Correction:**
- To fix this, I would try to extend the s-range or formulate p₁ and p₂ based on a direct derivation from the given equation, ensuring that the search covers all plausible s, p₁, p₂.

**Corrected Program:**
```python
# The original problem involves the equation:
# ((p1 + p2 - 1)*(p1 + p2))/2 - p1 + 1 = 2015
# Let s = p1 + p2
# Then the equation becomes:
# ((s - 1)*s)/2 - p1 + 1 = 2015
# Simplify:
# ((s - 1)*s)/2 + 1 = 2015 + p1
# Since p1 > 0 and p2 > 0, p1 < s, p2 < s

# We will iterate over possible s values and

The provided code snippet is essentially an incomplete Lean theorem using annoyed syntax (or similar pseudocode). It contains only a placeholder `sorry` and no executable Python code or enumeration logic. The enumeration results show an error indicating no answers are generated, likely because there is no code at all.

Since the problem asks for an answer enumeration with a Python program and the original is empty, it cannot produce any solutions. Given the original program is empty and does not fulfill the provided requirements, it should be rejected.

**My judgment:**
- The program produces no results.
- It doesn't adhere to the required enumeration structure.
- It does not supply any outputs.
- It violates the implicit requirement to enumerate possible solutions.

**Therefore, the original program is rejected.**

**Corrected Program:**

Let's analyze the problem mathematically first:

Given:

\[
(p_1 + p_2 - 1) \times (p_1 + p_2) / 2 - p_1 + 1 = 2015
\]
with the constraints:
\[
p_1 > 0, \quad p_2 > 0
\]

Let \( S = p_1 + p_2 \), with \( S \ge 2 \).

Rewrite the equation:

\[
\frac{(S-1) \times S}{2} - p_1 + 1 = 2015
\]

\[
\Rightarrow \frac{S(S-1)}{2} - p_1 + 1 = 2015
\]

\[
\Rightarrow \frac{S(S-1)}{2} + 1 - p_1 = 2015
\]

\[
\Rightarrow p_1 = \frac{S(S-1)}{2} + 1 - 2015
\]

\[
\Rightarrow p_1 = \frac{S(S-1)}{2} - 2014
\]

Since \( p_1 > 0 \), we have:

\[
\frac{S(S-1)}{2} - 2014 > 0
\]

\[
\Rightarrow \frac{S(S-1)}{2} > 2014
\]

\[
\Rightarrow S(S-1) > 4028
\]

Now, \( p_2 = S - p_1 \).

Also, \( p
