The problem involves analyzing the sets L2 and L3 constructed from elements of L1, which has 10 elements. Specifically:
- L2 consists of products q * a * b where a, b in L1.
- L3 consists of sums of squares of elements of L1, with 4 elements involved.

The key points:
- L1 has exactly 10 elements.
- L2 involves all products involving q and two elements from L1.
- L3 involves sums of squares of 4 elements from L1.
- The question asks for the set of q where L2 ⊆ L3.

Given that L1's size is small (10), the largest product set involves up to 100 pairs, and L3 involves sums of four squares.

To approximate the boundary for q, I will:
- Generate small sample values for L1 (say, from 1 to 10) for simplicity.
- For each candidate q in a range, check if all products q * a * b (a, b in L1) are within the sum of squares of elements in L1.
- Since the set of sums can be checked explicitly, and the number of pairs is manageable, exhaustive enumeration is feasible.

The minimal value of q for L2 to be within L3's sums would be when the maximum product q * max(a)*max(b) is at most the maximum sum of squares in L3.

Here's the code:

```python
import itertools

# Sample L1 with 10 elements
L1 = list(range(1, 11))
# Precompute all sums of squares of 4 elements in L1
sums_of_squares = set()
for comb in itertools.product(L1, repeat=4):
    sums_of_squares.add(sum(x * x for x in comb))
max_sum = max(sums_of_squares)

# Generate all products q * a * b for a, b in L1
pair_products = []
for a, b in itertools.product(L1, repeat=2):
    pair_products.append(a * b)

# Search for q values such that all pair products <= max sum of 4 squares
# For a sample range, say q in [0.1, 2.0]
answers = set()
for q_int in range(1, 21):
    q = q_int / 10
    if all(q * p <= max_sum for p in pair_products):
        answers.add(q)

# Include 0, if needed (q=0) always satisfies
answers.add(0)

# Print all q satisfying the inclusion
for a in sorted(answers):
    print("Candidate q:", a)
```

This script enumerates candidate q-values where the scaled products are within the sums of four squares from L1, giving insight into the parameter boundary for L2 ⊆ L3.
