This problem involves a complex quantification over strategies and sequences, with a built-in recurrence relation. The goal seems to approximate or find bounds for the value of `omnimath84_answer`, which is defined as an unknown real constant.

Given the complexity, and since the goal is to generate candidate answers for conjecture, a practical approach is:

- Fix small sample values for parameters, such as limits on the number of steps `n`.
- Implement the sequence calculation based on a hypothetical strategy.
- Enumerate all possible small strategies with bounded values.
- Check the maximum (or minimum) `numbers n i` obtained for these strategies to approximate bounds.
- Stream outputs for each candidate, especially those that yield larger values.

This approach helps generate potential answers without excessive computation, fitting within the token constraints.

```python
# Enumerate small strategies and compute sequence values to estimate bounds on the answer.
# We generate strategies as functions mapping (m, i) to small real values (here, integers).
# We limit the steps n and the strategy values to keep computations feasible.

import itertools
import math

# Parameters for enumeration
max_strategy_value = 2    # strategy values are in {0,1,2}
max_n = 10               # maximum number of recursive steps
max_m = 4                # limit m to keep computations small
max_i = 7                # limit i to match Fin 80 (simulate large i with smaller range)

# Generate all possible strategies for (m, i) within bounds
strategy_keys = list(itertools.product(range(max_m), range(max_i)))
strategy_space = list(itertools.product(range(max_strategy_value + 1), repeat=len(strategy_keys)))

# Function to compute the sequence for a given strategy
def compute_numbers(strategy_map, n_steps, max_i):
    # Map (m,i) -> value
    strategy_dict = dict(zip(strategy_keys, strategy_map))
    def strategy(m, i):
        return strategy_dict.get((m, i), 0)
    
    # Initialize
    numbers = {}
    for i in range(max_i + 1):
        numbers[(0, i)] = 0.0
    
    # Compute for n steps
    for step in range(1, n_steps + 1):
        for i in range(max_i + 1):
            prev_value = numbers.get((step - 1, i), 0)
            m_idx = 0  # We consider m=0 for simplicity in this approximation
            # In actual problem, m varies over sequence length; here we keep m=0 for simplicity
            m = 0
            diff = i - m
            if 0 <= diff < 10:
                new_value = prev_value
            else:
                new_value = prev_value + strategy(m, i)
            numbers[(step, i)] = new_value
    return max(numbers.values())

# Enumerate all strategies and compute maximum sequence value
for strategy_idx, strat in enumerate(strategy_space):
    max_value = compute_numbers(strat, max_n, max_i)
    print(f"Strategy {strategy_idx+1}: max value = {max_value}")
