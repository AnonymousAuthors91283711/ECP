This problem appears to involve finding all possible sums of digits of numbers in a certain interval and relating those sums to a set `omnimath3820_answer`. The structure suggests we're looking for all N such that there's a number `k` with all numbers from `k` to `k+999` having digit sums equal to `N`, and N should be in a certain set.

Given the constraints and the theme, the key insight is that for each fixed `k`, the digit sums of the numbers from `k` to `k + 999` might vary, but there's a pattern or bound on the possible sums. A common number theory approach is to analyze the minimal and maximal possible sums within such intervals.

In the absence of explicit ranges, and aiming to produce candidate answer values efficiently:

- Because digit sums are bounded and tend to grow slowly relative to the number's size, and given the interval length of 1000, the sum of digits should range roughly within certain min/max values depending on the size of `k`.

To explore the possible values, we'll instantiate small `k` and compute the digit sums for `k` through `k + 999`. We focus on small `k` values to keep computations efficient.

Here's a Python program that enumerates possible digit sums of numbers from 0 up to 19999 (if needed), gathering the minimal and maximal sums for each `k`, to find all potential N that might appear.

```python
# Enumerate all possible digit sums for numbers in a manageable range to gain insight
def digit_sum(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

# Collect all possible sums for intervals [k, k + 999] for small k
max_k = 20000 - 1000  # limit to manageable size
possible_sums = set()

for k in range(max_k):
    interval_sums = set()
    for m in range(k, k + 1000):
        interval_sums.add(digit_sum(m))
    min_sum = min(interval_sums)
    max_sum = max(interval_sums)
    # For each sum in the observed range, add to the overall set
    possible_sums.update(interval_sums)
    # Optional: print min and max for each k
    print(f"k={k}, minSum={min_sum}, maxSum={max_sum}")

# Show the collected candidate sums
print("Candidate N values (possible digit sums):")
for n in sorted(possible_sums):
    print(n)
```
