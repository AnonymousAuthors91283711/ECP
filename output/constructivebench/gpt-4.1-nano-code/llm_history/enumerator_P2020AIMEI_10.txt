The problem defines a set of natural numbers \( k \) such that there exist positive integers \( m, n \) with specific properties, including gcd conditions and divisibility conditions involving \( m, n \), and their sum \( m + n \). The ultimate goal seems to be finding the least such \( k \), but the specific constraints make enumerations manageable for small values.

Steps:
- Fix small values for \( n \) and \( m \), starting from small positive integers.
- Check the gcd condition \( \gcd(m + n, 210) = 1 \).
- Check divisibility conditions \( n^n \mid m^m \) and \( \neg n \mid m \).
- Record all such \( m + n \), then find the minimum.

```python
# Enumerate small positive m, n to find the least k satisfying the given conditions
import math

results = []

for n in range(1, 20):  # Small n
    n_pow = n ** n
    for m in range(1, 20):  # Small m
        sum_mn = m + n
        # Check gcd with 210
        if math.gcd(sum_mn, 210) != 1:
            continue
        # Check divisibility conditions:
        # 1. n^n divides m^m
        if m == 0:
            continue
        # only if m^m is divisible by n^n
        # m^m divisible by n^n means n^n | m^m
        # which is true if and only if for all prime p dividing n,
        # p^a divides m^m with a â‰¤ m * exponent of p in m
        # but we can check directly:
        if (m ** m) % n_pow != 0:
            continue
        # 2. n does not divide m
        if m % n == 0:
            continue
        # Conditions satisfied
        results.append(sum_mn)
        print(f"Found candidate sum m + n = {sum_mn} for m={m}, n={n}")

if results:
    answer = min(results)
    print(f"The least such sum m + n is: {answer}")
else:
    print("No such sum found within search limits.")
```
