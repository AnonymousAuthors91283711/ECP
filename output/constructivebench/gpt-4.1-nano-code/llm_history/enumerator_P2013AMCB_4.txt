The problem involves computing an expression based on the miles traveled and gas consumption rates. Given the definitions:

- gas_ray = miles / 40
- gas_tom = miles / 10

We want to evaluate:

2 * miles / (gas_ray + gas_tom)

First, substitute the given expressions:

gas_ray + gas_tom = (miles / 40) + (miles / 10)

Expressed with a common denominator:

= (miles / 40) + (4 * miles / 40) = (1 + 4) * miles / 40 = 5 * miles / 40 = miles / 8

Now, plug back into the main expression:

2 * miles / (miles / 8)

Dividing by a fraction:

= 2 * miles * (8 / miles) = 2 * 8 = 16

The answer simplifies to 16 for any miles > 0 (since dividing by zero when miles=0 is invalid). Considering integer division and the problem's constraints, the result always simplifies to 16 when miles > 0.

Here's the enumeration code verifying this:

```python
# Program to confirm the expression simplifies to 16 for various miles
def main():
    for miles in range(1, 101):  # Testing miles from 1 to 100
        gas_ray = miles / 40
        gas_tom = miles / 10
        denominator = gas_ray + gas_tom
        result = 2 * miles / denominator
        # Since all calculations are floating point, check if result is approximately 16
        print(f"miles={miles}, result={result}")
        if abs(result - 16) > 1e-6:
            print(f"Unexpected result at miles={miles}")
            break

main()
```

This code confirms the limiting value is 16 for positive miles, aligning with the algebraic simplification.
