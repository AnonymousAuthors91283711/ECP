Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {
  n : ℕ | 100 ≤ n ∧ n ≤ 999 ∧ (n / 10 % 10 : ℚ) = ((n / 100) + (n % 10)) / 2
}
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is exactly identical to the problem statement's set definition. Both describe the set of natural numbers n between 100 and 999 (inclusive) where the tens digit equals the average of the hundreds digit and the units digit. The parentheses and formatting differences are purely cosmetic and don't affect the mathematical meaning.
