Ground Truth Answer: 64
Proposed Answer: (11 * 2^(2 + 2 + 1 + 0))
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is a system of equations with variables b (blue), r (red), g (green), c (cyan) that must sum to 280, with specific multiplicative relationships between them.

2. From the equations:
   - c = 4r
   - r = 2b ⇒ c = 4(2b) = 8b
   - g = 3c = 3(8b) = 24b
   - Total: b + r + g + c = b + 2b + 24b + 8b = 35b = 280 ⇒ b = 8
   - Therefore c = 8b = 64

3. The ground truth answer is indeed 64.

4. The proposed answer is (11 * 2^(2 + 2 + 1 + 0)) which evaluates to:
   - Exponent: 2+2+1+0 = 5
   - 11 * 2^5 = 11 * 32 = 352 ≠ 64

The proposed answer does not match the correct solution.
