The error arises because the expression uses an `if-then-else` construct on a real number condition, making it noncomputable without explicit proof of totality or noncomputability. Since the value of `P2024AIMEI_1_answer` appears to be a specific real number derived from the candidate solution in the enumeration, we should assign it directly to that real number to ensure the definition is total and well-typed.

From the enumerated solutions, the primary candidate `s=2.5` and `t≈24` fit the structure implied by the problem. Noticing the pattern in the approximate answer, the value `24/60` simplifies to `0.4`, and the candidate `s=2.5` satisfies the equations.

Given the approximation and consistency, the expression for `P2024AIMEI_1_answer` should be a specific real number, for example, `0.4` (or precisely the floating-point number corresponding to `24/60`). Thus, the corrected definition is:

<<<0.4>>>

This makes the definition total, computable, and consistent with the enumerated candidate solutions.
