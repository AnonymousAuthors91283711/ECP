theorem omnimath3926 : fn 1991 (2^1990) = omnimath3926_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Starting iteration for n=10, initial=1024
Iteration result: 49
Result after 10 iterations: 169
Starting iteration for n=20, initial=2^20
Result after 20 iterations: 256
Digital root of 2^1990: 7
Conjecture: The value of fn(1991, 2^1990) converges to the fixed point related to the digital root, likely 1 or 4.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests the fixed point is related to the digital root; for the large exponent, the digital root is 7, which ultimately leads to a fixed point of 1 after repeated sum-of-digits operations. Therefore, the final answer converges to 1.
