The problem involves enumerating all paths of length 20 starting from (0,0) in a 2x2 grid, where consecutive positions are adjacent, summing the grid values along each path, and counting how many such paths sum to exactly 20. To approach this, I'll generate all possible paths of length 20, respecting adjacency constraints, compute their sums, and count those with sum 20. To make this feasible, constraints limit the search space, as the total sum along the path is fixed at 20 with a small grid.

Since the grid values are small and path length is relatively short, an efficient recursive backtracking approach with pruning can be used to enumerate all valid paths and check their sums on-the-fly. This approach maintains performance, avoids generating invalid paths, and streams results when found.

```python
# Enumerate all paths of length 20 starting from (0,0) in a 2x2 grid
# with adjacency constraints, compute their sum, and count those summing to 20.

def main():
    from itertools import product

    # Grid values
    grid = {(0,0): 1, (0,1): 2, (1,0): 3, (1,1): 4}

    # Adjacency function
    def is_adjacent(p, q):
        i1, j1 = p
        i2, j2 = q
        return (i1 == i2 and abs(j1 - j2) == 1) or (j1 == j2 and abs(i1 - i2) == 1)

    start = (0,0)
    path_length = 20
    target_sum = 20
    count = 0

    # Recursive DFS function
    def dfs(current_path, current_sum):
        nonlocal count
        if len(current_path) == path_length:
            if current_sum == target_sum:
                print(current_path)
                count += 1
            return
        last_point = current_path[-1]
        for neighbor in grid:
            if neighbor not in current_path and is_adjacent(last_point, neighbor):
                dfs(current_path + [neighbor], current_sum + grid[neighbor])

    # Start recursion
    dfs([start], grid[start])
    print(f"Total paths summing to {target_sum}: {count}")

main()
```
