theorem omnimath4183 :
  IsGreatest {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ totient n ∣ n ∧ 
    (∑' m, (n / m - (n - 1) / m)) = 1992} omnimath4183_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: timeout triggered. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the sum simplifies to the count of divisors n, which equals n, the condition reduces to n divides n and sum equals 1992, so n=1992; n > 0, n divides n, and sum is 1992.  
Final answer: <<<1992>>>
