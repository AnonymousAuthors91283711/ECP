Given the linear equations and the symmetry in their coefficients, the relations involve sums of squares and reciprocals suggestive of a rotation or specific angle solution. The coefficients 56, 33, 33, 56 relate to Pythagorean triples (for example, 56^2 + 33^2 = 65^2). 

Using these, the explicit solution for |x| + |y| simplifies to 65 — the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed. 

Therefore, the answer is: 

<<<65>>>
