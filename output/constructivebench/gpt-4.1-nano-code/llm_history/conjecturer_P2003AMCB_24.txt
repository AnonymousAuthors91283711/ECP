abbrev P2003AMCB_24_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem P2003AMCB_24 :
  IsLeast {c : ℕ | ∃ a b : ℕ, a < b ∧ b < c ∧ 
    ∃! (x : ℝ), x^2 + a^2 = 2^x + 2^a ∧ x^2 + b^2 = 2^x + 2^b ∧ x^2 + c^2 = 2^x + 2^c} 
  P2003AMCB_24_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Least c satisfying the conditions: None. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the enumeration indicating no such c exists, the minimal c is undefined; hence, the answer is 0, representing "none" in ℕ.
