Ground Truth Answer: 8
Proposed Answer: 60
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a situation where:
   - Initially, girls make up 40% of total students (2*total %5 = 0)
   - After 2 girls leave, girls make up 30% of the new total (which is total-2+2 = total, since 2 leave and 2 join)

2. The equation simplifies to:
   (0.4*total - 2)*10 = 3*total
   4*total - 20 = 3*total
   total = 20

3. However, the ground truth answer is 8 and proposed answer is 60, neither matches our calculation.

4. The ground truth answer (8) would give:
   - Initial girls: 2*8/5 = 3.2 (not integer)
   - Doesn't satisfy the first condition (2*8%5=1≠0)

5. The proposed answer (60) would give:
   - Initial girls: 2*60/5=24
   - After changes: (24-2)*10=220 vs 3*(60)=180
   - Doesn't satisfy the equation

Both answers fail to satisfy the given conditions. The correct answer should be 20 based on the equations.
