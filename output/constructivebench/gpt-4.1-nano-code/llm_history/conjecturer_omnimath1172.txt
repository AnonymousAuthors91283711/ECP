theorem omnimath1172 :
  (∑ f : Fin 2021 → Fin 2021, 
    (Finset.image (fun n => iterate f 2021 n) univ).card) % 2017 = omnimath1172_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating functions on set of size 2
Total sum of images for size 2: 6
Enumerating functions on set of size 3
Total sum of images for size 3: 51
Enumerating functions on set of size 4
Total sum of images for size 4: 568. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern of sums suggests for size n, the total sum is roughly n! * (n-1)! or related factorial terms, hinting at factorial-based formulas. Noticing cumulative sums grow rapidly, the answer likely involves n! * (n-1)! mod 2017, and given enumerations, for n=2021, the pattern suggests n! * (n-1)! mod 2017. 

Using Wilson's theorem: (p-1)! ≡ -1 mod p for prime p, and 2017 is prime, so (2016)! ≡ -1. 

Hence, for n=2021, the sum relates to (2020)! * 2021! mod 2017, which simplifies to (-1)*...= - (2016)! ≡ 1 mod 2017. 

Final expression: 
<<<1>>>
