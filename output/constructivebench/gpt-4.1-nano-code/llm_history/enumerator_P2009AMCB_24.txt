This problem involves analyzing the set of real numbers \(x\) within \([0, \pi]\) such that \(\arcsin(\sin(6x)) = \arccos(\cos x)\). To find the number of solutions, I will generate candidate \(x\) values within \([0, \pi]\) and check the equality numerically, considering the periodicity and properties of the involved functions. 

Since the problem is a high-school level competition question, I will select discrete sample points in \([0, \pi]\), evaluate the expression, and count how many satisfy the equality. This approach aims to approximate the solution set and aid in conjecturing the exact count.

Let's implement this logic, sampling at small intervals, and print solutions immediately as they are found.

```python
import math

# Define the interval [0, pi]
start, end = 0, math.pi

# Step size for sampling
step = 0.01

# Initialize count of solutions
solutions_count = 0

x = start
while x <= end:
    sin_6x = math.sin(6 * x)
    arcsin_value = math.asin(sin_6x)
    cos_x = math.cos(x)
    arccos_value = math.acos(cos_x)

    # Check if they are approximately equal within a tolerance
    if abs(arcsin_value - arccos_value) < 1e-6:
        print(f"x = {x:.4f} satisfies the condition.")
        solutions_count += 1

    x += step

print(f"Total solutions approximate count: {solutions_count}")
```
