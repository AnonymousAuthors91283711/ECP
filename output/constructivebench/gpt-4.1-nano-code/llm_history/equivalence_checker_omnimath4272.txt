abbrev omnimath4272_answer : ℕ → Prop := sorry
theorem omnimath4272 (n : ℕ) (hn : n > 0) :
  (∃ m, ∑ d ∈ divisors n, d = 2^m) → omnimath4272_answer n := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun n => ∃ k, n.divisors.card = 2^k
Proposed Answer: fun n => n = 1 ∨ (∃ k : ℕ, n = 2^k - 1 ∧ ∑ d ∈ divisors n, d = 2^k)
