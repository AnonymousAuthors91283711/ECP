abbrev omnimath2768_answer : ℤ × ℤ → ℤ := sorry
theorem omnimath2768 (x y : ℤ) (hx : x = -2) (hy : y = -1) : 
    (3 * x + 2 * y) - (3 * x - 2 * y) = omnimath2768_answer (x, y) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: -4. Expected Answer Type: ℤ × ℤ → ℤ
Given the pattern of the enumerated answer (-4) when (x, y) = (-2, -1), and the expression (3 * x + 2 * y) - (3 * x - 2 * y), simplifying shows the answer is always 4. The answer is independent of x, y. Thus, for any (x,y), omnimath2768_answer (x, y) = 4.
