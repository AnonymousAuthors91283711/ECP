This appears to be a Lean theorem involving natural numbers and properties of evenness, combined with an unknown function `omnimath3490_answer`. Your goal is likely to find a function `omnimath3490_answer` that satisfies the stated properties for `n = 7`, based on the conditions provided.

The theorem involves checking whether `omnimath3490_answer n` is even, while also ensuring several other expressions are not even, given `n = 7`.

The constraints for `n = 7`:
- `omnimath3490_answer 7` is even,
- `9 * 7 = 63` is not even (which is obvious),
- `7 + 8 = 15` is not even (obvious),
- `7^2 = 49` is not even,
- `7 * (7 - 2) = 7 * 5 = 35` is not even.

The complexity lies in finding such an `omnimath3490_answer` that makes the first statement true but aligns with the non-even conditions of other expressions.

Hence, a simple candidate that satisfies the properties is to choose `omnimath3490_answer n = 2`, since:
- 2 is even,
- the other expressions are not even.

Let's validate for other small candidates, aiming to explore possible values.

```python
# Program to enumerate possible values of omnimath3490_answer for n=7,
# satisfying the theorem properties, focusing on evenness of the answer.
# We check candidate values and print solutions that satisfy the constraints.

def is_even(x):
    return x % 2 == 0

# For n=7, check candidates from 0 up to 20 (arbitrary small range)
n = 7
candidate_range = range(0, 21)

for candidate in candidate_range:
    # First condition: omnimath3490_answer 7 is even
    if not is_even(candidate):
        continue
    # 9 * n = 63, not even (true), so no need to check
    # n + 8 = 15, not even, no condition needed
    # n^2 = 49, no condition needed
    # n*(n-2) = 35, no condition needed
    print(candidate)
```
