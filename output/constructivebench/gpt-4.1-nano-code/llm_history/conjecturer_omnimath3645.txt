Sequence up to n=10: [19, 95, 190, 380, 760, 1520, 3040, 6080, 12160, 24320]. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern shows x(n) doubles each step, starting from 19, with x(2)=95=19×5, then x(3)=190=19×10, and subsequent terms multiply by 2 while scaling by 5. The pattern is x(n) = 19×2^{n-2}×5 for n≥2. For n=1995 and n=1996, the ratio is 2^{1994} and 2^{1995}, respectively.

The gcd of x(1995) and x(1996) is 19×2^{1994} (since their difference ∝ 2^{1994}), and the lcm is 19×2^{1995}×5. Their gcd*lcm = x(1995)*x(1996). The answer simplifies to 19×2^{1994}.
