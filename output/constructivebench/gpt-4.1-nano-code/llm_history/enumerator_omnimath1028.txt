This problem asks to find the number of integers n between 2 and 2016 inclusive such that for every prime p less than 8, p divides n^n - 1. Since primes less than 8 are 2, 3, 5, and 7, we need n such that:

- n^n ≡ 1 mod 2
- n^n ≡ 1 mod 3
- n^n ≡ 1 mod 5
- n^n ≡ 1 mod 7

We can analyze these congruences:

- For p = 2: n^n ≡ 1 mod 2 implies n is odd.
- For p = 3: n^n ≡ 1 mod 3; since 3 divides n^n - 1, n ≡ 1 or 2 mod 3 (because for n ≡ 0 mod 3, n^n ≡ 0, so fails). Let's check:

n ≡ 1 mod 3: n^n ≡ 1^n ≡ 1 mod 3 → OK  
n ≡ 2 mod 3: 2^n mod 3 alternates between 2 and 1:

- n odd: 2^n ≡ 2 mod 3 → not 1  
- n even: 2^n ≡ 1 mod 3 → OK

Thus, for n ≡ 1 mod 3, always OK; for n ≡ 2 mod 3, only if n even.

Similarly, for p=5: n^n ≡ 1 mod 5:

- 5 divides n^n - 1 if n ≡ 1 or 4 mod 5 (since by Fermat: n^{4} ≡ 1 mod 5 for n coprime to 5).  
- For n ≡ 0 mod 5: n^n ≡ 0, so no.

- n ≡ 1 mod 5: always OK  
- n ≡ 4 mod 5: Fermat's little theorem: 4^4 ≡ 1 mod 5, so for n ≡ 4, n^n mod 5 is 4^n. Since 4^4 ≡ 1, and powers alternate, for n ≡ 4, n^n ≡ 4^4 ≡ 1 mod 5, so OK.

Similarly, for p=7:

- n ≡ 1 or 6 mod 7: by Fermat, n^6 ≡ 1 mod 7.  
- For n ≡ 1 mod 7: n^n ≡ 1^n ≡ 1 mod 7, OK.  
- For n ≡ 6 mod 7: 6^6 ≡ 1 mod 7; for n ≡ 6, n^n ≡ 6^6 ≡ 1 mod 7, OK.

Combining all:

- n is odd (from mod 2)
- n ≡ 1 or 2 mod 3. But for n ≡ 2 mod 3, check if n is even or odd:

If n ≡ 2 mod 3 and n is odd, then n ≡ 2 mod 3 and odd → OK for n ≡ 1 mod 3, but for n ≡ 2 mod 3, only if n even: contradiction. From earlier, only n ≡ 1 mod 3 is always OK; for n ≡ 2 mod 3, only if n even, which can't happen because 2 mod 3 is odd. But we have the restriction n is odd (from 2), so n ≡ 1 mod 3.

Thus, for n: n ≡ 1 mod 3 and n odd.

Now, check the other conditions:

- n ≡ 1 or 4 mod 5: OK
- n ≡ 1 or 6 mod 7: OK

Since n ≡ 1 mod 3, and n odd, then n ≡ 1 mod 3, which is odd.

Let's test n's with these congruences:

- n ≡ 1 or 4 mod 5
- n ≡ 1 or 6 mod 7
- n ≡ 1 mod 3
- n odd (from mod 2)

n ≡ 1 mod 3 indicates n ≡ 1 mod 3.

Let's look for n between 2 and 2016 satisfying:

- n ≡ 1 mod 3
- n ≡ 1 or 4 mod 5
- n ≡ 1 or 6 mod 7

We can implement the code to enumerate n in the range, check these conditions, and count. We'll look for the total number of such n.

```python
# Enumerate n from 2 to 2016 satisfying:
# n ≡ 1 mod 3,
# n ≡ 1 or 4 mod 5,
# n ≡ 1 or 6 mod 7,
# and n is odd (already enforced by n ≡ 1 mod 3).

count = 0
for n in range(2, 2017):
    if n % 3 != 1:
        continue
    if n % 5 not in (1, 4):
        continue
    if n % 7 not in (1, 6):
        continue
    print(n)
    count += 1
print("Total count:", count)
```

This code directly enumerates candidate integers satisfying the derived congruences, immediately outputs each, and finally presents the total number. Since the total count likely covers most of the domain conforming to the constraints, this should correctly help in conjecturing the answer.
