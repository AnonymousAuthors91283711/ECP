The problem defines a function \(f(n) = \log_{2002}(n^2)\) and asks to compute the sum \(N = f(11) + f(13) + f(14)\). 

Since \(\log_b(n^2) = 2 \log_b(n)\), the sum simplifies to:
\[
N = 2 \left(\log_{2002}(11) + \log_{2002}(13) + \log_{2002}(14)\right)
\]
which is equivalent to:
\[
N = 2 \cdot \log_{2002}(11 \times 13 \times 14)
\]
because \(\log_b(a) + \log_b(c) = \log_b(ac)\).

The exact value involves the product \(11 \times 13 \times 14 = 11 \times (13 \times 14) = 11 \times 182 = 2002\). 

Hence, \(N = 2 \times \log_{2002}(2002) = 2 \times 1 = 2\).

```python
# The exact sum simplifies to 2 because:
# 11 * 13 * 14 = 2002, and log_base(2002)(2002) = 1
# Therefore, N = 2 * 1 = 2
# Compute and verify this using Python's math module for correctness.

import math

# define the base b and the product of the numbers
b = 2002
product = 11 * 13 * 14

# compute the sum in terms of logs
N = 2 * (math.log(product, b))
print(N)

# Since the product equals 2002, log_b(2002) = 1, so N should be exactly 2.
```
