The problem involves finding the least \( x \in \mathbb{R} \) such that \( 0 < x \) and \(\frac{\lfloor x \rfloor}{x - \lfloor x \rfloor} = T \), with \( T = 35 \). To analyze this, observe the equation:

\[
\frac{\lfloor x \rfloor}{x - \lfloor x \rfloor} = T \implies x - \lfloor x \rfloor = \frac{\lfloor x \rfloor}{T}
\]

Let \( n = \lfloor x \rfloor \), with \( n \in \mathbb{Z} \), \( n \ge 0 \) (since \( x > 0 \)). Then,

\[
x = n + \frac{n}{T} = n \left(1 + \frac{1}{T} \right)
\]

The minimal \( x \) is achieved by choosing the smallest \( n > 0 \), which is \( n=1 \), because for \( n=0 \), numerator would be zero, making the expression undefined (or zero, but then the fraction isn't defined). Given \( T=35 \):

\[
x = 1 \times \left(1 + \frac{1}{35}\right) = 1 + \frac{1}{35} = \frac{36}{35}
\]

Any larger \( n \) would give larger \( x \), so the minimal \( x \) is when \( n=1 \).

Let's write code to systematically verify this for small \( n \).

```python
# Enumerate possible n values to find the least x satisfying the condition for T=35
T = 35
answers = []

for n in range(1, 10):  # check first 10 positive integers
    x = n * (1 + 1/T)
    # verify the floor and the fraction
    floor_x = n
    fraction = floor_x / (x - floor_x)
    if abs(fraction - T) < 1e-9:
        print(f"n={n}, x={x:.10f}, floor(x)={floor_x}, fraction={fraction}")
        answers.append(x)

# minimal x
min_x = min(answers)
print(f"Least x: {min_x}")
```
