This problem involves logarithm identities, specifically converting the sum of two logarithms with different bases into a single logarithm or a numerical value.

Steps:
- Recall the change of base formula: `log_b(a) = log(a) / log(b)` (where `log` is natural logarithm).
- Express the sum as `(log 40 2) + (log 20 2)`.
- Compute numerically or algebraically to find the answer.

Let's generate candidate answers for different approximations to identify the exact value.

```python
import math

# Function to convert log_b(a) to natural log
def log_base(a, b):
    return math.log(a) / math.log(b)

# Candidates given initial approximations:
vals = []
# Approximate log base 2 of 40
l_40_2 = log_base(40, 2)
# Approximate log base 2 of 20
l_20_2 = log_base(20, 2)

# Sum
sum_logs = l_40_2 + l_20_2
print(f"log 40 2 ≈ {l_40_2}")
print(f"log 20 2 ≈ {l_20_2}")
print(f"Sum ≈ {sum_logs}")

# Exact logarithm calculations:
# 40 = 2^3 * 5, so log_2(40) = 3 + log_2(5)
# 20 = 2^2 * 5, so log_2(20) = 2 + log_2(5)

log2_5 = math.log(5) / math.log(2)
exact_sum = (3 + log2_5) + (2 + log2_5)  # = 5 + 2*log2_5

print(f"ln 5 / ln 2 ≈ {log2_5}")
print(f"Exact sum = 5 + 2*log2_5 = {exact_sum}")

# Return the exact algebraic answer (symbolic form)
# The suspicious answer is 5 + 2 * log2(5)
# Rather than approximate, we keep it symbolic

# Final answer in simplified form
answer = 5 + 2 * log2_5
# For implementation in mathlib, approximate value
answer_value = exact_sum

print(f"The exact value is: {answer}")
print(f"As a decimal approximation: {answer_value}")
```
