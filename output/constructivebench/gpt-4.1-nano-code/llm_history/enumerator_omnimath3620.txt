This problem involves a functional equation:

\[f(x) + f(y \cdot f(x) + f(y)) = f(x + 2f(y)) + xy\]

for all real \(x, y\). The task is to explore possible solutions \(f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\). Without assuming the form of \(f\), one approach is to try particular values structured around simplified substitutions (like setting \(x=0\) or \(y=0\)), and to check whether constant solutions or linear solutions satisfy the equation.

Below is a Python code that attempts constant and simple polynomial solutions by iterating over small candidate values and printing solutions that satisfy the equation within a numerical tolerance. It uses a small sample of candidate functions and prints plausible solutions immediately.

```python
import math

# Functional equation:
# f(x) + f(y * f(x) + f(y)) = f(x + 2 * f(y)) + xy

# Define candidate functions: constants and linear functions
# We test constants: f(x) = c
# Linear: f(x) = a * x + b

tolerance = 1e-6

def check_constant(c):
    # check if f(x) = c satisfies the equation for sample points
    for x in [-1, 0, 1]:
        for y in [-1, 0, 1]:
            fx = c
            fy = c
            lhs = fx + c  # f(y*f(x) + f(y)) = f(y*c + c) = c
            rhs = c + x * y
            if abs(lhs - rhs) > tolerance:
                return False
    print(f"Constant solution f(x)={c}")
    return True

def check_linear(a, b):
    # check if f(x) = a * x + b satisfies the equation
    for x in [-1, 0, 1]:
        for y in [-1, 0, 1]:
            fx = a * x + b
            fy = a * y + b
            f_y = fy
            f_x = fx
            f_yf = a * (y * fx + fy) + b
            f_xplus = a * (x + 2 * fy) + b
            lhs = fx + a * (y * fx + fy) + b
            rhs = a * (x + 2 * fy) + b + x * y
            if abs(lhs - rhs) > tolerance:
                return False
    print(f"Linear solution f(x)={a}*x + {b}")
    return True

# Search small set of constants
for c in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
    check_constant(c)

# Search small set of linear functions
for a in [-1, 0, 1]:
    for b in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
        check_linear(a, b)
