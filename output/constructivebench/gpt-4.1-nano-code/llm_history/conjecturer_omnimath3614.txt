theorem omnimath3614 (x y z : ℕ) : 
  x^5 + x^4 + 1 = 3^y * 7^z ↔ (x, y, z) ∈ omnimath3614_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: (0, 0, 0)

(2, 0, 2). Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ × ℕ)
The solutions are finite and follow from checking small values, and the pattern suggests the answer set contains these triples. The only solutions for non-negative integers satisfying the equation are `(0, 0, 0)`, `(1, 1, 0)`, and `(2, 0, 2)`. Thus, I will express this set as the union of singleton sets with these elements.

The main issue is that the definition of `omnimath3614_answer` is set to `sorry`, which is acceptable, but the pattern suggests it should be explicitly written as a set containing the known solutions. The current proposed answer is a raw set of tuples written directly with curly braces, which is valid in Lean syntax if we use `Set.ofList` or by directly constructing the set with `({ ... })`. 

To fix the compilation error, I will define `omnimath3614_answer` as a set containing exactly those three known solutions: `(0, 0, 0)`, `(1, 1, 0)`, and `(2, 0, 2)`.

Thus, the corrected answer should be:

<<<{
  (0, 0, 0),
  (1, 1, 0),
  (2, 0, 2)
}>>>

There is no need for the string explanation inside the definition; the set notation is direct and concise, matching the found solutions. Enclosing this with curly braces creates a `Set (ℕ × ℕ × ℕ)` correctly in Lean.

Final Corrected Answer:
<<<{
  (0, 0, 0),
  (1, 1, 0),
  (2, 0, 2)
}>>>
