Possible prime p=47 for m=10. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The pattern indicates that for m=1, no such p exists, so 1 is excluded. For others, the primes are those where p ≡ 1 mod m, implying m divides p−1. Since p is prime, p ≡ 1 mod m. Therefore, the answer set includes all positive integers m ≥ 2 such that m divides p−1 for some prime p, or equivalently, m is not 1. The set of m satisfying the condition is exactly m=1, which does not satisfy the property, so the final set is all m ≥ 2. 

Thus, the explicit closed form is:

<<<{m : ℕ | 2 ≤ m}>>>
