The problem asks to compute the sum of squares of odd numbers from 1 up to the 49th odd number, then find the result modulo 1000. Since the sequence of odd numbers up to 49 terms is 1, 3, 5, ..., 97, 99, we need to evaluate:

\[
\sum_{k=0}^{49} (2k+1)^2
\]

and then take this sum modulo 1000.

To do this efficiently, we can:
- Iterate over k = 0 to 49,
- Compute (2k+1)^2,
- Keep a running total,
- After summing all, take the result modulo 1000,
- Print the sum immediately on each step for streaming output.

Here's a Python program to perform this task:

```python
# Calculate sum of squares of first 50 odd numbers, then modulo 1000
total = 0
for k in range(50):
    val = (2 * k + 1) ** 2
    total += val
    print(f"Adding (2*{k}+1)^2 = {val}, running total = {total}")
result_mod = total % 1000
print(f"Final sum mod 1000 = {result_mod}")
```

This code computes the sum efficiently without unnecessary repetition, streams results as it goes, and finally outputs the answer.
