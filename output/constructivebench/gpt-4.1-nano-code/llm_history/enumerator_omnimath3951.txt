This problem appears to involve polynomial composition and evaluations over ℝ, with a focus on particular identities for polynomials. To assist with conjecturing and exploring solutions, I will enumerate small values of the parameter `k` for various sample degrees of polynomial `P`.

Given constraints:
- n > 1 (we'll choose n=3, for example)
- degree P > 0 (try small degrees)
- The polynomial P and composition structure are involved

I will produce candidate polynomials P of small degrees and check whether the evaluation condition holds, aiming to find possible k values such that P = omnimath3951_answer n k. Since the exact formula for `omnimath3951_answer` is unknown, we'll just generate candidate polynomials P that satisfy some candidate identities.

The code will:
- Pick small `n`
- Generate small polynomials `P` (e.g., degree 1 or 2)
- Check whether the evaluation equality holds for several sample x values
- If consistent, print the polynomial and candidate k

Here's the code:

```python
import sympy as sp

# Setup
x = sp.symbols('x')
n = 3  # sample n > 1
max_deg = 2  # limit degree for P
sample_xs = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]  # sample points for evaluation

# We'll generate some candidate polynomials P with degrees 1 and 2
for deg in range(1, max_deg + 1):
    # Generate coefficients
    # For simplicity, pick small integer coefficients from -2 to 2
    for c0 in range(-2, 3):
        for c1 in range(-2, 3):
            for c2 in range(-2, 3):
                # Build P
                if deg == 1:
                    P = c1 * x + c0
                elif deg == 2:
                    P = c2 * x**2 + c1 * x + c0
                else:
                    continue
                # Compose P with X^(i+1) for i in range(n)
                compositions = [
                    P.subs(x, x**(i+1))
                    for i in range(n)
                ]
                prod_compositions = sp.prod(compositions)
                # Compose P with X^(n*(n+1)//2)
                exponent = n * (n + 1) // 2
                P_composed = P.subs(x, x**exponent)
                # Check for various x
                valid_for_all = True
                for val in sample_xs:
                    eval1 = prod_compositions.evalf(subs={x: val})
                    eval2 = P_composed.evalf(subs={x: val})
                    if abs(eval1 - eval2) > 1e-6:
                        valid_for_all = False
                        break
                if valid_for_all:
                    # Guess k as degree ? For illustration, set k as degree of P
                    k = deg
                    print(f'P = {P}, belongs to candidate k={k}')
```
