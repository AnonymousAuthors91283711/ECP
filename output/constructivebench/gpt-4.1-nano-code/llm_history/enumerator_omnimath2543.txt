The problem appears to involve a polynomial \( P = X^7 - 7 \), roots \( r_i \), and a parameter \( K \) defined as a product over pairs of roots. Given the form of \( P \), its roots are the 7th roots of 7, scaled appropriately. The expression \( K \) involves the sum of pairs of roots with an ordering constraint, and the goal seems to relate \( K^2 \) to some value.

Since the roots are complex 7th roots of 7, these roots are explicitly expressible as \( r_i = \sqrt[7]{7} \cdot \zeta^i \), where \( \zeta \) is a primitive 7th root of unity: \( \zeta = e^{2\pi i/7} \).

Given the symmetry and properties of roots of unity, the product involving sums \( r_i + r_j \) over \( i < j \) can be computed explicitly for the roots, with fixed parameters, avoiding symbolic ambiguities.

To assist in conjecturing, we pick representative roots: the 7th roots of the real number \( \sqrt[7]{7} \) are \( r_i = \sqrt[7]{7} \cdot e^{2\pi i i/7} \), for \( i=0,\dots,6 \).

The key is to enumerate all pairwise sums \( r_i + r_j \) with \( i < j \), multiply them to compute \( K \), then square to find \( K^2 \).

Here is the code:

```python
import cmath
import math

# Compute the 7th roots of unity
roots_of_unity = [cmath.exp(2j * math.pi * i / 7) for i in range(7)]
# 7th root of 7
r_base = 7 ** (1/7)

# Compute r_i
roots = [r_base * z for z in roots_of_unity]

# Generate all pairs i < j
pair_products = []
n = 7
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i+1, n):
        sum_pair = roots[i] + roots[j]
        pair_products.append(sum_pair)

# Compute K as the product of all sums
K_complex = 1
for val in pair_products:
    K_complex *= val

# Clear magnitude for better readability
K_magnitude = abs(K_complex)

# The exact value of K^2 (since roots are symmetric)
K_squared = (abs(K_complex)) ** 2

# Due to symmetry and known properties, K^2 is real
print(f"K ≈ {K_complex}")
print(f"K^2 ≈ {K_squared}")
```

This enumeration computes the approximate value of \( K \), then outputs \( K \) and \( K^2 \). It can help conjecture that \( K^2 \) is a specific value and serves as a step towards a formal proof.
