This appears to be a formal mathematical setting, potentially inspired by Lean or a similar proof assistant, with a problem involving a parameterized expression. The goal seems to be to define a function `omnimath2669_answer` that computes the value of `x^2 + 2*x - x*(x+1)` for each `x`, and then to prove it equals that same expression, perhaps for verification.

Given the hints in the problem, it seems you are interested in exploring the behavior of the expression, possibly for conjecture or verification purposes.

Let's analyze the expression manually:
- `x^2 + 2x - x(x+1) = x^2 + 2x - (x^2 + x) = x^2 + 2x - x^2 - x = x`

So it's simplified to just `x`. We probably want to verify this in code and then generate values accordingly.

Here's a Python script that models this:

- Defines a small range of `x` values.
- Computes the expression.
- Prints the value immediately when found, confirming the relation.

```python
# Enumerate small values of x and compute the expression
for x in range(0, 20):  # Small sample size for demonstration
    result = x**2 + 2*x - x*(x + 1)
    # Since the expression simplifies to x, output the result and verify
    print(f"x = {x}, expression = {result}")
    # Additional check: result should be equal to x
    if result != x:
        print(f"Discrepancy found at x = {x}")
```

This code provides exploration of the expression for small `x`, outputs each computation immediately, and confirms the simplified form. It aligns with the constraints and helps verify the formula.

```python
# Enumerate and verify the expression for small sample
for x in range(0, 20):
    result = x**2 + 2*x - x*(x + 1)
    print(f"x = {x}, expression = {result}")
```
