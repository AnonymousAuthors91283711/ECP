Since the problem involves the Fibonacci sequence and divisibility by 13, the pattern suggests that the indices n where 13 divides F_n are multiples of 7 (from observed 7, 14, 21, etc.). The largest n ≤ 100 divisible by 7 with F_n divisible by 13 is 98, and there are 14 such indices: 0,7,14,...,98. 

The total count is 15 (including 0), but the question's enum hints at 14 divisible by 13 within 0..100.

Thus, the answer corresponds to the count of n in [0,100] with 13 | F_n:

. Current Proposed Answer: Since the problem involves the Fibonacci sequence and divisibility by 13, the pattern suggests that the indices n where 13 divides F_n are multiples of 7 (from observed 7, 14, 21, etc.). The largest n ≤ 100 divisible by 7 with F_n divisible by 13 is 98, and there are 14 such indices: 0,7,14,...,98.

77. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern of the enumerated answers shows the indices where F_n is divisible by 13 are multiples of 7 within 0 to 100: these are 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98. The total count is 15. 

So, to encode this in Lean, the number of such n in [0, 100] where 13 divides F_n is 15.

Since the exact calculation or proof might be complex, the key is the enumeration: all these indices are multiples of 7 up to 98 (since 98 ≤ 100).

Delayed reasoning aside, a closed form answer is the number of multiples of 7 in [0, 100], which is ⌊ 100/7 ⌋ + 1 = 14 + 1 = 15.

Hence, the answer is 15.
