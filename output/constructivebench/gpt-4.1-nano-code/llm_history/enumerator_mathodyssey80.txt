The problem appears to be a linear optimization problem: find the maximum value of \( z = 9x + y \) under constraints given by two inequalities involving \(x\) and \(y\).

Constraints:
1. \( 2x - 5y \leq -6 \)
2. \( 3x + 6y \leq 25 \)

Objective:
Maximize \( z = 9x + y \)

Since the feasible region is a polygon defined by these inequalities, the maximum occurs at a vertex (corner point). To find candidate points, we'll examine intersections of the boundary lines:

- Line 1: \( 2x - 5y = -6 \)
- Line 2: \( 3x + 6y = 25 \)

Compute intersection:
```python
import numpy as np

# Define the boundary lines
def line1(x): return (2*x + 6) / 5
def line2(x): return (25 - 3*x) / 6

# Compute intersection of boundary lines
# Solve:
# 2x - 5y = -6
# 3x + 6y = 25

# Express y from line1:
# y = (2x + 6)/5
# Substitute into line2:
# 3x + 6 * [(2x + 6)/5] = 25
# 3x + (12x + 36)/5 = 25
# Multiply through by 5:
# 15x + 12x + 36 = 125
# 27x = 89
x_int = 89 / 27
y_int = line1(x_int)

# Compute candidate points:
candidate_points = []

# Intersection point of lines
candidate_points.append((x_int, y_int))
print(f"Intersection point: x={x_int}, y={y_int}")

# Check vertices at x, where constraints intersect with axes:
# Since these are linear inequalities, check:
# - Intersect with x-axis (y=0)
x1 = (-6) / 2  # from line1
x2 = (25) / 3  # from line2

# For each, check feasibility:
for x_candidate in [x1, x2]:
    # Check if constraints are satisfied
    y1 = 0
    feasible1 = (2*x_candidate - 5*y1 <= -6) and (3*x_candidate + 6*y1 <= 25)
    if feasible1:
        candidate_points.append((x_candidate, y1))
        print(f"Feasible vertex at x-axis: x={x_candidate}, y=0")
    # Similarly check at y-axis (x=0)
    # For y-axis x=0:
    y_line1 = (-6 - 2*0)/(-5)  # from line1
    y_line2 = (25 - 3*0)/6   # from line2
    for y_candidate in [y_line1, y_line2]:
        feasible2 = (2*0 - 5*y_candidate <= -6) and (3*0 +6*y_candidate <= 25)
        if feasible2:
            candidate_points.append((0, y_candidate))
            print(f"Feasible vertex at y-axis: x=0, y={y_candidate}")

# Remove duplicates
candidate_points = list(set(candidate_points))

# Evaluate z = 9x + y at each candidate point
# Print results immediately
for x, y in candidate_points:
    z = 9*x + y
    print(f"Candidate point: x={x}, y={y}, z=9*{x}+{y}={z}")
```
