The problem involves solving a system of equations with positive integers x, y, z:

1. \( x > 0, y > 0, z > 0 \)
2. \( x^2 + y - z = 100 \)
3. \( x + y^2 - z = 124 \)

To enumerate possible solutions, we can observe that both equations relate x, y, z in specific ways. Subtracting one from the other helps eliminate z:

\[
(x^2 + y - z) - (x + y^2 - z) = 100 - 124
\]
\[
x^2 + y - x - y^2 = -24
\]
\[
x^2 - x + y - y^2 = -24
\]

Rearranged:

\[
(x^2 - x) + (y - y^2) = -24
\]

This splits the problem into considering possible integer values of x and y such that:

\[
x^2 - x + y - y^2 = -24
\]

Since x, y > 0, and the quadratic terms grow quickly, we can limit the search for x and y to small positive integers and search exhaustively.

For each candidate (x, y), compute z:

\[
z = x^2 + y - 100
\]

Check if z is positive and satisfies the second equation:

\[
x + y^2 - z = 124
\]
\[
z = x + y^2 - 124
\]

We can verify if both expressions for z agree. Alternatively, since both express z, we can compute z from the first:

\[
z = x^2 + y - 100
\]

and verify whether:

\[
x + y^2 - z = 124
\]

matches.

Here's the code:

```python
# Enumerate small positive integers x, y within a reasoned range
for x in range(1, 50):
    for y in range(1, 50):
        z_candidate1 = x**2 + y - 100
        z_candidate2 = x + y**2 - 124
        # Check positive z and if both z expressions match
        if z_candidate1 > 0 and z_candidate1 == z_candidate2:
            print((x, y, z_candidate1))
```
