The problem appears to involve analyzing polynomial evaluations modulo n, examining the behavior of the residues over iterations, and relating the cardinality of a certain set to an expression involving n and 2^m. Given the structure, we can design an enumeration over small n, and for each, explore possible polynomial behaviors for small m, collecting the n values that satisfy the given property.

Here's the plan:
- Fix small values for n (say, 1 to 20) and small polynomial degrees (say degree â‰¤ 2).
- For each n and polynomial P:
  - For small m (say 1 to 10), compute the set rems of the iterated polynomial evaluations modulo n.
  - Check if the size of rems matches the ceiling of n divided by 2^m.
- Collect all n satisfying the property for some P and m, then store in a set `omnimath4265_answer`.
- Stream answers as they are found.

This setup enables we to enumerate possible answers in a polynomial-time feasible way, and to observe patterns and conjecture.

```python
# Enum and check for the condition for small n, P, m
from math import ceil
from itertools import product

# Helper: generate small integer polynomials up to degree 2 with coefficients in [-2, 2]
def generate_polynomials():
    for deg in range(0, 3):
        for coeffs in product(range(-2,3), repeat=deg+1):
            yield lambda x, c=coeffs: sum(c[i]*x**i for i in range(deg+1))

# Set to collect answers
omnimath4265_answer = set()

# Limits
max_n = 20
max_m = 10

for n in range(1, max_n+1):
    for P in generate_polynomials():
        # For each polynomial, check for some m
        for m in range(1, max_m+1):
            # Compute the rems set
            rems = set()
            current = 1
            for _ in range(m):
                current = P(current) % n
                rems.add(current)
            # Calculate expected size
            expected = ceil(n / (2 ** m))
            if len(rems) == expected:
                # If condition holds for some m, record n
                print(f"n={n} satisfies condition with polynomial coefficients approximating {P} and m={m}")
                omnimath4265_answer.add(n)
                # Once found for some P and m, no need to check further P for this n
                break

# Output all collected answers
print("Collected n values satisfying the property:", sorted(omnimath4265_answer))
```
