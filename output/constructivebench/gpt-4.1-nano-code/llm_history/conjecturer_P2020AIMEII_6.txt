. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests that for large n, t(n) exhibits a ratio converging to a value near 12, with fractional parts oscillating around that value. Empirically, the numerator plus denominator approaches 12*n, indicating the limit behavior. Based on the given approximations and pattern, the answer likely follows an approximate linear relation involving 12 and n.
