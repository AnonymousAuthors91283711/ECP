[write_program]
This problem involves finding the greatest integer \(k\) such that there exists a subset \(s\) of the finite set \(\text{Fin}(100)\) satisfying the condition: the number of primes in \(s\) (where primes are \(\{i : i + 1 \text{ is prime}\}\)) is greater than the number of multiples of 4 in \(s\). We interpret the problem as searching for the maximum \(k\) where a subset of size \(k\) satisfies the given inequality with the prime and multiple-of-4 counts. Since the problem is complex for large sets, we'll explore small values systematically, focusing on feasible sizes, and identify the maximum \(k\) for which such a subset exists.

```python
# Program to find the maximum k satisfying the problem's inequality over subsets of Fin(100).
# It enumerates small subset sizes and checks whether a subset exists with the required property,
# prioritizing the maximal k.

    sieve = [True]*(n+1)
    sieve[0], sieve[1] = False, False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5)+1):
        if sieve[i]:
            for j in range(i*i, n+1, i):
                sieve[j] = False
    return {i for i in range(2, n+1) if sieve[i]}

    for s in itertools.combinations(range(100), k):
        s_set = set(s)
        primes_in_s = sum(1 for i in s if is_prime(i))
        mult4_in_s = sum(1 for i in s if is_mult4(i))
        if primes_in_s > mult4_in_s:
            print(f"Found subset of size {k} with primes {primes_in_s} > multiples of 4 {mult4_in_s}")

            max_k_set = s
            found = True
            break
    if found:
        # No need to check smaller sizes
        break

print(f"Maximum k satisfying the condition is: {max_k_found}")
# For their actual size aligns to what the code finds, the subset is printed if needed
