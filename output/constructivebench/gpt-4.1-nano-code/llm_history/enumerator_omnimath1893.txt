The problem defines relationships between a, b, c, and n, with positive real numbers and specific ratios. To find possible values of n, we can use the given equations:

1. \(\frac{a + b}{a} = 3 \Rightarrow a + b = 3a \Rightarrow b = 2a\)
2. \(\frac{b + c}{b} = 4 \Rightarrow b + c = 4b \Rightarrow c = 3b = 6a\)
3. \(\frac{c + a}{c} = n \Rightarrow c + a = n c \Rightarrow n = \frac{c + a}{c} = 1 + \frac{a}{c}\)

Substituting \(a\) and \(c\):

- \(a = a\)
- \(c = 6a\)

Therefore,

\[ n = 1 + \frac{a}{6a} = 1 + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{7}{6} \]

The only consistent value under these constraints is \(n = 7/6\).

However, to accommodate potential generalizations or parametrizations, the code will attempt to verify a range of ratios for \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and ensure the formulas align. Since all numbers are determined once \(a > 0\) is chosen, the value of \(n\) is fixed.

```python
# The algebraic derivation indicates n is fixed at 7/6 for positive real solutions.
# To assist in conjecture, let's generate possible n given small perturbations around typical ratios.

# But as the algebra shows, the solution is unique, so we'll just confirm that n = 7/6.

print("n =", 7/6)
```
