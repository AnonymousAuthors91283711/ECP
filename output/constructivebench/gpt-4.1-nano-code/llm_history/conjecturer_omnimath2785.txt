The error stems from using `=` instead of defining a value with `:=`, and attempting to include explicit substitutions and calculations inside an `abbrev`. Instead, I should declare `omnimath2785_answer` as a function of the variables, or directly compute the sum based on the given relations and known values for `a`, `b`, `c`, and `r`.

The key constraints are:
- \( a + b + c = 114 \),
- \( a \times b \times c = 46656 \),
- \( b = a r \),
- \( c = a r^2 \),
- and the specific solution with \( r = 3/2 \).

From \( a + b + c = 114 \), and substituting \( b = a r \), \( c = a r^2 \):

\[ a + a r + a r^2 = a (1 + r + r^2) = 114. \]

Given \( r = 3/2 \):

\[ 1 + \frac{3}{2} + \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 = 1 + \frac{3}{2} + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{4}{4} + \frac{6}{4} + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{19}{4}. \]

Hence:

\[ a \times \frac{19}{4} = 114 \implies a = \frac{114 \times 4}{19} = \frac{456}{19}. \]

Calculate \( c = a r^2 \):

\[ c = \frac{456}{19} \times \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{456}{19} \times \frac{9}{4} = \frac{456 \times 9}{19 \times 4} = \frac{4104}{76} = \frac{1026}{19}. \]

Now, sum \( a + c \):

\[ a + c = \frac{456}{19} + \frac{1026}{19} = \frac{456 + 1026}{19} = \frac{1482}{19} = 78. \]

This matches the enumerated answer for \( r = 3/2 \). So the closed-form answer for the sum \( a + c \) under these conditions is \( \frac{1482}{19} \).

In Lean, the expression can be written as:

<<<(456 + 1026) / 19>>>

This is a precise, closed-form answer that matches the specific values derived from the problem constraints.


**Final Answer:**

<<<(456 + 1026) / 19>>>[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The error arises because Lean's `ℝ` (Real) does not automatically support computable division, especially when used in abbreviations or definitions. To fix this, we need to declare `omnimath2785_answer` as `noncomputable`, which allows us to use division without Lean's requirement for constructive definitions. Based on the enumeration, the pattern suggests that the answer for the sum `a + c` is a fixed real number, which is `78.0`. 

By observing that for the given parameters, the sum `a + c` is always 78 (as confirmed by the enumerated answer for different ratios), and knowing that our expression `a + c` simplifies to `a + a * r^2 = a(1 + r^2)`, we can directly set the answer as the constant `78.0`.

**Final fixed answer in Lean:**

<<<noncomputable def omnimath2785_answer : ℝ := (456 + 1026) / 19>>>

*However, since the resulting value simplifies to 78 (because (456 + 1026)/19 = 78), a more straightforward and semantically meaningful answer is the numeric constant 78.*

Therefore, the most natural and robust closed-form answer (especially considering the enumeration and the fixed value) is simply:

```lean
noncomputable def omnimath2785_answer : ℝ := 78.0
```

This complies with Lean's requirements and matches the enumerated answers.

**Summary:**
- Declare as `noncomputable` to avoid division error
- Use the value 78, derived from the ratio calculations and pattern matching the enumerated answers
- Ensure the final definition is self-contained and computable in Lean.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The problem involves finding the value of \(a + c\) given the relations involving \(a, b, c\), and \(r\). From the enumeration, for \(r=3/2\), the answer is 78, which suggests the general form of the solution might be a constant value independent of \(r\), or at least symmetric.

Analyzing the conditions:
- \(a + b + c = 114\)
- \(a b c = 46656\)
- \(b = a r\)
- \(c = a r^2\)

Expressing \(a + c\) in terms of \(a\):
\[ a + c = a + a r^2 = a (1 + r^2) \]

Using the sum:
\[ a + a r + a r^2 = 114 \]
\[ a (1 + r + r^2) = 114 \]
So,
\[ a = \frac{114}{1 + r + r^2} \]

The product condition:
\[ a \cdot a r \cdot a r^2 = a^3 r^3 = 46656 \]
\[ a^3 r^3 = 46656 \]

Recall that \(46656 = 6^6\). Then:
\[ a^3 r^3 = 6^6 \]
\[ (a r)^3 = 6^6 \]
But from earlier:
\[ a r = ? \]

Alternatively, express \(a\) from the sum and substitute into the product:
\[ a = \frac{114}{1 + r + r^2} \]
\[ a^3 r^3 = 46656 \]
\[
\left(\frac{114}{1 + r + r^2} \right)^3 r^3 = 46656
\]
\[
\frac{114^3 r^3}{(1 + r + r^2)^3} = 6^6
\]

Notice that \(6^6= (6^2)^3=36^3\). Let's check whether the numerator matches:
\[
114^3 r^3 = 36^3 (1 + r + r^2)^3
\]

But rather than directly solving for \(r\), from the given candidate answers, for both \(r=3/2\) and \(r=2/3\), the value for \(a + c = 78\). This suggests the quantity \(a + c\) may be independent of \(r\), or at least takes this value for these rational roots.

Since \(a + c = a (1 + r^2)\), and \(a\) depends on \(r\), the product's algebraic constraints lead to a constant value, which from the given data is 78. Therefore, the expression \(a + c\) is simply 78.

In Lean, we should represent the answer as a constant real number 78, not using 'noncomputable' or defining it as a 'def' directly in this context, because the 'abbrev' is already declared as a constant.

Hence, the answer expression is:

<<<78.0>>>

which is a literal real value in Lean.

In the original code, 'abbrev' is used to declare 'omnimath2785_answer' as an abbreviation for the real number, so directly assigning 78.0 should work.

Thus, the corrected answer is:

abbrev omnimath2785_answer : ℝ := 78.0

or directly in your theorem:

(hprod : a * b * c = 46656)

(hc : c = a * r ^ 2)
: a + c = 78.0 := by simp [show a + c = a * (1 + r^2), from rfl, ...] -- you could include the further proof steps

But since only the answer expression is required:
