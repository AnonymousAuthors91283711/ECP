The problem appears to be a formal statement involving properties of sets of powers of two, sums, and congruences modulo r. It asks for a characterization of the set `omnimath4336_answer`, which seems to be a set of natural numbers (possibly moduli r) for which certain subset conditions hold. 

Given the complexity, to assist in conjecturing the true answer, I will:

1. Choose small sample values for r.
2. Enumerate finite sets of powers of two and their sums.
3. Check for the conditions with various a, s, and station sets.
4. Print each r for which the conditions hold for some configurations.

This brute-force approach over small samples will help identify potential patterns and the structure of `omnimath4336_answer`.

```python
# Enumerate r from 1 to 20.
# For each r, test various small subsets of powers of 2 to see if the conditions can be met.
# For each subset, compute sum, check congruence, and print relevant r values.

import itertools

def powers_of_two(max_power=5):
    return [2**k for k in range(max_power+1)]

def subset_sums(arr):
    # Generate all subset sums along with subsets
    subsets = []
    for r in range(len(arr)+1):
        for combo in itertools.combinations(arr, r):
            subsets.append((set(combo), sum(combo)))
    return subsets

# Input parameters
max_r = 20
max_power = 5  # Keep small for efficiency
powers = powers_of_two(max_power)

result_set = set()
for r in range(1, max_r+1):
    # For each r, try to find a, s, stations satisfying the conditions
    # Since the problem involves arbitrary a, s, and stations, we try with small s and station sets
    found = False
    for s_size in range(1, 4):  # small subset size
        for s_subset in itertools.combinations(powers, s_size):
            s_set = set(s_subset)
            s_sum = sum(s_subset)
            # For each possible a in range 0 to r, test
            for a in range(r):
                # Try to find stations that include s and satisfy sum ≡ a mod r
                for stations_size in range(s_size, s_size+2):  # try small station sets including s
                    for stations_subset in itertools.combinations(powers, stations_size):
                        stations_set = set(stations_subset)
                        stations_sum = sum(stations_subset)
                        if s_set.issubset(stations_set):
                            # Check the sum condition
                            if stations_sum % r == a:
                                print(f"r={r} yielded with stations={stations_subset} sum={stations_sum} ≡ {a} mod {r}")
                                result_set.add(r)
                                found = True
                                break
                    if found:
                        break
                if found:
                    break
            if found:
                break
        if found:
            break
# Output candidate r values satisfying the conditions
print("Candidates r:", sorted(result_set))
