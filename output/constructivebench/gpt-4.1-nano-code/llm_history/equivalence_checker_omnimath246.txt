abbrev omnimath246_answer : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath246 (m n : ℕ) (h : m ≥ n) :
    (m + n)! / (m - n)! = omnimath246_answer m n := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun m n => ∏ i in Finset.Icc 1 n, (m^2 + m - i^2 + i)
Proposed Answer: fun m n => Finset.prod (Finset.Icc (m - n + 1) (m + n)) id
Let's analyze the two answers carefully:

1. Ground Truth: This computes the product of (m² + m - i² + i) for i from 1 to n
2. Proposed Answer: This computes the product of all numbers from (m-n+1) to (m+n)

The problem asks for (m+n)!/(m-n)!. Let's verify:
- (m+n)!/(m-n)! = (m-n+1)*(m-n+2)*...*(m+n), which exactly matches the proposed answer
- The ground truth is actually a different expression that happens to equal this for certain cases, but isn't the direct expansion

The proposed answer correctly implements the factorial ratio, while the ground truth is a different (though sometimes equivalent) expression. They are not generally equivalent.
