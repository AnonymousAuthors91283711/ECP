The problem involves exploring polynomials over integers, specifically those that factor into two polynomials of degree at least 1 with a particular form for the constant term. The prime and squarefree conditions on p and q suggest certain irreducibility or factorization constraints. To assist, I will generate candidate polynomials \(g\) and \(h\) satisfying the degree and product conditions for small n, focusing on concrete small p and q.

I'll choose small prime and squarefree values for p and q, such as p=2 and q=3, with n=3 (since n â‰¥ 3). The code iterates over possible integer coefficients for \(g\) and \(h\), computes their product, then checks if the resulting polynomial matches the target form. It then prints each found solution immediately for conjecture building.

```python
import itertools

def enumerate_polynomials(max_coeff=5):
    # We pick small coefficients for g and h to keep computations manageable
    solutions = []
    for g_coeffs in itertools.product(range(-max_coeff, max_coeff+1), repeat=2):
        for h_coeffs in itertools.product(range(-max_coeff, max_coeff+1), repeat=2):
            # g(x) = g1 x + g0
            g = (g_coeffs[0], g_coeffs[1])  # (leading, constant)
            # h(x) = h1 x + h0
            h = (h_coeffs[0], h_coeffs[1])
            # Polynomial multiplication for degree 1 * 1 = degree 2
            # g(x) * h(x) = (g1 x + g0)(h1 x + h0)
            # = g1 h1 x^2 + (g1 h0 + g0 h1) x + g0 h0
            deg = 2
            coeffs = {
                2: g[0] * h[0],
                1: g[0] * h[1] + g[1] * h[0],
                0: g[1] * h[1]
            }
            # For n=3, attempt to find g,h of degree >=1; in case of degree=2, as polynomial
            # For larger n, we'd need higher degree polynomials and a different approach
            # For simplicity, only degree 1 polynomials here
            # The polynomial product is degree 2, which is less than n=3, so we skip
            continue

# Instead, for degree 1 polynomials and n=3, we can consider g(x) = a1 x + a0, h(x) = b1 x + b0
# their product is degree 2; to get degree n=3, need at least degree 2 polynomials
# Let's generalize to degree 2 polynomials with coefficients from -3 to 3
