[write_program]
The problem appears to involve finding prime numbers \( p \) such that \( p^2 \) equals 3 plus the number formed by concatenating the digits of two primes \( q \) and \( r \). The goal is to enumerate all such primes \( p \) for small prime pairs \( q, r \). 

Since the problem asks for an enumeration approach, the Python program will:
- Generate small prime numbers \( q \) and \( r \).
- Concatenate their digits.
- Add 3.
- Check if the result is a perfect square.
- If it is, check if the square root is prime \( p \).
- Print each such \( p \) immediately when found.

This approach is efficient enough for small primes because the problem is likely designed for small candidates. The code will limit prime candidates to a small range (say up to 50) to keep execution quick.

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def concatenate_digits(a, b):
    return int(str(a) + str(b))

# Generate small primes up to 50
primes = [x for x in range(2, 51) if is_prime(x)]

for q in primes:
    for r in primes:
        concatenated = concatenate_digits(q, r)
        candidate = concatenated + 3
        root = int(candidate ** 0.5)
        if root * root == candidate and is_prime(root):
            print(f"p = {root}, q = {q}, r = {r}, p^2 = {candidate}")
```
