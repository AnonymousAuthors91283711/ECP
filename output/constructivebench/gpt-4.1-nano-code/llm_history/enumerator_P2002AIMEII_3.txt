This problem involves finding natural numbers a, b, c satisfying several conditions:

1. \( a < b < c \)
2. \( b^2 = a c \)
3. There exists \( k \in \mathbb{N} \) with \( b - a = k^2 \)
4. \( \log_b 6 a + \log_b 6 b + \log_b 6 c = 6 \)
5. \( a + b + c = \text{some answer} \) (to be found)

Given the constraints, the key is to explore small values systematically, focusing on the relations:

- Since \( b^2 = a c \), \( a c \) must be a perfect square.
- The difference \( b - a \) is a perfect square.
- The logs sum to 6, which can be rewritten in terms of \( a, b, c \).

Note: Since \( \log_b 6 a = \log_b 6 + \log_b a \), and similarly for \( c \), but the sum is given directly as 6, indicating a relation involving the logs base \( b \).

A practical approach: fix small \( a \), find \( b \) and \( c \) satisfying the relations, especially for small \( a \) and \( k \). For the logarithms, convert to a common base to avoid irrationalities.

Below is a Python script to enumerate small possible valuesâ€”this matches instructions: streaming output, focusing on small parameters, and efficiency.

```python
# Enumerate small values for a, b, c to satisfy the constraints
import math

# Set upper bounds for search
max_a = 50
max_b = 100
max_c = 200

for a in range(1, max_a + 1):
    for k in range(1, int(math.sqrt(max_b)) + 1):
        b = a + k**2
        if b < 1 or b > max_b:
            continue
        # Since b^2 = a * c, c = b^2 / a, must be integer
        if b**2 % a != 0:
            continue
        c = b**2 // a
        if c <= b or c > max_c:
            continue
        # Check the sum condition
        if a + b + c > 150:  # limit sum for efficiency
            continue
        # Check the log condition
        # a, b, c must be > 0
        # log_b 6 a + log_b 6 b + log_b 6 c = 6
        # Equivalent to:
        # log_b (6 a) + log_b (6 b) + log_b (6 c) = 6
        # log_b (6 a) = log_b 6 + log_b a, so sum = 3*log_b 6 + log_b a + log_b b + log_b c
        # But the problem states sum as 6, so:
        # log_b (6 a) + log_b (6 b) + log_b (6 c) == 6
        # We can compute:
        # sum_logs = math.log(6 * a, b) + math.log(6 * b, b) + math.log(6 * c, b)
        # But math.log(x, base) is not available in standard library until Python 3.3
        # Else, convert logs via change of base: log(x) / log(b)
        # For better accuracy, check logs directly:
        try:
            log_b_6a = math.log(6 * a) / math.log(b)
            log_b_6b = math.log(6 * b) / math.log(b)
            log_b_6c = math.log(6 * c) / math.log(b)
        except:
            continue
        total_log = log_b_6a + log_b_6b + log_b_6c
        # Due to floating-point precision, check if close to 6
        if abs(total_log - 6) < 1e-3:
            total = a + b + c
            print(f"a = {a}, b = {b}, c = {c}, sum = {total}")
```

This script systematically searches for candidate triples (a, b, c) meeting the constraints, especially focusing on those with small parameters for tractability, and prints solutions immediately upon discovery, aiding in conjecture formation.
