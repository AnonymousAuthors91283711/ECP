The problem appears to involve examining natural numbers n with certain properties related to their digit representations in base 3, specifically focusing on numbers n where n and n² satisfy a predicate `mild`. The predicate `mild n` indicates that every digit of n in base 3 is **not** 2, since for each digit in the base-3 representation of n, the digit is not 2.

Given the theorem, likely goal:
- Find the count of numbers n between 1 and 1000 (inclusive)
- For which both n and n² satisfy `mild`

To do this efficiently:
- Generate all numbers n from 1 to 1000
- Check if n in base 3 contains digit 2
- Check if n² in base 3 contains digit 2
- Count how many satisfy both

This approach will produce the desired answer streamingly.

```python
def base3_digits(n):
    digits = []
    while n > 0:
        digits.append(n % 3)
        n //=3
    return digits[::-1]  # return most-significant digit first

def is_mild(n):
    # Check if every digit in base 3 is not 2
    for d in base3_digits(n):
        if d == 2:
            return False
    return True

count = 0
for n in range(1, 1001):
    if is_mild(n):
        n_squared = n * n
        if is_mild(n_squared):
            print(n)  # answer candidates
            count += 1
print("Total count:", count)
```
