[write_program]
This problem involves identifying a sequence defined by a recurrence relation or geometric pattern, given some terms and a formula. Estimating \(a_n\) based on the description suggests that the sequence may be geometric, since \(a_n\) appears expressed as \(a_1 \times (a_2 / a_1)^{n-1}\). From \(a_{20}=8\) and \(a_{14}=2^{21}=2097152\), we can try to find the common ratio and a consistent sequence.

Here's the approach:
- Use the geometric sequence formula \(a_n = a_1 \times r^{n-1}\), where \(r = \frac{a_2}{a_1}\).
- Given \(a_{20}\) and \(a_{14}\), find \(r\) and \(a_1\).
- Verify the values and compute \(a_{21}\).

I'll write a Python program to approximate \(a_1\) and \(r\), then compute \(a_{21}\):

```python
# Approximate parameters of the geometric sequence
# Given: a20=8, a14=2^21=2097152
# a_n = a_1 * r^(n-1)
# Hence:
# a20 = a_1 * r^19 = 8
# a14 = a_1 * r^13 = 2097152

# Calculate r from the ratio of the two known terms
r_pow_6 = (2097152) / 8  # r^(13-19) = r^-6, but better to use logs for accuracy
import math

# Find r^6 = a20 / a14
r_pow_6_value = 8 / 2097152  # â‰ˆ 3.8147e-6

# r^6 = 1 / r^(-6)
# Take sixth root to find r
r_estimate = r_pow_6_value ** (1/6)

# Compute a1
a1 = 8 / (r_estimate ** 19)

# Now find a21
a21 = a1 * r_estimate ** 20

# Print the approximate answer
print(f"Estimated a21: {a21}")
```

This code:
- Computes \(r\) approximately by taking the sixth root of the ratio of known terms.
- Derives \(a_1\).
- Calculates \(a_{21}\).

This will help conjecture the value of \(a_{21}\). Since the problem asks for exact solutions and the data appears to fit a geometric sequence, the estimated \(a_{21}\) will be close to an exact value.

```python
import math

# Known values
a20 = 8
a14 = 2 ** 21  # 2097152

# Calculate ratio r^6 between a20 and a14
r_pow_6 = a20 / a14  # 8 / 2097152

# Find r by sixth root
r = r_pow_6 ** (1/6)

# Calculate a1 using a20 = a1 * r^19
a1 = a20 / r ** 19

# Calculate a21 = a1 * r^20
a21 = a1 * r ** 20

# Print the estimated exact value of a21
print(f"{a21}")
```
