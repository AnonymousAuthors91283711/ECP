The problem asks us to determine the difference in probabilities of starting from 0 and eventually reaching 20 versus 15 in a stochastic process, likely a simple random walk on the non-negative integers. Assuming each step increases or decreases position by 1 with equal probability, and considering absorption at zero, the probability of ever reaching a positive position m starting from 0 in such a walk is 1 (for m > 0).

However, if the process is a gambler's ruin with absorbing boundary at 0 and possibly at some upper boundary, the probabilities depend on the boundary conditions. Without explicit boundaries, the classical result for an unbiased random walk starting at 0 is:

- Probability of hitting m > 0 at some time is 1.
- Probability of hitting 0 starting from 0 is 0 unless starting at 0 (which is already at boundary).

Assuming a simple symmetric walk with unlimited upper boundary:

- reach_prob(m) should be 1 for any m > 0, since it's certain to reach m eventually.

Given no further parameters, the difference is 0.

To illustrate, we'll implement a simulation of the walk with small parameters to empirically verify probabilities.

```python
import random

def reach_prob(m, trials=10000):
    """Estimate probability of reaching m starting from 0 in a simple symmetric random walk."""
    successes = 0
    for _ in range(trials):
        position = 0
        while True:
            move = random.choice([-1, 1])
            position += move
            if position == m:
                successes += 1
                break
            elif position < 0:
                # Reflecting boundary at 0
                position = 0
    return successes / trials

# Select small parameters m=15 and m=20
m1, m2 = 15, 20
# Run simulations to estimate probabilities
prob_m1 = reach_prob(m1)
print(f"Estimated probability of reaching {m1} starting from 0: {prob_m1}")

prob_m2 = reach_prob(m2)
print(f"Estimated probability of reaching {m2} starting from 0: {prob_m2}")

# Since asymptotic probability is 1 for unbounded walk, difference should be 0
```
