The problem seems to involve understanding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sequence \( 2002^n + 2 \) for \( n \geq 1 \).  
We want to find the common divisor \( d \) that divides all terms \( 2002^n + 2 \), and among those, find the minimal such \( d \) (or confirm that the GCD over all \( n \) is some specific value).

Because we are to explore the GCD of the sequence, the key steps are:
- Find all divisors of \( 2002^n + 2 \) for small \( n \).
- Focus on small \( n \) to identify common divisors.
- Gather these as potential candidates for the GCD.
- Confirm the minimal such divisor that divides all terms.

Let's pick small \( n \) values (say \( n=1,2,3 \)), compute \( 2002^n + 2 \), and find their divisors.  
Then, find common divisors, and pick the greatest common divisor among them as our candidate answer.

Here's the code:

```python
# Compute gcd of two numbers
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

# Function to find divisors of a number
def divisors(x):
    divs = set()
    i = 1
    while i * i <= x:
        if x % i == 0:
            divs.add(i)
            divs.add(x // i)
        i += 1
    return divs

# Sequence terms for n = 1, 2, 3
n_values = [1, 2, 3]
sequence_terms = [2002 ** n + 2 for n in n_values]

# Find common divisors
common_divs = divisors(sequence_terms[0])
for term in sequence_terms[1:]:
    common_divs = common_divs.intersection(divisors(term))
    if not common_divs:
        break

# Largest common divisor candidate
answer = max(common_divs) if common_divs else 1
print(f"Candidate GCD of sequence for small n: {answer}")

# Verify for larger n to confirm
for n in range(4, 10):
    val = 2002 ** n + 2
    if val % answer != 0:
        # Found a counterexample where answer doesn't divide all
        candidate = gcd(answer, val)
        print(f"Adjusting GCD with n={n}: gcd({answer}, {val}) = {candidate}")
        answer = candidate

print(f"Final answer: {answer}")
```

This code enumerates possible divisors for initial terms, finds their intersection, and refines the GCD to confirm the minimal universal divisor across small \( n \).  
It helps in conjecturing the true GCD of the entire sequence \( 2002^n + 2 \) for all \( n \geq 1 \).
