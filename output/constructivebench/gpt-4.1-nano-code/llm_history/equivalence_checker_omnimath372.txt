abbrev omnimath372_answer : ℕ × ℕ × ℕ → Bool := sorry
theorem omnimath372 (v e f : ℕ) : 
  (v - e + f = 2) ↔ omnimath372_answer (v, e, f) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun (v, e, f) => v - e + f = 2
Proposed Answer:  
  fun ⟨v, e, f⟩ => v - e + f = 2
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer and ground truth answer are equivalent. Both define a function that takes a triple of natural numbers (v, e, f) and returns whether v - e + f equals 2. The only difference is syntactic:
1. The ground truth uses (v, e, f) as the parameter pattern
2. The proposed answer uses ⟨v, e, f⟩ (angle brackets) which is Lean's notation for destructuring a tuple
Both versions will behave identically when applied to a triple of natural numbers.
