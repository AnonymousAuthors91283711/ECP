This is a theorem involving a sum over a sequence, with the sequence terms related via a ratio. To approach this, I will assume that the sequence {a(n)} exhibits a telescoping property such that the sum simplifies significantly. I'll code a Python script to numerically approximate and identify the pattern or the exact sum by assuming a potential form for a(n). Since the problem says "enumerate possible answers" and involves a sum of ratios, a common approach is to consider simple functions for a(n), e.g., linear or geometric, to test candidates.

I'll choose small sample values, attempt to evaluate the sum numerically with assumptions, and look for patterns or approximate the sum to suggest an exact value.

```python
# Enumerate possible simple sequences for a(n) and compute the sum
# For instance, assume a(n) = C * r^n (geometric sequence), or constant
# We test with a simple geometric ratio and compute the sum of ratios

import math

def test_sequence(r):
    # Assume a(n) = r^n for simplicity
    total = 0.0
    for k in range(2000):  # limiting to avoid long computation
        numerator = r ** (k + 4)
        denominator = r ** (k + 5)
        # Simplify the ratio: r^{k+4} / r^{k+5} = r^(-1)
        ratio = numerator / denominator
        total += ratio
    return total

# Test different r values to see if sum stabilizes around a simple number
for r in [1, 0.5, 2, -1]:
    sum_value = test_sequence(r)
    print(f"r = {r}, sum ≈ {sum_value}")

# Because the ratio a(k+4)/a(k+5) simplifies to 1/r, the sum over k=0 to N of 1/r is (N+1)/r
# For large N=2000, the sum ≈ 2001 / r
# Hence, the sum depends on r; this suggests the original sequence might be geometric

# Let's compute the sum for some specific r values
for r in [1, 0.5, 2]:
    sum_estimate = (2000) / r
    print(f"Estimated sum for a geometric sequence with ratio {r}: {sum_estimate}")

# Since the sum is over many terms, the exact sum in this model is (number of terms) / r
# If the problem context suggests a telescoping sum, and considering the ratios, the sum could be a finite value or infinite

# Now, suppose the sequence is constant a(n)=A, then a(k+4)/a(k+5)=1, sum over 2019 terms = 2019
# Let's test that: sum ≈ 2019

print("If a(n) is constant, sum ≈ 2019")
```
