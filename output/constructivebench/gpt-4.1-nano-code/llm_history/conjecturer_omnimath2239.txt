. Enumerated answers: Unique candidate values for x: []. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern of the given equalities suggests symmetry and specific relations among a, b, c, leading to calculating x. Based on the structure, the value of x appears to combine the constants involved in the equations, notably 20 and 14, and the symmetry implies adding these constants to form 34, with previous similar problems indicating the final x. The answer should be a symmetric function involving these constants, and given the pattern, x likely equals 34.

<<<34>>>
