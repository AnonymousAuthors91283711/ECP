This problem involves identifying the set of real numbers \(a\) that satisfy certain trigonometric conditions involving parameters \(x, y\). The given equations relate \(\sin x, \cos x, \sin y, \cos y\) with the parameter \(a\):

\[
\begin{cases}
\sin^2 x + \cos^2 y = \frac{3}{2} a \\
\cos^2 x + \sin^2 y = \frac{1}{2} a^2
\end{cases}
\]

Given the unit circle constraints \(\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1\), we aim to find all \(a\) for which there exist \(x, y\) satisfying these equations.

We will choose sample values \(a\) within a reasonable range and check if the equations can be satisfied by some \(x, y\). Since the equations involve \(\sin^2\) and \(\cos^2\), the variables are in \([0, \pi/2]\) for simplicity, and we can use a grid search with small steps to find potential solutions.

Here's the Python code to perform this enumeration, testing \(a\) over a small range and looking for solvable pairs \((x, y)\):

```python
import numpy as np

# Define the range for 'a'
a_values = np.linspace(-2, 3, 100)  # sample from -2 to 3
found_as = []

# Tolerance for checking equations
tolerance = 1e-4

for a in a_values:
    # For each 'a', try to find x, y satisfying the equations
    # Use a grid search over x, y in [0, pi/2]
    for x_deg in np.linspace(0, 90, 20):  # degrees for clarity
        x = np.radians(x_deg)
        sin_x2 = np.sin(x) ** 2
        cos_x2 = np.cos(x) ** 2
        # For each y
        for y_deg in np.linspace(0, 90, 20):
            y = np.radians(y_deg)
            sin_y2 = np.sin(y) ** 2
            cos_y2 = np.cos(y) ** 2
            # Check equations
            eq1 = sin_x2 + cos_y2
            eq2 = cos_x2 + sin_y2
            if abs(eq1 - 1.5 * a) < tolerance and abs(eq2 - 0.5 * a ** 2) < tolerance:
                if a not in found_as:
                    print(f"a = {a:.3f} satisfies with x = {x_deg:.1f}°, y = {y_deg:.1f}°")
                found_as.append(a)
                break
        else:
            continue
        break

# Print all found 'a' values
print("Potential solutions for a include:", sorted(set(found_as)))
```

This enumeration searches for \(a\) over [-2, 3], comparing the equations at sampled \(x, y\). It reports any \(a\) exhibiting solutions within a small tolerance, streaming each candidate as soon as found, aiding in conjecturing the set of feasible \(a\).
