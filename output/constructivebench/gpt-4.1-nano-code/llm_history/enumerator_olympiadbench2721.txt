The problem involves given relationships between parameters and an unknown answer, aiming to satisfy the equation:

tickets + answer + arrests = 20 * warnings

Given:
warnings = T + 2
tickets = 20
arrests = T + 5

We need to find all possible values of `olympiadbench2721_answer` that satisfy the equation for small values of T. Since T is a non-negative integer, we can iterate T over a small range (e.g., 0 to 50) to find solutions.

Here's the Python code to enumerate candidate answers:

```python
# Enumerate values of T in a small range to find possible answers satisfying the equation
for T in range(0, 50):
    warnings = T + 2
    tickets = 20
    arrests = T + 5
    total_warnings = 20 * warnings
    answer = total_warnings - tickets - arrests
    print(f"T={T}, warnings={warnings}, tickets={tickets}, arrests={arrests}, answer={answer}")
```
