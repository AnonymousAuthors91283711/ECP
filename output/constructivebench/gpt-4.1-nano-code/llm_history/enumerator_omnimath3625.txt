The problem involves the integer equation m^5 - n^5 = 16 * m * n, and we want to find all solutions (m, n). To handle this computationally, we can examine small ranges of m and n (e.g., from -20 to 20) and check which satisfy the equation. This approach helps us understand the solution set, identify potential patterns, and conjecture the full set.

```python
# Enumerate small integer pairs (m, n) to find solutions to m^5 - n^5 = 16 * m * n
# Highly unlikely that large values satisfy the equation for small ranges, so limit to -20..20

def check_solutions():
    for m in range(-20, 21):
        for n in range(-20, 21):
            lhs = m**5 - n**5
            rhs = 16 * m * n
            if lhs == rhs:
                print(f"Solution: m={m}, n={n}")

check_solutions()
```
