abbrev omnimath200_answer : Set (ℤ × ℤ) := sorry
theorem omnimath200 (m n : ℤ) (hm : m ≠ 0) (hn : n ≠ 0) :
    (m^2 + n) * (m + n^2) = (m - n)^3 ↔ (m, n) ∈ omnimath200_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Solution found: m=-1, n=-1
Solution found: m=8, n=-10
Solution found: m=9, n=-6. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℤ × ℤ)
All solutions satisfy the integer equations with specific pairs. The known solutions show a pattern where solutions lie along two families related by quadratic and cubic identities involving m and n. The pairs mirror the roots of the polynomial identities. The set includes pairs where m and n are related by quadratic forms, particularly solutions (-1, -1), (8, -10), and (9, -6). These satisfy the polynomial identities. The pattern suggests defining the set via all integer pairs (m, n) satisfying `(m + 1)^2 = n`.
