The problem appears to involve finding the greatest value of an expression \( c \times a^b - d \) where \( a, b, c, d \) are chosen from the set \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), with the additional constraint that \( a, b, c, d \) are distinct and collectively form the set \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\). 

To find the greatest possible value, we need to consider all permutations of \(\{0,1,2,3\}\) assigned to \(a, b, c, d\), then evaluate \( c \times a^b - d \) for each permutation, and track the maximum obtained value. We omit repetitions and ensure immediate output upon discovery of each candidate. The smallest sample space is manageable with brute force due to only 24 permutations (4!). 

Here's the Python code implementing this reasoning:

```python
import itertools

# Set of elements to assign to a, b, c, d
elements = [0, 1, 2, 3]
max_value = None

for perm in itertools.permutations(elements):
    a, b, c, d = perm
    val = c * (a ** b) - d
    print(f"Trying a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d} => {val}")
    if (max_value is None) or (val > max_value):
        max_value = val
        print(f"New maximum found: {max_value} with a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}")
```
