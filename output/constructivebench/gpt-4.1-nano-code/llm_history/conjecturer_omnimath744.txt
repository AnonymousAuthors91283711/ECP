The pattern suggests the total distance forms a geometric series with initial value 5, ratio 2/3, and total iterations t=12. The sum is: total_distance = initial_value / (1 - ratio) * (ω * t / (2 * π)). Simplifies to 5 / (1 - 2/3) * (π/6 * 12 / (2π)) = 15 * (12/12) = 15 * 1 = 15. But considering the calculation, the total sum instead matches the derived formula, so the total distance simplifies to 2 * π * (r0 / (1 - ratio)) * (ω * t / (2 * π)). With substitution: 2 * π * (5 / (1 - 2/3)) * ((π/6) * 12 / (2π)) = 2 * π * 15 * (12/ (12)) * (1/6) = 2 * π * 15 * (1/6) = 2 * π * 2.5 = 5π. Therefore:
<<<5 * π>>>
