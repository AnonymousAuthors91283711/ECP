noncomputable abbrev mathodyssey81_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem mathodyssey81 :
  let S := {x : ℝ | ∃ a b, 1 ≤ a ∧ a ≤ b ∧ b ≤ 2 ∧ x = 3/a + b}
  sSup S + sInf S = mathodyssey81_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Max candidate: a=1, b=2, x=5.0
Min candidate: a=2, b=2, x=3.5
a=1, b=1, x=4.0
a=1, b=2, x=5.0
a=1.5, b=1.5, x=3.5
a=1.5, b=2, x=4.0
a=2, b=2, x=3.5
a=2, b=2, x=3.5
Sum of extremal bounds: 8.5. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The supremum occurs at (a=1, b=2), giving x=3/1+2=5, and infimum at (a=2, b=2), giving x=3/2+2=3.5. The sum is 5+3.5=8.5. 

Therefore, the answer is a constant: 

<<<8.5>>>
