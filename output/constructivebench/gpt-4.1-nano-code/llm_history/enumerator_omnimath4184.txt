[write_program]
This problem defines a set of functions with recursive properties involving three variables (p, q, r). It resembles a recursive relation similar to a multidimensional difference equation, with base case conditions when any argument is zero and a recursive step involving neighboring points when all are positive.

Given the structure, the goal is to enumerate functions \(f:\mathbb{N}^3 \to \mathbb{R}\) satisfying these relations, especially focusing on behavior when any of p, q, r is zero, and the recursive relation when all are positive.

To generate possible functions, we can:
- For cases where any argument is zero, set \(f(p, q, r) = 0\).
- For positive arguments, the value depends recursively on neighboring points.

Due to the recursive nature and symmetry, and to illustrate possible solutions, we'll implement a small enumeration for some initial values, particularly for small p, q, r, using a dynamic programming (bottom-up) approach while fixing some parameters for simplicity.

Here's a Python program that:
- Fixes small p, q, r (like 0 to 2).
- Uses the relation to compute possible functions over these points.
- Prints the results as they are computed.

```python
# Enumerate functions over small grid with recursive relations
# Assume f(p,q,r) = 0 when any argument is zero (base case)
# For positive p,q,r, recursively define values based on neighbors

max_val = 3  # limit to p,q,r values for enumeration
f_values = {}

# Initialize base cases: if any argument is zero, f=0
for p in range(max_val):
    for q in range(max_val):
        for r in range(max_val):
            if p == 0 or q == 0 or r == 0:
                f_values[(p, q, r)] = 0.0

# Compute recursively for p,q,r > 0
for p in range(1, max_val):
    for q in range(1, max_val):
        for r in range(1, max_val):
            # Compute neighbors
            sum_neighbors = (
                f_values[(p+1 if p+1 < max_val else p, q-1, r)]
                + f_values[(p-1, q+1 if q+1 < max_val else q, r)]
                + f_values[(p-1, q, r+1 if r+1 < max_val else r)]
                + f_values[(p+1 if p+1 < max_val else p, q, r-1)]
                + f_values[(p, q+1 if q+1 < max_val else q, r-1)]
                + f_values[(p, q-1, r+1 if r+1 < max_val else r)]
            )
            # Apply the recursive relation
            f_values[(p, q, r)] = 1 + (1/6) * sum_neighbors

            # Print each computed value immediately
            print(f"f({p},{q},{r}) = {f_values[(p, q, r)]}")
```
