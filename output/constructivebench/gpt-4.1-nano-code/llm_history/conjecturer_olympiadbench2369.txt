theorem olympiadbench2369 :
  ∃! (gh : ℕ × ℕ), 19 * gh.1 + 17 * gh.2 = 201 ∧ gh.1 > 0 ∧ gh.2 > 0 ∧ olympiadbench2369_answer = gh := by sorry. Enumerated answers: (7, 4). Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ
The solution involves positive integers (x, y) satisfying 19x + 17y = 201. Using linear Diophantine equations, the pattern indicates a parametric form: 

x = 4 + 17t, y = 3 - 19t, with positivity constraints leading to t=0. 

Therefore, the unique positive integral solution is (7, 4). So, the answer in Lean is:

<<<(7, 4)>>>
