This problem involves solving a system of equations and then computing a specific expression. The equations are:

1. \( x \times y = 6 \)
2. \( x - z = 2 \) âž” \( z = x - 2 \)
3. \( x + y + z = 9 \)

Substituting \( z = x - 2 \) into the third equation:
\[
x + y + (x - 2) = 9 \implies 2x + y = 11 \implies y = 11 - 2x
\]

From the first equation:
\[
xy = 6 \implies x(11 - 2x) = 6
\]
which expands to:
\[
11x - 2x^2 = 6
\]
or rearranged:
\[
2x^2 - 11x + 6 = 0
\]

This quadratic can be solved for \(x\):
\[
x = \frac{11 \pm \sqrt{(-11)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times 6}}{2 \times 2} = \frac{11 \pm \sqrt{121 - 48}}{4} = \frac{11 \pm \sqrt{73}}{4}
\]

For each solution of \(x\), compute \( y \) and \( z \) then evaluate the expression:
\[
\frac{x}{y} - \frac{z}{x} - \frac{z^2}{xy}
\]

Let's implement this in Python to enumerate the solutions.

```python
import math

# Calculate both roots for x
discriminant = 73
sqrt_discriminant = math.sqrt(discriminant)

x_candidates = [
    (11 + sqrt_discriminant) / 4,
    (11 - sqrt_discriminant) / 4
]

for x in x_candidates:
    y = 11 - 2 * x
    z = x - 2
    # Compute the expression
    result = x / y - z / x - (z ** 2) / (x * y)
    print(f"x: {x}, y: {y}, z: {z}, expression: {result}")
```
