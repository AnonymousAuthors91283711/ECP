This problem seems to involve parameters total_doctors and total_nurses with constraints total_doctors = 6 and total_nurses = 4, then defining variables d = total_doctors - 1 and n = total_nurses - 1, and computing d * n.

Given the constraints:
- total_doctors = 6
- total_nurses = 4

then:
- d = 6 - 1 = 5
- n = 4 - 1 = 3

the product d * n = 5 * 3 = 15.

The problem asks to produce the answer, not hardcoded, and to enumerate plausible answers, which in this specific case seems straightforward.

Here's a Python program that:
- Sets total_doctors and total_nurses to the values used.
- Calculates d and n as per the problem.
- Prints the product, streaming the result.

```python
# Enumerate possible values based on the problem constraints
# total_doctors = 6, total_nurses = 4

total_doctors = 6
total_nurses = 4

# Define d and n based on the problem
d = total_doctors - 1
n = total_nurses - 1

# Compute the answer
answer = d * n

# Stream the answer directly
print(answer)
```
