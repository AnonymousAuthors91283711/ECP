Ground Truth Answer: 2014 / 2015
Proposed Answer: 2014 + 2015/2016
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the greatest real number x in the set where:
   - x is between k and k+1 for some natural number k
   - floor(x)/x = 2015/2016

2. The ground truth answer suggests that omnimath2390_answer = 2014/2015, meaning the solution would be 2015 + 2014/2015.

3. The proposed answer suggests omnimath2390_answer = 2014 + 2015/2016, which would make the solution 2015 + (2014 + 2015/2016) = 4029 + 2015/2016.

The proposed answer is clearly much larger than what would make sense for this problem (it's over 4000 when we'd expect something around 2015). The structure of the proposed answer also doesn't match the expected form where omnimath2390_answer should be a fractional part between 0 and 1.
