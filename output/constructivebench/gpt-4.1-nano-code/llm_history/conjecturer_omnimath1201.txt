Given the symmetry and constraints, the maximum of the minimum product occurs when the triple (a, b, c) is symmetric. Solving yields a = b = c = 10/3, leading to a minimal pairwise product of (10/3)^2 = 100/9 ≈ 11.11. The minimal product maximized under the constraints is 100/9.

<<<(100/9 : ℝ)>>>

This is the maximum minimal product satisfying the problem’s conditions.
