This problem involves finding all three-digit numbers where each digit is from 1 to 7, and at least one of the following divisibility conditions holds: the number is divisible by 7, or a certain rearranged permutation of its digits is divisible by 7. To aid in conjecturing and verifying, we'll enumerate all such numbers, print each when found, and then determine the total count.

Approach:
- Loop over all three-digit numbers from 100 to 999.
- Check if each digit is in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} (implied by `isGoodNumber`).
- Verify the three divisibility conditions.
- Count and print each such number.

The code is efficient: it avoids unnecessary computations and explicitly enumerates candidates.

```python
# Enumerate three-digit numbers where each digit is in {1..7}
# and at least one of the divisibility conditions holds.
# Prints each qualifying number and returns the total count.

def is_good_number(n):
    d1 = (n // 100) % 10
    d2 = (n // 10) % 10
    d3 = n % 10
    digits = [d1, d2, d3]
    # Check digit constraints
    if not all(1 <= d <= 7 for d in digits):
        return False
    # Conditions for divisibility
    condition1 = (n % 7 == 0)
    perm_num1 = (d3 * 10 + d1) * 10 + d2  # rearranged: last, first, second
    condition2 = (perm_num1 % 7 == 0)
    perm_num2 = (d3 * 100 + d2 * 10 + d1)  # last, second, first
    condition3 = (perm_num2 % 7 == 0)
    return condition1 or condition2 or condition3

found_numbers = []
for n in range(100, 1000):
    if is_good_number(n):
        print(n)
        found_numbers.append(n)

print(f"Total count: {len(found_numbers)}")
```
