The problem involves summing over a large range \( [0, 2^{2014}) \) with the expression \(k^{(k/2)}\). Handling such a huge range computationally for exact sums is infeasible, so we should analyze the pattern for smaller values and look for simplifications or symmetries.

Observations:
- For \(k\) even, \(k/2\) is an integer.
- For \(k\) odd, \(k/2\) is not an integer; likely the expression considers integer division \(k/2\).
- Since we're using natural numbers, the division probably refers to floor division.

Examining small cases:
- \(k=0\): sum term is \(0^{0/2} = 0^0\), conventionally \(1\).
- \(k=1\): \(1^{1//2} = 1^0 =1\).
- \(k=2\): \(2^{2//2} = 2^{1} = 2\).
- \(k=3\): \(3^{3//2} = 3^{1} = 3\).
- \(k=4\): \(4^{4//2} = 4^{2} = 16\).

Summing these small cases:
- sum for 0 to 3: \(1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 7\).
- sum for 0 to 4: previous sum + 16 = 23.

Pattern:
- For even \(k\), \(k^{k//2}\) is a perfect power.
- The sequence suggests summing over all \(k\), with the specific term depending on \(k//2\).

Given the enormous upper bound, it's impractical to compute directly. We can deduce the sum's structure based on parity:
- Sum over even \(k\): \(\sum_{k \text{ even}} k^{k//2}\).
- Sum over odd \(k\): \(\sum_{k \text{ odd}} k^{k//2}\).

But no simple closed form appears. Instead, we can choose small \(n\) to illustrate the pattern, then generalize.

Here's the code that sums for small ranges values up to a certain threshold:

```python
# Enumerate the sum for small n to observe pattern
for n in range(1, 20):
    total = 0
    for k in range(n):
        total += k ** (k // 2)
    print(f"Sum up to {n-1}: {total}")
# Based on small observations, the sum can grow rapidly. 
# For the actual large problem, the sum might be too large for direct calculation.
# Since the problem hints at a formal proof or pattern, we acknowledge this growth.
```

Given the scope:
- For general large \(2^{2014}\), enumerating isn't feasible.
- The problem likely expects recognizing the pattern or properties, not direct computation.

Thus, for the final answer, we return a symbolic placeholder noting the impracticality of exact computation at this scale, and hint at the pattern observed:

```python
# Since exact sum over 2^2014 terms is computationally infeasible,
# and no closed form is evident, the exact answer remains symbolic.
# The sum approximately grows rapidly based on the pattern for small values.
# We only demonstrate the pattern for small n.

for n in range(1, 20):
    total = 0
    for k in range(n):
        total += k ** (k // 2)
    print(f"Sum up to {n-1}: {total}")
# The actual sum for 0 to 2^2013 would be astronomically large and cannot be explicitly computed here.
# This program illustrates the approach and growth pattern.
```
