This problem involves enumerating pairs of coprime natural numbers (a, b) that satisfy certain ratios derived from combinatorial counts involving the number 2020. Specifically, it references combinatorial counts like total triplets and isosceles triplets among 2020 elements, and ratios involving their gcds.

Once simplified, the core of the problem is to find coprime pairs (a, b) such that:

- a = (number of isosceles triplets) / gcd(isosceles, total)
- b = total / gcd(isosceles, total)

Where:

- total = n * (n-1) * (n-2) / 6
- isosceles = n * (n-1)

with n=2020.

The plan:

- Compute total and isosceles.
- Find gcd of isosceles and total.
- Reduce both by gcd to get coprime pairs (a, b).
- Since gcd divides both, the pair (a, b) is the reduced form.

This should yield a single candidate pair because these are derived directly from counts involving n=2020, which is fixed in the problem, but since the instructions ask for enumeration, we'll verify the pair and output the simplified values.

Here's a straightforward Python implementation:

```python
import math

# Given n
n = 2020

# Compute total number of triplets (combinations of 3)
total = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6

# Compute number of isosceles triplets (approximated as n*(n-1))
isosceles = n * (n - 1)

# Calculate gcd of isosceles and total
g = math.gcd(isosceles, total)

# Reduce to coprime pair (a, b)
a = isosceles // g
b = total // g

# Print the results
print(f"Candidate answer: a = {a}, b = {b}")

# The answer matches the reduced ratio of isosceles to total
print(f"Answer: (a, b) = ({a}, {b})")
```

This code computes and outputs the simplified coprime pair (a, b). It follows the instructions to calculate the ratios based on the given fixed parameters.
