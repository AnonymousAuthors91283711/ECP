This problem involves modeling a scenario with roses and carnations of different colors, calculating the total number of carnations based on the given proportions. To approach it programmatically, we'll:

- Define the total number of flowers (`total`)
- Compute the number of pink flowers, red flowers
- Divide pink into roses and carnations
- Divide red into carnations
- Calculate total carnations

We'll avoid hardcoding the answer; instead, we'll compute and print each intermediate step, focusing on the exact values, and finally produce the total carnations.

Here's the Python code for enumerating and computing this:

```python
# Given total number of flowers
total = 100

# Number of pink flowers
pink = 6/10 * total  # 60% of total
print(f'Pink flowers: {pink}')

# Number of red flowers
red = total - pink
print(f'Red flowers: {red}')

# Pink roses (1/3 of pink)
pink_roses = (1/3) * pink
print(f'Pink roses: {pink_roses}')

# Pink carnations (remaining pink flowers)
pink_carnations = pink - pink_roses
print(f'Pink carnations: {pink_carnations}')

# Red carnations (3/4 of red)
red_carnations = (3/4) * red
print(f'Red carnations: {red_carnations}')

# Total carnations
total_carnations = pink_carnations + red_carnations
print(f'Total carnations: {total_carnations}')
```
