The provided theorem involves a function \( GEB \) with specific properties, including monotonicity and differences that satisfy certain conditions. To help in conjecturing the value of \( GEB(100) \), I'll focus on constructing a plausible \( GEB \) function that satisfies the given properties and then enumerate possible values at \( n=100 \) accordingly.

Key observations:
- \( GEB(0) = 1 \)
- \( GEB \) is strictly increasing.
- \( diff(n) = GEB(n+1) - GEB(n) \)
- \( diff \) is strictly increasing.
- The set of positive integers not in the range of \( GEB \) corresponds exactly to the values of \( diff \).

A simple function satisfying these conditions can be built using known sequences like the Fibonacci numbers or similar, but given the constraints, I'll generate candidates where:
- \( GEB(n) \) = sum of differences up to \( n-1 \).
- \( diff(n) \) are strictly increasing positive integers, starting from at least 1.

I'll choose small differences (like 1, 2, 3, ...) and compute \( GEB(100) \), enumerating possible \( GEB(100) \) values.

```python
# Enumerate possible values of GEB(100) based on small increasing difference sequences
# Differences start from 1 and increase strictly, representing the gaps.
# For simplicity, consider difference sequences of the form: diff(n) = n+1 for n in [0, 99].
# Sum of first n differences: sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (k+1) = n(n+1)/2.
# So GEB(n) = 1 + sum_{k=0}^{n-1} diff(k) = 1 + n(n+1)/2.

# For n=100:
n = 100
# sum of first n-1 differences:
sum_diff = (n - 1) * n // 2  # sum of 1 through n-1
geb_100 = 1 + sum_diff

print("GEB(100) with differences diff(n)=n+1:", geb_100)

# Now, variations:
# For example, using diff(n) = n + c where c â‰¥ 0, where c is an integer offset
# sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (k + c + 1) = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (k + c + 1)
# = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k + sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (c+1)
# = (n-1)n/2 + n(c+1)

for c in range(0, 3):  # small offsets for diversity
    sum_diff_c = (n - 1) * n // 2 + n * (c + 1)
    geb_value = 1 + sum_diff_c
    print(f"For diff(n) = n + {c}, GEB(100): {geb_value}")
```
