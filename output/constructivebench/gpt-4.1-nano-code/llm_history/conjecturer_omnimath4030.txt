The problem asks for the set of positive integers n for which there exists a function x : Fin n → ℤ, all strictly positive, satisfying a sum condition. 

Observing the pattern in the enumerated solutions, for small n, the solutions require n=1 (trivially), and for n ≥ 2, the set involves n. Since the sum involves powers of 2 and reciprocals of squares, n=1 always works with appropriate x, while for n≥2, no such x satisfy the equation (since sum exceeds 1 for larger n).

Thus, the answer is: only n=1.
