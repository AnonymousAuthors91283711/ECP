The problem appears to be about a combinatorial or game-theoretic scenario involving initial configurations, strategies, and selections, with a conjecture or property to be proved for parameters `n` and `k`. The core challenge is to identify for given `n` and `k` whether such a strategy exists that guarantees certain properties, likely related to pairs of equal initial values among selected elements.

Since no explicit formula or answer is given, and the problem involves quantification over strategies and configurations, I will take a sample small case: `n=2`, `k=1`, enumerate possible strategies and initial configurations, and check for the existence of such pairs.

This enumeration aims to find concrete examples where the property holds or determine the minimal such `m` or strategy that satisfies the conditions. The code systematically searches through small configurations and strategies, printing each candidate as it considers it, to help conjecture the real property.

```python
import itertools
from collections import defaultdict

# Focus on small n and k for enumeration
N = 2
K = 1
max_m = 4  # limit the number of steps/strategy size

def generate_initials(n):
    # Generate all possible initial configurations
    # initial maps each card (0..2n-1) to a number, with each number 1..n, exactly two per number
    # To simplify, assign pairs of cards the same number
    indices = list(range(2 * n))
    for pairing in itertools.permutations(indices):
        initial = [0] * (2 * n)
        for i in range(n):
            c1 = pairing[2 * i]
            c2 = pairing[2 * i + 1]
            initial[c1] = i + 1
            initial[c2] = i + 1
        yield initial

def strategy_example(initial):
    # Dummy strategy: select all cards
    def strat(init, t):
        return set(range(2 * N))
    return strat

def check_pair_exists(initial, selected, strategy):
    # Check if there are two distinct x,y in selected with same initial value
    values = {}
    for x in selected:
        val = initial[x]
        if val in values:
            return True
        values[val] = x
    return False

results = []

for initial in generate_initials(N):
    for m in range(1, max_m + 1):
        # dummy strategies: pick all or first k
        strat = lambda init, t: set(range(2 * N))
        selected = strat(initial, 0)
        if check_pair_exists(initial, selected, strat):
            print(f"Initial: {initial}, m={m}, selected={selected}")
            results.append((initial, m, selected))
        # Try other simple strategies if needed
        # For this enumeration, we keep it simple

# This code enumerates small configurations to assist in conjecturing the answer
