theorem omnimath3796 :
  {p : ℕ | Nat.Prime p ∧ ∃!a : ZMod p, (a : ZMod p)^3 - 3*(a : ZMod p) + 1 = 0} = omnimath3796_answer :=

. Enumerated answers: Prime p=3 with solution a=2
Primes with exactly one solution: [3]. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The only prime p with a unique solution to a^3 - 3a + 1 = 0 mod p is 3, where a=2. In general, the only such prime is 3, and the solution is a=2. Thus, the answer set contains only the prime 3.
