theorem omnimath1312 :
  Finset.sum (Finset.filter (fun n => 1 ≤ n ∧ n ≤ 10000 ∧ (List.sum (digits 10 n) = 2)) (Finset.range 10001)) (fun x => x^2) = omnimath1312_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 11

Sum of squares: 7294927. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests the answer involves numbers with digit sum 2, which include 11, 20, 101, 110, 200, 1001, 1010, 1100, 2000.  
Their squares sum to 7294927, indicating a form like 10^{k} + 1 or 10^{k} + 10, 10^{k+1}, etc., with the overall sum pattern resembling 2000 or 20000 factors.  
Given the sum value and pattern, the most likely closed-form answer is 2000, corresponding to the sum of the squares of numbers with digit sum 2 up to 10000.  

Thus, the final answer is:  

<<<2000>>>
