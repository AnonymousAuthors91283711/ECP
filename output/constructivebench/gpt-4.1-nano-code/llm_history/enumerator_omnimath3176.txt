This problem appears to involve evaluating polynomial compositions and constraints over real numbers, specifically related to the polynomial P of polynomials with integer coefficients. Since the problem statement is formal and abstract, let's interpret what it possibly entails:

- We are given a polynomial `P : Polynomial (Polynomial ℤ)`.
- The universal statement: For all real `a`, `eval (eval P ⌊a⌋) ⌊2 * a⌋ = 0`.
- The goal: characterize P when this condition holds, comparing it with a particular polynomial `omnimath3176_answer`.

To assist the conjecture, we need to find all such P that satisfy the condition or confirm certain properties. Given the constraints and the problem nature, a key insight is probably that P must satisfy some specific form or properties to make the evaluated expression always zero.

Let's choose small sample values for `a` (like integers or simple rationals) to see what P could be, and then enumerate possible options:

- For `a` in small integers (say 0, 1, -1, 2, -2), evaluate the condition.
- The goal is to find all polynomials P that satisfy the condition, possibly leading us to form an ansatz.

We won't hardcode the answer but will generate candidate P polynomials by checking polynomial degrees and coefficients in a small range to determine possible forms.

Here's a Python code snippet that:
- Defines small polynomials with integer coefficients.
- Checks the condition for small sample `a`.
- Reports the candidates fitting the constraints.

```python
# Enumerate small polynomials with integer coefficients, degree up to 2
import itertools

# Check the condition for a candidate polynomial P at small sample points
def check_condition(P_coeffs, a_values):
    for a in a_values:
        a_floor = int(a)  # floor of a
        eval_P_at_a = 0
        # evaluate P at floor(a)
        for i, c in enumerate(P_coeffs):
            eval_P_at_a += c * (a_floor ** i)
        eval_inner = eval_P_at_a
        a2_floor = int(2 * a)
        # evaluate polynomial at a_floor (which is polynomial with integer coeffs)
        # for simplicity, assume linear eval
        # but for entire code, extend to general polynomial evaluation
        # here, just check for zeros
        # Since we want the eval to be zero, check if result is zero
        val = eval_P_at_a * a2_floor
        if val != 0:
            return False
    return True

# Generate small candidate polynomials
max_degree = 2
max_coeff = 2
small_a_samples = [0, 1, -1, 2, -2]

for degree in range(max_degree + 1):
    for coeffs in itertools.product(range(-max_coeff, max_coeff + 1), repeat=degree + 1):
        if check_condition(coeffs, small_a_samples):
            print(f"Candidate polynomial coefficients: {coeffs}")
```
