  p = ∑' (n : ℕ), (9/10)^n * (1/10) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Exact sum calculated analytically: 1.0000000000000002
Partial sum at N=87: 0.9999059538913021 (approaching 1)
Approximate sum at N=10000: 1.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ≥0∞
The series ∑_{n=0}^∞ (9/10)^n * (1/10) is a geometric series with ratio r=9/10<1 and first term a=1/10, summing to a/(1−r)= (1/10)/(1/10)=1.  

Final answer, in closed-form:

<<<1>>>

This sum converges to 1 in ℝ≥0∞.
