Based on the recursion, sequence sums, and constraints, the minimal common value N at step 6 occurs when starting with minimal initial values satisfying the inequality a₁ < b₁ and the Fibonacci-like recurrence. Setting the minimal initial conditions leads to N = 0, as the minimal initial values are both 0, with a₁ < b₁ implies a₁ = 0, b₁ = 1, resulting in N=0 for both sequences at step 6.
