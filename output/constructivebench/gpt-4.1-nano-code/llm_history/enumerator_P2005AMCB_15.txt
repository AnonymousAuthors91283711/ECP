This problem asks us to verify that there are no four two-digit numbers (a, b, c, d), each with digits from 1 to 9 (no zeros), summing to 221, with all digits distinct across all four numbers. Each digit is from 1-9, total digits 8, summing to 221, and digits must be pairwise distinct.

Approach:
- Generate all 4 pairs of digits (a, b, c, d) with digits 1-9 (no zeros).
- For each candidate, check if their combined digits sum to 221.
- Verify all digits are unique across all four numbers.
- Output each valid candidate's digits immediately.

Given the potential size is not too large (digits 1-9, 4 numbers, each 2 digits), brute-force enumeration will be efficient enough.

```python
# Generate all 2-digit numbers with digits 1-9 (no zeros)
two_digit_numbers = [(tens * 10 + ones) for tens in range(1, 10) for ones in range(1, 10)]

# Enumerate all quadruples (a, b, c, d)
for a in two_digit_numbers:
    for b in two_digit_numbers:
        for c in two_digit_numbers:
            for d in two_digit_numbers:
                # Check sum of digits equals 221
                total_sum = sum([a // 10, a % 10, b // 10, b % 10, c // 10, c % 10, d // 10, d % 10])
                if total_sum == 221:
                    # Check all digits are distinct across a, b, c, d
                    digits = [a // 10, a % 10, b // 10, b % 10, c // 10, c % 10, d // 10, d % 10]
                    if len(set(digits)) == 8:
                        print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}")
```
[refine_program]
This problem asks for the quadruple of two-digit numbers (digits 1–9, no zeros) that sum their digits to 221, with all digits across the four numbers being distinct.

The original program:
- Generates all 2-digit numbers from 11 to 99 (excluding zeros).
- Checks every possible combination of four such numbers.
- For each quadruple, sums all 8 digits.
- Checks if the sum equals 221.
- Checks if all 8 digits are distinct.

The code outputs nothing because:
1. The sum of all digits in four 2-digit numbers (each with digits 1–9) can maximumly be 9+9 multiplied by 4 = 72, which is far less than 221.
2. Therefore, the condition `total_sum == 221` can never be true, resulting in no matches.

**Judgment:**
- The program correctly implements the logic but searches for the impossible condition.
- Since no quadruple can have digits summing to 221, it will always produce no output.
- The problem is fundamentally unsolvable under given constraints.
- The code can be accepted if the problem is correctly interpreted, or can be simplified to output that no solution exists.

**Acceptance:**
- The code does not produce any answers because the condition cannot be satisfied rather than an error in code.
- No need for correction unless the problem intends to find the maximum or minimum sum or other options.

**Final decision:**
>>>False>>>

**Corrected program to reflect the impossibility:**
```python
# Generate all 2-digit numbers with digits 1-9 (no zeros)
two_digit_numbers = [(tens * 10 + ones) for tens in range(1, 10) for ones in range(1, 10)]

# Since the maximum sum of all digits for four 2-digit numbers is 9+9=18 per number, total max is 72
# It's impossible to reach sum 221; output that no solutions exist
print("No quadruple of four two-digit numbers with distinct digits sums to 221.")
```
