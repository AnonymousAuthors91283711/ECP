The error arises because in Lean, defining a set of functions using union of lambda expressions directly with braces is invalid syntax. Instead, sets of functions are typically constructed via explicitly enumerated elements or via a set constructor that takes a predicate (subsetof). 

Given the enumerated solutions are constant functions f(x) = -1 and f(x) = 0, the most straightforward representation is to define `omnimath3867_answer` as the set of functions identical to `λ _ , -1` or `λ _ , 0`. Since these are constant functions, they can be written as functions:

- `λ _ : ℝ, -1`
- `λ _ : ℝ, 0`

and the set containing these functions can be written as the union of singleton sets of these functions. In Lean, singleton sets are given by `{f}` (the set containing just `f`). 

Thus, the corrected expression is:

```lean
abbrev omnimath3867_answer : Set (ℝ → ℝ) := { λ _ : ℝ, -1 } ∪ { λ _ : ℝ, 0 }
```

This union compiles correctly, representing the set of functions satisfying the given conditions, matching the given enumerated constant solutions.

The main issue with the proposed answer is the incorrect use of 'abbrev' within an expression, along with improper syntax for defining a set of functions in Lean. To fix these, we should directly define 'omnimath3867_answer' as a set of constant functions that take the value -1 or 0 everywhere, which matches the enumerated solutions. 

Furthermore, since the functions are constant, representing the set as { λ x, -1 } ∪ { λ x, 0 } is sufficient. This set includes all functions with constant value -1 or 0 across ℝ. Given Lean's syntax, this set can be expressed as the union of two singleton sets. 

Note that the top-level definition should be an expression, not a statement with 'abbrev' inside the answer. So, the fix is to directly define 'omnimath3867_answer' as such a set, enclosed in a lambda for the function, then unioned appropriately.

This reasoning aligns with the enumeration provided, which suggests that functions are constant with values -1 or 0, satisfying the constraints for particular (x, y) pairs.

The error arises because in Lean, function sets are constructed as sets of functions, which are of type (ℝ → ℝ), not as sets containing individual functions with explicit union syntax. The current code attempts: { λ _ : ℝ, -1 } ∪ { λ _ : ℝ, 0 }, which is invalid in Lean syntax.

The correct way to define a set containing multiple functions in Lean is to use set notation with a characteristic property or explicitly use set constructors like `Set.ofList`, or `Set`, or list comprehensions with `set`.

Given that the functions are constant functions f(x) = -1 and f(x) = 0, the set of all such functions can be expressed as:

- The set of all constant functions f where ∀ x, f x = c for some constant c ∈ {-1, 0}.

Thus, the answer set can be constructed as:

```lean
{f : ℝ → ℝ | ∀ x, f x = -1 ∨ f x = 0}
```

This set includes exactly those functions that are constantly -1 or constantly 0.

Alternatively, we can define it explicitly:

```lean
{f : ℝ → ℝ | ∀ x, (f x = -1) ∨ (f x = 0)}
```

which in set notation corresponds to all functions whose value is always either -1 or 0, i.e., the functions in the union of the constant functions `λ _ : ℝ, -1` and `λ _ : ℝ, 0`.

**Final answer:**

<<<
{f : ℝ → ℝ | ∀ x, f x = -1 ∨ f x = 0}
