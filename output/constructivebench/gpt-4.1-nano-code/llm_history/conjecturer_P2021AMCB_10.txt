theorem P2021AMCB_10 :
  ∃ (x y : ℕ), x ∈ Finset.Icc 1 37 ∧ y ∈ Finset.Icc 1 37 ∧ x ≠ y ∧ 
  (∑ i in (Finset.Icc 1 37 \ {x, y}), i) = x * y ∧ 
  y - x = P2021AMCB_10_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 10. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The relation between the sum and the difference suggests a quadratic pattern, and the enumeration indicates the answer is 10. Because difference y - x = 10, and for the sum over remaining values, the consistent pattern confirms the answer. 

<<<10>>>
