The problem involves a set S = {64, 88, 120, 165}, and a property P involving four positive integers a, b, c, d such that the set of their pairwise products matches S. The goal is to find or characterize the sum a + b + c + d, and since the statement involves both an existential and a universal quantifier over P, the question appears to be about the possible sum consistent with the set S.

Approach:
- Enumerate all quadruples (a, b, c, d > 0) such that their pairwise products are exactly the elements of S.
- For each such quadruple, record the sum a + b + c + d.
- Since the set of pairwise products is fixed to S, the relations between the numbers constrain their possible values.

Note:
- The core difficulty is determining the quadruples that satisfy the set of pairwise products.
- Because the maximal set of quadruples can be large, we limit the search to small values and check systematically.
- We'll assume the only relevant products are those matching exactly the set S. 

Implementation:
- We generate all combinations of positive integers with small bounds, check their pairwise products, and match the set to S.
- Upon finding a valid quadruple, print the sum.

Here's the code:

```python
# Enumerate all quadruples of positive integers with small bounds.
# For each quadruple, check if their pairwise products match S.
# Record and output the sum for each valid quadruple.

S = {64, 88, 120, 165}
max_val = 20  # small bound for enumeration

results = set()

for a in range(1, max_val + 1):
    for b in range(1, max_val + 1):
        for c in range(1, max_val + 1):
            for d in range(1, max_val + 1):
                products = {a*b, b*c, c*d, d*a}
                if products == S:
                    total = a + b + c + d
                    # Print each sum found
                    print(total)
                    results.add(total)

# Optionally, print the minimum and maximum sums if needed
if results:
    print("Minimum sum:", min(results))
    print("Maximum sum:", max(results))
```
