The given theorem involves a function \(f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}\) that is positive for all positive \(x\), and a polynomial \(P\ge 0\) with \(P(0)=0\), satisfying a complex functional equation. Since the problem asks for enumeration to help conjecture the solution, a reasonable strategy is to consider simple candidate functions and polynomials, verify the conditions, and output solutions when they fit.

Key observations:
- \(f(x) > 0\) for all \(x>0\).
- \(P \ge 0\) with \(P(0) = 0\), so probably \(P\) has nonnegative coefficients and zero constant term.
- The functional equation involves \(f(f(x)+P(y))\), \(f(x-y)\), and terms involving \(y\).

Given the nature, natural candidate functions are linear forms like \(f(x)=ax+b\), and polynomials with small degree and nonnegative coefficients, e.g., zero or linear polynomials.

The enumeration will pick small \(a,b\), small degree polynomials for \(P\), and check the key functional equation.

```python
# Enumerate small candidate solutions for f and P based on problem constraints
# and verify the functional equation, printing any solutions found.

import math

# Candidate functions for f: linear functions f(x) = a*x + b with a > 0 (to ensure positivity for x>0)
# Candidate polynomials P: degree <= 2 with nonnegative coefficients, P(0)=0 => constant term=0

results = []

for a in [i/10 for i in range(1, 11)]:  # a > 0
    for b in [i/10 for i in range(0, 11)]:
        def f(x):
            return a * x + b

        # For P, try degree 1 polynomial: P(y)=c*y with c >= 0
        for c in [i/10 for i in range(0, 11)]:
            def P(y):
                return c * y

            # Check the key functional equation for a small sample of x,y > 0
            # choose sample points to test the equation
            for x_test in [0.1, 1, 2]:
                for y_test in [0.1, 0.5, 1]:
                    if x_test > y_test > 0:
                        lhs = f(f(x_test) + P(y_test))
                        rhs = f(x_test - y_test) + 2 * y_test
                        # Check for approximate equality within tolerance
                        if not math.isclose(lhs, rhs, rel_tol=1e-6, abs_tol=1e-6):
                            break
                else:
                    continue
                break
            else:
                # If all sampled checks pass, print the candidate
                print(f"Found candidate: f(x) = {a}*x + {b}, P(y) = {c}*y")
                results.append((a, b, c))
# The enumeration may find multiple candidates; the user can analyze these further.
