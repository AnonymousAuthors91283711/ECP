Based on the recurrence relation resembling rotation in the complex plane and the enumerated numeric approximation, the sum a₁ + b₁ corresponds to the real part of the initial complex number when rotated 100 times. The rotation by angle arccos(sqrt 3/2) over 100 steps leads numerical evidence to approximate this sum as 2. Generalizing from the pattern, the initial sum remains constant at 2.
