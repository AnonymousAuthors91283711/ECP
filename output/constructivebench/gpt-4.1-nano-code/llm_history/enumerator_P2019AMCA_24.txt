This problem asks us to find the number of integers `n` in the range 1 to 50 such that `(n^2)!` is divisible by `(n!)^n`. In other words, count how many `n` satisfy `(n!)^n | (n^2)!`. We need to enumerate all such `n` between 1 and 50, check the divisibility condition, and report the total count.

Key insights:
- For divisibility, prime factor counting suggests that `(n!)^n` divides `(n^2)!` if and only if the prime exponents in `(n!)^n` are less than or equal to those in `(n^2)!`.
- Since factorials involve prime exponent counting, we can check for each prime whether the prime exponent in `(n!)^n` is â‰¤ that in `(n^2)!`.

We will:
- List primes up to 50.
- For each `n` in 1..50, check whether `(n!)^n` divides `(n^2)!` by comparing prime exponents.
- Count how many satisfy the condition.

Here's the code:

```python
import math

# Generate list of primes up to 50
primes = [p for p in range(2, 51) if all(p % d != 0 for d in range(2, int(p**0.5) + 1))]

def prime_exponent_in_factorial(n, p):
    # Counts the exponent of prime p in n!
    count = 0
    power = p
    while power <= n:
        count += n // power
        power *= p
    return count

count = 0
for n in range(1, 51):
    # Check divisibility condition:
    # For each prime p, check if exponent in (n!)^n <= exponent in (n^2)!
    divides = True
    for p in primes:
        exp_n_fact = prime_exponent_in_factorial(n, p)
        exp_n2_fact = prime_exponent_in_factorial(n * n, p)
        # (n!)^n has exponents n * exp_n_fact
        # (n^2)! has exponents exp_n2_fact
        if n * exp_n_fact > exp_n2_fact:
            divides = False
            break
    if divides:
        print(n)
        count += 1

print("Total count:", count)
```
