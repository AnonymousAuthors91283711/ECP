Given the recursive pattern and initial conditions, the sequence a(n) constructs palindromes with length n, starting with [1], then [0], and the recursive concatenation preserves or creates palindromes. For n ≥ 1, a(n) forms a palindrome of length n. The answer matches the maximum n for which this holds.
