The problem appears to ask for the greatest natural number n such that there exists some integer k satisfying k ≤ n and the inequality k + (n - k) * (2/3) ≤ 30. We want to find the maximum n for which such k exists, and perhaps identify that maximum explicitly.

Approach:
- For given n, find whether there exists a k satisfying the constraints.
- For fixed n, the inequality simplifies to: k + (n - k) * (2/3) ≤ 30.
- Rearranged: k + (2/3)n - (2/3)k ≤ 30
- Combine k terms: k - (2/3)k = (1/3)k
- So: (1/3)k + (2/3)n ≤ 30
- Multiply through by 3: k + 2n ≤ 90
- Since k ≤ n, then k maximum is n, so check if the maximum possible k = n satisfies the inequality:
  n + 2n ≤ 90 → 3n ≤ 90 → n ≤ 30.

- The maximum n is 30. For n=30:
  Is there a k ≤ 30 with k + 2*30 ≤ 90? Check k=30:
  30 + 60 = 90, inequality holds, so n=30 is possible.

- For n=31:
  31 + 62 = 93 > 90 → no such k, so maximum n is 30.

Thus, the greatest n satisfying the condition is 30.

We will write code to confirm this systematically.

```python
# Enumerate n from 0 up to 60 for safety, check for existence of k
max_n = 0
for n in range(31, 61):
    found = False
    # For each n, check if exists k ≤ n satisfying the inequality
    for k in range(n + 1):
        # Check inequality: k + (n - k)*(2/3) ≤ 30
        lhs = k + (n - k) * (2/3)
        if lhs <= 30:
            print(f"n={n}, k={k} satisfies inequality with lhs={lhs}")
            found = True
            break
    if not found:
        print(f"n={n} does not satisfy inequality for any k")
        break
# The last n where found=True is our answer
print("Greatest n:", n - 1)
```
