This problem appears to be a mathematical optimization/partition problem likely related to covering sums with unit-sized subsets. The goal seems to be to find the minimum number `k` such that any distribution of a total `n` into `d` parts, each between 0 and 1, can be partitioned into `k` parts each summing to at most 1. 

To assist in conjecturing the true value, we can try several small values of `d` and `a_i`, checking for the smallest `k` that always suffices for the partition condition. For each fixed `n`, we test with small `d` and candidate distributions `a_i` that sum to `n`, then determine the minimal `k` where the partition property holds.

The following Python program enumerates these candidates, checks the minimal `k`, and streams answers for each `n`. It avoids assumption of the ground-truth answer and provides a set of candidate minimal `k`s for given `n`.

```python
# This code estimates the minimal number of partitions k needed for sums n
# by enumerating possible distributions and partitionings.

def enumerate_partitionings(d):
    # Generate all possible distributions a_i with sum n,
    # where each a_i between 0 and 1 and sum to n
    # For simplicity, we only consider distributions with a_i integers in [0, n]
    # and sum == n, to minimize complexity.
    distributions = []

    def backtrack(i, total, current):
        if i == d:
            if total == n:
                distributions.append(current.copy())
            return
        # Try all possible a_i from 0 to min(n - total, 1) for binary case
        for val in range(min(n - total, 1) + 1):  # since a_i ≤ 1
            current[i] = val
            backtrack(i+1, total + val, current)

    for dist in distributions:
        backtrack(0, 0, [0]*d)
    return distributions

def check_partition(a, k):
    # Check if a can be partitioned into k parts each with sum ≤ 1
    # For this enumeration, we try simple greedy partitioning
    a_sorted = sorted(a, reverse=True)
    parts = [0]*k
    for val in a_sorted:
        # Place val into the first part that can accommodate it
        placed = False
        for i in range(k):
            if parts[i] + val <= 1:
                parts[i] += val
                placed = True
                break
        if not placed:
            # Cannot place this value in current partition
            return False
    return True

    # For small d, find minimal k for all distributions
    min_k = {n: float('inf')}
    for d in range(1, max_d+1):
        # Generate distributions
        # To limit runtime, consider distributions with zeros and ones
        # more detailed enumeration can be added
        for num_ones in range(d+1):
            # Create a distribution with num_ones entries as 1, rest 0
            for zeros_positions in combinations(range(d), d - num_ones):
                a = [1 if i in zeros_positions else 0 for i in range(d)]
                total = sum(a)
                if total == n:
                    # Determine minimal k for this distribution
                    for k in range(1, n+1):
                        if check_partition(a, k):
                            if k < min_k[n]:
