[write_program]
This looks like a formal theorem statement involving some computed values (x, y, z) and an unknown answer. Since the code references Mathlib (a Lean mathematics library) and uses specific variable definitions, but the task is to write a Python program for enumeration, I'll interpret this as a problem to find a particular numeric value related to (x, y, z).

Given:
- x = 2
- y = 2^2 - 5 = 4 - 5 = -1
- z = y^2 - 5 = (-1)^2 - 5 = 1 - 5 = -4

The theorem appears to be suggesting that z equals some answer. To assist in conjecturing and proving, we can write a Python script that computes z from the given x, y, and the pattern, then explores nearby values to see if any other values match or relate to this.

Since the problem seems to involve simple expressions and potential iteration, the script will:
- Explicitly compute y and z
- Check if z matches related values
- Print the computed z and nearby values for conjecture

```python
# Python program to compute the value of z based on the given x, y, and the expression y^2 - 5

# Define initial parameters
x = 2
y = 2 ** 2 - 5  # = 4 - 5 = -1
z = y ** 2 - 5  # = 1 - 5 = -4

print("x =", x)
print("y =", y)
print("z =", z)

# Explore nearby values for conjecture (optional)
for delta in range(-2, 3):
    candidate_z = y ** 2 - 5 + delta
    print(f"Candidate z with delta {delta}: {candidate_z}")

# Since the specific answer is not hardcoded, just output the computed z
# This assists in conjecturing whether z is unique or part of a pattern
print("Computed z:", z)
```
