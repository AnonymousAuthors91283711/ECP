theorem omnimath104 (a : ℕ) (ha : 0 < a) :
  (∀ (x y : ℕ), x > y → y ≥ 0 → Nat.xor x (a * x) ≠ Nat.xor y (a * y)) ↔ a ∈ omnimath104_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Candidate a: 2

Minimal a satisfying the property: 2. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The pattern of candidate solutions suggests the minimal a where the XOR property holds depends on whether a is even or odd. Given the enumerations, candidate values are all even, starting from 2. This matches the conjecture that the set includes all even positive integers. 

So, the set is all even natural numbers greater than zero:

abbrev omnimath104_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath104 (a : ℕ) (ha : 0 < a) :
  (∀ (x y : ℕ), x > y → y ≥ 0 → Nat.xor x (a * x) ≠ Nat.xor y (a * y)) ↔ a ∈ omnimath104_answer := by sorry. Current Proposed Answer: fun a => a > 0 ∧ even a. Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 54, which is at "even a" in "abbrev omnimath104_answer : Set ℕ := fun a => a > 0 ∧ even a", there is an error: unknown identifier 'even'.

Minimal a satisfying the property: 2. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The error indicates that Lean cannot identify `even` as a known identifier. In Lean, the property of being even is expressed as `Even a` using the standard library, or equivalently as `a % 2 = 0`. Since the signature involves `Set ℕ`, the set can be defined via a predicate such as `λ a, a % 2 = 0`.

Given the enumeration, the minimal satisfying value is 2, which correlates with `a` being even and greater than zero. The minimal set satisfying the property appears to be the set of positive even numbers, i.e., all `a > 0` with `a % 2 = 0`. To fix the error, replace `even a` with `a % 2 = 0`.

Thus, we can define `omnimath104_answer` as the set of positive even numbers:

```lean
fun a => a > 0 ∧ a % 2 = 0
```

which aligns with the enumerated answers and the properties described.

***Final answer:***

<<<fun a => a > 0 ∧ a % 2 = 0>>>
