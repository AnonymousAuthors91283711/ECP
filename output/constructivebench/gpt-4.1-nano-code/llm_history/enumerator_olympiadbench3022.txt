The problem involves solving the equation:

\[
\log_{6}(\sqrt{x - 7}) + \log_{6^2}(x - 2) = 1
\]

Given that \(\log_{a} b + \log_{a} c = \log_{a} (b c)\), and converting the logs to a common base, the expression simplifies.

Let's analyze conditions for \(x\):

- \(\sqrt{x - 7}\) is defined for \(x \geq 7\).
- \(x - 2 > 0 \Rightarrow x > 2\).
- The logs are valid when their arguments are positive.

We will enumerate candidates for \(x\) around \(7\) and \(2\), and check for solutions.

Here's a Python program to approximate solutions:

```python
# Enumerate x in a small range and check the equation
import math

# Function to evaluate the equation
def eq(x):
    if x <= 7 or x <= 2:
        return None  # invalid for logs
    try:
        left = math.log(math.sqrt(x - 7), 6) + math.log(x - 2, 36)
        return left
    except:
        return None

# Search over candidates
for x in range(8, 50):
    val = eq(x)
    if val is not None:
        print(f"x = {x}, equation value = {val}")
        if abs(val - 1) < 1e-6:
            print(f"Approximate solution found: x = {x}")
```

This code explores values from 8 to 49 for an approximate solution. For exact algebraic solutions, more symbolic computation is needed, but this enumerator helps to conjecture potential solutions.

```python
# Python program to scan for solutions to the equation
import math

def evaluate(x):
    if x <= 7 or x <= 2:
        return None
    try:
        val = math.log(math.sqrt(x - 7), 6) + math.log(x - 2, 36)
        return val
    except:
        return None

# Enumerate possible x values
for x in range(8, 50):
    val = evaluate(x)
    if val is not None:
        print(f"x = {x}, computed value = {val}")
        if abs(val - 1) < 1e-6:
            print(f"Potential solution at x â‰ˆ {x}")
```
