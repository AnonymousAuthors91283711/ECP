This problem asks us to find the number of natural numbers \( n \) such that \( 0 < n \) and \( 111 \equiv 6 \pmod{n} \). 

Rewriting the condition: \( 111 \equiv 6 \pmod{n} \) means \( n \mid (111 - 6) \), i.e., \( n \mid 105 \).

So, the problem reduces to counting the positive divisors of 105.

I'll write a Python script to enumerate all positive divisors of 105 and count them, printing each one immediately.

```python
# Enumerate positive divisors of 105 and count them
number = 105
divisors = []

# Loop through possible divisors up to sqrt(105)
import math
limit = int(math.isqrt(number))
for i in range(1, limit + 1):
    if number % i == 0:
        # i is a divisor
        print(i)  # print divisor immediately
        divisors.append(i)
        complement = number // i
        if complement != i:
            print(complement)  # print the corresponding divisor

print(f"Total number of divisors: {len(divisors)}")
```
