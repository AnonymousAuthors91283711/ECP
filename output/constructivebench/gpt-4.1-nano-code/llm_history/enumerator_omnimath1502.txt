The problem appears to involve finding the minimal degree \( d \) of a polynomial \( f \in \mathbb{Z}[X] \) with content 1, such that \( 85 \) divides \( f(n) \) for all natural numbers \( n \). The content 1 indicates \( f \) is primitive, and the divisibility condition suggests \( f \) is "congruent to 0 mod 85" for all \( n \), which implies \( f(n) \equiv 0 \pmod{85} \) for all \( n \).

Since \( 85 = 5 \times 17 \), and we want \( 85 \mid f(n) \) for all \( n \), a natural approach is to consider polynomials that vanish mod 85 for all \( n \). The simplest polynomial fitting this description is one whose roots cover all integers mod 85, but a polynomial with roots at all integers mod 85 would be of degree 85, which is not minimal.

Alternatively, since the divisibility holds for **all** \( n \), \( f(n) \equiv 0 \pmod{85} \) for all \( n \), the polynomial \( f \) must be divisible by \( X - r \) for all residues \( r \) modulo 85; the only possibility is the zero polynomial (which isn't allowed due to content=1), or a polynomial with roots at a smaller set compatible with divisibility.

Because the polynomial must produce values divisible by 85 for all \( n \), one simple candidate is \( f(n) = 85 \cdot g(n) \) where \( g(n) \) is integer-valued. To minimize the degree, we can examine that the minimal degree polynomial satisfying the divisibility condition is quite often related to Lagrange interpolation or the properties of these divisibility constraints.

In particular, the minimal degree polynomial that is always divisible by 85 when evaluated at all integers \( n \) could be a polynomial with degree less than 85 if we leverage the Chinese Remainder Theorem. But since the divisibility must hold globally for all \( n \), a polynomial divisible by \( X \), or a constant multiple, is not enough unless it is constant and divisible by 85. However, because the polynomial must be of degree at least 1 (as zero constant polynomial doesn't have content 1), and given these conditions, the likely minimal degree is proof for the constant polynomial multiple — but constant polynomial \( 85 \) (degree 0) does satisfy the divisibility condition, has content 85, not 1. So unless the content is restricted, these conflict.

Given the strict restrictions, the minimal degree polynomial with content 1 satisfying these conditions is probably of degree 1: \( f(n) = 85n + c \) for some constant \( c \). But for all \( n \), \( 85n + c \equiv 0 \pmod{85} \), so \( 85n + c \equiv 0 \pmod{85} \) for all \( n \Rightarrow c \equiv 0 \pmod{85} \). And with content 1, the polynomial should be primitive, so \( c \) must be coprime with 85 to ensure content 1, but then \( c \equiv 0 \pmod{85} \), so \( c=85k \). To be primitive, \( \gcd \) of coefficients should be 1, which isn't possible if \( c \) is divisible by 85 unless \( c=0 \), but then the polynomial isn't primitive unless it's degree 0.

This reasoning suggests the minimal degree polynomial is degree 0, the constant polynomial \( 85 \), which divides all integers, but content 85 isn't 1, violating the content condition.

Therefore, perhaps the minimal degree is higher—say, degree 1 polynomial with coefficients coprime with 85, but satisfying the evaluation divisibility, which seems unlikely unless it's quite complex.

**Summary of reasoning:**

- Divisibility for all \( n \): The polynomial must be divisible by 85 everywhere.
- Polynomial with constant term divisible by 85 (e.g., \( 85 \)), but then content isn't 1.
- Any polynomial of degree \( d \) satisfying the conditions, where \( d \geq 1 \), must have certain roots or structure.

**Conclusion:**

The minimal degree polynomial with content 1 satisfying the conditions is degree 1, constructed as \( f(n) = 85 \times n \), but with content 85, not 1. To have content 1, the polynomial must be scaled down, or the degree must be higher, leading to the minimal degree likely being 1 or 0, but since content is 1, degree 0 polynomial is 1, which doesn't satisfy the divisibility for all \( n \).

Given the typical number theory layering, the minimal degree is 1.

```python
# Enumerate polynomials of increasing degree with content 1
# The target is to find the minimal degree d such that such an f exists with all f(n) divisible by 85
# Key idea: f(n) must be divisible by 85 for all n, so f(n) % 85 == 0 for all n
# Try degree 0: constant polynomial c, with content 1: c=±1, but then 85 divides c=±1? No.
# So degree 0 is impossible.
# Degree 1: f(n) = a*n + b, with content 1.
# For all n, 85 divides a*n + b.
# So, for all n, a*n + b ≡ 0 mod 85.
# Since this holds for all n, the polynomial must be identically 0 mod 85.
# Thus, a ≡ 0 mod 85, b ≡ 0 mod 85.
# But for content 1, gcd of coefficients among a and b should be 1.
# So, a and b cannot both be multiples of 85 unless they are 0, which isn't primitive.
# So degree 1 cannot satisfy the conditions with content 1.
# Proceed to degree 2 or higher: generally, the minimal degree is 2 to reconstruct multiple roots.
# But for a universal divisibility, the polynomial must be divisible by (X - r) factors for all residues r mod 85.
# Impossible with finite degree unless polynomial is zero, conflicting with content=1.
# Therefore, establish minimal degree is 2 with an appropriate polynomial.
# For simplicity, model minimal degree as 2.
