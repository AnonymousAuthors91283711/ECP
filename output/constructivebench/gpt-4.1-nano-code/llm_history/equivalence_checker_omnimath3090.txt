(hn : 2 * n + 5 = 16)
: 2 * n - 3 = omnimath3090_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 8
Proposed Answer: 7
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us the equation: 2 * n + 5 = 16
2. We can solve for n:
   - 2n + 5 = 16
   - 2n = 16 - 5
   - 2n = 11
   - n = 5.5

However, n is defined as a natural number (ℕ), but 5.5 is not a natural number. This suggests the equation has no solution in natural numbers.

3. The theorem asks to find 2 * n - 3, which would be:
   - 2 * 5.5 - 3 = 11 - 3 = 8 (ground truth answer)
   - But since n must be natural, this is invalid

4. The proposed answer is 7, which doesn't match the calculation (8) and also ignores the natural number constraint.

The ground truth answer correctly follows from the calculation (though the problem is ill-posed for natural numbers), while the proposed answer is incorrect.
