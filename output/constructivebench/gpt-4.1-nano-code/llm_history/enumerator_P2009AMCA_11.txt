This problem involves a recursive function \(F(n)\) with initial conditions \(F(0)=1, F(1)=1, F(2)=5\), and a recurrence \(F(n+3) = F(n+2) + 4(n+2)\). We are asked to conjecture a closed-form expression for \(F(n)\) when \(n \ge 3\). 

Our goal is to implement an enumeration for possible \(F(n)\) values, focusing on small \(n\), and attempt to find patterns or closed-form solutions. Since the recurrence involves both previous values and a linear term, it's a combination of recurrence and summation. 

We will generate values first, then attempt to recognize the pattern. Because the recurrence involves addition of a linear term, the solution likely involves polynomial expressions. Let's generate some values:

- \(F(3) = F(2) + 4 \times 2 = 5 + 8 = 13\)
- \(F(4) = F(3) + 4 \times 3 = 13 + 12 = 25\)
- \(F(5) = F(4) + 4 \times 4 = 25 + 16 = 41\)
- \(F(6) = F(5) + 4 \times 5 = 41 + 20 = 61\)
- \(F(7) = F(6) + 4 \times 6 = 61 + 24 = 85\)

Now, notice the pattern: the initial values suggest a quadratic pattern. Let's express \(F(n)\) for \(n \ge 3\):

Since \(F(n+3) = F(n+2) + 4(n+2)\), this is similar to summing a linear sequence:

\[
F(n) = F(2) + \sum_{k=3}^{n} 4k
\]

Because \(F(2)=5\), and for \(n \ge 3\):

\[
F(n) = 5 + 4 \sum_{k=3}^n k
\]

Sum of integers:

\[
\sum_{k=3}^n k = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - \frac{2 \times 3}{2} = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 3
\]

Thus:

\[
F(n) = 5 + 4 \left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 3 \right) = 5 + 2 n(n+1) - 12 = 2 n(n+1) - 7
\]

Check for \(n=3\):

\[
2 \times 3 \times 4 -7= 2 \times 12 -7=24 -7=17
\]

But earlier we computed \(F(3)=13\), so discrepancy. Let's verify our summation:

Wait, the sum from \(k=3\) to \(n\):

\[
\sum_{k=3}^n k = \sum_{k=1}^n k - \sum_{k=1}^2 k = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 3
\]

but the sum \(\sum_{k=1}^2 k = 3\). Correct.

So, then:

\[
F(n) = 5 + 4 \left( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 3 \right) = 5 + 2 n(n+1) - 12= 2 n(n+1) - 7
\]

Test at \(n=3\):

\[
2 \times 3 \times 4 - 7 = 24 - 7 = 17
\]

which conflicts with earlier \(F(3)=13\).

So our earlier arithmetic was:

Earlier, for \(n=3\):

\[
F(3)=F(2)+4 \times 2=5 + 8=13
\]

which contradicts the sum-based formula of 17.

Hold on, the recurrence is:

\[
F(n+3) = F(n+2) + 4(n+2)
\]

and initial:

\[
F(0)=1, F(1)=1, F(2)=5
\]

Calculating \(F(3)\):

\[
F(3) = F(2)+4 \times 2=5+8=13
\]

Similarly, for \(n=3\):

\[
F(3) = 13
\]

But if the formula is \(F(n) = 2 n(n+1) - 7\), then at \(n=3\):

\[
2 \times 3 \times 4 -7= 24-7=17
\]

which does not match 13.

Our sum approach seems mismatched; perhaps the sum should start from \(k=0\) to \(n-1\).

Note that \(F(n)\) depends recursively on earlier terms, involving initial values.

Alternatively, let's proceed with generating more values and fitting a polynomial:

Values:

\[
\begin{aligned}
F(0)&=1\\
F(1)&=1\\
F(2)&=5\\
F(3)&=13\\
F(4)&=25\\
F(5)&=41\\
F(6)&=61\\
F(7)&=85
\end{aligned}
\]

Plotting \(F(n)\) vs \(n\), the pattern resembles a quadratic:

Calculate differences:

First differences:

\[
\begin{aligned}
F(1)-F(0)=0 \\
F(2)-F(1)=4 \\
F(3)-F(2)=8 \\
F(4)-F(3)=12 \\
F(5)-F(4)=16 \\
F(6)-F(5)=20 \\
F(7)-F(6)=24
\end{aligned}
\]

Second differences:

Between the first differences:

\[
4-0=4,\quad 8-4=4,\quad 12-8=4,\quad 16-12=4,\quad 20-16=4,\quad 24-20=4
\]

Equal second differences of 4 imply quadratic:

\[
F(n) = a n^2 + b n + c
\]

Use three known values to solve:

at \(n=0\):

\[
F(0)=1=a \times 0 + b \times 0 + c \Rightarrow c=1
\]

at \(n=1\):

\[
F(1)=a + b + 1=1 \Rightarrow a + b=0
\]

at \(n=2\):

\[
4a + 2b + 1=5 \Rightarrow 4a + 2b=4
\]

From \(a + b=0\):

\[
b=-a
\]

Plug into the second:

\[
4a + 2(-a)=4 \Rightarrow 4a - 2a=4 \Rightarrow 2a=4 \Rightarrow a=2
\]

Then \(b=-a=-2\).

Thus:

\[
F(n)= 2 n^2 - 2 n + 1
\]

Verify at \(n=3\):

\[
2 \times 9 - 2 \times 3 + 1= 18 -6 +1=13
\]

matches the computed value. 

Similarly at \(n=4\):

\[
2 \times 16 -8 +1=32 -8 +1=25
\]

correct.

At \(n=5\):

\[
2 \times 25 -10 +1=50 -10 +1=41
\]

matches.

Therefore, for \(n \ge 3\):

\[
F(n) = 2 n^2 - 2 n + 1
\]

and the initial values fit as well.

We can now define a function for the answer. Since the problem asks for the \(P2009AMCA_11_answer(n)\), and the derivation shows an exact closed-form expression for \(n \ge 3\):

```python
import math

def P2009AMCA_11_answer(n):
    if n >= 3:
        return 2 * n**2 - 2 * n + 1
    else:
        # For n<3, match initial conditions
        return [1, 1, 5][n]
```

Finally, the theorem can be implemented accordingly.

**Full code:**

```python
# Enumeration and conjecture: derived closed-form for n >=3
def P2009AMCA_11_answer(n):
    if n >= 3:
        return 2 * n**2 - 2 * n + 1
    else:
        return [1, 1, 5][n]
```

The provided code and description contain several issues:

- The original problem appears to define a recursive sequence F with initial values, and the theorem claims it equals some answer function. The sequence is defined as:
  - F(0) = 1
  - F(1) = 1
  - F(2) = 5
  - For n ≥ 3, F(n+3) = F(n+2) + 4*(n+2)

This recurrence is somewhat unusual; typically, a recurrence is written with n in the same domain, but the code suggests F(n+3) depends on F(n+2). Adjusting for a consistent recurrence:

- Let's attempt to interpret the recurrence properly:
  
  F(n+3) = F(n+2) + 4*(n+2)
  
  Which implies:

  F(n+3) - F(n+2) = 4*(n+2)

- Using initial values:

  F(0)=1, F(1)=1, F(2)=5

- To find an explicit formula, observe the recurrence involves a linear function of n, suggesting F may be quadratic in n.

Testing for small n:

- F(0) = 1
- F(1) = 1
- F(2) = 5

Calculate F(3):

- F(3) = F(2) + 4*2 = 5 + 8 = 13

Calculate F(4):

- F(4) = F(3) + 4*3 = 13 + 12 = 25

Calculate F(5):

- F(5) = F(4) + 4*4 = 25 + 16 = 41

Check pattern against quadratic formula:

Try matching F(n) to a quadratic form: F(n) = A n^2 + B n + C

Plug in initial points:

At n=0: C=1

At n=1: A + B + C=1 → A + B + 1=1 → A + B=0

At n=2: 4A + 2B + C=5 → 4A + 2B + 1=5 → 4A + 2B=4

Since A + B=0, then B= -A

Plug into 4A + 2B=

This problem appears to be a high-school level math problem likely involving recursive sequences. The provided code is incomplete (using 'sorry') and contains no implementation or enumeration of answers. The name suggests it's from a 2009 AMC contest problem, which often involve recursive sequences or sums.

Key observations:
- The function F is defined recursively, with base cases at 0, 1, 2, and a recursive step for n+3.
- The theorem states that for n ≥ 3, F n equals some unknown answer function, but that function is not provided.
- The code lacks an enumeration or computation to verify or find the answers.
- The program is essentially empty, resulting in no outputs.
- Since the enumerator outputs an error, it does not produce any answers to accept.

Given the problem requirements:
- The current code is incomplete and unexecutable.
- It does not stream answers, does not produce partial results, and does not compute the sequence or answer.

Therefore, the code should be rejected. We need to produce a corrected program that:
- Implements the recursive function F.
- Computes or enumerates solutions for small n.
- Checks the formula for n ≥ 3 if possible.
- Prints results immediately.
- Avoid hardcoding the answer; instead, compute or deduce it.

Since the sequence looks complex, but the recursive formula suggests a pattern, let's attempt to find a closed form for F(n).

Sequence calculations:
- F(0)=1
- F(1)=1
- F(2)=5
- F(3)=F(2)+4*2=5+8=13
- F(4)=F(3)+4*3=13+12=25
- F(5)=F(4)+4*4=25+16=41
- F(6)=F(5)+4*5=41+20=61

Sequence: 1,1,5,13,25,41,61,...

Differences:
- From 1 to 1: 0
- 1 to 5: +4
- 5 to 13: +8
- 13 to 25: +12
- 25 to 41: +16
- 41 to 61: +20

Differences increase by 4, so the sequence F(n) for n ≥ 2 forms an arithmetic pattern in differences. Let's see if a closed
