     (w i = 2 ∧ w (i+1) = 0) → False} = P2003AIMEII_3_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 192. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The problem describes sequences of length 7 over {0,1,2} that do not contain the specific adjacent pattern 0→1→2 or 1→2→0 or 2→0→1, effectively avoiding certain transitions. Analyzing the patterns, the sequences exclude the 3 cyclic transitions; thus, only sequences with no forbidden consecutive pairs are valid. Since the pattern counts constrain the sequence choices, the total number of such sequences is 192, matching the enumerated answer. 

Final answer:
<<<192>>>
