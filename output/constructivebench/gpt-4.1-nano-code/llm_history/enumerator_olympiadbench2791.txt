This problem involves polynomial factorization and parameterization, with roots structured symmetrically around a variable `a` and scaled by `d`. The key is to identify the coefficient of the quadratic term in the expanded form of these roots, which should match the given polynomial form. The roots are `(a - 3d)`, `(a - d)`, `(a + d)`, `(a + 3d)` with `d ≠ 0`.

The polynomial results from the product:
`(X - (a - 3d))(X - (a - d))(X - (a + d))(X - (a + 3d))`.

Expanding this polynomial, the coefficient of `X^2` will be expressible in terms of `a` and `d`. We can find this coefficient explicitly and then solve for the unknown `olympiadbench2791_answer`'s coefficient.

We will pick small sample values for `a` and `d`, especially with `d ≠ 0`, and compute the resulting coefficient to find consistent values for the target coefficient.

```python
# This script searches for possible values of the coefficient of X^2
# in the polynomial formed by roots symmetric around 'a' with spacing 'd'
# It selects small 'a' and 'd' with d ≠ 0, computes the polynomial coefficients,
# and outputs candidate answers for the target coefficient.

for a in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
    for d in [-3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3]:
        if d == 0:
            continue
        roots = [a - 3 * d, a - d, a + d, a + 3 * d]

        # Expand the polynomial (X - r1)(X - r2)(X - r3)(X - r4)
        # Step 1: combine roots to get the pairwise sums
        # Coefficient of X^2 in expanded form:
        # sum over products of roots taken two at a time
        sum_pairs = (
            roots[0]*roots[1] + roots[0]*roots[2] + roots[0]*roots[3] +
            roots[1]*roots[2] + roots[1]*roots[3] + roots[2]*roots[3]
        )

        # Calculate the roots explicitly:
        r1, r2, r3, r4 = roots

        # The coefficient of X^2:
        coeff_X2 = -(r1*r2 + r1*r3 + r1*r4 + r2*r3 + r2*r4 + r3*r4)

        # Output the coefficient as a candidate answer
        print(f"Candidate answer for coefficient of X^2: {coeff_X2}")
