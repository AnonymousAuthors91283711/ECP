The main issue in the current proposed answer is the syntax of the λ-expression. In Lean, anonymous functions over natural numbers are written with `λ n, ...` rather than `λ n, 0`. The comma after `n` and the expression following it should be separated with `=>` or a comma in the syntax.

Since the candidate functions from enumeration are simple constant functions, the simplest candidate for the answer that satisfies divisibility for \(k=2..4\) is the constant zero function \(f(n) = 0\).

To make the code compile, I will define `omnimath3676_answer` as a constant function returning 0, using the proper Lean syntax for constant functions (`λ n, 0`).

This particular candidate is consistent with the enumerated solutions, and the formal statement (proving the equivalence) should hold for the constant zero function.

**Final Answer:**

<<<fun n : ℕ => 0>>>
