The problem appears to be a combinatorial question involving injective functions from a finite set {0,1,2,3,4} to {0,1,2,3,4,5} with certain spacing conditions between indices. Specifically, the conditions involve the difference of indices (i - j) being greater than 1 and less than 4, which restricts pairs of positions where the function values must differ.

To solve this, we can:

1. Enumerate all functions from `Fin 5` to `Fin 6`.
2. For each function, check whether for all pairs `(i, j)`, the difference `(i - j)` satisfies the condition and whether `f i ≠ f j` if the condition is met.
3. Count the number of functions satisfying the condition.

Given the small sizes, an efficient brute-force approach is feasible. The code will:

- Trace over all possible functions (6^5 options)
- Check the condition for each pair of indices
- Count and print valid solutions

Here's the implementation:

```python
# Enumerate all functions f from {0,1,2,3,4} to {0,1,2,3,4,5}
# and count how many satisfy the spacing conditions.

from itertools import product

def main():
    count = 0
    # f: tuple of length 5, each element in 0..5
    for f in product(range(6), repeat=5):
        valid = True
        for i in range(5):
            for j in range(i+1, 5):
                diff = abs(i - j)
                # Check if within the specified difference range (greater than 1 and less than 4)
                if 1 < diff < 4:
                    # Then f(i) ≠ f(j)
                    if f[i] == f[j]:
                        valid = False
                        break
            if not valid:
                break
        if valid:
            count += 1
            print(f"Valid function: {f}")
    print(f"Total solutions: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
