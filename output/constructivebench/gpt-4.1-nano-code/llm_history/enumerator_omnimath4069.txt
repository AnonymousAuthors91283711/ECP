The problem appears to involve a set construction with specific properties related to real numbers, and the condition involving the square root of the difference of squares suggests a focus on intervals or particular types of sets. To assist, I'll enumerate candidate sets satisfying the conditions, especially focusing on simple or well-structured sets like intervals or discrete sets.

Given the general nature of the problem, a reasonable approach is to consider sets that contain 1 and are closed under the operation \( x, y \in S \Rightarrow \sqrt{x^2 - y^2} \in S \) whenever \( x > y \). Since \( \sqrt{x^2 - y^2} \leq x \), this hints at sets closed downward or within certain bounds.

I'll implement a script that:
- Checks sets of real numbers formed by intervals or small finite sets.
- Ensures that 1 is in the set.
- Verifies closure under \( x > y \Rightarrow \sqrt{x^2 - y^2} \in S \).
- Outputs each candidate when it satisfies the conditions.

To keep within the token limit, only simple candidate sets will be used, especially intervals like \([a, b]\) with \(a \leq 1 \leq b\), and some discrete sets.

```python
# Enumerate possible sets containing 1 and check closure under the given operation.
import math

def check_set(S):
    for x in S:
        for y in S:
            if x > y:
                val = math.sqrt(x**2 - y**2)
                # Check if val is in S within a tolerance
                if not any(abs(val - s) < 1e-8 for s in S):
                    return False
    if 1 not in S:
        return False
    return True

# Candidate sets: intervals [a, b] with a <= 1 <= b, or discrete sets
candidate_intervals = [
    [a, b] for a in [0, 0.5, 1] for b in [1, 2, 3]
]
discrete_sets = [
    {1},
    {0.5, 1, 2},
    {1, 2}
]

# Enumerate and print sets satisfying conditions
# Use intervals for efficiency
for a in [0, 0.5, 1]:
    for b in [1, 2, 3]:
        S = [a + (b - a) * i / 10 for i in range(int((b - a) * 10) + 1)]
        S_set = set(S)
        if check_set(S_set):
            print("Interval [{}, {}]".format(a, b))
# Check discrete sets
for S in discrete_sets:
    if check_set(S):
        print("Set:", S)
```
