theorem omnimath4341 (n : ℕ) (hn : 0 < n) :
  (∑ i ∈ Finset.range n, ∑ j ∈ Finset.range n, ⌊((i + 1) * (j + 1) : ℚ) / (n + 1)⌋) = (n^2 * (n - 1)) / 4 ↔ omnimath4341_answer n := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n = 1 satisfies the sum condition with sum = 0
n = 2 satisfies the sum condition with sum = 1
n = 4 satisfies the sum condition with sum = 12
n = 6 satisfies the sum condition with sum = 45
n = 10 satisfies the sum condition with sum = 225
n = 12 satisfies the sum condition with sum = 396
n = 16 satisfies the sum condition with sum = 960
n = 18 satisfies the sum condition with sum = 1377. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → Prop
The pattern indicates that the sum equals (n^2 * (n - 1)) / 4 for larger even n, and zero at n=1. Observing the formulas and how the sum matches for these values, the pattern suggests the sum is zero for odd n and matches (n^2 * (n - 1)) / 4 for even n. Therefore, the answer is: n is even.
