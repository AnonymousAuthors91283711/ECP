The problem involves a function \(f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) satisfying two conditions: surjectivity \(\forall y, \exists x, f x=y\), and a functional equation \(\forall x, f(f x) = (x-1)f x + 2\). To explore possible functions, I'll try to find explicit solutions, especially affine functions, as quadratic or more complex functions are harder to handle directly. I'll implement a program that systematically tests affine functions \(f(x) = a x + b\) with small rational parameters, checking if both conditions can be satisfied. Since the functional equation involves second composition \(f(f x)\), I'll derive conditions on \(a, b\) by substitution, only for simple rational candidates, and check for surjectivity.

```python
# Enumerate small rational affine functions f(x) = a x + b
# with integer numerator/denominator in range [-3,3], excluding zero denominators
# For each, check if the functional equation holds for some x (symbolically or numerically)
# and if the function is surjective over ℝ (for affine, always surjective unless constant zero).
# Since surjectivity on ℝ for affine functions f(x)=ax+b with a≠0, is true, focus on those with a ≠ 0.
# For each candidate, verify the functional equation for some representative x values.
