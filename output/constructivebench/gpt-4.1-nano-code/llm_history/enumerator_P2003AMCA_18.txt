[write_program]
This appears to be a problem involving counting five-digit integers (from 10,000 to 99,999) that satisfy a particular modular condition: the sum of the first two digits (n/100) and the last two digits (n%100) must be divisible by 11. The goal is to find the total count of such integers within that range.

We will write a Python program to explicitly enumerate all integers between 10,000 and 99,999, compute the sum of the hundred's and last two digits, check divisibility by 11, and count how many satisfy the condition. The program will print each qualifying number immediately when found.

This approach is efficient for small enumeration (roughly 90,000 iterations), which is feasible here.

```python
# Enumerate all five-digit numbers and count those satisfying the condition:
# (n // 100 + n % 100) % 11 == 0

count = 0
for n in range(10000, 100000):
    part1 = n // 100  # extract first three digits as integer division
    part2 = n % 100   # last two digits
    if (part1 // 100 + part2) % 11 == 0:
        print(n)
        count += 1
print("Total count:", count)
```
