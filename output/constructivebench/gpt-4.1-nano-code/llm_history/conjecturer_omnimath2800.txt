Minimal answer: 209957. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The minimal answer from enumeration suggests that the problem reduces to factoring \( m^n = 2^{25} \times 3^{40} \). Since \( m \) must be of the form \( 2^a \times 3^b \), \( m^n = 2^{a n} \times 3^{b n} \). Equate exponents: \( a n = 25 \), \( b n = 40 \). With \( m > 0 \), \( m \neq 1 \), and \( n > 1 \), the only integer solution occurs when \( a = 5 \), \( b = 8 \), \( n = 5 \), giving \( m = 2^5 \times 3^8 = 32 \times 6561 = 209952 \). Then \( m + n = 209952 + 5 = 209957 \). 

Finally, the answer:

<<<209957>>>
