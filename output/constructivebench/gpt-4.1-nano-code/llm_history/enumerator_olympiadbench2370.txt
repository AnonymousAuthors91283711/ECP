This problem asks us to find all real solutions to the equation (x + 8)^4 = (2x + 16)^2, and then define a set of solutions accordingly.

Let's analyze the equation algebraically before coding:
- (x + 8)^4 = (2x + 16)^2
- Note that 2x + 16 = 2(x + 8), so substitute:
  (x + 8)^4 = [2(x + 8)]^2 = 4(x + 8)^2
- Now, divide both sides by (x + 8)^2 (valid for x ≠ -8):
  (x + 8)^2 = 4
- So, (x + 8)^2 = 4 ⇒ x + 8 = ±2 ⇒ x = -8 ± 2
- x = -8 + 2 = -6 and x = -8 - 2 = -10
- For x ≠ -8, these are solutions.
- For x = -8, plug back into original equation:
  (0)^4 = (2* -8 + 16)^2 = 0^2 = 0
  The equation holds, so x = -8 is also a solution.

Thus, solutions: x ∈ {-10, -8, -6}.

Now, implement code to enumerate solutions explicitly:

```python
# Enumerate all solutions to the equation (x + 8)^4 = (2x + 16)^2
# based on algebraic derivation, solutions are x = -10, -8, -6.
# We will generate these solutions and print them immediately.

solutions = [-10, -8, -6]

for x in solutions:
    print(x)
```
