Sum of cubes ≈ -0.500000
. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Based on the pattern and the sum approximations, the sum of the three cubes of these cosines is approximately -1/2. The angles are multiples of 2π/7, related to roots of unity, and their cosines satisfy algebraic relations leading to a simple rational sum. Therefore, the exact value is \(-\frac{1}{2}\).
