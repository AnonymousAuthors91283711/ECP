theorem omnimath1649 :
  ∃! (P : Polynomial ℚ), P.degree ≤ 2015 ∧
  (∀ n ∈ Finset.range 2016, P.eval (↑(n + 1) : ℚ) = Q (n + 1)) ∧
  ⌊(2017 : ℚ) * (P.eval (2017 : ℚ))⌋ = omnimath1649_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 0














. Expected Answer Type: ℤ
Given the enumeration that the answer is zero, and considering the structure of the interpolation problem with defined points and polynomial degrees, the consistent value is 0. 

Thus, the closed-form answer:

<<<0>>>
