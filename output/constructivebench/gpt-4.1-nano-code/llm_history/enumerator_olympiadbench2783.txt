This appears to be a formalization in Lean, focusing on the logarithm base `b` of specific values. The key part involves understanding the relationship between logs with different bases and the values involved. The typical mathematical approach involves using change-of-base formulas and the known logs of powers of 2 and 4.

Given the problem:
\[
\log_b 4 = \frac{\log 4}{\log b}
\]
and
\[
\log_b 2 = \frac{\log 2}{\log b}
\]
we want to find the value of `olympiadbench2783_answer` such that:
\[
\log_b 4 = \log_2 (olympiadbench2783_answer)
\]

Expressing these logs with natural logs:
\[
\log_b 4 = \frac{\ln 4}{\ln b}
\]
and
\[
\log_2 (x) = \frac{\ln x}{\ln 2}
\]

Set these equal:
\[
\frac{\ln 4}{\ln b} = \frac{\ln x}{\ln 2}
\]
which implies:
\[
\ln x = \frac{\ln 4}{\ln b} \times \ln 2
\]

Given that the problem asks for an answer for `b` or for the corresponding value of `x`, and without explicit values, we can choose a sample `b`, say `b=2`. Then:
\[
\log_2 4 = 2
\]

Since `log_b 4` equals `2` with `b=2`, the relation simplifies to:
\[
2 = \log_2 x
\]

which yields:
\[
x = 2^2 = 4
\]

Thus, for the particular case `b=2`, the answer is `4`. To encompass generality in the code, we can iterate over a few small `b` values and compute possible answers.

```python
# Program to approximate possible answer for given base b
import math

for b in [2, 3, 4, 5]:
    # Calculate log_b 4
    log_b_4 = math.log(4) / math.log(b)
    # Compute x such that log_b 4 = log_2 x
    # log_2 x = log_b 4 => x = 2^{log_b 4}
    x = 2 ** log_b_4
    print(f"b = {b}, answer (x) â‰ˆ {x}")
```
