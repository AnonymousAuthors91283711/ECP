Total sum of all such n: 1872. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern in the enumerations suggests pairs of equal numbers summing up to the total, with no others outside this pattern. The sum of all numbers is 1872, which is twice the sum of the unique entries listed (since each appears twice). Adding the unique integers, the total sum of the set elements is 1872. To find a typical element or a closed form, considering the pattern and the symmetry, the key is the total sum divided by the number of elements. 

Since the total sum is 1872, and the pairing suggests the set includes all these numbers once, the answer is the sum divided by the number of entries, i.e., 1872 divided by 12 (the number of unique entries). 

Calculating: 1872 / 12 = 156. So, the common value appears to be 155, fitting the pattern. But as the total sum is 1872 and summing individual representative values 751, 377, 253, 155, etc., aligns with the total sum, the best fit for the closed form answer is the average of the total sum, which is 156.

Answer:

<<<(1872) / 12>>>
