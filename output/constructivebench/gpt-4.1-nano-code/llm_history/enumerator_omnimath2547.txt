The problem involves defining a sequence \(a(n)\) with initial value \(a(1) = 1\) and recurrence \(a(n) = (a(n-1))! + 1\) for \(n > 1\). The goal is to find the smallest \(n\) such that \(a(n) > 10^{10}\).

Since factorials grow very rapidly, we can compute the sequence iteratively starting from \(a(1) = 1\), and find the first term exceeding \(10^{10}\). We only need to consider small \(n\) because factorials grow super-exponentially.

Let's implement this algorithm to enumerate the sequence and find that smallest \(n\).

```python
import math

def find_n_for_sequence(limit):
    a = 1
    n = 1
    while a <= limit:
        n += 1
        a = math.factorial(a) + 1
        print(f"n={n}, a={a}")
    return n

limit = 10**10
n_answer = find_n_for_sequence(limit)
print(f"The least n such that a(n) > 10^10 is {n_answer}")
```

This code efficiently computes the sequence until the condition is met, printing each step. It outputs the minimal \(n\) satisfying the inequality, matching the problem's requirements.
