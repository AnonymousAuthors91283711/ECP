The pattern suggests the numbers are perfect squares, perfect cubes, or their products, reflecting gcds of powers of positive integers. The key values included are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 8, 27, 64, 72, which are either perfect squares, perfect cubes, or their compositions, and are divisors or gcds of these forms. These are exactly the numbers that can appear as gcd (a^2, b^3) with a,b > 0.  
By examining the set, the numbers are numbers of form m^2, n^3, or their products, and the set seems to correspond to the least such representing numbers up to 100.  
The main pattern is numbers n with n = gcd(a^2, b^3), where a, b > 0. Known such gcds are all numbers whose prime factors are in {2,3,5,7}, with exponents less than or equal to 2 and 3 accordingly, but within 100, these are all regraded as 1, 4, 9, 8, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 27, 81, 100, and 72.  
Thus, the total answer is the set of all such numbers. Collecting these, the minimal such n ≤ 100 can be expressed as the set of numbers <= 100 that are either perfect squares, perfect cubes, or products thereof, with constraints given by gcdn from prime factor exponents.

72. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The key issue is that the proposed answer is trying to construct a set of candidate numbers (specifically, the gcds of a^2 and b^3), but it ends up as a list of numbers with a complicated list manipulation. The target type is ℕ, and the theorem expects an explicit ℕ value (or formula) that matches the description of possible gcd values.

From the enumeration, the values are: 1, 4, 9, 8, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 27, 81, 100, 72. These appear to be all numbers less than or equal to 100 that can be expressed as gcd(a^2, b^3) for positive integers a, b.

**Analysis:**

- The patterns suggest these numbers: perfect squares, perfect cubes, and some others.

- GCD(a², b³) can take specific forms: for example, gcd of a square and a cube often involves numbers with prime factorization satisfying certain divisibility properties.

- The pattern in the enumeration suggests the answer includes perfect squares (1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81), perfect cubes (8,27), and some special numbers like 72 and 100.

- It seems the set includes all perfect squares up to 100, plus some others, especially 8, 27, 72, which are not perfect squares or cubes, but occur as gcds.

---

**Conjectured form:**

- The set includes the perfect squares less than or equal to 100: 1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100.

- The set also includes some key numbers that are gcds of a² and b³ that are not perfect squares: 8, 27, 72.

- 8 = gcd(2², 2³), 27 = gcd(3², 3³), 72 = gcd(8², 6³). 

- The pattern suggests that the complete set includes all perfect squares up to 100, plus 8, 27, 72.

**Final answer:**

Assuming the answer should be a concrete natural number, a good candidate is the maximum of these, which is 100, or a number encoding the set. The theorem states the value as a ℕ, perhaps indicating the size or a representative element.

**Likely candidate:** The set of all such gcds is finite and includes key numbers: 1, 4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 36, 49, 64, 72, 81, 100.

If the answer is a number (say, maximum), then `100` makes sense.

### **Final answer:**

<<<100>>>

---

### **Explanation:**

The number 100 is chosen as it is the maximum of possible gcds in the enumerated set, aligning with the bounds and the pattern shown. The actual set of gcds includes common squares and specific numbers like 8, 27, and 72, which are less than or equal to 100, making 100 a natural candidate as a concise representative answer for this problem.
