abbrev omnimath3788_answer : ℤ → ℤ → ℤ := sorry
theorem omnimath3788 (f : ℤ → ℤ) :
  (∀ x y, f (4 * x + 3 * y) = f (3 * x + y) + f (x + 2 * y)) ↔ 
  ∃ a, f = omnimath3788_answer a := by sorry. Enumerated answers: f(n) = -5 * n
f(n) = -4 * n
f(n) = -3 * n
f(n) = -2 * n
f(n) = -1 * n
f(n) = 0 * n
f(n) = 1 * n
f(n) = 2 * n
f(n) = 3 * n
f(n) = 4 * n
f(n) = 5 * n. Expected Answer Type: ℤ → ℤ → ℤ
Based on the pattern in enumerations, the solutions are linear functions with slopes from -5 to 5. Letting \(a\) be the slope, the closed form is \(f(n) = a \times n\).  
Final answer:
<<<fun a : ℤ => fun n : ℤ => a * n>>>
