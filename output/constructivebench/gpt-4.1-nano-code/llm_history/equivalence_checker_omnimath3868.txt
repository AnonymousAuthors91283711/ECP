Ground Truth Answer: { fun x => x, fun x => 1 / x }
Proposed Answer: { f | ∃ c : ℝ, ∀ x, f x = c * x }
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding all positive real-valued functions f (where f(x) > 0 when x > 0) that satisfy a certain functional equation involving ratios of sums of squares.

2. The ground truth answer gives two specific solutions: the identity function f(x) = x and the reciprocal function f(x) = 1/x.

3. The proposed answer suggests that all solutions are linear functions f(x) = c*x for some constant c.

Analysis:
- The identity function f(x) = x is indeed a solution (when c=1).
- The reciprocal function f(x) = 1/x is not of the form c*x, so it's not included in the proposed answer.
- We can verify that f(x) = 1/x satisfies the given condition:
  For w*x = y*z, the equation becomes:
  (1/w² + 1/x²)/(1/y² + 1/z²) = (w² + x²)/(y² + z²)
  Which can be shown to hold true when w*x = y*z.

Conclusion:
The proposed answer is missing the reciprocal solution, so it's not complete. The ground truth answer is correct as it includes both solutions.
