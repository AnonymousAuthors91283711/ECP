Found solution: M=5, k=1, n=5
Found solution: M=6, k=1, n=6
Found solution: M=7, k=1, n=7
Found solution: M=8, k=1, n=8
Found solution: M=9, k=1, n=9
Found solution: M=10, k=1, n=10
Found solution: M=11, k=1, n=11
Found solution: M=12, k=1, n=12
Found solution: M=13, k=1, n=13
Found solution: M=14, k=1, n=14
Found solution: M=15, k=1, n=15
Found solution: M=16, k=1, n=16
Found solution: M=17, k=1, n=17
Found solution: M=18, k=1, n=18
Found solution: M=19, k=1, n=19
Found solution: M=20, k=1, n=20
Candidates for M where the equation holds for some small k, n: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
<<<{m : ℕ | 1 ≤ m}>>>

This set includes all positive integers since the solutions suggest that for any M ≥ 1, there exists (k=1, n=M) satisfying a M k = n.
