  (hw : 1 ≤ w ∧ w ≤ 9) (hx : 0 ≤ x ∧ x ≤ 9) (hy : 0 ≤ y ∧ y ≤ 9) (hz : 0 ≤ z ∧ z ≤ 9) :
  1000*w + 100*x + 10*y + z + 100*x + 10*y + z + 10*y + z + z = 2014 ↔ w + x + y + z = omnimath3130_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 13. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the pattern and sum constraints, the equation simplifies to: 1000w + 320x + 31y + 4z = 2014, with the sum w + x + y + z = 13. To satisfy the sum constraint and limit the digit ranges, the most plausible value for the sum is the total of all variables, leading to the answer being 13.
