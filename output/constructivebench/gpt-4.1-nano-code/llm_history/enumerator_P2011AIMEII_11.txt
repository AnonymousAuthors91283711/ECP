The problem involves a sequence of determinant calculations of matrices \( M(n) \) and a sum involving their determinants. Since the sum involves infinite series and determinants of specific matrices, the key is to analyze the pattern of the determinants \( D(n) \).

Given the structure of the matrix \( M(n) \):

- Diagonal entries are 10.
- Off-diagonals immediately adjacent are 3.
- All other entries are 0.

This is a tridiagonal matrix of size \( n \). Let's analyze small cases to find a pattern for \( D(n) \).

For small \( n \):

- \( D(1) = \det([10]) = 10 \).
- \( D(2) = \det \begin{bmatrix} 10 & 3 \\ 3 & 10 \end{bmatrix} = 10 \times 10 - 3 \times 3 = 100 - 9 = 91 \).
- \( D(3) = \det \begin{bmatrix} 10 & 3 & 0 \\ 3 & 10 & 3 \\ 0 & 3 & 10 \end{bmatrix} \).

Using the recurrence for tridiagonal determinants:

\[
D(n) = aD(n-1) - b^2 D(n-2),
\]

where \( a=10 \), \( b=3 \).

Checking:

- \( D(2) = 10 \times 10 - 3^2 = 100 - 9 = 91 \).
- \( D(3) = 10 \times 91 - 9 \times 10 = 910 - 90 = 820 \).

Let's verify \( D(3) \):

\[
D(3) = 10 \times D(2) - 9 \times D(1) = 10 \times 91 - 9 \times 10 = 910 - 90 = 820.
\]

Similarly,

\[
D(4) = 10 \times 820 - 9 \times 91 = 8200 - 819 = 7381.
\]

Notice the recurrence:

\[
D(n) = 10 D(n-1) - 9 D(n-2),
\]

with initial values \( D(1)=10 \), \( D(2)=91 \).

Let's write a small Python code to generate these determinants and sum the series.

The sum:

\[
\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{8 D(n+1) + 1}
\]

can be approximated numerically by summing a large number of terms and looking for patterns or closed-form values.

Here's a Python program to enumerate \( D(n) \) for small \( n \), check the sum, and conjecture \( p, q \).

```python
# Pattern analysis for D(n):
# Recurrence: D(n) = 10*D(n-1) - 9*D(n-2)
# with D(1)=10, D(2)=91

def generate_D(max_n):
    D = [0, 10, 91]  # Indexing from 1 for convenience
    for n in range(3, max_n + 1):
        D.append(10 * D[n - 1] - 9 * D[n - 2])
    return D[1:]  # return from D(1)

# Generate a list of determinants
n_terms = 20
D_list = generate_D(n_terms + 1)  # D(1) to D(n_terms+1)

# Sum the series numerically
series_sum = 0.0
for n in range(n_terms + 1):
    denom = 8 * D_list[n] + 1
    series_sum += 1 / denom
    print(f"n={n}, D({n+1})={D_list[n]}, 1/({denom})={1/denom}")

# Approximate sum
print(f"Approximate sum: {series_sum}")

# The sum seems to converge to a rational value; attempt to find its pattern
# Since D(n) grows rapidly, the series converges quickly.

# Conjecture:
# The pattern suggests the sum is related to simple fractions (p/q).
# Sum approx equals to some rational p/q; p + q can be guessed.

# For demonstration purposes, let's deduce p/q by comparison:
# For large n, terms are tiny, sum stabilizes.

# Now, output the plausible candidate answer:
# For example, if sum ~ 1, then p/q = 1/1
# If sum ~ 0.5, then 1/2, etc.

# Given the rapid growth of D(n), the series converges to a number close to 1.

# Based on the partial sum:
# Final code might suggest p=1, q=1, total sum approx 1

# Let's print the result as fraction:
from fractions import Fraction
approx_fraction = Fraction(series_sum).limit_denominator()
print(f"Sum as fraction: {approx_fraction}")
print(f"p={approx_fraction.numerator}, q={approx_fraction.denominator}, p+q={approx_fraction.numerator + approx_fraction.denominator}")
```

---

This code generates \( D(n) \), sums the series, and approximates the sum as a rational \( p/q \) to conjecture the answer. It shows the pattern through small cases and the sum's convergence, guiding the identification of \( p \) and \( q \).

Given the convergence behavior, the sum likely simplifies to a rational number with numerator and denominator close to small integers, aiding in formulating the desired conjecture, which can then be rigorously proved.
