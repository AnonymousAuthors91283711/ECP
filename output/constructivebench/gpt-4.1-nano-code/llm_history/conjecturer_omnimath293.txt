theorem omnimath293 (a b : ℕ) (ha : 0 < a) (hb : 0 < b) :
  (∃ k : ℕ, (a^3 * b - 1) = k * (a + 1)) ∧ (∃ m : ℕ, (b^3 * a + 1) = m * (b - 1)) ↔ (a, b) ∈ omnimath293_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: (1, 3)
(2, 2)
(3, 3). Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ)
Given the pattern and the enumerated solutions, the plausible general form aligns with the pairs where a = b, including a special case (1, 3). Observing the solutions: (1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 3), a common pattern emerges: either a = b, or (a, b) = (1, 3).

Therefore, the set includes all pairs with a = b, plus the special case (1, 3). Thus, the description is:
- All pairs where a = b.
- The pair (1, 3).

Final answer: <<<{ (a, b) | a = b } ∪ { (1, 3) }>>>
