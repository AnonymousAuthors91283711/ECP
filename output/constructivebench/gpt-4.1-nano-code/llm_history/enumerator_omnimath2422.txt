The problem involves counting paths in a 6-step hypercube where each move changes exactly 2 bits, starting and ending with all bits false. To enumerate possible paths, we'll consider small sample parameters: the 5-bit positions and the constraints on the path.

Since moves change exactly 2 bits, each step transitions between nodes differing in 2 bits. The path begins and ends with all bits false, and each intermediate step also involves toggling 2 bits relative to the previous node.

Given the small dimensions, enumerate all paths respecting the constraints.

```python
# Enumerate all possible 6-step paths in a 5-bit hypercube starting/ending with all bits false,
# where each move toggles exactly 2 bits.
# We generate all sequences of nodes with the specified constraints.

from itertools import product, combinations

def toggle_bits(node, coords):
    # toggle bits at given positions
    return tuple((bit ^ 1) if i in coords else bit for i, bit in enumerate(node))

bits_positions = range(5)
all_nodes = list(product([False, True], repeat=5))

# Precompute adjacency: nodes connected if differ in exactly 2 bits
adj = {}
for n in all_nodes:
    adj[n] = []
    for m in all_nodes:
        diff = sum(a != b for a, b in zip(n, m))
        if diff == 2:
            adj[n].append(m)

paths_count = 0
start_node = (False,)*5

# Generate sequences of length 6
for path in product(all_nodes, repeat=6):
    # Check start and end conditions
    if path[0] != start_node or path[-1] != start_node:
        continue
    # Check each step differs by toggling 2 bits
    valid = True
    for i in range(5):
        diff = sum(a != b for a, b in zip(path[i], path[i+1]))
        if diff != 2:
            valid = False
            break
    if valid:
        print(path)
        paths_count += 1

print(f"Total paths: {paths_count}")
```
