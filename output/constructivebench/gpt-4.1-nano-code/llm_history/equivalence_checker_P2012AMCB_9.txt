Ground Truth Answer: fun t_walk t_move => (t_walk * t_move) / (t_walk - t_move)
Proposed Answer: fun t_walk t_move => 40 + (t_walk - 60) * 0.65 + (t_move - 24) * 0.11
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for a general function of t_walk and t_move that evaluates to 40 when t_walk = 60 and t_move = 24.

2. The ground truth answer is a rational function that satisfies:
   - (60 * 24)/(60 - 24) = 1440/36 = 40
   - And provides correct values for other inputs

3. The proposed answer is a linear approximation:
   - It equals 40 when t_walk=60 and t_move=24
   - But for other values, it's just a linear approximation of the true function

The proposed answer is only correct at the specific point (60,24) but not equivalent to the ground truth function. It's a local linearization rather than the actual solution.
