  (h : r₁ * r₂ = 8 ∧ r₁ + r₂ = 180) :
  r₁ / (r₂ ^ (1/3)) + r₂ / (r₁ ^ (1/3)) = olympiadbench2739_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Error: Program is empty. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The problem provides symmetric relations between \( r_1 \) and \( r_2 \): their sum and product. Recognizing the pattern resembles solving quadratic roots, and the symmetry suggests the answer may involve the sum \( r_1 + r_2 \) and their geometric mean \( \sqrt{r_1 r_2} \). Given the symmetry, the exponents suggest cube roots, and the formula simplifies when expressing in terms of the roots of a quadratic. The sum is 180; the product is 8. Hence, the roots are related to the roots of \( x^2 - 180x + 8 = 0 \).

Final answer simplifies to \( 2 \times 180 / \sqrt[3]{8} \), which is \( 2 \times 180 / 2 = 180 \).

<<<180>>>
