This problem involves analyzing a set \( S \) defined by some complex equations involving an element \( z \), and then finding all real \( k \) satisfying certain uniqueness and distance conditions. The goal appears to be to determine the sum of all such \( k \), which forms the conjectured answer.

To proceed, I'll:
- Fix some parameters for the complex point \( z \).
- Explore the geometric conditions:
  - \( |25 + 20i - z| = 5 \): \( z \) lies on a circle centered at \( 25 + 20i \) with radius 5.
  - \( |z - 4 - k| = |z - 3i - k| \): the distances from \( z \) to two points differ by a constant shift depending on \( k \).
- Since the problem is about the uniqueness of \( z \) for each \( k \), I will numerically sample candidate \( k \) values and check for solutions \( z \).

The likely key step:
- For each candidate \( k \), check if there's a unique \( z \) satisfying these conditions.
- Collect such \( k \) into a set and sum them.

Because the code must be efficient and quick, I will:
- Use a small discrete sample over \( k \)-values.
- Approximate conditions numerically to find solutions.
- Output each candidate \( k \) that matches the criteria immediately upon discovery.

Now, here's the Python code:

```python
import numpy as np

# Define constants
circle_center = np.array([25, 20])  # center of circle for z
circle_radius = 5

# Range of k to examine
k_values = np.linspace(-10, 10, 200)  # sample k in [-10, 10]

# Collect solutions
solutions = []

for k in k_values:
    solutions_for_k = []
    # Discretize z around the circle
    angles = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 100)
    for angle in angles:
        z = circle_center + circle_radius * np.array([np.cos(angle), np.sin(angle)])
        z_complex = z[0] + 1j * z[1]
        dist1 = abs(25 + 20j - z_complex)
        dist2_1 = abs(z_complex - 4 - k)
        dist2_2 = abs(z_complex - 3j - k)
        # For the second condition: distances to points differ
        diff = abs(dist2_1 - dist2_2)
        # Check if the point satisfies the conditions approximately
        if abs(dist1 - 5) < 0.1:
            # Check if the difference in distances equals zero (within tolerance)
            if diff < 0.1:
                solutions_for_k.append(z_complex)
    # Check if there's exactly one solution (within tolerance)
    if len(solutions_for_k) == 1:
        k_value = k
        solutions.append(k_value)
        print(f"Found candidate k: {k_value:.3f}")

# Sum all such k to get the answer
answer = sum(solutions)
print(f"Sum of all k: {answer}")
```

This script:
- Samples \( z \) on the circle fulfilling the first condition.
- Checks the second condition roughly.
- Collects \( k \) values where exactly one \( z \) satisfies conditions.
- Outputs candidate \( k \) immediately, then sums and reports.

This approach approximates the solutions, suitable for conjecturing the true answer, paves the way toward a formal proof.
