noncomputable abbrev P2007AMCB_13_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2007AMCB_13 : 
  let cycle := 30 + 3 + 30
  let change_intervals := 3 + 3  -- 3 seconds at end of green (yellow transition), 3 seconds at end of yellow (red transition)
  change_intervals / cycle = P2007AMCB_13_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Exact ratio: 2/21 (approx. 0.0952). Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The ratio is simplified to (6 / (2 * 30 + 3 + 30 + 3)) = 6 / 96 = 1 / 16; But the target ratio is 2/21, consistent with the proportion of the yellow interval to the total cycle.

Final answer: <<<2 / 21>>>
