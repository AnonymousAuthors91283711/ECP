The problem provides a system of linear equations:
h1: x + 2y - 3z = 7
h2: 2x - y + 2z = 6
and asks to find the value of 8x + y.

To enumerate potential solutions, we can parametrize z (since the system is likely underdetermined) and solve for x and y in terms of z. Then, compute 8x + y for several z values. We will print each candidate result immediately, focusing on exact rational or decimal approximations.

Here's the plan:
- Loop over small integer values for z (e.g., from -10 to 10).
- Solve for x and y using substitution.
- Compute 8x + y.
- Print each result.

```python
# Enumerate solutions for z in a small range,
# solve for x and y, then compute 8x + y.
for z in range(-10, 11):
    # System:
    # x + 2y - 3z = 7  => x + 2y = 7 + 3z
    # 2x - y + 2z = 6 => 2x - y = 6 - 2z
    # Solve for x and y:
    # From first: x = 7 + 3z - 2y
    # Substitute into second:
    # 2(7 + 3z - 2y) - y = 6 - 2z
    # 14 + 6z - 4y - y = 6 - 2z
    # 14 + 6z - 5y = 6 - 2z
    # -5y = 6 - 2z - 14 - 6z
    # -5y = -8 - 8z
    # y = (8 + 8z)/5
    y_num = 8 + 8 * z
    y_den = 5
    y = y_num / y_den
    x = (7 + 3 * z - 2 * y)
    answer = 8 * x + y
    print(answer)
```
