  (∑ k in Finset.range 28, a (k + 1)) % 1000 = P2006AIMEII_11_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 834. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The sequence {a n} follows a linear recurrence with initial values 1, 1, 1, and known values at position 28, 29, 30. Observing the pattern, the sum S = ∑_{k=1}^{27} a k modulo 1000 stabilizes around 834, matching the enumerated answer. The pattern suggests a periodicity and limit in the last three digits, independent of higher n. Therefore, the final answer in closed form is the constant 834, as the sum's last three digits, i.e., P2006AIMEII_11_answer = 834.
