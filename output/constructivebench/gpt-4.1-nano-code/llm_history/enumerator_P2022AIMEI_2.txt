The problem appears to be about finding a three-digit number \( P \) with digits \( a, b, c \), satisfying specific algebraic conditions involving permutations and sum relations. The key is:

- \( P = a + 9b + 81c \)
- \( P = b + 9c + 81a \)
- Digits \( a, b, c \) are each less than 9 (i.e., from 0 to 8)
- The number \( P \) is formed from these digits.

Given the symmetrical relationships, we want to find all digit triplets that satisfy the equations, then pick the candidate answer \( P \).

Let's write a Python script that enumerates all triples \((a, b, c)\) with each digit from 0 to 8, checks whether the equations hold, and if so, computes \( P \). We will print each suitable \( P \) immediately when found.

```python
# Iterate through all possible digits a, b, c from 0 to 8
for a in range(9):
    for b in range(9):
        for c in range(9):
            # Check the two conditions
            P1 = a + 9*b + 81*c
            P2 = b + 9*c + 81*a
            if P1 == P2:
                # Ensure that P corresponds to the digits (a, b, c)
                # The number formed could be either P1 or P2; they are equal here
                P = P1
                print(P)
```
