Solutions:
Solution 1: x + y = 2008.5707963267948
Solution 2: x + y = 2013.7113924685068. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Conjecture based on pattern and data, utilizing sine and cosine relations with bounded y. The sum x + y appears close to 2008 + y or 2012 + y, but given the approximate values and constraints, the consistent candidate is around 2008 + π/2. 

Thus, the final answer is:
<<<2008 + π / 2>>>
