The given theorem appears to specify a functional equation involving a function \(f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\):
\[ \forall x, y \in \mathbb{R}, \quad f(\lfloor x \rfloor \cdot y) = f(x) \cdot \lfloor f(y) \rfloor. \]
Our goal is to explore solutions to this functional equation to understand the possible forms of \(f\).

For such problems, a common approach is to test specific values and simple functions to deduce properties about \(f\). We consider simple candidates like constant functions, zero functions, identity functions, and functions related to \(\lfloor x \rfloor\). We do a small enumeration over plausible types of solutions.

```python
# Enumerating simple candidate functions to understand the solutions to the functional equation.
# We focus on candidate functions like zero function, identity, constant functions, and functions involving floor.
# We print candidate functions if they satisfy the given functional equation for sampled points.

def f_zero(x):
    return 0

def f_identity(x):
    return x

def f_const_c(c):
    return lambda x: c

def check_solution(f, test_points):
    for x in test_points:
        for y in test_points:
            try:
                lhs = f((x // 1) * y)  # floor(x) * y
                rhs = f(x) * int(f(y))  # floor(f(y))
                if abs(lhs - rhs) > 1e-6:
                    return False
            except Exception:
                return False
    return True

test_points = [0, 1, 2, -1, -2, 0.5, -0.5]

# Check zero function
if check_solution(f_zero, test_points):
    print("f(x) = 0 is a solution.")

# Check identity
if check_solution(f_identity, test_points):
    print("f(x) = x is a solution.")

# Check constant functions for some sample constants
for c in [-1, 0, 1, 2]:
    f_const = f_const_c(c)
    if check_solution(f_const, test_points):
        print(f"f(x) = {c} is a solution.")

# Note: These tests are heuristic; to fully verify, symbolic checks or exhaustive testing over domain would be needed.
