theorem omnimath52 (a n : ℕ) (ha : a > 0) (hn : n > 0) :
  n ∣ ((a + 1)^n - a^n) ↔ (a, n) ∈ omnimath52_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: { (a, n) | n = 1 ∧ a > 0 }
Proposed Answer: {(a, n) | 1 ≤ a}
Let's analyze the problem and answers:

1. The problem asks when n divides (a+1)^n - a^n for positive integers a and n.

2. The ground truth answer states this only happens when n=1 (for any a>0), which is correct because:
   - For n=1: (a+1)^1 - a^1 = 1, which is divisible by n=1
   - For n>1: The expression (a+1)^n - a^n grows too rapidly to be divisible by n in general

3. The proposed answer {(a, n) | 1 ≤ a} is incorrect because:
   - It doesn't constrain n at all (allowing any n>0)
   - It's missing the crucial condition that n must be 1
   - While it correctly includes a>0, this is insufficient

The proposed answer is wrong because it fails to capture the essential condition on n.
