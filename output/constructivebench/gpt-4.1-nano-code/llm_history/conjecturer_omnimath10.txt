Possible independent set size: 14
Possible independent set size: 15. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The constraints imply a maximum independent set size under the degree bound of 5 and 30 vertices. Given the pattern from enumerated solutions, the larger sets are disallowed by the conditions, and the threshold appears at 15. Therefore, the maximum independent set size is 15.
