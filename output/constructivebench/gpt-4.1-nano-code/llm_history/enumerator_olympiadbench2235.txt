The problem appears to involve functions `s : Fin 2 → Fin 5 → ℤ` with certain conditions: each `s i` (for i in Fin 2) is strictly monotonic, and for each `i`, the sums of squares satisfy a Pythagorean relation. The goal is to find all functions `s` satisfying these conditions, and to identify `olympiadbench2235_answer`.

Since the problem involves small finite domains (`Fin 2` and `Fin 5`), we can enumerate all possible monotonic functions `s i : Fin 5 → ℤ`. Because `Fin 5` consists of 5 elements (0..4), and `s i` should be strictly monotonic, we consider possible ascending sequences for each `s i`. The squares equality indicates Pythagorean triples, so potential candidate triples correspond to small Pythag triples.

Here's a plan:
- Enumerate all strictly increasing sequences of length 5 for `s i`.
- For each, check the sum of squares conditions at positions 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
- For each pair `(s 0, s 1)` that satisfies the sum of squares condition for each `i`, print the sequence.
- Since `s` maps `Fin 2` to `Fin 5 → ℤ`, total candidates are manageable with small search space.

Now, implement the enumeration:

```python
# Enumerate strictly increasing sequences of length 5 within a small range
# For each sequence, check the sum of squares condition for the first three elements versus the last two
def generate_sequences(start, end):
    from itertools import combinations
    for seq in combinations(range(start, end), 5):
        yield list(seq)

# Check if the sum of squares of first three equals the sum of squares of last two
def is_pythag_triplet(seq):
    return sum(x**2 for x in seq[:3]) == sum(x**2 for x in seq[3:])

# We will try small integer values (-20 to 20) for candidate sequences
# to find those satisfying the Pythagorean relation in the sequences
candidates_s = []

for seq in generate_sequences(-20, 20):
    if is_pythag_triplet(seq):
        candidates_s.append(seq)

# For each candidate sequence for s i, check both i=0 and i=1
for s0 in candidates_s:
    for s1 in candidates_s:
        # For each position in 0..4, check the sum of squares condition
        valid = True
        for i_seq in [s0, s1]:
            if not is_pythag_triplet(i_seq):
                valid = False
                break
        if valid:
            # Output candidate functions as an example (done as a single combined function)
            print(f's0: {s0}')
            print(f's1: {s1}')
```
