theorem olympiadbench2570 (a b c : ℤ) :
    (b - a = c - b ∧ a + b + c = 60 ∧ ∃ r, (a - 2) * r = b ∧ b * r = c + 3) ↔ 
    (a, b, c) ∈ olympiadbench2570_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Error: Program is empty. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℤ × ℤ × ℤ)
The conditions imply an arithmetic progression with common difference, and linear relations. Solving gives fixed values of a, b, c. 

The answer set includes all triples satisfying the derived relations, which simplifies to specific fixed points.
