This problem involves finding the greatest natural number n for which there exists a certain function X from Fin n to finite sets of natural numbers satisfying a specific union-cardinality condition based on the square root of the triple product of indices. To explore possible answers, we'll iterate over small values of n, construct candidate functions X (like singleton sets or simple patterns), and check if the condition can be met. We'll print each candidate n and the constructed X to generate conjectures.

Given the structure, start with small n, generate simple X assignments, verify the union cardinal condition for all triples, and print the resulting maximum n satisfying the condition. We'll limit n to a small range due to complexity and output constraints.

```python
import math
from itertools import combinations, product

# Function to check the condition for a given n and a candidate X
def check_condition(n, X):
    for a, b, c in combinations(range(n), 3):
        a_idx, b_idx, c_idx = a, b, c
        # Compute the union size
        union_size = len(X[a_idx].union(X[b_idx]).union(X[c_idx]))
        # Calculate the target ceiling value
        target = math.ceil(math.sqrt(a_idx * b_idx * c_idx))
        if union_size != target:
            return False
    return True

max_n_found = 0
max_n_config = None

# Explore small n from 3 (minimum for triples) up to 10 for demonstration
for n in range(3, 11):
    # Generate simple candidate X: assign singleton sets {a} for each index
    X = {i: {i} for i in range(n)}
    if check_condition(n, X):
        print(f"n={n}, X={X}")
        max_n_found = n
        max_n_config = X
    else:
        # Try uniform sets (e.g., empty or entire set) or small variations
        # For demonstration, we keep singleton sets
        pass

print(f"Maximum n satisfying the condition: {max_n_found}")
```
