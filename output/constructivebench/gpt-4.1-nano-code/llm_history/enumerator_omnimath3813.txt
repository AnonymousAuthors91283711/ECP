This problem essentially asks for the smallest integer \(b\) such that within some interval \([a+1, a+b]\), there exist two distinct integers \(k, l\) with a GCD of \(k^2 + k + 1\) and \(l^2 + l + 1\) greater than 1. In other words, we're looking for the minimal length \(b\) of an interval where two such polynomial expressions share a common factor greater than 1, for some starting point \(a\).

A key observation is that \(k^2 + k + 1\) often shares common factors with \(l^2 + l + 1\) when \(k\) and \(l\) have related residues modulo some small primes, especially their common divisors.

To find the minimal such \(b\), we test small values systematically, checking for pairs \((k, l)\), and find the minimal interval length \(\max(k, l) - \min(k, l) + 1\) where the GCD exceeds 1.

The program:
- Sets starting values \(a\) and searches over small \(k, l\).
- Checks if their associated polynomials share a factor.
- Keeps track of the minimal interval length \(b\).

```python
import math

# Function to compute the gcd of k^2 + k + 1 and l^2 + l + 1
def gcd_poly(k, l):
    return math.gcd(k**2 + k + 1, l**2 + l + 1)

# Search small values for pairs with common factors > 1
answers = []

# Examine pairs with k, l in a reasonable small range
for a in range(1, 20):
    for k in range(a, a + 50):
        val_k = k**2 + k + 1
        for l in range(a, a + 50):
            if l != k:
                val_l = l**2 + l + 1
                g = math.gcd(val_k, val_l)
                if g != 1:
                    b = max(k, l) - min(k, l) + 1
                    answers.append((a, b, k, l, g))
                    print(f"a={a}, interval=[{a+1},{a+b}], k={k}, l={l}, gcd={g}")

# Find minimal b across collected answers
if answers:
    min_b = min(ans[1] for ans in answers)
    for ans in answers:
        if ans[1] == min_b:
            # Output the minimal interval
            a = ans[0]
            b = ans[1]
            print(f"Minimal interval length b={b} starting from a={a} with pair ({ans[2]}, {ans[3]}) having gcd={ans[4]}")        
```
