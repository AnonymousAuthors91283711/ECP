  IsGreatest {s : ℕ | ∃ (l : List ℕ), l.Pairwise (· < ·) ∧
    (∀ p ∈ l, Nat.Prime p ∧ p < 50 ∧ ∃ (a k : ℕ), a^k = p + 1 ∧ k ≥ 2) ∧
    s = l.sum} omnimath2660_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 3
7
10
Maximum sum: 10. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The answer set's maximum sum is achieved when including primes less than 50 with (p + 1) being a perfect power with exponent ≥ 2. Given the enumeration, the highest sum is 10, likely from the subset {7, 3} because 7+1=8=2^3, 3+1=4=2^2. The sum of these primes is 7 + 3 = 10.
