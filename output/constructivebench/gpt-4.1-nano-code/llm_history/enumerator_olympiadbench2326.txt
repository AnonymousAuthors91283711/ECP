This problem involves identifying all integers \(k \neq 0\) for which the quadratic equations \(k x^2 + 6 x + k = 0\) (and similarly for \(x_2\)) both have real, distinct solutions, and these solutions \(x_1, x_2\) are distinct.

To analyze this, note that for each fixed integer \(k \neq 0\):

- The quadratic \(k x^2 + 6 x + k = 0\) has discriminant \(\Delta = 36 - 4k^2\).
- Real solutions exist if \(\Delta \geq 0 \Rightarrow 36 - 4k^2 \geq 0 \Rightarrow k^2 \leq 9 \Rightarrow |k| \leq 3\).
- The solutions are \(x = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{2k}\).

For the solutions \(x_1, x_2\), to be distinct, we need \(\sqrt{\Delta} \neq 0\), i.e., \(\Delta \neq 0\). So:

\(\Delta \neq 0 \Rightarrow 36 - 4k^2 \neq 0 \Rightarrow 4k^2 \neq 36 \Rightarrow k^2 \neq 9 \Rightarrow |k| \neq 3\).

Thus, the possible integer \(k\) values are:

- \(-2, -1, 1, 2\), since these satisfy \(k^2 \leq 4\), and are not equal to \(\pm 3\).

For each such \(k\):
- Verify that the roots are real and distinct.
- The roots are distinct as long as discriminant is positive: \(\Delta > 0\):

Check for \(k=1\):

\(\Delta=36 - 4(1)^2=36-4=32>0\), roots are real and distinct.

Similarly for \(k=2\):

\(\Delta=36 - 4(4)=36-16=20>0\).

For \(k=-1\):

\(\Delta=36 - 4(1)=36-4=32>0\).

For \(k=-2\):

\(\Delta=36 - 4(4)=20>0\).

Now, find the roots \(x_1, x_2\):

For a general \(k\neq 0\):

\[
x = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4k^2}}{2k}
\]

Note that the roots are distinct because \(\Delta \neq 0\).

Now, we are to collect:

\[
\left\{ k \in \mathbb{Z} \setminus \{0\} \mid \text{the quadratic has two distinct real solutions} \right\}
\]

with corresponding solutions.

To generate all these candidates efficiently, a Python program can:

- Iterate over small integer \(k\) in \([-3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3]\) (excluding 0 and 3, -3 since they make discriminant zero or negative).
- For each \(k\), check discriminant > 0.
- Compute roots and output root values.

Here is a Python code to do this:

```python
import math

# List possible k values, exclude 0 and those with zero discriminant
candidate_ks = [-2, -1, 1, 2]

for k in candidate_ks:
    discriminant = 36 - 4 * k * k
    if discriminant > 0:
        sqrt_disc = math.sqrt(discriminant)
        x1 = (-6 + sqrt_disc) / (2 * k)
        x2 = (-6 - sqrt_disc) / (2 * k)
        # Output each k and solution pair as soon as computed
        print(f'k = {k}: solutions x1 = {x1}, x2 = {x2}')
```

This enumerates all relevant values and solutions immediately, aligning with requirements, and remains efficient.
