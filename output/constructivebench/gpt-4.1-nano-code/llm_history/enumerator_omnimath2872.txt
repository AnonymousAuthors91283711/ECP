The problem appears to involve finding the maximum value of n within certain constraints involving sums over intervals, with parameters k and m, where m ≥ 4, and n is the sum of integers in some interval. The set of such n is from 1 up to an unknown maximum (omnimath2872_answer). The goal is to determine the maximum possible n, given the constraints.

Given m≥4, and n=sum of integers from i=k to i=k+m-1, sum_{i=k}^{k+m-1} i= sum_{i=1}^{k+m-1} i - sum_{i=1}^{k-1} i = ((k+m-1)* (k+m) / 2) - ((k-1)*k/2).

To find the maximum n, we should vary k ≥ 1 and m ≥ 4, with m and k small for enumeration. For efficiency, limit m to up to, say, 50, and k up to some reasonable value, e.g., 100.

The maximum sum occurs when both k and m are large, but to keep it manageable, we consider m from 4 to 50, and k from 1 up to 100.

We track the maximum sum encountered, streaming each sum when found.

```python
# Enumerate all sums of intervals [k, k+m-1], with m≥4, k≥1
# Print each sum when found, track maximum value
max_n = 0
for m in range(4, 51):
    for k in range(1, 101):
        # sum from k to k+m-1: sum = S(k+m-1) - S(k-1)
        sum_end = (k + m - 1) * (k + m) // 2
        sum_start = (k - 1) * k // 2
        n = sum_end - sum_start
        # or directly:
        # n = sum(i=k to k+m-1) i
        print(n)
        if n > max_n:
            max_n = n
print(f"Maximum n found: {max_n}")
```
