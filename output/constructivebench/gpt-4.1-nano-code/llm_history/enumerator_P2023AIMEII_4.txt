This problem involves a finite set \( S \subset \mathbb{R} \) defined by specific symmetric relations between its elements \( x,y,z \). The sum of the squares of the elements in \( S \) is asked for, given the conditions involving sums of the elements and their powers.

To help conjecture the answer, I will:
- Generate possible triples \( (x,y,z) \) satisfying the given conditions.
- Derive the set \( S \) from these solutions.
- Compute the sum of squares over these elements.

The key steps:
- Use symmetric sums to analyze the conditions.
- For simplicity, choose small sample values to find solutions.
- Enumerate the solutions systematically.

Here is the code:

```python
# Given the problem's symmetric nature, analyze basic solutions to the system:
# x + y + z = 1
# x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2
# x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 3
# We attempt to find possible solutions by fixing one variable and solving for others.

from itertools import product

# Set small candidate values to find solutions
candidates = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]

solutions = set()

for x, y in product(candidates, repeat=2):
    z = 1 - x - y
    # Check if the relations hold approximately (exact checks for these small sets)
    if abs(x + y + z - 1) < 1e-8:
        if abs(x**2 + y**2 + z**2 - 2) < 1e-8:
            if abs(x**3 + y**3 + z**3 - 3) < 1e-8:
                solutions.add((x, y, z))
                print(f"Found solution: x={x}, y={y}, z={z}")

# Extract the unique elements from solutions
elements = set()
for trio in solutions:
    elements.update(trio)

# Output the sum of squares of these elements as the answer
answer = sum(x**2 for x in elements)
print(f"Sum of squares: {answer}")
```
