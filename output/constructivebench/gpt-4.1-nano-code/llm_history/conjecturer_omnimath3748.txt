theorem omnimath3748 (m n : ℕ) (hm : 0 < m) (hn : 0 < n) :
  m ∣ (9^(natAbs (m - n)) + 3^(natAbs (m - n)) + 1) ∧ 
  n ∣ (9^(natAbs (m - n)) + 3^(natAbs (m - n)) + 1) ↔ 
  (m, n) ∈ omnimath3748_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Pair (m, n)=(1, 1) with difference 0 divides 3
Pair (m, n)=(3, 3) with difference 0 divides 3. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ)
<<<{(m, n) | m = n}>>>

The difference is zero; both m and n divide the sum, which reduces to 3, since 9^0 + 3^0 + 1 = 3. Hence, the set includes all pairs where m equals n.
