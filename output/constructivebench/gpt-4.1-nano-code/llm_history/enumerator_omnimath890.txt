The problem appears to ask for the greatest natural number \(a\) such that there exist positive integers \(b,c\) satisfying \(a + b + c = \gcd(a, b) + \gcd(b, c) + \gcd(c, a) + 120\), with all variables positive. We need to find the maximum \(a\) meeting this condition by enumerating possible solutions with small values for \(b, c\).

Approach:
- Fix small values of \(b, c\) 
- For each pair, compute \(\gcd(a, b), \gcd(b, c), \gcd(c, a)\)
- Derive \(a = \text{sum of gcds} + 120 - (b + c)\)
- Check if \(a\) is positive integer, then record and print candidates
- Continue to find the maximum \(a\)

```python
import math

max_a = 0

# Enumerate small positive values for b and c
for b in range(1, 101):
    for c in range(1, 101):
        gcd_ab = math.gcd(b, b)  # gcd(a, b) depends on a, but since a is unknown, handle differently
        # Instead, since a is unknown, express as: a = gcd(a,b) + gcd(b,c) + gcd(c,a) + 120 - b - c
        # But gcd(a,b) depends on a; need a different approach
        # Instead, guess values for gcd(a,b), gcd(a,c) that satisfy the conditions

        # For simplicity, iterate over plausible gcds
        for gcd_ab in range(1, min(b, 101)):
            for gcd_ac in range(1, min(c, 101)):
                # gcd_b_c based on b and c
                gcd_bc = math.gcd(b, c)
                # Now, a = gcd(a, b), but gcd(a, b) can be any divisor of a and b
                # To satisfy the gcd condition, pick a multiple of gcd_ab
                for potential_a in range(gcd_ab, 200, gcd_ab):
                    # Check if gcd(a, b) = gcd_ab
                    if math.gcd(potential_a, b) != gcd_ab:
                        continue
                    # Check if gcd(a, c) = gcd_ac
                    if math.gcd(potential_a, c) != gcd_ac:
                        continue
                    total_gcd = gcd_ab + gcd_bc + gcd_ac
                    a_calc = total_gcd + 120 - (b + c)
                    if a_calc > 0 and a_calc == potential_a:
                        # Valid candidate
                        print(a_calc)
                        if a_calc > max_a:
                            max_a = a_calc

# After enumeration, print the maximum a found
print("Maximum a:", max_a)
```
