This problem involves finding a specific pair `(a, b)` of real numbers that satisfy the equation

\[ a \times (x + b \times (x + 3)) = 2 \times (x + 6) \quad \text{for all } x \in \mathbb{R} \]

and then proving that this pair is unique.

To approach this computationally in Python, we'll:

- Consider the parameterized form \( a(x) = a \), \( b(x) = b \),
- Derive the relationships algebraically,
- Then verify candidates numerically for different values of \( a \), \( b \), and check the parameterized equation holds for all \( x \). 

Since the problem requires an enumeration and verification approach for contest-level exploration, we will:

- For small sample values of \( a \) and \( b \),
- Check if the equation holds for a set of sample \( x \) values,
- Print all solutions that satisfy the condition within the tested range.

Note: For a problem like this, the analytical solution suggests \( a = 2 \) and \( b = 1 \), but since we're asked for a Python enumeration, we'll implement a brute-force search over small candidate ranges for \( a \) and \( b \).

```python
# Enumerate candidate pairs (a, b)
# Check if the equation holds for multiple sample x values
# For each candidate, verify the relation for several x
# Stream output when found, prioritize specific solutions

def test_relation(a, b, xs):
    for x in xs:
        left = a * (x + b * (x + 3))
        right = 2 * (x + 6)
        if abs(left - right) > 1e-6:
            return False
    return True

def main():
    solutions_found = []
    candidate_range = [i * 0.1 for i in range(-30, 31)]  # from -3.0 to 3.0
    xs = [0, 1, -1, 2, -2, 3, -3]  # sample points for testing
    for a in candidate_range:
        for b in candidate_range:
            if test_relation(a, b, xs):
                print(f"Candidate solution: a={a:.2f}, b={b:.2f}")
                solutions_found.append((a, b))
    # Explicitly output the suspected unique solution if exists
    # Known from algebra: a=2, b=1 satisfies the relation exactly
    # but enumeration will help in conjecturing from data
    
main()
```
