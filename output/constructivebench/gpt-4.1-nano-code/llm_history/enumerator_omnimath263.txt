The problem appears to concern positive rational sequences summing and multiplying to the same number \( n \), with constraints on the sequence length and positivity. I'm asked to suggest possible answers, likely values of \( n \), based on the conditions: existence of a sequence \( a_i > 0 \), with sum and product both equal to \( n \), for \( n > 0 \). I will enumerate small positive integers \( n \), check for feasible sequences, and identify potential candidates.

Here's the process:
- For small \( n \), check if such sequences exist.
- When such sequences exist, yield \( n \) as a candidate.
- Provide a systematic enumeration to find all such \( n \leq 20 \) as sample since larger \( n \) often don't satisfy such strict conditions easily.

This approach balances computational efficiency and appears suitable given the problem's nature.

```python
# Enumerate small n to find values where a sequence of positive rationals exists
import itertools
from fractions import Fraction

def exists_sequence(n, max_k=6):
    # For each sequence length k >= 2
    for k in range(2, max_k + 1):
        # Generate all possible combinations of positive rational candidates (here limited for efficiency)
        # We'll limit trial to very simple candidates to check existence
        # For small n, try integers and fractions with denominator 1, 2, 3
        candidates = [Fraction(i, d) for i in range(1, n+1) for d in [1, 2, 3] if i/d <= n]
        for a in itertools.product(candidates, repeat=k):
            if all(a_i > 0 for a_i in a):
                s = sum(a)
                p = 1
                for a_i in a:
                    p *= a_i
                if s == n and p == n:
                    return True
    return False

max_n = 20
for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
    if exists_sequence(n):
        print(n)
```

**Explanation:**  
- The code searches for sequences of positive rational numbers summing and multiplying to \( n \).  
- It limits sequence length to 6 for efficiency.  
- It tries small numerators and denominators for possible rational sequence elements.  
- If a sequence exists, it prints \( n \).  

This enumeration reveals potential candidate values of \( n \).
