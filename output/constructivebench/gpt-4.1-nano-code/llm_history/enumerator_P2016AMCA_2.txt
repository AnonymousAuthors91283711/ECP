The problem involves solving the algebraic equation:

(10)^x * (100)^{2x} = (1000)^5

First, express all numbers as powers of 10:

- 10 = 10^1
- 100 = 10^2
- 1000 = 10^3

Rewriting the equation:

10^x * (10^2)^{2x} = (10^3)^5

Simplify exponents:

10^x * 10^{4x} = 10^{15}

Combine like bases:

10^{x + 4x} = 10^{15}
10^{5x} = 10^{15}

Since bases are equal and positive:

5x = 15

x = 3

Now, to implement this algebraic solution in code that enumerates possible answers, we could test a range of x and verify the equation holds exactly or approximately, streaming solutions as found.

Here's the code that searches for values of x that satisfy the equation by checking within a small range:

```python
# Enumerate x in steps, checking exact equality for powers
import math

# Since the solution suggests x=3, verify near that and nearby points
candidate_xs = [x/10 for x in range(20, 40)]  # x from 2.0 to 4.0 with step 0.1

for x in candidate_xs:
    left = (10 ** x) * (100 ** (2 * x))
    right = (1000 ** 5)
    # Check if the values are effectively equal (exact if possible)
    if math.isclose(left, right, rel_tol=1e-12):
        print(f"x = {x}")
print("Expected solution: x = 3.0")
```
