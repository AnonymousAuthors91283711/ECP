open Function Real

abbrev omnimath3933_answer : Set (ℝ → ℝ) := sorry
theorem omnimath3933 (f : ℝ → ℝ) :
  (∀ x y, f (f x - f y) = f (f x + f y) - 4 * f x * f y) ↔ f ∈ omnimath3933_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Constant solution: f(x) = 0
Solution: f(x) = 0. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ → ℝ)
The pattern suggests the only solution is the constant zero function. So, the set contains exactly that function.
