abbrev omnimath4135_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath4135 (n : ℕ) :
  (∀ (k : ℕ), (digits 10 k).count 1 = n - 1 → (digits 10 k).count 7 = 1 → Nat.Prime k) ↔ n ∈ omnimath4135_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n = 2 satisfies the property.
Answer set: {2}. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The pattern indicates that for n=2, the key number k with digits satisfying the conditions is prime, and for larger n, no such k exists. The set is therefore {2}.  
Final answer: <<< {2} >>>
