Ground Truth Answer: 127 / 512
Proposed Answer: (-1/16 + 5/32)
Let's analyze the proposed answer and compare it to the ground truth:

1. First, let's simplify the proposed answer:
   -1/16 + 5/32 = -2/32 + 5/32 = 3/32 ≈ 0.09375

2. The ground truth answer is:
   127/512 ≈ 0.248046875

3. These are clearly different values (3/32 ≠ 127/512)

The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't match the ground truth. The simplification shows they're not equivalent.

<<<False>>>
