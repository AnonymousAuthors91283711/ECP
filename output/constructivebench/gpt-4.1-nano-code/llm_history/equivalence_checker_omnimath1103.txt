Ground Truth Answer: 15 * (2013)!
Proposed Answer: 2013! * 24
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about counting fixed points in permutations of a 2013-element set and summing their fourth powers.

2. The ground truth answer is 15 * 2013! which comes from combinatorial analysis of fixed points in permutations.

3. The proposed answer is 2013! * 24, which is different from the ground truth.

4. The correct combinatorial analysis would show that the sum should be 15 * 2013! (as permutations with different numbers of fixed points contribute differently to the sum).

The proposed answer (2013! * 24) is incorrect as it doesn't match the combinatorial calculation. The correct answer should be 15 * 2013!.
