abbrev omnimath2731_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2731 (x : ℝ) :
    (5 + x) / 2 = 7 ∧ (x + 9) / 2 = 12 ∧ (5 + 9) / 2 = 10 ↔ x = omnimath2731_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: x from first equation: 9
x from second equation: 15
omnimath2731_answer: 9
. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The equations simplify to:
(5 + x)/2=7 ⇒ x=9
( x + 9)/2=12 ⇒ x=15
(5+9)/2=10 confirms the constant.

The consistent solution satisfying the first two equations is x=9.
