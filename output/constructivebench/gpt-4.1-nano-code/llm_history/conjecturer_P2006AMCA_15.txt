The infimum (greatest lower bound) of the set is -infinity.. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The error arises because Lean's ℝ doesn't recognize "-∞" as a value; ℝ in Lean is the real number type (e.g., from mathlib's constructions) and does not include infinity. To represent the infimum of a set that extends unbounded downward, the appropriate choice in Lean is `-\infty` from the extended real numbers (`ℝ∞`). However, since our `P2006AMCA_15_answer` is declared as `ℝ`, we cannot assign `-\infty` directly.

**Key reasoning:**
- The set includes points where both `cos x = 0` and `cos (x + z) = 1/2`. 
- Based on the given solutions, `z` varies without bound toward negative infinity.
- The infimum of this set is therefore `-\infty`.

**Fix:**
- Use `-∞` from the extended real numbers `ℝ∞` (which allows infinities).
- Declare `P2006AMCA_15_answer` as an element of `ℝ∞` to accommodate infinities.

**Final answer:**
Enclose the fixed answer as a `-∞` from `ℝ∞`, which represents the greatest lower bound (infimum) as negative infinity.

The infimum (greatest lower bound) of the set is -infinity.. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The problem involves finding the infimum of the set {z | ∃ x, cos x = 0 ∧ cos(x+z) = 1/2}. The key insight is understanding the relationship between x and x+z given the cosine conditions:

- cos x = 0 ⇒ x ≡ π/2 + kπ for k ∈ ℤ.
- cos(x+z) = 1/2 ⇒ x + z ≡ ±π/3 + 2mπ for m ∈ ℤ.

Substituting x = π/2 + kπ into the second condition, we get:

π/2 + kπ + z ≡ ±π/3 + 2mπ.

Rearranged:

z ≡ ±π/3 + 2mπ - π/2 - kπ.

Grouping terms:

z ≡ (±π/3 - π/2) + 2mπ - kπ.

Note that the set of possible z's comprise all real numbers congruent to (±π/3 - π/2) modulo 2π, with infinitely many shifts by integer multiples of 2π, depending on k and m.

Calculating the difference:

- For the '+' case, the base value:

(π/3 - π/2) = (2π/6 - 3π/6) = -π/6 ≈ -0.523599.

- For the '−' case:

(-π/3 - π/2) = (-2π/6 - 3π/6) = -5π/6 ≈ -2.618.

Because of the periodicity modulo 2π, the set of z includes all numbers congruent to either -π/6 or -5π/6 mod 2π, with infinite shifts. Therefore, the set of z's is unbounded below, as it contains values tending to -∞. Hence, the infimum is -∞.

The enumerated candidate answers close to zero, but the set is unbounded downward, approaching -∞.

Thus, the infimum is -∞.

The Lean code:

I will fix the proposed answer to correctly reflect the infimum:
