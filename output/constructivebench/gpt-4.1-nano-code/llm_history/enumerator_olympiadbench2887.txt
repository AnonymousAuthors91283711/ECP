The problem asks us to find the least number formed by permutation of [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5], interpreted as a concatenation, that is divisible by 264. To do this, we'll generate all permutations, convert each to an integer, and check divisibility. We prioritize efficiency by stopping once we find the smallest valid number.

```python
import itertools

# The list of digits to permute
digits = [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5]

# Initialize the minimum number to None
min_number = None

# Generate all unique permutations
for perm in itertools.permutations(digits):
    # Convert permutation to number
    number = int(''.join(map(str, perm)))
    # Check divisibility by 264
    if number % 264 == 0:
        # Update minimum if necessary
        if min_number is None or number < min_number:
            min_number = number
            print(min_number)
# The smallest such number is printed during the process
```
