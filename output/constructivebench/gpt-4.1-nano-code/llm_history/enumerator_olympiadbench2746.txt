This appears to be a problem involving binomial coefficients and a fraction, possibly simplifying to a rational number. The core expression is:

\[ \frac{1}{\binom{13}{2} \times \binom{13}{2}}. \]

Since \(\binom{13}{2}\) is straightforward to compute, we can enumerate its value directly and then compute the reciprocal. The problem also seems to involve reasoning about rational numbers (â„š).

Let's write a Python program that computes this exact value and outputs it immediately, fitting your specifications:

```python
# Compute binomial coefficient: C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)
def binomial(n, k):
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, k+1):
        result = result * (n - i + 1) // i
    return result

# Compute the value of the expression
n = 13
k = 2
binom_value = binomial(n, k)
answer = 1 / (binom_value * binom_value)

# Output the answer immediately
print(answer)
```
