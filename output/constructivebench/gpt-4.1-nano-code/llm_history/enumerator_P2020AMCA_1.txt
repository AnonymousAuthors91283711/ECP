This problem appears to be about computing a specific value involving remainders and fractions, likely related to a word problem about distribution or subtraction. To explore possible answers, I'll enumerate potential fractional values step-by-step, focusing on exact rational calculations to find the value for `P2020AMCA_1`.

Since the structure involves `remainder = 1 - 7/10 = 3/10`, and `maria_took := (1/3) * remainder`, the key is to compute `1 - 7/10 - maria_took`.

Here, I'll explicitly calculate these values using rational arithmetic without approximation and print all feasible rational solutions.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Define known values as fractions for exactness
remainder = Fraction(1, 1) - Fraction(7, 10)  # 1 - 7/10 = 3/10
# Iterate over possible numerator/denominator for 'maria_took' as fractions of remainder
# Since 'maria_took' = (1/3) * remainder, it simplifies exactly
maria_took = Fraction(1, 3) * remainder

# Calculate the final answer
answer = Fraction(1, 1) - Fraction(7, 10) - maria_took

# Print the intermediate and final results
print("remainder:", remainder)          # Expected 3/10
print("maria_took:", maria_took)        # Expected (1/3)*(3/10) = 1/10
print("final answer:", answer)          # Expected 1 - 7/10 - 1/10 = 1 - 8/10 = 2/10 = 1/5

# Explicitly print the value in fraction form
print("Answer as fraction:", answer)
```
