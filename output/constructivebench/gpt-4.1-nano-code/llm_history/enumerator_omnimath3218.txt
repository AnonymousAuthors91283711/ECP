This problem involves analyzing a set of lattice points based on powers of 2 and their sums of squares, then identifying specific 4-element subsets with a particular geometric structure (likely squares). To assist in conjecturing — especially for small `n` — I will generate all such squares for small `n` (e.g., n from 0 to 3) and enumerate the corresponding subsets.

The code will:
- Fix small `n` values.
- Generate `P_n`.
- Find all 4-element subsets forming the described configuration.
- Stream results immediately.

The approach avoids heavy computation and relies on explicit enumeration for small `n`.

```python
import itertools

# Generate the set P_n
def generate_P_n(n):
    P = set()
    # Include (0,0)
    P.add((0, 0))
    # Add points p where p.x^2 + p.y^2 = 2^k for some k ≤ n
    max_k = n
    max_coord = 2 ** max_k  # bounds for search
    for x in range(-max_coord, max_coord + 1):
        for y in range(-max_coord, max_coord + 1):
            s = x*x + y*y
            # Check if s is a power of 2 and ≤ 2^n
            if s > 0 and (s & (s - 1)) == 0:  # s is a power of two
                k = s.bit_length() - 1
                if k <= max_k:
                    P.add((x, y))
    return P

# Generate all 4-point subsets of P that form the specified structure
def find_squares(P):
    results = []
    points = list(P)
    # Generate all 4-point subsets
    for S in itertools.combinations(points, 4):
        s_set = set(S)
        # For each subset, check the geometric condition
        for p in S:
            # For each possible d: (dx, dy)
            for d in points:
                if d == (0, 0):
                    continue
                p1 = p
                p2 = (p[0] + d[0], p[1] + d[1])
                p3 = (p[0] - d[1], p[1] + d[0])
                p4 = (p[0] + d[0] - d[1], p[1] + d[1] + d[0])
                cube = {p1, p2, p3, p4}
                if cube.issubset(P) and cube == s_set:
                    print(f"Found square: {s_set}")
    return

# Enumerate for n = 0 to 3
for n in range(4):
    print(f"n = {n}")
    P_n = generate_P_n(n)
    print(f"P_{n} has {len(P_n)} points")
    find_squares(P_n)
```
