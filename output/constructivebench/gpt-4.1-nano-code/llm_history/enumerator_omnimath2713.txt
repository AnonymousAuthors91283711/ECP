This problem asks to find a unique number \( N \) between 400 and 600 that is odd, divisible by 5 and 11, and then to compute the sum of its digits. Our approach is to enumerate all candidates \( N \) satisfying the divisibility conditions and oddness within the range,计算digits sum, and identify the unique such number. We then output the sum of digits for that number.

```python
# Program to find the unique number N between 400 and 600,
# odd, divisible by 5 and 11, and compute sum of its digits.

def digit_sum(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

# Collect candidate numbers
candidates = []

# Iterate over potential N satisfying divisibility and range conditions
for N in range(401, 600):  # start from 401 to ensure N is odd if odd
    if N % 2 == 1 and N % 5 == 0 and N % 11 == 0:
        candidates.append(N)
        print(f"Candidate N: {N}")

# Check for the unique candidate
if len(candidates) == 1:
    N_unique = candidates[0]
    sum_digits = digit_sum(N_unique)
    print(f"Unique N: {N_unique}")
    print(f"Sum of digits: {sum_digits}")
else:
    print("No unique candidate found or multiple candidates exist.")
```
