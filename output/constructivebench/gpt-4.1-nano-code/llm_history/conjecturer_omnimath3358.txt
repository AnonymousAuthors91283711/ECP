Given the factorization condition with primes, and the value of φ n, the pattern suggests n = p² * q * r with p, q, r primes. φ(n) = (p^2 - p) * (q - 1) * (r - 1). Set this equal to 11^3 + 1 = 1332. To satisfy φ, choose p = 12, p² = 144, then (p² - p) = 132. 

Dividing 1332 by 132 yields 10, so (q - 1)(r - 1) = 10. primes for q and r with q - 1, r - 1 dividing 10: q - 1, r - 1 ∈ {1, 2, 5, 10}. Possible pairs: (2, 6), (6, 2), (3, 5), (5, 3), (11, 2), etc., but only (2, 6) and (6, 2) yield q, r primes. 

Remaining factors: q = 3, r = 7 or q=7, r=3. Therefore, n = 144 * 3 * 7 and n = 144 * 7 * 3, which simplifies to n = 144 * 21 = 3024.

Final set contains n = 3024, the only suitable n under the primes and φ constraints, matching the pattern. 

Answer:
<<<{3024}>>>
