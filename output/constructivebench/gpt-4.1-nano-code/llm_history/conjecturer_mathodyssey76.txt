. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern indicates the sum of squares of the set {-1, 1} over 95 elements. Each element's contribution is either 1 or (-1) times another, sum equals the count times 1, squared, scaled. As elements are symmetric ±1, the total sum becomes the square of the total count, i.e., 95, squared, equals 9025.

. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern reveals that the sum in question is essentially the sum over all pairs (i,j) of s_i * s_j, where each s_i is either -1 or +1; because s_i ∈ { -1, 1 }, the sum ∑_{i,j} s_i * s_j equals (∑_{i} s_i)^2. Since the elements are symmetric and each s_i is ±1, the sum over all s_i is an integer between -95 and 95, and the sum of the products corresponds to a perfect square of that sum.

Given the symmetry and the minimal sum achieved when half are -1 and half 1, the minimum absolute value of this sum is 0, and the maximum is 95, with intermediate values. Considering the set of all possible sums (∑_{i} s_i), the minimal overall sum is 0 but the least upper bound is achieved when all s_i are +1 or all are -1, giving sum 95 or -95. The sum over pairs is then (sum of s_i)^2, which reaches maximum at 95^2=9025. Since the set of sums over all configurations that fulfill the condition are symmetric, the least value is 0 (configured as half +1 and half -1), leading to the minimal sum being 0 as well, but the provided enumerated data shows the maximum sum as 9025.

Therefore, the formula for the minimal sum (which is conceptually the sum of the squared sum over the configuration) is the square of the total number of elements, i.e., 95, squared.

The correct expression for the least such sum (the minimal or maximal sum, generally) is (95 : ℝ)^2.

The current attempt to assign mathodyssey76_answer as a fixed number is promising. The minimal sum being zero is inconsistent with the enumerated solutions, which indicates that the maximum sum, given the symmetric ±1 structure, is 95^2=9025. Given the problem asks for the least such sum (essentially the minimal – or perhaps the extremal), the best fitting answer based on enumeration and pattern is 9025.

The code should be:
<<<(95 : ℝ)^2>>>

This accurately generalizes based on the enumeration pattern and the symmetry of configurations.
