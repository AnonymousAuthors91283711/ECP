[conjecture_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

open Nat

abbrev omnimath3050_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath3050 : 
  4 * (4 * 5 + 2) + 2 = omnimath3050_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 90. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests a direct calculation: 4 * (4 * 5 + 2) + 2 = 4 * 22 + 2 = 88 + 2 = 90.  
**Final answer in Lean syntax:**

<<<90>>>

This matches the enumeration and the expected type ℕ.
