This problem involves analyzing the set \( S = \{-6, -4, -2, 0, 1, 3, 5, 7\} \) and finding the maximum (greatest) value of all possible products \( a \times b \times c \) with distinct \( a, b, c \in S \). The goal is to enumerate all such products, identify their maximum, and verify the greatest.

Since the set size is small (8 elements), we can generate all ordered triples with distinct elements, compute their products, and identify the maximum value. To ensure efficiency, we only consider unique permutations for each triple (or just combinations and account for order). Because the problem asks for the greatest product, we will enumerate all, find the maximum, and output immediately as we go.

Below is a Python program that performs this enumeration and outputs the maximum product found.

```python
# Set S as given
S = {-6, -4, -2, 0, 1, 3, 5, 7}

# Initialize maximum product found
max_product = None

# Generate all ordered triples with distinct elements
for a in S:
    for b in S:
        if b == a:
            continue
        for c in S:
            if c == a or c == b:
                continue
            product = a * b * c
            # Print each product immediately
            print(product)
            # Update max_product if needed
            if (max_product is None) or (product > max_product):
                max_product = product

# Output the maximum product found
print("Maximum product:", max_product)
```
