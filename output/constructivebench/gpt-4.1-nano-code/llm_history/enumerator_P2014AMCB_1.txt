[write_program]
The problem aims to find natural numbers p and n satisfying the equations:
- p + n = 13
- n + 1 = p
- p + 5 * n = answer

Given the equations, we can substitute p = n + 1 into the first equation:
(n + 1) + n = 13 ⇒ 2n + 1 = 13 ⇒ 2n = 12 ⇒ n = 6

Then p = n + 1 = 7.

Finally, compute p + 5 * n = 7 + 5 * 6 = 7 + 30 = 37.

The program will enumerate possible n and p within feasible bounds to verify the equations, then compute the answer.

```python
# Enumerate n from 0 to 20 as a safe upper bound
for n in range(21):
    p = n + 1
    if p + n == 13:
        answer = p + 5 * n
        print(f"p = {p}, n = {n}, answer = {answer}")
```
