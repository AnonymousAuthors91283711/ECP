The problem involves analyzing the days of August based on a starting day in July, with a focus on the number of days that match a specific day of the week (the answer parameter). The goal appears to be to determine how many days of August fall on the same weekday as `P2002AMCB_8_answer`, which is an integer from 0 to 6. The starting day in July is either Sunday (0), Friday (5), or Saturday (6), and we need to count how many August days are equal to `P2002AMCB_8_answer`.

We will enumerate all possible start days in July (0, 5, 6), compute the corresponding days in August, and for each, count how many August days match each possible weekday (0-6). The answer parameter must be one of those weekdays that appear exactly five times (since the problem states `count P2002AMCB_8_answer = 5`).

```python
# Enumerate start days in July and corresponding August days
# Count matching days for each weekday and print those with exactly 5 matches.
results = []
start_days = [0, 5, 6]
for start_july in start_days:
    start_august = (start_july + 31) % 7
    august_days = [ (start_august + i) % 7 for i in range(31)]
    count_map = {}
    for day in august_days:
        count_map[day] = count_map.get(day, 0) + 1
    # Check which weekdays have exactly 5 occurrences
    for weekday, count in count_map.items():
        if count == 5:
            print(f"Start in July: {start_july}, August weekday: {weekday}, count: {count}")
```
