This problem involves finding integers \( m, n, r, s \) with certain modular congruences and inequalities, then summing them up. The key points:

- \( r > 0 \), and \( r \) satisfies: \( 702 \equiv r \pmod{m} \), \( 787 \equiv r \pmod{m} \), \( 855 \equiv r \pmod{m} \).
- \( s > 0 \), and \( s \) satisfies: \( 412 \equiv s \pmod{n} \), \( 722 \equiv s \pmod{n} \), \( 815 \equiv s \pmod{n} \).
- \( r \neq s \).

We want to find possible values of \( m, n, r, s \). To do so programmatically, we'll analyze the differences to understand the constraints.

- For \( r \):
  
  The three congruences imply:
  
  \[
  702 \equiv r \pmod{m},
  \]
  \[
  787 \equiv r \pmod{m},
  \]
  \[
  855 \equiv r \pmod{m}.
  \]
  
  Which means:
  
  \[
  702 - r \equiv 0 \pmod{m},
  \]
  \[
  787 - r \equiv 0 \pmod{m},
  \]
  \[
  855 - r \equiv 0 \pmod{m}.
  \]
  
  Therefore, \( m \) divides all three differences: \( (702 - r), (787 - r), (855 - r) \).

- The pairwise differences must be divisible by \( m \):

  \[
  (787 - r) - (702 - r) = 85,
  \]
  \[
  (855 - r) - (787 - r) = 68,
  \]
  \[
  (855 - r) - (702 - r) = 153.
  \]
  
  So \( m \) divides 85, 68, and 153.

- For \( s \):

  Similar logic:

  \[
  412 \equiv s \pmod{n},
  \]
  \[
  722 \equiv s \pmod{n},
  \]
  \[
  815 \equiv s \pmod{n}.
  \]
  
  Differences:

  \[
  722 - 412 = 310,
  \]
  \[
  815 - 722 = 93,
  \]
  \[
  815 - 412 = 403.
  \]
  
  So \( n \) divides 310, 93, and 403.

---

Based on this, the possible \( m \) are divisors of 85, 68, 153; and possible \( n \) are divisors of 310, 93, 403.

Let's enumerate these divisors, pick small divisors to find candidates for \( r \) and \( s \) with \( r \neq s \), and compute the sum.

```python
# List divisors of numbers
def divisors(x):
    return [d for d in range(1, x+1) if x % d == 0]

# Divisors for m based on differences
divs_85 = divisors(85)   # factors of 85
divs_68 = divisors(68)   # factors of 68
divs_153 = divisors(153) # factors of 153

# Divisors for n based on differences
divs_310 = divisors(310) # factors of 310
divs_93 = divisors(93)   # factors of 93
divs_403 = divisors(403) # factors of 403

# Generate candidate m values (common divisors of all three)
candidate_m = [d for d in set(divs_85).intersection(divs_68).intersection(divs_153)]
# Generate candidate n values
candidate_n = [d for d in set(divs_310).intersection(divs_93).intersection(divs_403)]

import itertools

# For each m, r can be any number with 1 <= r < m
# For r, pick small values for demonstration. Similarly for s.

results = []

for m in candidate_m:
    # r must satisfy: 702 ≡ r mod m, likewise for the others
    # since m divides the differences, all these congruences satisfy:
    # r ≡ 702 mod m
    r_candidate = 702 % m
    if r_candidate == 0:
        r_candidate = m  # r > 0
    for n in candidate_n:
        s_candidate = None
        for s in range(1, n):  # pick s from 1 to n-1
            # s must satisfy 412 ≡ s mod n
            if 412 % n == s and 722 % n == s and 815 % n == s:
                # check s > 0 and s ≠ r
                if s > 0 and s != r_candidate:
                    total = m + n + r_candidate + s
                    print(f"m={m}, n={n}, r={r_candidate}, s={s} => sum={total}")
                    results.append(total)

# The code will output candidate sums; from this, one can conjecture the answer.
```
