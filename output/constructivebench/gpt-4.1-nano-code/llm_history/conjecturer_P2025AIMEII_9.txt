theorem P2025AIMEII_9 :
  let f := fun x => sin (7 * π * sin (5 * x))
  let zeros := {x ∈ Ioo 0 (2 * π) | f x = 0}
  let tangent := {x ∈ zeros | HasDerivAt f 0 x}
  Nat.card zeros + Nat.card tangent = P2025AIMEII_9_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 220. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The zeros are at x where sin(7π sin(5x))=0, i.e., 7π sin(5x)=kπ, sin(5x)=k/7. For k in [-7,7], as sin(5x)∈[-1,1], valid k are integers from -7 to 7. zeros count = 2*7 + 1 = 15. Derivates vanish when f' x=0, leading to roots where sin(5x)=0 or cos(7π sin(5x))=0. These are at 5x=π m, i.e., x=π m/5, within (0, 2π). Counting m from 1 to 9 yields 3, with specific tangent roots at x=π/5, 2π/5. Thus total = 15 + 3 = 18. Final answer: <<<18>>>
