The problem appears to involve selecting the correct answer from a small set of rational numbers, likely based on some properties or criteria not fully specified here. Since the code hints at choosing from a set of rational numbers, and emphasizes checking for membership and uniqueness, the main task could be to determine which element(s) satisfy the given property or to verify the answer among candidates.

Given all the candidate answers ({31/10, 49/15, 33/10, 109/33, 15/4}), the Python program will enumerate each candidate, check whether it meets a certain criteria (if any is provided; since none is specified, perhaps just to identify the set), and identify the unique answer.

Here, we will:
- List all candidate rational answers;
- For example, if the criterion was to identify a specific value based on some property (say, being the maximum or minimum in the list, or satisfying some other condition), we could implement that.
- Since no explicit property is given, I will illustrate enumeration of candidates, printing each candidate and verifying which is the answer based on a placeholder criterion (e.g., perhaps the smallest or largest).

Given the instruction, here's a minimal code that enumerates candidates, prints them, and finally outputs a selected answer according to a simple criterion (e.g., the maximum).

```python
# Enumerate candidate answers from the set of provided rationals
candidates = [31/10, 49/15, 33/10, 109/33, 15/4]

# Print all candidates
for q in candidates:
    print(q)

# Example criterion: select the maximum candidate (can adjust as needed)
answer = max(candidates)

# Print the chosen answer
print("Selected answer:", answer)
```
