This appears to be a Lean theorem statement involving real numbers, parameters, and an equation constraint. The goal is to find all possible values of \( z = x + 2 y^2 \) that satisfy the given condition \( P \), which relates \( x \) and \( y \) via a polynomial.

The problem involves solving the equation:

\[ 8 y^4 + 4 x^2 y^2 + 4 x y^2 + 2 x^3 + 2 y^2 + 2 x = x^2 + 1 \]

Simplify the equation to derive potential candidates for \( x, y \), and then compute \( z = x + 2 y^2 \). Since the task is to enumerate solutions, we'll choose sample values of \( y \), solve for \( x \), and compute \( z \). We'll print each result as soon as it's found.

Here's an efficient enumeration approach:
- Pick small, integer \( y \) values: \( y = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 \).
- For each \( y \), plug into the equation and solve for \( x \).
- Since solving the equation exactly may be complicated, I'll find approximate solutions or solutions via substitution.
- For simplicity and efficiency, I'll analyze specific \( y \) values, derive \( x \), and compute \( z \).

Let's implement this logic:

```python
# Enumerate candidate y values and solve for x approximately
import math

# List of sample y values
sample_ys = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]

# Store solutions
solutions = []

for y in sample_ys:
    y2 = y ** 2
    # The equation:
    # 8 y^4 + 4 x^2 y^2 + 4 x y^2 + 2 x^3 + 2 y^2 + 2 x = x^2 + 1
    # Rearranged as:
    # 8 y^4 + 4 x^2 y^2 + 4 x y^2 + 2 x^3 + 2 y^2 + 2 x - x^2 - 1 = 0
    # For each y, treat as a polynomial in x and attempt to find roots numerically.
    # Since manual solving is complex, we try a few x guesses.

    # Generate some candidate x values around 0
    candidate_xs = [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]
    for x in candidate_xs:
        # Compute the left side
        lhs = (8 * y2 ** 2) + (4 * x ** 2 * y2) + (4 * x * y2) + (2 * x ** 3) + (2 * y2) + (2 * x)
        rhs = x ** 2 + 1
        if abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-6:
            z = x + 2 * y2
            print(f"Found candidate: y={y}, x={x}, z={z}")
            solutions.append(z)

# After enumerating, print all solutions
print("All candidate solutions for z:", set(solutions))
```

This code:
- Enumerates small \( y \) and \( x \) values,
- Checks if the polynomial relation approximately holds,
- Computes \( z = x + 2 y^2 \),
- Prints each found candidate immediately.

Note: For exact algebraic solutions, symbolic solvers are required; here, numerical checks suffice for a competition-level enumeration.
