This problem involves analyzing the given equation involving x and y, which resembles a geometric condition, possibly the cosine of an angle between vectors or points. Our goal is to find all solutions satisfying the relation

\[
\frac{(x - 2013)(y - 2014)}{(x - 2013)^2 + (y - 2014)^2} = -\frac{1}{2}
\]

and determine the sum \(x + y\).

To enumerate potential solutions, we'll parametrize the problem by setting \(X = x - 2013\), \(Y = y - 2014\), reducing the problem to:

\[
\frac{XY}{X^2 + Y^2} = - \frac{1}{2}
\]

This is a standard form related to the cosine of the angle between vectors \((X, Y)\). Since for vectors, the quotient gives cos(θ), by comparing:

\[
\cos \theta = - \frac{1}{2}
\]

which corresponds to angles \(\theta = 120^\circ\) or \(240^\circ\).

Therefore, \((X, Y)\) are scalar multiples of unit vectors at these angles:

\[
(X, Y) = r (\cos \theta, \sin \theta)
\]

with \(\cos \theta = -1/2\), \(\sin \theta = \pm \sqrt{3}/2\).

Enumerate solutions with \(r\) as small integer multiples (say \(\pm 1, \pm 2\)) for simplicity, to generate candidate points, then convert back to \(x\), \(y\).

Below is a simple enumeration code to generate these candidate solutions.

```python
import math

# The angles where cosine = -1/2: 120° and 240°
angles = [math.radians(120), math.radians(240)]
radii = [1, 2, -1, -2]

solutions = []

for r in radii:
    for theta in angles:
        X = r * math.cos(theta)
        Y = r * math.sin(theta)
        x = X + 2013
        y = Y + 2014
        sum_xy = x + y
        print("x =", x, "y =", y, "x + y =", sum_xy)
```

This code outputs candidate solutions for \(x + y\), enabling conjecture and validation of the true value.
