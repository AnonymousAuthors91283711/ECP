Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
<<<(2 : ℚ) / 13>>>

The ratio simplifies to the fraction of even numbers with 2+ digits and no repeated digits over all such numbers. Since the set of even numbers with distinct digits and length ≥ 2 follows a pattern where the last digit is even, and the rest of digits are no repetition, the ratio approaches 2/13 based on enumeration.
