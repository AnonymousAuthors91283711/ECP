The problem involves finding the greatest natural number m such that there exist families of sets \(A_i, B_i\) for \(i< m\), with fixed sizes and a specific disjointness property only when indices match. 

In particular:
- \(\forall i, |A_i| = 2012\)
- \(\forall i, |B_i| = 2013\)
- \(\forall i, j, (A_i \cap B_j) = \emptyset \iff i = j\)

This essentially encodes a system where each \(A_i\) and \(B_i\) are disjoint pairs, and different pairs do not intersect, except possibly at points outside their own pairs (implied by the disjointness condition). The structure resembles a *pairing* of elements with no overlaps, suggesting the total number of such pairs is limited by the size of the universe.

Key insights:
- The universe size must be at least the total of all \(A_i\) and \(B_i\): \(\text{size}(U) \ge m \times (2012 + 2013) = m \times 4025\).
- To maximize \(m\), we want the largest number of disjoint pairs such that each \(A_i, B_i\) fits within the universe without overlap, i.e., the universe size is at least \(m \times 4025\).

Given infinite universe is impossible but assuming the universe is just large enough (or possibly finite but large), the maximum \(m\) is constrained by the total size of the universe.

In the simplest case, if universe is infinite, \(m\) could be infinitely large. But within finite universe constraints (say, size \(N\)), the maximum \(m\) is \(\lfloor N/4025 \rfloor\). 

Since the problem references \(\mathbb{N}\) and fixed set sizes, and we're asked for maximal \(m\), under infinite universe assumptions, the greatest \(m\) is unbounded.

But considering the typical finite setting, let's assume the smallest universe size equal to the total sizes, so \(N = m \times 4025\). Then, the largest integer \(m\) satisfying \(m \times 4025 \le N\) can be arbitrarily large with infinite universe, or concretely, unbounded.

Given the problem's form and common principle, the maximum \(m\) without constraints tends to infinity. But typical set problems assume a finite universe; then the maximal \(m\) equals the largest number for which the total size fits in the universeâ€”assuming a universe size equal to the total sets' sum, the maximum \(m\) is unbounded.

In conclusion, the greatest such \(m\) is unbounded, or in other words, infinity.

To encode this in code: I will enumerate values indicating increasing possible values of \(m\).

```python
# Enumerate possible values of m, assuming infinite universe (theoretically unbounded)
# We choose a large threshold to illustrate the growth, e.g., up to 10^6
threshold = 10**6
for m in range(1, threshold+1):
    # Each step, print the candidate m and the total size needed
    total_size = m * (2012 + 2013)
    print(f"Candidate m: {m}, total size needed: {total_size}")
```

This code lists increasing \(m\) values, illustrating the potential unbounded nature of the problem. The maximum (Greatest) is theoretically infinite, so for practical enumeration, we show large values.
