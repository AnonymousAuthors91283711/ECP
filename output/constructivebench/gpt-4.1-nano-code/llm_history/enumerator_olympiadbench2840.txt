This problem involves algebraic manipulation of logarithmic expressions with factorials, aiming to find the value of **x** in terms of known quantities.

Key observations:
- \(T = -10\) (constant)
- The equation involves \(\log 2 (4^{8!}) + \log 4 (2^{8!}) = 6! \times T \times x\)

Since \(4 = 2^2\), rewrite \(\log 2 (4^{8!})\):
\[
\log_2(4^{8!}) = \log_2((2^2)^{8!}) = \log_2(2^{2 \times 8!}) = 2 \times 8!
\]

Similarly, rewrite \(\log_4 (2^{8!})\):
\[
\log_4(2^{8!}) = \frac{\log_2(2^{8!})}{\log_2(4)} = \frac{8!}{2}
\]

Now, the sum becomes:
\[
2 \times 8! + \frac{8!}{2}
\]

Rewrite the right side:
\[
6! \times T \times x
\]
where \(T = -10\).

Compute the sum:
\[
2 \times 8! + \frac{8!}{2} = \left(2 + \frac{1}{2}\right) \times 8! = \frac{5}{2} \times 8!
\]

Finally, solve for \(x\):
\[
x = \frac{\frac{5}{2} \times 8!}{6! \times T}
\]

Note that:
\[
8! = 8 \times 7 \times 6! 
\]

Plug in:
\[
x = \frac{\frac{5}{2} \times 8 \times 7 \times 6!}{6! \times (-10)} = \frac{\frac{5}{2} \times 8 \times 7}{-10}
\]

Simplify numerator:
\[
\frac{5}{2} \times 8 \times 7 = 5 \times 4 \times 7 = 140
\]

Divide by denominator:
\[
x = \frac{140}{-10} = -14
\]

Here's the Python code to verify this approach:

```python
import math

# Known constant
T = -10

# Calculate factorials
factorial_6 = math.factorial(6)
factorial_7 = math.factorial(7)
factorial_8 = math.factorial(8)

# Logarithmic sum calculation based on rewritten expressions
log_sum = 2 * factorial_8 / math.log(2) + (factorial_8 / math.log(2) / 2)

# Since the logs are expressed in different bases, convert to common base
# Actually, rewriting logs in base 2:
# log2(4^{8!}) = 2 * 8!
# log4(2^{8!}) = (1/2) * 8!

# Sum directly:
sum_logs = 2 * factorial_8 + (factorial_8 / 2)

# Solve for x:
x = (sum_logs) / (factorial_6 * T)

print(f"Calculated x: {x}")

# Check if x matches the algebraic derivation
assert abs(x + 14) < 1e-6, "x should be approximately -14"
```
