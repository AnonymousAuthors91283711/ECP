open Set

abbrev omnimath920_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath920 (n : ℕ) : n ∈ omnimath920_answer ↔ 
  (n = 153 ∨ n = 370 ∨ n = 371 ∨ n = 407) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 153
370
371
407. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
Let's observe the enumerated answers: 153, 370, 371, 407. These are specific, isolated natural numbers, and the theorem states that these are exactly the elements in omnimath920_answer. Based on pattern recognition, the set appears to include perfect numbers and related special numbers in that range. The set of these four numbers can be expressed explicitly. 

Answer: <<<{153, 370, 371, 407}>>>
