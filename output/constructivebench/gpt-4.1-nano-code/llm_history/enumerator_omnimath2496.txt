This problem asks to find primes p, q, r satisfying two equations: 2*p + 3*q = 6*r and p + q + r = some natural number answer. We are to enumerate possible solutions to conjecture the true answer.

Given that p, q, r are primes, and since the equations involve linear relations, we can choose small prime candidates for p and q, then compute r, check if it is prime, and record p + q + r.

Approach:
- Use small prime numbers (e.g., 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,...).
- For each pair (p, q), compute r = (2*p + 3*q) / 6 if divisible.
- Check if r is prime.
- Record p + q + r.

Output each valid result as soon as it's found.

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    if n in (2, 3):
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23]
found_answers = set()

for p in primes:
    for q in primes:
        numerator = 2 * p + 3 * q
        if numerator % 6 == 0:
            r = numerator // 6
            if is_prime(r):
                answer = p + q + r
                print(f'p={p}, q={q}, r={r} => sum={answer}')
                found_answers.add(answer)
