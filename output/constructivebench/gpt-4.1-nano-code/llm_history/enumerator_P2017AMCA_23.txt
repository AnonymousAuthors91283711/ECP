To explore the possible values of \( f(1) \) given the conditions, we note that \(f\) is a cubic polynomial with roots \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \) (distinct, nonzero). Specifically,

\[f(x) = x^3 + a x^2 + b x + c\]
and roots \( r_i \) satisfy \( f(r_i) = 0 \). Since \(f\) has three roots \(r_1, r_2, r_3\), the polynomial can be written as:

\[f(x) = (x - r_1)(x - r_2)(x - r_3)\]

Expanding:

\[f(x) = x^3 - (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) x^2 + (r_1 r_2 + r_2 r_3 + r_3 r_1) x - r_1 r_2 r_3\]

Given the constraints:

- Each root \( r_i \neq 0 \)
- Roots are distinct (implied by \(\text{card} = 3\))
- The roots are real

We want to compute \(f(1) = 1 + a + b + c\).

Expressed in terms of roots:

\[f(1) = (1 - r_1)(1 - r_2)(1 - r_3)\]

This product will be zero if any \( r_i = 1 \). Since roots are nonzero and distinct, we consider possible root combinations where roots are nonzero, real, and distinct:

- Roots are arbitrary nonzero real numbers, with the only restriction that their product and sums produce valid polynomial coefficients.

The key observation: For different sets of roots, the value \(f(1)\) varies as the product of differences (since the polynomial is fully determined by roots).

To generate candidate roots efficiently, consider small integer or rational roots â€” for example:

- roots in \(\{ \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3 \}\)
- ensure roots are distinct and nonzero

Enumerate combinations with these small roots and compute \(f(1)\):

```python
# Python code to enumerate small distinct nonzero roots and compute f(1)

roots_candidates = [-3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3]
results = set()

for r1 in roots_candidates:
    for r2 in roots_candidates:
        if r2 == r1:
            continue
        for r3 in roots_candidates:
            if r3 == r1 or r3 == r2:
                continue
            if 0 in (r1, r2, r3):
                continue
            # Compute f(1) = (1 - r1)*(1 - r2)*(1 - r3)
            val = (1 - r1)*(1 - r2)*(1 - r3)
            print(f"Roots: {r1}, {r2}, {r3} -> f(1) = {val}")
            results.add(val)
```

This small sample will give a set of possible \(f(1)\) values for roots in a manageable range.

```python
# Final enumerator: generate candidate roots and compute f(1)

roots_candidates = [-3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3]
results = set()

for r1 in roots_candidates:
    for r2 in roots_candidates:
        if r2 == r1:
            continue
        for r3 in roots_candidates:
            if r3 == r1 or r3 == r2:
                continue
            if 0 in (r1, r2, r3):
                continue
            val = (1 - r1) * (1 - r2) * (1 - r3)
            print(val)
            results.add(val)
```
