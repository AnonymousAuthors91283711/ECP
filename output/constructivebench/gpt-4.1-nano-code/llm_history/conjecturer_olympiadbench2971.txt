Given the constraints: n in [10^4, 10^5-1], digits unique, divisible by 63, the enumeration suggests the pattern of the largest n satisfying all. The maximum n with these properties ends at 98721, which is divisible by 63 and has distinct digits, starting with the largest possible digit 9, decreasing to 1. Hence, the expected answer is 98721.
