The problem involves analyzing the set \( S \) of integers \( n \) between 1 and 2024 inclusive, satisfying two coprimality conditions:
\[
\gcd(99+n, 99n+1) = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad \gcd(101+n, 101n+1) = 1.
\]
We need to determine the ratio \(\frac{|S|}{2024}\).  
To approach this, I will:
- Generate possible \( n \) values in the range [1, 2024].
- For each \( n \), check the two gcd conditions.
- Count how many satisfy both.
- Output the ratio \( \frac{|S|}{2024} \).

Since the problem asks for a heuristic enumeration, I will check all \( n \) from 1 to 2024 and output the ratio as a float approximation, which can hint toward the actual fractional value.

```python
import math

count = 0
total = 2024

for n in range(1, total + 1):
    gcd1 = math.gcd(99 + n, 99 * n + 1)
    gcd2 = math.gcd(101 + n, 101 * n + 1)
    if gcd1 == 1 and gcd2 == 1:
        count += 1
        print(f"n={n} satisfies both conditions.")

ratio = count / total
print(f"Total satisfying n: {count} out of {total}, ratio â‰ˆ {ratio}")
```
