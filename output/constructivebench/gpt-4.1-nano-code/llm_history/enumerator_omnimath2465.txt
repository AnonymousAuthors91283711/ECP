The problem appears to involve finding the number of solutions \( n \) in a certain set with constraints involving its decimal digits and divisibility. To assist in conjecturing and eventually proving the answer, I'll write a Python script to enumerate candidate \( n \) values starting from \( 10^9 \), where \( n \) is divisible by 11, and check the digit conditions related to the decreasing order of certain digits. I will keep the enumeration limited to feasible ranges, and immediately print each qualifying answer.

Since the problem involves the decimal digits and between 1 and 9, it's manageable to iterate over candidates \( n \) starting from \( 10^9 \), stepping by 11 (due to divisibility), up to some upper bound. For simplicity, I'll limit to candidates less than a certain upper bound, say \( 2 \times 10^{10} \), and check the digit criteria.

```python
# Enumerate n >= 1,000,000,000, divisible by 11,
# and verify that for i in 1..9, the (i+1)-th digit from the right
# is less than or equal to the i-th digit, with the constraint on n mod 11.

def get_digit(n, i):
    return (n // 10**i) % 10

# Set a limit for enumeration
lower_bound = 10**9
upper_bound = 2 * 10**10  # arbitrary upper bound for search

# Iterate over candidates divisible by 11 in the specified range
n = lower_bound
while n < upper_bound:
    if n % 11 == 0:
        # Check digit sequence decreasing condition
        # i from 1 to 9, digits at positions i and i+1
        valid = True
        for i in range(1, 9):
            digit_i = get_digit(n, i)
            digit_next = get_digit(n, i + 1)
            if digit_next > digit_i:
                valid = False
                break
        if valid:
            print(n)
    n += 11
```
