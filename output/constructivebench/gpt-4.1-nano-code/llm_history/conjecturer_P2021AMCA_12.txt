Because roots are positive integers listed with multiplicities, sum of roots by Vieta relates coefficients. The explicit roots suggest B = - (multiplicity of roots 2 and 4). Using the polynomial roots expansion, B = - (sum of roots * multiplicities). Based on pattern, sum roots = 1*3 + 2*4 + 4*1 = 3 + 8 + 4 = 15. The coefficient B is the negative of the sum of roots, considering multiplicities: B = - (1*3 + 2*4 + 4*1) = - (3 + 8 + 4) = -15, but the pattern may include other factors. Given enumerations, for roots (1,1,1,1,2,4), B = -72, and for (1,1,2,2,2,2), B = -88. Thus, B = - 4 * (sum of roots), i.e., B = - 4 * 15 = -60. Considering numerator 12 (degree sum), a refined estimate is B = - 12 * sum of roots. Final: <<< -12 * (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 4) >>>
