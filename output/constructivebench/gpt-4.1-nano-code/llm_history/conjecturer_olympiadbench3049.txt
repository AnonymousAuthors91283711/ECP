The pattern suggests s = 20x + 80y with a constant average s/(x + y) = 34, so s = 34(x + y).  
Given 20x + 80y = s = 34(x + y), implies 20x + 80y = 34x + 34y, which simplifies to (20 - 34)x + (80 - 34)y = 0, leading to -14x + 46y = 0, or 23y = 7x.  
Since y and x are positive integers, set x = 7k, y = 23k, then s = 34(x + y) = 34(7k + 23k) = 34 * 30k = 1020k.  
Minimum positive k is 1, so s = 1020.

The problem involves finding the minimal sum \(s\) such that \(s = 20x + 80y\) with positive integers \(x,y\), and the average \(s/(x + y) = 34\). 

Given \(s = 34 (x + y)\) and the constraint \(20x + 80y = s\), substituting yields:
\[20x + 80y = 34 (x + y)\]
which simplifies to:
\[(20 - 34) x + (80 - 34) y = 0 \Rightarrow -14x + 46 y = 0 \Rightarrow 23 y = 7 x\]

Since \(x, y\) are positive integers, set \(x = 7k\), \(y=23k\) for some \(k \in \mathbb{N}^+\). substituting back:
\[s = 34(x + y) = 34 (7k + 23k) = 34 \times 30k = 1020k\]

The minimal positive \(k\) is 1, thus:
\[s = 1020\]

Since the problem asks for the least such \(s\), the answer in Lean is:

<<<1020>>>

This is the minimal sum \(s\), consistent with the pattern observed in the enumerated solutions.
