abbrev P2014AMCA_6_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem P2014AMCA_6 : 
  ∃ (x : ℕ), x ∈ Icc 10 99 ∧ 
  ∃ (a b : ℕ), a ∈ Icc 1 9 ∧ b ∈ Icc 0 9 ∧ 
    x = 10 * a + b ∧ 
    (10 * a + b) - (10 * b + a) = 5 * (a + b) ∧ 
    (10 * a + b) + (10 * b + a) = P2014AMCA_6_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 99. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the constraints, x = 10a + b with a ∈ [1,9], b ∈ [0,9], and x ∈ [10,99], the differences and sums imply (a,b) are digits, with a ≠ b to satisfy the difference condition. Calculating for (a,b) yields solutions with the sum 99 when the conditions align. Thus, the maximum x fulfilling all conditions is 99.
