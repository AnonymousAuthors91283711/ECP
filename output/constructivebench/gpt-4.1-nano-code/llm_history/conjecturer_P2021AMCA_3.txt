theorem P2021AMCA_3 :
  ∃ (a b : ℕ), a + b = 17402 ∧ 10 ∣ a ∧ b = a / 10 ∧ a - b = P2021AMCA_3_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 14238
. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests a relation where the sum is 17402, with \(a\) divisible by 10, and \(b = a/10\), leading to \(a - b\). Replacing \(b\) and simplifying, the difference becomes \(a - a/10 = 9a/10\), which must equal 14238. Solving \(9a/10 = 14238\) yields \(a = 14238 * 10 / 9 = 15820\). Therefore, \(a = 15820\), \(b = a/10 = 1582\), and sum 17402. The difference expression is \(9*a/10\).

. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The current proposed answer is written as a lambda function `fun _ => 9 * 15820 / 10`, which is of a function type, not a simple natural number. The error message indicates that `P2021AMCA_3_answer` is expected to be a `ℕ`, but the provided candidate is a function, causing a type mismatch.

Given the enumerated answer is 14238, and the overall structure seeks an explicit value satisfying the conditions in the theorem, it's natural to define:
```lean
abbrev P2021AMCA_3_answer : ℕ := 14238
```
This fixes the type mismatch and aligns with the enumerated answer. The expression `9 * 15820 / 10` evaluates to 14238, confirming the correctness of the numerical value. 

Thus, the corrected final answer in Lean is:

<<<14238>>>

This ensures the `P2021AMCA_3_answer` is a concrete Nat, satisfying the Lean type checker.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The current proposed answer has multiple errors due to incorrect syntax: specifically, the repeated "abbrev" and the declaration of an abbreviation with the same name as the answer term, which is unnecessary here. Also, the problem instructs to supply a closed-form natural number answer, generalized from the enumeration 14238, within the Lean code.

Given the pattern and the simplicity of the answer, I conjecture that the key is a reasonable value based on the given information and the enumerated answer, which is 14238. The original theorem states that there exist `a` and `b` satisfying certain conditions: their sum is 17402, `a` is divisible by 10, `b` relates to `a` through division by 10, and their difference equals the answer.

To correct the code, I will declare the constant directly as a `⟨ℕ⟩` value, eliminating the erroneous redundant "abbrev" and making it a simple declaration. The corrected answer expression is:

<<<14238>>

The function must return `a - b = 14238`. This form corresponds with the enumerated answer and the problem context. It is a concise, valid, and closed-form numeric answer embedded in Lean syntax.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib
