Ground Truth Answer: 7530
Proposed Answer: 15 * (999 - 14 * 1) + 105 * 1
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer.

The problem asks for the greatest possible sum of a 15-term arithmetic sequence where each term ≤ 999, and where no larger common difference d can be used to form such a sequence.

Key observations:
1. To maximize the sum, we want the largest possible terms (close to 999)
2. The sequence must have 15 terms, so the first term must leave room for 14 increments
3. The sum of an arithmetic sequence is n*(first term + last term)/2 = 15*(a + (a+14d))/2 = 15a + 105d

The ground truth answer 7530 comes from:
- Setting d=1 (maximal possible d that allows 15 terms ≤ 999)
- First term a = 999-14 = 985 (so last term is 985+14=999)
- Sum = 15*985 + 105*1 = 14775 + 105 = 14880? Wait no, this doesn't match 7530.

Wait, let's recalculate:
The correct sum formula is n/2*(2a + (n-1)d) = 15/2*(2a + 14d) = 15*(a + 7d)
For a=985, d=1: 15*(985 + 7) = 15*992 = 14880

This doesn't match the ground truth 7530, suggesting either:
1. The ground truth is incorrect, or
2. I'm misunderstanding the problem

The proposed answer is: 15*(999 - 14*1) + 105*1 = 15*985 + 105 = 14880
This matches my calculation above.

Since the ground truth (7530) is exactly half of our calculation (14880), there might be a misunderstanding in the problem statement or ground truth.

Given this discrepancy, and since the proposed answer follows correct reasoning but doesn't match the ground truth, I'll return:

<<<False>>>
