The provided problem appears to involve a real number x satisfying some condition, and the theorem relates x to an expression involving (x + 1)^3 and an unknown answer. Since it states x = -2 implies (x + 1)^3 equals some answer, I will enumerate candidate values of x around -2 to see what (x + 1)^3 evaluates to. 

Given the structure, the key is likely to identify the value of (x + 1)^3 for x = -2, which simplifies to (-2 + 1)^3 = (-1)^3 = -1. Thus, most likely, the answer is -1. To assist in conjecturing, the program will test some x values near -2, compute (x + 1)^3, and stream the results.

```python
# Enumerate x values near -2 to explore (x + 1)^3
for x_int in range(-4, 3):  # testing x from -4 to 2
    x = x_int
    value = (x + 1) ** 3
    print(f"x = {x}, (x + 1)^3 = {value}")
```
