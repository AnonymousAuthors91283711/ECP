The problem defines a function on parameters (i, j) related to a pattern, with the formula: 

\[ \text{Answer} = 4 + 3 \times (i - 1) + (3 + 4 \times (i - 1)) \times (j - 1) \]

This pattern suggests that for given i, the sequence over j is linear with a base plus a multiple of j-1. To verify this, we can generate several values for small i and j, and confirm that the pattern holds. 

The goal here is to help determine the pattern's values and verify the answer for the example (i=50, j=40). To do this efficiently, we'll enumerate small sample points and also output the value for the specific example.

```python
# Enumerate small values of i and j to observe the pattern
# and verify the formula. We'll print results immediately.

# Sample small i and j to observe sequence
for i in range(1, 4):
    for j in range(1, 6):
        answer = 4 + 3 * (i - 1) + (3 + 4 * (i - 1)) * (j - 1)
        print(f"i={i}, j={j} => answer={answer}")

# Specifically compute the example (50, 40)
i_example, j_example = 50, 40
answer_example = 4 + 3 * (i_example - 1) + (3 + 4 * (i_example - 1)) * (j_example - 1)
print(f"Example (i=50, j=40) => answer={answer_example}")
```
