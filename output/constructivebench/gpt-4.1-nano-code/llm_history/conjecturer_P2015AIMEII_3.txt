theorem P2015AIMEII_3 :
  IsLeast {m : ℕ | 0 < m ∧ 17 ∣ m ∧ (digits 10 m).sum = 17} P2015AIMEII_3_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 1088. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the enumeration, the minimal positive multiple of 17 with digit sum 17 and greater than 0 is 1088; 1088's digits sum to 1+0+8+8=17, divisible by 17, and minimal satisfying conditions. 

Thus, the closed-form answer is:
<<<1088>>>
