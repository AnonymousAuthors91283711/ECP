The problem appears to involve a set \( S \) of functions \( t : \text{Fin} 3 \to \mathbb{N} \) where all \( t(i) \) are prime, and the set of such functions where the quadratic \( t(0) x^2 + t(1) x + t(2)=0 \) has a rational solution. The goal is to find all primes \( p \) such that at least 7 such functions \( t \) (with one of the \( t(i) = p \)) exist within \( S \).

Key points:
- \( t(i) \) are prime.
- The quadratic \( t(0) x^2 + t(1) x + t(2) = 0 \) has a rational solution if and only if its discriminant is a perfect square, i.e., \( \Delta = t(1)^2 - 4 t(0) t(2) \) is a perfect square.
- We need to count how many such \( t \) exist for each prime \( p \) in the position \( t(i) \), where the other \( t(j) \) are prime as well.
- The candidate primes for \( t(i) \) are small, as we are enumerating.

Let's pick small prime values (say, all primes â‰¤ 19) to efficiently generate candidates and count solutions.

```python
# Enumerate small primes for t(i)
primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]

# Function to check if a number is a perfect square
def is_perfect_square(n):
    root = int(n**0.5)
    return root * root == n

# Count how many triplets (t0, t1, t2) are prime and satisfy the discriminant condition
# with t_i fixed to prime p, and counting how many have t_i = p
from collections import Counter

answer_counts = {p:0 for p in primes}

for p in primes:
    count_for_p = 0
    for t0 in primes:
        for t1 in primes:
            for t2 in primes:
                # Assign t_i to p for each i in 0,1,2
                for fixed_pos in range(3):
                    if fixed_pos == 0:
                        if t0 != p:
                            continue
                    elif fixed_pos == 1:
                        if t1 != p:
                            continue
                    else:
                        if t2 != p:
                            continue
                    # Compute discriminant
                    disc = t1*t1 - 4 * t0 * t2
                    if disc >= 0 and is_perfect_square(disc):
                        count_for_p += 1
    answer_counts[p] = count_for_p
    # If count >= 7, immediately print p (candidate prime)
    if count_for_p >= 7:
        print(p)
```
