Ground Truth Answer: 982982
Proposed Answer: 2 * 491 * 3 * 13 * 37 * 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a number (omnimath458_answer) that:
   - Is a product of 491, a 3-digit number ABC (where A,B,C < 10), and 2
   - Both 491 and ABC must be prime
   - The number has the form 100100*A + 10010*B + 1001*C

2. Ground truth answer is 982982:
   - 982982 = 491 * 1003 * 2
   - 1003 is a 3-digit number (A=1,B=0,C=3)
   - Both 491 and 1003 are prime (1003 = 17*59, but wait - this is not prime!)

Wait, this suggests the ground truth answer might be incorrect since 1003 is not prime. However, let's check the proposed answer:

Proposed answer is given as a factorization: 2 * 491 * 3 * 13 * 37 * 2
Let's compute this:
= 491 * (3 * 13 * 37) * 4
= 491 * 1443 * 4
= 491 * 5772
= 2,834,052

This doesn't match the ground truth answer (982,982), and is much larger. Also, 1443 is a 4-digit number, not 3-digit.

However, if we look at the original problem constraints, the proposed answer doesn't satisfy them (wrong digit length, doesn't match the required form).
