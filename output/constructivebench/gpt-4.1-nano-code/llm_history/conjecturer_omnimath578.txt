abbrev omnimath578_answer : ℕ → ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath578 (n : ℕ) :
  (digits 10 (∏ i in Finset.range (n + 1), (10^(2^i) - 1))).sum = omnimath578_answer n := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n = 0: sum of digits = 9
n = 1: sum of digits = 18
n = 2: sum of digits = 36
n = 3: sum of digits = 72
n = 4: sum of digits = 144
n = 5: sum of digits = 288
n = 6: sum of digits = 576
n = 7: sum of digits = 1152
n = 8: sum of digits = 2304
n = 9: sum of digits = 4608
n = 10: sum of digits = 9216. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
The pattern doubles the previous result at each step, starting from 9 when n=0. Thus, the sum of digits appears as 9 * 2^n for n ≥ 0. Therefore, the closed-form answer is: 

<<<fun n : ℕ => 9 * 2^n>>>
