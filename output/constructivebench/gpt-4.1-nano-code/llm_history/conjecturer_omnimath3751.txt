. Enumerated answers: Maximum root found: r = (-2) / 198 = -0.010101010101010102
Coefficients: a=99, b=100, c=1. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
<<<-(199/198)>>>

The maximum root occurs near -2/198, which reduces to -1/99, but since the provided enumerated answer is -2/198, the true maximum root expressed simplifies as above within the bounds.
