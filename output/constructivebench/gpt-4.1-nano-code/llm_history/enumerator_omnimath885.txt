This problem involves finding the minimal sum `s` of a set `A` with specific properties: size 7, positive integers, pairwise distinct, and the sum of any non-empty subset is divisible by its size. To approach this, we will generate all 7-element strictly increasing sets of positive integers with small values, check the divisibility condition, and find the minimal sum.

We focus on small integers to keep computations manageable, and omit large sets or high values, due to efficiency and token constraints.

```python
from itertools import combinations

def is_divisible_sum(subset):
    total = sum(subset)
    size = len(subset)
    # Check if the sum of subset is divisible by its size
    return total % size == 0

def check_set(A):
    # Check the divisibility condition for all non-empty subsets
    from itertools import chain, combinations
    for r in range(1, len(A)+1):
        for B in combinations(A, r):
            if sum(B) % len(B) != 0:
                return False
    return True

# Generate candidate sets: increasing sequences of length 7, small positive integers
min_sum = None
answer_set = None
for A in combinations(range(1, 20), 7):
    if check_set(A):
        s = sum(A)
        if min_sum is None or s < min_sum:
            min_sum = s
            answer_set = A
            print(f"Found candidate set: {A} with sum {s}")

# Output the minimal sum found
if answer_set is not None:
    print(f"Minimal sum: {min_sum} with set {answer_set}")
else:
    print("No suitable set found within the search bounds.")
```
