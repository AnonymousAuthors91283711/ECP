Let's analyze the problem based on its components:

- We're looking for the smallest natural number \( m \) such that:
  1. \( 0 < m \)
  2. \( 17 \mid m \)
  3. Sum of the digits of \( m \) (in base 10) equals 17.

Our approach:
- Since \( m \) must be divisible by 17.
- The sum of digits is 17.
- We want the least such \( m \).

To find this, we'll generate numbers with digit sum 17, starting from the smallest, and check divisibility by 17. We'll limit the search to reasonable bounds, say up to 3 or 4 digits (since larger numbers quickly become large).

Enumeration:
- Generate all digit combinations with sum 17, starting with the smallest numeric values.
- For each generated number \( m \), check if divisible by 17.
- Print each candidate as soon as found; stop at the first (smallest) one.

Here's the implementation:

```python
# Enumerate numbers with digit sum 17, starting from smallest, check divisibility by 17
def generate_numbers_with_digit_sum(s, max_digits=4):
    # Generate all digit combinations with sum s within max_digits
    def helper(current_digits, remaining_sum, position):
        if position == max_digits:
            if remaining_sum == 0:
                yield int(''.join(map(str, current_digits)))
            return
        start_digit = 0 if position > 0 else 1  # Leading zeros not allowed
        for digit in range(start_digit, 10):
            if digit <= remaining_sum:
                yield from helper(current_digits + [digit], remaining_sum - digit, position + 1)
    return helper([], s, 0)

for candidate in generate_numbers_with_digit_sum(17, max_digits=4):
    if candidate % 17 == 0:
        print(candidate)
        break  # Stop after the first (smallest) number found
```
