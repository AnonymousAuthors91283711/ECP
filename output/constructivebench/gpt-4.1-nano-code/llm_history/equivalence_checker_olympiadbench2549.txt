Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {x | x = -1 ∨ x = 1 ∨ x = (1 - sqrt 5) / 2 ∨ x = (1 + sqrt 5) / 2}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer lists some correct roots but is incomplete. The equation f(f(f(x))) = 3 is a degree 8 polynomial equation, which should have up to 8 real roots (though some may be repeated). The proposed solution only includes 4 roots, missing others like x = 3 and x = (3 ± sqrt(13))/2 that also satisfy the equation. The answer is partially correct but not complete.
