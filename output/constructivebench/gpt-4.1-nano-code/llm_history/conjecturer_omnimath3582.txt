open Function Real

abbrev omnimath3582_answer : ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3582 (f : ℝ → ℝ) :
  (∀ x y, f (f y) + f (x - y) = f (x * f y - x)) ↔ f = omnimath3582_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: f(x) = 0 satisfies the equation.. Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
<<<fun x : ℝ => 0>>>
This pattern suggests the zero function satisfies the functional equation trivially, fitting the pattern of an explicit solution.
