  (∑ k ∈ Finset.Icc 1 1006, ‖z ^ (2 * k + 1) - z ^ (2 * k - 1)‖ = Real.sqrt 2012 ∧
   ∑ k ∈ Finset.Icc 1 1005, ‖z ^ (2 * k) - z ^ (2 * k - 2)‖ = Real.sqrt 2012) ↔ 
  re (z ^ 2) = omnimath1432_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Possible answer for re(z^2): 1. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests that the sums relate to symmetric expressions involving powers of z, and both sums equate to √2012. The sum involving odd powers suggests properties like z^2 being real or related to ±1 to satisfy the equalities. Given the pattern in the enumerated answer and the symmetry, the likely value of re(z^2) that makes both sums equal to √2012 is 1, satisfying the symmetry and the sum constraints over real parts.
