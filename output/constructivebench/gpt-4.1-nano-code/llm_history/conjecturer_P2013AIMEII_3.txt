theorem P2013AIMEII_3 :
  let totalTime := ∑ k in Finset.range 119, 10 * (k + 1)
  let halfTime := totalTime / 2
  let heightAtHalfTime := 119 - (Finset.card {k ∈ Finset.range 119 | ∑ i in Finset.range k, 10 * (i + 1) ≤ halfTime})
  10 * heightAtHalfTime = P2013AIMEII_3_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 36
37
35. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the problem involves the sum of a sequence and the height at its halfway point, the pattern from enumerated answers suggests the height is approximately (119 + 1) / 2 ≈ 60, scaled down by some factor. Considering the options 36, 37, and 35, the most plausible height at half time is 36, matching the pattern in similar problems. 

The answer, scaled by 10, is thus 10 * 36 = 360. 

Final expression:

<<<360>>>

This fits with the logical progression of the problem's structure and the options provided.
