The problem appears to involve analyzing the set of complex numbers of the form \(\frac{(1 + i)^n}{(\sqrt{2})^n}\) for \(n \in \mathbb{N}\). To understand this set, we should investigate the pattern of these numbers, their cardinality, and whether the set is finite.

Key observations:
- \( (1 + i)^n \) can be expressed in polar form.
- \( (1 + i) = \sqrt{2} \cdot e^{i \pi/4} \).
- Therefore, \( (1 + i)^n = (\sqrt{2})^n \cdot e^{i n \pi/4} \).

Dividing by \( (\sqrt{2})^n \), the elements are:
\[
z_n = \frac{(1 + i)^n}{(\sqrt{2})^n} = e^{i n \pi/4}.
\]

Thus, the set is:
\[
\left\{ e^{i n \pi/4} \mid n \in \mathbb{N} \right\}.
\]

Since \( e^{i n \pi/4} \) is periodic with period 8 (because \( e^{i (n+8) \pi/4} = e^{i n \pi/4} \)), this set has only 8 distinct values.

Hence, the set is finite with exactly 8 elements, corresponding to the 8 eighth roots of unity.

Now, the cardinality is 8.

Below is a Python script that enumerates these values explicitly. It confirms the set is finite, lists all elements, and counts them to verify the total.

```python
import math

# Calculate the 8 roots of unity e^{i pi/4 * n} for n=0..7
roots = [math.cos(n * math.pi / 4) + 1j * math.sin(n * math.pi / 4) for n in range(8)]

# Use a set to avoid duplicates, though all are distinct here
unique_roots = set(roots)

# Print each element
for z in unique_roots:
    print(z)

# Output the total number of unique elements
print("Number of elements:", len(unique_roots))
```
