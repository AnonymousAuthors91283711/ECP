theorem olympiadbench2327 :
  ∃! (ab : ℕ × ℕ), 0 < ab.1 ∧ 0 < ab.2 ∧ Nat.gcd ab.1 ab.2 = 1 ∧ ab.2 - ab.1 = 15 ∧ 
  5/9 < ab.1/ab.2 ∧ ab.1/ab.2 < 4/7 ∧ ab.1/ab.2 = olympiadbench2327_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Candidate pair: (a=19, b=34), ratio=0.5588. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
Based on the enumerated candidate (19,34) and the ratio 19/34 ≈ 0.5588, which fits within the bounds 5/9≈0.5555 and 4/7≈0.5714, and considering the gcd condition, the ratio appears to match the unique ratio satisfying the conditions. Hence, the simplified ratio is 19/34.
