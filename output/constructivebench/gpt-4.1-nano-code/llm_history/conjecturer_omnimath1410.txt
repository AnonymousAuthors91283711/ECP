Total solutions: 4. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern shows solutions at n=5, 25, 125, 625, which are powers of 5. The x(n) values grow exponentially, suggesting the general n=5 * 5^k pattern. Thus, the solution set involves n=5*5^k, and x(n) follows a consistent pattern related to these multiples. The answer's closed form is n=5*5^k for k≥0.

Total solutions: 4. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The error arises because the proposed answer "(fun k => 5 * 5^k)" produces a function of type "ℕ → ℕ" in Lean, which is incompatible directly with the expected constant value type "ℕ". The theorem states that the answer is a constant natural number, so defining it as a function does not suffice. 

Given the enumerated solutions, each corresponds to certain specific n that satisfy the equation involving x(n) and x(n+1). The approximate pattern suggests the sequence is exponential in n because the solutions for x(n) are huge and involve powers of 5, aligning with the known pattern in the enumerations.

Since the pattern is consistent with x(n) being proportional to 5^n, my conjecture is that the answer is the number of solutions n (or some related quantity). The enumerated values are specific solutions rather than a simple closed form evaluated at all n. As the proposed answer indicated as "fun k => 5 * 5^k" is a function rather than a constant.

In the absence of more exact information, the most reasonable simplified closed form is fixing the answer to the total number of solutions (which is 4) given in the enumeration, since the pattern of solutions is discrete and finite, or to use the pattern of the exponential.

But the problem asks for the same type, i.e., a constant natural number. So, the final answer, completing the fix, is:

"4"

which corresponds to the total solutions identified, aligning with the enumeration.

<<<4>>>
