This problem involves finding the greatest \(k \in \mathbb{N}\) such that there exists a cubic polynomial \(P \in \mathbb{Q}[X]\) satisfying certain divisibility conditions involving quadratic polynomials. To approach this:

- Let's choose small candidate values of \(k\) (probably around 0 to 50) to check for the divisibility conditions.
- We generate polynomials \(P\) of degree 3 that are divisible by the two quadratics for each candidate \(k\).
- Verify if such \(P\) exists, and track the greatest \(k\).

Since the problem is abstract and algebraic, we'll implement a numerical search, focusing on small \(k\), and print the candidates when the divisibility conditions are met.

```python
from sympy import symbols, Poly, Rational, div, gcd
from itertools import product

X = symbols('X')

def quadratic(k):
    # quadratic for divisibility: X^2 + (k - 29)X - k
    return Poly(X**2 + (k - 29)*X - k, X)

def quadratic2(k):
    # second quadratic for divisibility: 2X^2 + (2k - 43)X + k
    return Poly(2*X**2 + (2*k - 43)*X + k, X)

# Generate all monic cubic polynomials P with rational coefficients
# For efficiency, we can parametrize P by three rational numbers a, b, c
# with leading coefficient 1 for simplicity

for k in range(0, 50):  # small sample range for k
    q1 = quadratic(k)
    q2 = quadratic2(k)
    
    # Compute GCDs to check divisibility
    # Since the problem states divisibility, check if q1 and q2 divide P
    
    # Let's construct a sample P divisible by q1 and q2
    # For that, P must be divisible by their least common multiple
    # If q1 and q2 are coprime, LCM is their product
    
    g1 = gcd(q1, q2)
    # For simplicity, assume q1 and q2 are coprime or work with their product
    lcm_poly = q1 * q2 // g1
    
    # Since q1 and q2 are quadratics, their product is degree 4
    # But P is degree 3, so P can be a polynomial dividing both, 
    # which can only happen if q1 and q2 share a factor, i.e., gcd not 1
    # If gcd is 1, no degree 3 P divides both quadratics
    if g1.as_expr() != 1:
        # P divides both q1 and q2 if q1 and q2 share a factor,
        # so P could be q1 or q2 (if degree 3)
        # For degree 3, P could be q1 (degree 2) or q2 (degree 2), but not degree 3
        # So no candidate in this case
        continue
    
    # Otherwise, q1 and q2 are coprime; check their gcd
    # For explicit divisibility, try to find if either quadratic divides some degree 3 polynomial
    # For simplicity, check whether q1 divides some polynomial of degree 3
    # But degree 3 cannot be divisible by quadratic unless it's reducible
    # Let's generate candidate P as q1 times a linear polynomial:
