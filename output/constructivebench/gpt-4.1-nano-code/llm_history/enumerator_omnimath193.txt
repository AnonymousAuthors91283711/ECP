This problem involves enumerating pairs of natural numbers (m, n) that satisfy specific conditions: m and n are coprime, both are odd, and their sum is a power of two. To explore the set of all such pairs, we can systematically generate small odd coprime pairs and check whether their sum is a power of two. We'll iterate over small m and n, enforce the conditions, and print each valid pair as soon as it is found, aiding in conjecturing the possible solutions.

```python
import math

# Function to check if a number is a power of two
def is_power_of_two(x):
    return x > 0 and (x & (x - 1)) == 0

# Generate candidate pairs (m, n)
# m, n are odd, coprime, and sum to a power of two
max_value = 50  # small sample limit for enumeration
for m in range(1, max_value + 1, 2):
    for n in range(1, max_value + 1, 2):
        if math.gcd(m, n) == 1:
            sum_mn = m + n
            if is_power_of_two(sum_mn):
                print((m, n))
```
