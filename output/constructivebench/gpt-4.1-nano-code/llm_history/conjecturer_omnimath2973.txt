96. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests counting numbers between 0 and 99 that contain the digit 6, which occur in certain positions with counts increasing by 10, and then at specific points, with some exceptions. The total count includes all numbers with 6, accounting for tens and units digit placements.

The enumerated answers show counts at 6, 16, 26, 36, 46, 56, and then irregular counts around 60-69, with higher counts for numbers containing 6 in tens digit. The overall pattern indicates the total count is 60, as this captures all numbers with at least one 6 in the range.

Final expression: <<<60>>>
