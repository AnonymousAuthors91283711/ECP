This problem involves a polynomial \( P \) in three variables with specific symmetry and zeroing conditions, along with a fixed evaluation at a specific point. The goal is to determine the value of a given evaluation under these constraints. 

Since the problem is high-level mathematics (involving multivariable polynomials, symmetry, degrees, and evaluations), a brute-force enumeration of inputs with small sample values is a practical approach to conjecture solutions or bounds.

Key points:
- The polynomial degree is 4, in 3 variables.
- Zero evaluations for certain fixed points (hzero).
- Cyclic invariance property (hcyclic) which constrains \( P \)'s form.
- A specific evaluation at a fixed point (h123).

Given the constraints, our plan:
1. Generate all degree-4 multivariate polynomials with coefficients over \(\mathbb{R}\) (sample coefficients from small rational sets).
2. For each polynomial, test the constraints (zero at given points, cyclic symmetry, specific evaluation).
3. When constraints are satisfied, compute the target evaluation and print it.

We will focus on a small sample of polynomial coefficients to make enumeration feasible, considering symmetries and constraints to reduce the candidate space.

The code below:
- uses a small coefficient set (-2 to 2, as an example),
- constructs candidate polynomials parameterized by their monomials,
- tests all constraints,
- if satisfied, outputs the evaluation at the required point.
