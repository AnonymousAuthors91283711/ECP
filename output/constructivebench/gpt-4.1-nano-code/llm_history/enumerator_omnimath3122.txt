This problem defines a function s(n) = 43 - 4n, and asks for the size of the set { n : ℕ | s n > 0 }. We need to find all non-negative integers n where 43 - 4n > 0, then count them.

To generate possible n values:
- Solve 43 - 4n > 0 ⇒ 4n < 43 ⇒ n < 43/4 = 10.75.
- Since n ∈ ℕ, n must be ≤ 10.
- For n in [0..10], check which satisfy the inequality.

Program enumeration:
- Loop over n from 0 to 10.
- Print each n where 43 - 4n > 0.
- Count total, then output answer.

```python
# Enumerate all n in [0..10] where 43 - 4n > 0
result = []
for n in range(0, 20):  # Going slightly beyond 10 to confirm cutoff
    value = 43 - 4 * n
    if value > 0:
        print(f"n = {n}, s(n) = {value}")  # Streaming partial result
        result.append(n)
    elif n > 10:
        break
print(f"Total count: {len(result)}")
```
