The problem appears to involve analyzing inequalities related to sequences and sums, typical of Olympiad number theory or inequalities. Since the formal theorem involves an arbitrary parameter `a` and sequences `x`, and compares two sums with a constant `a`, our goal is to experiment with small values and sequence choices to find critical bounds that suggest the value of `a` for which the inequality holds or fails.

Given the constraints:
- We have a sequence `x` of real numbers, strictly monotonic increasing (`StrictMono`).
- The sequence starts at `x 0 = 0`.
- The sums involve `1 / (x(i+1) - x(i))` and `(i+2) / x(i+1)`.

Our plan:
- Fix small `n` (like 2, 3, or 4).
- For different sequences `x`, compute both sums.
- Vary `a` to find the boundary where the inequality switches from true to false, helping to approximate `olympiadbench1845_answer`.

Here's a Python program to do these enumerations:

```python
# The purpose is to approximate the critical value for a based on small sequences.
# We generate sequences with increasing x, compute the sums, and see how the inequality behaves.
# We scan over candidate 'a' values to identify the boundary case.

import math

def sum_reciprocal_diff(x):
    total = 0
    for i in range(len(x)-1):
        diff = x[i+1] - x[i]
        if diff == 0:
            continue
        total += 1 / diff
    return total

def sum_ratio(i_list, x):
    total = 0
    for i in i_list:
        total += (i+2) / x[i+1]
    return total

# Generate example sequences
# x starting at 0, strictly increasing, small values
sequences = [
    [0, 1, 2, 3],    # linear increasing
    [0, 1, 3, 6],    # increasing faster
    [0, 0.5, 1.5, 3],# smaller initial segment
    [0, 2, 4, 8],    # doubling pattern
]

n = 3  # sequence length

# Generate all sequences with positive increasing values
for seq in sequences:
    # Ensure strictly increasing
    if all(seq[i] < seq[i+1] for i in range(len(seq)-1)):
        sum_rec = sum_reciprocal_diff(seq[:n])
        sum_rat = sum_ratio(range(n), seq)
        print(f"Seq: {seq[:n]}, Sum reciprocal diff: {sum_rec:.4f}, Sum ratio: {sum_rat:.4f}")
        # Try different 'a' around the ratio
        for a_multiplier in [0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2]:
            a = a_multiplier
            inequality_holds = sum_rec >= a * sum_rat
            print(f"a = {a:.2f} => inequality holds: {inequality_holds}")
        print()
```

This script enumerates small sequences, computes the two sums, and tests values of `a` around 1. To better understand the critical `a` threshold, observe the transition points where the inequality switches from true to false, helping approximate `olympiadbench1845_answer`.
