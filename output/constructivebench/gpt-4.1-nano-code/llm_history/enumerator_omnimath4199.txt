This problem appears to explore the set of multisets of size 2017 containing squares, with a given sum n, and relates this to the cardinality of such multisets. Since the question seems to ask for a possible sum n of 2017 squares, a simple approach is to consider small squares and sum them up to generate potential n values. 

Given the complexity, we'll generate small square numbers, combine 2017 of them in different ways (e.g., repeatedly using 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, ...), and output the first few possible sums. This will help in conjecturing the minimum, maximum, or possible values of n.

Here's the approach:
- Pick a small set of squares: 0, 1, 4, 9, 16.
- Enumerate multisets of size 2017 with combinations of these squares.
- For each combination, calculate the sum n and print it.
- Since the total number of multisets is huge, restrict to some pattern, e.g., how many 0s and remaining squares being 1s or 4s, etc.
- Focus on small or extremal sums to estimate the range of n.

```python
# Enumerate different sums for multisets of size 2017 with small squares
squares = [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]
size = 2017

# Generate some sample combinations:
# 1. All zeros
sum_all_zero = 0
print(f"Sum with all zeros: {sum_all_zero}")

# 2. All ones
sum_all_ones = 1 * size
print(f"Sum with all ones: {sum_all_ones}")

# 3. Mix of zeros, ones, and fours
# For example, half zeros, half fours (if even)
half = size // 2
sum_half_fours = 4 * half + 0 * (size - half)
print(f"Sum with {half} fours and rest zeros: {sum_half_fours}")

# 4. Maximize sum with only squares <= 16, for example, all 16
sum_all_16 = 16 * size
print(f"Sum with all 16s: {sum_all_16}")

# 5. Slight variation: some 9s, rest zeros
n_nines = 10
remaining = size - n_nines
sum_nines_zeros = 9 * n_nines + 0 * remaining
print(f"Sum with {n_nines} nines and rest zeros: {sum_nines_zeros}")

# 6. Combine small counts for variety
# e.g., 1000 ones, 1000 fours, 17 zeros
sum_varied = 1 * 1000 + 4 * 1000 + 0
print(f"Sum with 1000 ones and 1000 fours: {sum_varied}")
```
