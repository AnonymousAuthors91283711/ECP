The problem describes a combinatorial property involving permutations of a finite set (namely, functions from Fin 6 to Fin 6), with constraints on the images of certain elements. We need to enumerate these bijective functions (permutations) that satisfy the neighbor-eaten intersection condition, which resembles a localized boundary constraint.

Since the problem asks for the cardinality of such functions, I will:
- Generate all permutations of 6 elements (since they form bijections from Fin 6 to Fin 6).
- For each permutation, check the condition for each position `k`.
- Count only those permutations satisfying the condition for all `k`.
- Stream results immediately when a permutation satisfies the condition.
- Calculate the total count at the end.

Given the small set size, enumeration is feasible and not computationally heavy.

```python
import itertools

def is_valid_permutation(p):
    n = 6
    for k in range(n):
        # 'eaten' set: images of positions less than k
        eaten = {p[i] for i in range(k)}
        # 'neighbors' of p[k]
        neighbors = set()
        x = p[k]
        x1, x2 = divmod(x, 3)
        for y in range(n):
            if y == x:
                continue
            y1, y2 = divmod(y, 3)
            # Check adjacency in 3x2 grid
            if (x1 == y1 and abs(x2 - y2) == 1) or (x2 == y2 and abs(x1 - y1) == 1):
                neighbors.add(y)
        # Count neighbors within eaten
        intersection = neighbors & eaten
        if len(intersection) > 2:
            return False
    return True

count = 0
for perm in itertools.permutations(range(6)):
    if is_valid_permutation(perm):
        print(f"Valid permutation: {perm}")
        count += 1

print(f"Total count: {count}")
```
