The problem appears to involve counting the number of integers \(n\) within the interval \([1, 2005]\) such that the product \(\prod_{i=1}^n (4i - 2)\) is divisible by \(n!\). To enumerate solutions, we need to check for each \(n\) whether the divisibility holds.

A key insight:
- \(\prod_{i=1}^n (4i - 2)\) can potentially contain all prime factors necessary for divisibility by \(n!\). 
- We will simulate for small \(n\), check the divisibility, and count the satisfied cases.

While the exact behavior depends on divisibility factors, the code below explicitly enumerates for small \(n\), emphasizing correctness and efficiency. It:

- sets a maximum \(N = 2005\),
- checks the divisibility condition for each \(n\),
- counts and reports each valid \(n\),
- finally outputs the total count.

```python
import math

def check_divisibility(n):
    product = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        product *= (4 * i - 2)
    return product % math.factorial(n) == 0

count = 0
max_n = 2005
results = []

for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
    if check_divisibility(n):
        results.append(n)
        print(n)  # Streaming results as found
        count += 1

# Output the total count
print("Total:", count)
```
