Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The divisors count of \( n^n \) for the largest \( n \) with \( (n^n) \) divisors ≥ 1,000,000 is attained at \( n=66 \) with 300,763 divisors, which is less than 1,000,000. For \( n=70 \), divisors = 357,911, surpassing 1,000,000. Hence, the least such \( n \) is 70. 

Final answer: <<<70>>>
