The problem seems to be about a configuration of 10 points in the plane with certain distance properties, possibly related to a minimal number of points satisfying some conditions. Since the formal theorem involves complex properties over finite sets, and the problem context hints at an enumeration strategy, I will set up a simple finite enumeration over small sizes to help conjecture the minimal number `k`. 

Specifically, I'll generate configurations of points with small integer coordinates, check their distances, and verify properties like distances being distinct and unique closest points. I'll then output sizes that meet the criteria, aiming for the minimal `k` where the conditions hold.

The code will:
- Generate small point sets.
- Check the properties.
- Output candidate solutions immediately.

This approach helps in guessing the minimal number by enumerating small configurations.

```python
import itertools
import math

# Generate small configurations in 2D space
def generate_points(n):
    # Generate points with coordinates in small range to limit complexity
    coords = range(3)
    for pts in itertools.combinations(itertools.product(coords, repeat=2), n):
        yield list(pts)

# Compute Euclidean distance between two points
def dist(p1, p2):
    return math.dist(p1, p2)

# Check the properties for a set of points
def check_properties(points):
    n = len(points)
    distances = {}
    # Check distance symmetry and uniqueness
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            d = dist(points[i], points[j])
            if (i,j) in distances or (j,i) in distances:
                return False
            distances[(i,j)] = d
            distances[(j,i)] = d

    # Check that all pairwise distances are distinct
    d_values = set(distances.values())
    if len(d_values) != len(distances):
        return False

    # For each point, check existence of a unique closest point
    for i in range(n):
        dists = [dist(points[i], points[j]) for j in range(n) if j != i]
        min_dist = min(dists)
        closest_points = [j for j, d in enumerate(dists) if abs(d - min_dist) < 1e-8]
        if len(closest_points) != 1:
            return False
    return True

# Main enumeration for small sets, looking for minimal k
min_k_found = None
for size in range(2, 11):
    for pts in generate_points(size):
        if check_properties(pts):
            print(f"Found configuration with {size} points that satisfies conditions.")
            if min_k_found is None or size < min_k_found:
                min_k_found = size
            # stream partial results
    if min_k_found is not None:
        break

if min_k_found is not None:
    print(f"Minimal number of points satisfying properties: {min_k_found}")
else:
    print("No configuration found within tested range.")
```
