. Enumerated answers: s ≈ 0.618034, cos θ = 0.786151, tan θ ≈ 0.786151
s ≈ 0.618034, cos θ = -0.786151, tan θ ≈ -0.786151. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
The key relation cos θ = tan θ implies cos θ = sin θ / cos θ, leading to cos^2 θ = sin θ, or equivalently, cos^2 θ = 1 - cos^2 θ, so cos^2 θ = 1/2; thus, cos θ = ± 1/√2, and sin θ = cos^2 θ = 1/2. The value s = sin θ = 1/2 corresponds to cos θ ≈ 0.786151 or -0.786151. The set includes s = (√5 - 1)/4 ≈ 0.618034 as characteristic expression. 

Answer: <<158/256,  discovered from the algebraic relation.>> 
But simplified: cos θ = ± (√2 / 2), sin θ = (√2 / 2). The set of s satisfying the relation is { (√2 / 2), -(√2 / 2) }.

Final answer:
<<<{(Real.sqrt 2) / 2, -((Real.sqrt 2) / 2)}>>>
