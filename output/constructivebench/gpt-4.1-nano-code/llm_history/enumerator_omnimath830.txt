This problem involves finding the cardinality of a set T of subsets of Fin 3, which is closed under intersection and union. We need to enumerate all such T and determine its size.

Since Fin 3 has 8 subsets, the problem reduces to identifying all collections of these subsets closed under union and intersection, then counting them.

To manage this, we generate all subsets of the power set of Fin 3, filter those that satisfy the closure conditions, and count them.

Here's the implementation:

```python
import itertools

# All subsets of Fin 3 = {0,1,2}
elements = range(3)
power_subsets = []
for r in range(4):
    for subset in itertools.combinations(elements, r):
        power_subsets.append(set(subset))

# Generate all possible families T of subsets
all_families = []
# To limit the search, we restrict to families of size up to 8
max_size = len(power_subsets)

count = 0
# For each candidate family T (represented as a subset of power_subsets)
for size in range(1, max_size+1):
    for family in itertools.combinations(power_subsets, size):
        T = list(family)
        T_set = set(map(frozenset, T))
        # Check closure under union and intersection
        closed = True
        for U in T:
            for V in T:
                U_set = frozenset(U)
                V_set = frozenset(V)
                union = U.union(V)
                intersection = U.intersection(V)
                if frozenset(union) not in T_set or frozenset(intersection) not in T_set:
                    closed = False
                    break
            if not closed:
                break
        if closed:
            # Count this family
            print(len(T))
            count += 1
print(f"Total closed families: {count}")
```

This code enumerates all families, checks closure conditions, and outputs their sizes immediately when a valid family is found, facilitating an estimate of the total.
