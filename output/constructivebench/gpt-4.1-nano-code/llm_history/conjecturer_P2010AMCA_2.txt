  IsGreatest {n : ℕ | n = ∑ i in Finset.range 6, (100 - i)} P2010AMCA_2_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 585
Sum starting at 95: 555
Sum starting at 96: 561
Sum starting at 97: 567
Sum starting at 98: 573
Sum starting at 99: 579

Sum starting at 101: 591
Sum starting at 102: 597
Sum starting at 103: 603
Sum starting at 104: 609
. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern shows the sum increases by 6 with each increment of the starting point, starting from 555 at 95 up to 585 at 100. The maximum sum occurs at starting point 100, giving us 555 + (100 - 95) * 6 = 555 + 30 = 585. 

Final answer: <<<585>>>
