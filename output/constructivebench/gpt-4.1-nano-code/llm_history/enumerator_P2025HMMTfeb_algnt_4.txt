This problem involves summing over integer values from -1000 to 1000 of the floor of 2025 divided by (j + 0.5). To conjecture the answer, I'll write a Python script to evaluate this sum exactly and print each intermediate term to assist in understanding and verifying the result.

```python
# This script computes the sum of floor(2025 / (j + 0.5)) for j from -1000 to 1000
# It prints each individual term immediately upon calculation, then the total sum.

total = 0
lower_bound = -1000
upper_bound = 1000
constant = 2025

for j in range(lower_bound, upper_bound + 1):
    denominator = j + 0.5
    value = constant / denominator
    floor_value = int(value)  # floor since value > 0 for the range, but handle negatives correctly
    print(f"j = {j}, 2025 / (j + 0.5) = {value}, floor = {floor_value}")
    total += floor_value

print(f"Total sum: {total}")
```
