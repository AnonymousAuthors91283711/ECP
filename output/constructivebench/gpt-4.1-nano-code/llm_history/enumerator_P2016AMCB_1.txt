This problem appears to involve algebraic manipulation of a real expression with a parameter `a = 1/2`. We want to evaluate `(2 * a⁻¹ + (a⁻¹ / 2)) / a` and possibly find an exact answer.

First, let's understand the given expression:
- `a = 1/2`
- `a⁻¹ = 2` (since 1/(1/2) = 2)
- Expression: `(2 * a⁻¹ + (a⁻¹ / 2)) / a`

Substitute `a⁻¹ = 2`:
- Numerator: `2 * 2 + (2 / 2) = 4 + 1 = 5`
- Denominator: `a = 1/2`

So, the overall expression: `5 / (1/2) = 5 * 2 = 10`

Thus, the answer should be exactly `10`.

Here's the Python code to verify this step-by-step with minimal hardcoding, streaming the answer:

```python
# For verification, define a as 1/2
a = 1/2

# Compute the inverse of a
a_inv = 1 / a

# Compute numerator: 2 * a_inv + (a_inv / 2)
numerator = 2 * a_inv + (a_inv / 2)

# Compute the entire expression divided by a
result = numerator / a

# Print the exact result
print(result)
```
