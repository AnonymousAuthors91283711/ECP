Ground Truth Answer: 8 / (7 ^ (1/3))
Proposed Answer: 3.684
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the maximum value of a cyclic sum of fractional cube roots under given constraints.

2. The ground truth answer is 8 / (7^(1/3)), which is approximately 4.303 (since 7^(1/3) ≈ 1.913 and 8/1.913 ≈ 4.303).

3. The proposed answer is 3.684, which is significantly lower than the ground truth value.

4. The maximum would occur when all variables are equal (by symmetry), giving a = b = c = d = 25. Plugging this in:
   Each term becomes (25/(25+7))^(1/3) = (25/32)^(1/3) ≈ 0.908
   Sum of 4 terms ≈ 3.632, which is close to the proposed 3.684 but still doesn't match the ground truth.

5. The ground truth answer suggests a different configuration (likely some variables at 100 and others at 0) that gives a higher maximum.
