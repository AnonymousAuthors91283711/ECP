theorem omnimath2133 : 
  (List.sum (List.zipWith (fun (d : ℕ) (p : ℕ) => d * 4 ^ p) [1,0,2,0,1,2,1] [0,1,2,3,4,5,6])) = omnimath2133_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 6433. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern of the sums suggests calculating each term as \( d_i \times 4^{p_i} \) and summing. Substituting and summing the specific terms:

(1 * 4^0) + (0 * 4^1) + (2 * 4^2) + (0 * 4^3) + (1 * 4^4) + (2 * 4^5) + (1 * 4^6) = 1 + 0 + 32 + 0 + 256 + 2048 + 4096 = 6433.

Thus, the sum equals 6433.
