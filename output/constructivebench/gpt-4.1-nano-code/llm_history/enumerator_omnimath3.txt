This problem asks us to find whether there exist positive real numbers \(a_i\) (for \(i = 0,\dots,19\)) such that:

1. All \(a_i > 0\).
2. For all real \(x\), the polynomial \( x^{20} + \sum_{i=0}^{19} C(a_i) X^i \) has no roots (never evaluates to zero).
3. For every pair \((i,j)\) with \(i \neq j\), there exists an \(x\) such that replacing \(a_i, a_j\) with \(a_j, a_i\) in the coefficients yields a polynomial with a zero at \(x\).

We need to explore possible \(a_i\)s that satisfy these conditions.

Since the conditions are complex, especially the universal quantifiers, we simplify by:

- Testing small, distinct positive values for \( a_i \)
- Checking whether the polynomial with these coefficients is non-zero for some \( x \) (for the second condition)
- For pairs \( (i,j) \), verifying the existence of roots by sampling a range of \( x \).

Given the high degree (20) and the combinatorial complexity, we'll focus on a small sample for \(a_i\), e.g., assign \(a_i = 1\) for all \(i\). Then we check:

- Is \( P(x) = x^{20} + \sum_{i=0}^{19} C(1) x^i \) non-zero for various \(x\)?
- For pairs, we test swapped coefficients and seek roots.

Below is a Python program that:

- Sets \(a_i = 1\).
- Evaluates the polynomial at various \(x\).
- Attempts to detect roots or the absence thereof.
- Checks for swapped coefficients in pairs.

```python
import math

# Coefficients: all a_i = 1
a = [1 for _ in range(20)]

# Binomial coefficient function for C(a_i) - for simplicity, assume c(a_i) = a_i
def coeff(i):
    return a[i]

# Polynomial evaluated at x
def eval_poly(x, coeffs):
    result = x ** 20
    for i, c in enumerate(coeffs):
        result += c * x ** i
    return result

# Check if polynomial has real root in a range
def has_root_in_range(coeffs, start=-2, end=2, steps=1000):
    for i in range(steps + 1):
        x = start + i * (end - start) / steps
        val = eval_poly(x, coeffs)
        if abs(val) < 1e-6:
            return True
    return False

# Generate modified coefficients swapping i and j
def swapped_coeffs(i, j):
    new_coeffs = a[:]
    new_coeffs[i], new_coeffs[j] = new_coeffs[j], new_coeffs[i]
    return new_coeffs

# Main checks
print("Checking with all a_i = 1")
print("Polynomial non-zero in range [-2,2]:", not has_root_in_range(a))
for i in range(20):
    for j in range(i+1,20):
        coeffs_swapped = swapped_coeffs(i,j)
        root_exists = has_root_in_range(coeffs_swapped)
        if root_exists:
            print(f"Root found after swapping indices {i} and {j}")
        else:
            print(f"No root after swapping indices {i} and {j}")
```
