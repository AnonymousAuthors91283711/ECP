The equation 2x - 3z = 5y implies z = (2x - 5y)/3. The enumerations reveal z satisfies z = - (2/3)x + (5/3) y, which aligns with the pattern z = (-2/3) x + (5/3) y. To avoid fractions, multiply through by 3 and analyze the integral relations, ensuring the denominator divides evenly.

The given linear relation is 2x - 3z = 5y. Solving for z, we get z = (2x - 5y)/3. To express this as a closed-form function in Lean, noting that the enumeration shows z takes fractional values consistent with the pattern, the simplest and most direct formula is:

z = (2x - 5y)/3

In Lean syntax, this means:

abbrev omnimath3035_answer (p : ℤ × ℤ) : ℚ := (2 * p.1 - 5 * p.2) / 3

The formal theorem would then state that (x,y) satisfy the relation iff z equals this value:

<<<fun p : ℤ × ℤ => (2 * p.1 - 5 * p.2) / 3>>>

The reasoning behind this answer is straightforward algebra: From the relation 2x - 3z = 5y, solving for z gives z = (2x - 5y)/3. Since z must satisfy this relation precisely, the function that maps (x, y) to the unique z satisfying the equation is exactly (2x - 5y)/3. The enumeration indicates fractional values consistent with this pattern, confirming that this closed form universally fits all solutions. The concise definition avoids any conflicts with prior declarations and captures the intended logic succinctly in Lean syntax.
