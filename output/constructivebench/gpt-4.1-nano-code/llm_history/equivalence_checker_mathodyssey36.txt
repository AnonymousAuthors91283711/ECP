Ground Truth Answer: 5
Proposed Answer: 3
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the minimal number n such that x² + x + 4 can be expressed as a sum of squares of n linear forms (aᵢx + bᵢ)², but cannot be expressed with fewer than n such forms.

2. To determine this, we need to consider:
   - The quadratic form x² + x + 4
   - Its representation as a sum of squares of linear forms

3. Key observations:
   - The quadratic form is positive definite (discriminant = 1 - 16 = -15 < 0)
   - For real coefficients, the minimal number would be 2 (by diagonalization)
   - However, the problem specifies rational coefficients (a i b i : ℕ → ℚ)

4. With rational coefficients, the minimal number increases because:
   - We can't perform the same diagonalization while keeping coefficients rational
   - The minimal number becomes higher due to the constraints of working over ℚ

5. The ground truth answer is 5, which is correct for rational coefficients.
   - This is known from the theory of quadratic forms over ℚ
   - The proposed answer 3 is incorrect for this case
