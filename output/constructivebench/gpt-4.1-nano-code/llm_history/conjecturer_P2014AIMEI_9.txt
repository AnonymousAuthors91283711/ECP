. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Based on the pattern and approximate roots, the expression x₂ * (x₁ + x₃) approaches 2 as roots are close to the numerical approximation. 

Since the polynomial is of degree 3 with symmetric roots, the sum and product relationships suggest that x₂ * (x₁ + x₃) = 2 in the general form.
