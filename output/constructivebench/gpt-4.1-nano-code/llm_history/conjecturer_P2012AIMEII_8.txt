The problem involves twelfth roots of unity \(z, w\) with a linear relation and the quantifying the minimal squared norm of their product. The relation suggests \(z-w=(4+4i)(z+w)\), and roots of unity satisfy \(|z|=|w|=1\). Under these constraints, the smallest possible value of \(\operatorname{normSq}(z'w')\) is achieved for some specific roots, possibly with \(z' = 1\) or \(-1\). The minimal squared norm corresponds to the roots that minimize \(|z'w'|\), likely attained for \(z' w' = -1\) on the unit circle. The final closed-form expression simplifies to 1.
