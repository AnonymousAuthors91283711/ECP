The problem asks for the least number \(k\) of distinct positive integers in a list \(l\), such that:
- all elements are positive integers,
- exactly one integer appears exactly 10 times,
- all counts are ≤ 10,
- the size of the list (number of distinct elements) is minimized,
- and the total list size is \(k\).

Our goal: Find the minimal list length \(k\), satisfying these constraints.

Approach:
- We seek the minimal total length \(k\),
- with exactly one element appearing 10 times,
- other elements appearing at most 10 times,
- and at least one other element to ensure the count of distinct elements increases.

To minimize total length:
- Use exactly 1 element with count 10,
- Try to add as few other distinct elements as possible,
- Each additional element can appear at most 10 times.

Possible minimal configurations:
- One element with 10 counts,
- possibly adding other elements with minimal counts.

We want the minimal total length \(k\), i.e., 
\[k = 10 + \text{number of additional distinct elements} \times \text{their counts}\].

Since other elements can have counts ≤ 10, to keep total minimal:
- Add 1 other element with count 1 (minimum positive),
- Total length: \(10 + 1 = 11\),
- Distinct elements: 2.

Check whether fewer elements can give total length less than 11:
- Only 1 element with count 10: total length = 10, but then total list length = 10, count of distinct elements = 1 (which is less than 2).

But the problem asks for the *least* possible \(\,k\) such that the list's size is \(k\):

Actually, the real minimal is when total list length is 11:
- 1 element (with count 10) + 1 element (with count 1), total length 11,
- and number of distinct elements is 2,
- satisfying all conditions.

Now, we can implement code to generate such lists by enumerating combinations:

```python
# The following code searches for minimal total list length k satisfying the constraints
# We know the minimal is at least 11 (from the reasoning above),
# so iterate from 11 upward until we find a valid configuration.

# We only need to find the minimal k, so we can stop at the first success.

def generate_list_with_counts(total_length, distinct_count):
    # Generate possible count distributions:
    # One element with count 10, remaining total_length - 10 distributed among other distinct elements (each ≤10, ≥1)
    for counts in distribute_counts(total_length - 10, distinct_count - 1):
        # Check counts constraints
        if all(1 <= c <= 10 for c in counts):
            # Construct list
            list_items = [1]*10  # element with count 10
            for c in counts:
                list_items.append(2)  # other elements
            yield list_items

def distribute_counts(total, parts):
    # Distribute 'total' among 'parts' parts, each at least 1 and at most 10
    # Use recursive generator
    if parts == 1:
        if 1 <= total <= 10:
            yield [total]
    else:
        for first in range(1, min(10, total - parts + 1) + 1):
            for rest in distribute_counts(total - first, parts - 1):
                yield [first] + rest

k = 11  # Starting from minimal estimate
while True:
    for _ in generate_list_with_counts(k, 2):  # trying with 2 distinct elements
        # Found valid list
        print(f"Answer: minimal list length k = {k}")
        # Generate the list explicitly
        for l in generate_list_with_counts(k, 2):
            print(l)
        exit()
    k += 1
```

This code finds the minimal list length \(k\) where such a list exists, starting from the minimal estimated length 11 and increasing until found. It enumerates possible distributions of counts, constructing example lists satisfying all conditions.
