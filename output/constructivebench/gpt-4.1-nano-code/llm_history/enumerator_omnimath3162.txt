The problem asks to find a sequence \(a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}\) such that for all positive integers \(m\), the sum of \((a(n))^m\) over all \(n \in \mathbb{N}\) equals \(m\). We need to analyze or guess the possible form of such a sequence.

Let's consider small cases:
- For \(m=1\), \(\sum a(n) = 1\).
- For \(m=2\), \(\sum (a(n))^2 = 2\).

If the sequence is finite or simple, maybe it has only a few non-zero terms. Suppose only finitely many \(a(n)\) are non-zero, e.g., two values. Try to find these.

Candidates:
- \(a(n)=x\) for some \(n\), and others zero.
- For finite sums, the sum of powers has to match \(m\).

Let's experiment with small a few values:
- Suppose \(a(1)=x\), \(a(2)=y\), and others zero.
- Then:
  - \(\sum a(n) = x + y = 1\)
  - \(\sum (a(n))^2 = x^2 + y^2 = 2\)

From the first: \(y = 1 - x\).

Plug into the second:
\[
x^2 + (1 - x)^2 = 2 \implies x^2 + 1 - 2x + x^2 = 2 \implies 2x^2 - 2x + 1= 2
\]
\[
2x^2 - 2x = 1 \implies 2x^2 - 2x -1= 0
\]
\[
x = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4 - 4*2*(-1)}}{2*2} = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 8}}{4} = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{12}}{4} = \frac{2 \pm 2\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Corresponding \(y=1 - x\).

Now, check the third sum, for \(m=3\):

\[
a(1)^3 + a(2)^3 = x^3 + y^3 = 3
\]

Calculate \(x^3 + y^3\):

\[
x^3 + y^3 = (x + y)^3 - 3xy(x + y)
\]
Since \(x + y =1 \),
\[
x^3 + y^3=1^3 - 3xy*1 = 1 - 3xy
\]

Find \(xy\):

\[
x y = \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{3}}{2} \right) \left( \frac{1 - \sqrt{3}}{2} \right) = \frac{(1)^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2}{4} = \frac{1 - 3}{4} = -\frac{1}{2}
\]

Similarly for the other root \(x= \frac{1 - \sqrt{3}}{2}\).

Compute \(x^3 + y^3= 1 - 3xy= 1 - 3(-1/2)= 1 + 3/2 = 2.5\), but we need the sum for \(m=3\) to be exactly 3.

Since it's 2.5, not 3, the candidate doesn't fulfill the condition.

Hence, the assumption that only two non-zero terms works doesn't satisfy the \(m=3\) sum. Now, try the sequence with only one non-zero term: \(a(n)=c\). Then:

\[
\sum a(n) = c = 1
\]
\[
\sum (a(n))^m = c^m = m
\]

which gives:

\[
c^m = m
\]

For each \(m\), \(c^m= m\).

If \(c>0\), then \(c= m^{1/m}\).

But for different \(m\), \(c\) would change unless all \(m\) are the same, impossible.

Alternatively, suppose the sequence is \(\delta_{n=1}\), i.e., only \(a(1)=1\), others zero.

Then sum over \(a(n)^m\):

\[
a(1)^m=1^m=1 \neq m
\]
unless \(m=1\). So this doesn't satisfy the condition for all \(m\).

Let's try a constant \(a(n)=c\), with infinitely many terms (e.g., an infinite sum).

Suppose the sequence is constant \(c\), infinitely many times, then:

\[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} c^m
\]

Converges only if \(|c|<1\), but then the sum over \(\infty\) terms diverges for positive sum.

To get the sum equal \(m\), the sum over infinitely many constants converges only if the constants decay appropriately. But indefinitely many terms with fixed \(c\) won't converge unless \(c=0\).

It's getting complicated; perhaps interpret the sum as finite sums with finitely many non-zero terms.

Try a sequence where only one non-zero \(a(n)\) exists:

\[
a(n_0)= c,\quad \text{others zero}
\]

Then for all \(m\):

\[
c^m= m
\]
implying:

\[
c= m^{1/m}
\]

but as \(m\to\infty\), \(m^{1/m} \to 1\).

So for large \(m\), \(c\) approaches 1, but for each fixed \(m\), \(c\) must be \(m^{1/m}\). The sequence \(\{ m^{1/m} \}\) varies with \(m\), so not a fixed sequence.

Alternatively, suppose we choose a sequence \(a(n) = \frac{1}{n}\). Check:

\[
\sum_{n=1}^\infty a(n)^m = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^m}
\]

which is the Riemann zeta function \(\zeta(m)\), known to converge for \(m>1\) and diverge at \(m=1\). This sum does not match \(m\) for all \(m\).

Alternatively, choose \(a(n) = \omega^n\) where \(\omega\) is a root of unity; sum over all \(n\) might be manageable, but the sum of powers will also be complicated.

Overall, the main goal is to find or approximate a sequence \(a(n)\) such that for all positive integers \(m\),

\[
\sum_{n=1}^\infty (a(n))^m = m
\]

This resembles the properties of a measure or function with moments: the sum of powers equals the integer \(m\).

Given the arrangement, and the earlier tests, one candidate is to consider:

\[
a(n) = \frac{1}{n}
\]

then:

\[
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left(\frac{1}{n}\right)^m = \zeta(m)
\]

which is known to satisfy:

\[
\zeta(1) = \infty \quad \text{(diverges)}, \quad \zeta(2)=\frac{\pi^2}{6}, \quad \zeta(3) \text{ is Ap√©ry's constant}
\]

Given that they don't equal \(m\), but for small \(m\) it approaches certain values, perhaps approximate.

Since the problem emphasizes enumerating potential answers, let's try concrete finite sequences for small \(m\): for \(m=1\), sum of \(a(n) =1\). For \(m=2\), sum of squares \(=2\). For \(m=3\), sum of cubes \(=3\), etc.

Suppose only four elements:

\[
a(1)=1,\quad a(2)=\frac{1}{2},\quad a(3)=\frac{1}{3},\quad a(4)=\frac{1}{4}
\]

Sum:

\[
1 + 0.5 + 0.333... + 0.25 \approx 2.083
\]

Sum of squares:

\[
1 + 0.25 + 0.111... + 0.0625 \approx 1.4235
\]
which don't match the required sums.

Alternatively, choose sequences like \(a(n)=c \cdot \delta_{n=k}\), i.e., only one non-zero term:

\[
a(k)=c, \quad c^m = m
\]

\(\Rightarrow c= m^{1/m}\). If we define this for different \(k\) and \(m\), no fixed sequence.

To satisfy for all \(m\), the only realistic candidate is the sequence:

\[
a(n)=\frac{\delta_{n=1}}{1} + \frac{\delta_{n=2}}{2} + \frac{\delta_{n=3}}{3} + \cdots
\]

which leads to the sum of reciprocals.

Given these analyses, compute the sum accordingly.

Let's implement a code that:
- For small sample sizes, generate all sequences with entries in \(\{0,1/2, 1/3, 1/4\}\), sum their (power) sums, and check subsets matching the sums \(m=1,2,3,\dots\).

- Since the problem doesn't specify an exact known sequence and asks for enumeration, we'll choose small sequences, print their sums for various powers \(m=1,2,3\), and see what values approximate the sum \(m\).

Here's the code:

```python
import itertools

# Candidate sequence values
values = [0, 0.5, 1/3, 0.25]
max_length = 4

# Enumerate all sequences of length up to max_length
for length in range(1, max_length + 1):
    for seq in itertools.product(values, repeat=length):
        # Sum of sequence
        sum_seq = sum(seq)
        # For m=1,2,3, check sum of powers
        for m in range(1, 4):
            sum_powers = sum(x**m for x in seq)
            print(f"Sequence: {seq}, sum of squares: {sum_powers:.3f} for m={m}")
        print("---")
```

This code systematically enumerates small sequences with chosen sample values, computes sums of powers, and streams results. It helps in identifying patterns or conjectures about the sequence satisfying the original property.

---

**Final note:** The problem is challenging in general; the code provides a structured enumeration of small candidates, revealing potential sequences that approximate the sum conditions for specific small \(m\). Further mathematical analysis would be required for a formal proof.
