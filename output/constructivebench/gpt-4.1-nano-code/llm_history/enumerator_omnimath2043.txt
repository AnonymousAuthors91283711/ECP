This problem asks to find the size of the set of injective functions from the finite set of size 3 (`Fin 3`) to the finite set of size 4 (`Fin 4`).  
Since the question involves counting injections, the set in question is the set of injective functions from a 3-element set to a 4-element set.

Number of injective functions from a set of size 3 to a set of size 4 is the number of injective mappings (or permutations of 4 elements taken 3 at a time):

- First element: 4 options
- Second element: 3 options (excluding the first)
- Third element: 2 options (excluding the first two)

Total: 4 * 3 * 2 = 24

The code will explicitly enumerate and verify the number of such injective functions, then output the count.

```python
# Enumerate all functions c: Fin 3 -> Fin 4 and count how many are injective
from itertools import permutations

# Set of elements in Fin 4
fin4 = range(4)
# Generate all permutations of size 3 from Fin 4 (injective functions)
injective_count = 0
for perm in permutations(fin4, 3):
    injective_count += 1
    print(perm)  # Each injective function as a tuple

print(f"Total injective functions: {injective_count}")
# Assign the result to the lean constant
omnimath2043_answer = injective_count
```
