The problem appears to involve choosing pairs of positive integers (ab.1, ab.2) satisfying a specific equation involving binomial coefficients and powers, along with coprimality and sum conditions. To explore possible solutions systematically, I will:

- Use small sample values for ab.1 and ab.2.
- Compute the binomial coefficients and check the equation.
- Verify coprimality.
- Attempt to find the unique pair that satisfies all conditions.

Given the complexity, starting with small values of ab.1 and ab.2 up to a reasonable limit (say 30) should help in identifying candidate solutions. The solution is likely to involve some divisibility or ratio considerations, and the code will print each candidate satisfying the conditions.

```python
import math
from math import gcd, comb

# Given fixed binomial coefficients:
# choose(2000, 2) and choose(2000, 3)
binom_2000_2 = comb(2000, 2)
binom_2000_3 = comb(2000, 3)

# Search space for ab.1 and ab.2
max_value = 30

for a in range(1, max_value + 1):
    for b in range(1, max_value + 1):
        # Check coprimality
        if gcd(a, b) != 1:
            continue
        # Compute the equation:
        # binom(2000, 2) * a^1998 * b^2 = binom(2000, 3) * a^1997 * b^3
        left = binom_2000_2 * (a ** 1998) * (b ** 2)
        right = binom_2000_3 * (a ** 1997) * (b ** 3)
        if left == right:
            sum_ab = a + b
            print(f"Candidate: a={a}, b={b}, sum={sum_ab}")
```

The program searches for solutions with small values (up to 30) for a and b, checking the key equation involving large exponents and binomial coefficients. Given the enormous exponents (up to 1998), the calculations quickly become infeasible: `a^1998` and `b^1998` are astronomically large, leading to potential overflow or computational impracticality, and likely no small candidates satisfy the equality. Additionally, the program does not record or output any candidates, indicating that no solutions are found within the explored range.

**Judgement:**  
The problem appears to involve a relationship that simplifies algebraically, suggesting the true solutions, if small, might be missed by brute force. However, the current brute-force search is a reasonable initial approach for a problem at high school level, assuming the solutions are small.

Since the code does not produce any output, and the problem description seems to expect at least a candidate answer, the code likely fails to find solutions due to infeasible exponentiation and limited search space.

**Acceptance:**  
***Rejected*** â€” the code's search space is too small, and large exponents make brute-force infeasible.

---

**Corrected version:**  
Instead of brute-force, analyze the equation algebraically:

\[
\binom{2000}{2} a^{1998} b^2 = \binom{2000}{3} a^{1997} b^3
\]

Divide both sides by \( a^{1997} b^2 \):

\[
\binom{2000}{2} a = \binom{2000}{3} b
\]

Thus:

\[
a = \frac{\binom{2000}{3}}{\binom{2000}{2}} b
\]

Calculate the ratio:

\[
\frac{\binom{2000}{3}}{\binom{2000}{2}} = \frac{\frac{2000 \times 1999 \times 1998}{6}}{\frac{2000 \times 1999}{2}} = \frac{1998}{3} = 666
\]

So:

\[
a = 666 \times b
\]

Given \(a, b > 0\), and coprimality:

\[
\gcd(a, b) = 1 \;\Rightarrow\; \gcd(666 b, b) = \g

The provided problem seems to relate to a mathematical proof or a formalized theorem involving coprime positive integers and binomial coefficient equations. The original program is empty, with no code provided. The output indicates an error due to the absence of implementation.

Given the problem's statement, the task involves finding a unique pair of positive coprime integers \((ab.1, ab.2)\) satisfying a specific algebraic equation involving binomial coefficients, exponents, and coprimality.

**Judgement:**
- Since the entire code is missing, the program does not produce any answers and only results in an error.
- The problem appears high-level and more of a mathematical proof than computational enumeration; however, to verify the claims, a computational approach might attempt to find candidate pairs.

**Acceptance:**
- The original program is *not* acceptable because it produces no output and does not fulfill the enumeration and procedural requirements stated in the task description.

**Correction:**
- Implement a Python script that searches for candidate pairs \((a, b)\) within small bounds.
- Checks whether they are coprime and satisfy the algebraic relation.
- For demonstration purposes, select small sample bounds (e.g., 1 to 20).
- Output candidates as soon as they are found.
- After enumeration, identify and print the unique solution, if any.

```python
import math
from itertools import combinations

# Function to compute binomial coefficient
def C(n, k):
    return math.comb(n, k)

# Search bounds
max_val = 20  # small sample to keep enumeration efficient

# Equation parameters
target_coef_num = C(2000, 3)
target_coef_den = C(2000, 2)

# Enumerate candidate pairs (a, b)
for a in range(1, max_val + 1):
    for b in range(1, max_val + 1):
        if math.gcd(a, b) == 1:
            # Check the algebraic condition:
            # C(2000, 2) * a^1998 * b^2 = C(2000, 3) * a^1997 * b^3
            left = C(2000, 2) * (a ** 1998) * (b ** 2)
            right = C(2000, 3) * (a ** 1997) * (b
