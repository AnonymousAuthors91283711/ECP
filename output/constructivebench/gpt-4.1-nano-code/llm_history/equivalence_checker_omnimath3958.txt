theorem omnimath3958 (a b c d : ℝ) :
  (a + b) * (a^2 + b^2) = (c + d) * (c^2 + d^2) ∧
  (a + c) * (a^2 + c^2) = (b + d) * (b^2 + d^2) ∧
  (a + d) * (a^2 + d^2) = (b + c) * (b^2 + c^2) ↔ (a, b, c, d) ∈ omnimath3958_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: { (a, b, c, d) | a = b ∧ b = c ∧ c = d }
Proposed Answer: {x : ℝ × ℝ × ℝ × ℝ | ∃ k : ℝ, x = (k, k, k, k)}
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer and the ground truth answer are equivalent. Both express that all four variables (a, b, c, d) must be equal to each other and to some real number k. The ground truth states this explicitly with a = b ∧ b = c ∧ c = d, while the proposed answer uses existential quantification to say there exists a k such that all components equal k. These formulations describe exactly the same set of solutions.
