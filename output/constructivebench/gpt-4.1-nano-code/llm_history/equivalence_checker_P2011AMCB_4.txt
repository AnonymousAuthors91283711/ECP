Ground Truth Answer: 224
Proposed Answer: 1610
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find two-digit numbers a (10 ≤ a < 100) and b such that:
   - When you reverse a's digits (using the given function) and multiply by b, you get 161
   - The product a × b equals the answer (224 for ground truth, 1610 for proposed)

2. Let's check the proposed answer (1610):
   - If a × b = 1610, then possible pairs (a,b) where a is two-digit:
     (10,161), (14,115), (23,70), (35,46), (46,35), (70,23)
   - Checking the reversal condition:
     For (14,115): reversed 14 is 41 → 41×115 = 4715 ≠ 161
     For (23,70): reversed 23 is 32 → 32×70 = 2240 ≠ 161
     For (35,46): reversed 35 is 53 → 53×46 = 2438 ≠ 161
     None satisfy both conditions

3. The ground truth answer 224 works with a=14, b=16:
   - 14×16 = 224
   - reversed 14 is 41 → 41×16 = 656 ≠ 161 (Wait, this seems incorrect)
   Actually, the correct pair is a=32, b=7:
   - 32×7 = 224
   - reversed 32 is 23 → 23×7 = 161

The proposed answer 1610 doesn't satisfy the conditions, while 224 does. They are not equivalent.
