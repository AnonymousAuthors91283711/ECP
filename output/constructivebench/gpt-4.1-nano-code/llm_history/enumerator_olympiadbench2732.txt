This problem involves two pairs of roots: (r, s) and (r+1, s+1), with given relationships involving symmetric sums and products. Our goal is to find the value of c, which is the product of (r+1) and (s+1), given the constraints.

Given:
- \( r \neq s \)
- \( r + s = -b \)
- \( r \times s = 93 \)
- \( (r+1) + (s+1) = 22 \)
- \( (r+1) \times (s+1) = c \)

From the second pair:
- \( r+1 + s+1 = r + s + 2 = 22 \Rightarrow r + s = 20 \)
- \( r \times s = 93 \)

But from the first pair, \( r + s = -b \), so:
- \( -b = 20 \Rightarrow b = -20 \)

The roots r and s satisfy:
- \( r + s = 20 \)
- \( r s = 93 \)

Now, the roots are solutions to:
\[ x^2 - (r + s) x + r s = 0 \]
which simplifies to:
\[ x^2 - 20x + 93 = 0 \]
and solutions:
\[ r, s = \frac{20 \pm \sqrt{20^2 - 4 \times 93}}{2} = \frac{20 \pm \sqrt{400 - 372}}{2} = \frac{20 \pm \sqrt{28}}{2} \]

Similarly, \( r+1, s+1 \) are roots of:
\[ x^2 - 22 x + c = 0 \]
and by Vieta's:
- Sum: \( r + s + 2 = 22 \)
- Product: \( (r+1)(s+1) = c \)

But since:
\[ (r+1)(s+1) = r s + r + s + 1 = 93 + 20 + 1 = 114 \]

Therefore, \( c = 114 \).

Below, we create a Python program that confirms these calculations and enumerates possible roots and the value of c.

```python
import math

# Given
r_plus_s = 20
r_times_s = 93

# Roots of the quadratic for r and s
discriminant = r_plus_s**2 - 4 * r_times_s
sqrt_discriminant = math.sqrt(discriminant)

r1 = (r_plus_s + sqrt_discriminant) / 2
s1 = (r_plus_s - sqrt_discriminant) / 2

# Check that r+1 and s+1 roots satisfy the second polynomial
c = r_times_s + r_plus_s + 1
print("Possible roots for r and s:")
print(f"r = {r1}")
print(f"s = {s1}")
print(f"Sum r + s = {r1 + s1}")
print(f"Product r * s = {r1 * s1}")

# Compute c based on roots
r_plus_1 = r1 + 1
s_plus_1 = s1 + 1
c_computed = r_plus_1 * s_plus_1
print(f"Computed c (product of r+1 and s+1): {c_computed}")

# Verify the equations
print(f"Verification: (r+1) + (s+1) = {r_plus_1 + s_plus_1}")
print(f"Verification: (r+1)*(s+1) = {c_computed}")
```
