  Set.Finite S ∧ Nat.card S = P2020AMCB_17_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Total solutions: 0. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The total solutions count is zero for the polynomial class with roots satisfying the given rotational symmetry condition. This symmetry implies roots form orbits under multiplication by a primitive 3rd root of unity, which is incompatible with roots needed for multiplicity fitting the polynomial structure if roots are not special. Hence, no such polynomials exist.
