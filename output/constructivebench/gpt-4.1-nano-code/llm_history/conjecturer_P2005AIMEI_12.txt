theorem P2005AIMEI_12 :
  let a := Finset.card {n ∈ Finset.range 2005 | Odd (S (n + 1))}
  let b := Finset.card {n ∈ Finset.range 2005 | Even (S (n + 1))}
  |(a : ℤ) - b| = P2005AIMEI_12_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Number of n with odd S(n): 990
Number of n with even S(n): 1015
Absolute difference: 25. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<25>>>

This matches the absolute difference of 25 between the counts of n with odd and even S(n).
