This problem involves counting the number of pairs of finite sets (each subset of {0,1,...,9}) whose union has exactly 3 elements. The task is to enumerate all such pairs and find the total count, which is the cardinality of the set of pairs satisfying the union size condition.

Approach:
- Fix parameter n=10 for the universe size.
- For each possible size of the first set (k from 0 to 3, since union must be size 3), enumerate all subsets.
- For each possible size of the second set (l), determine possible overlaps to ensure union size is exactly 3.
- Count all such pairs efficiently, avoiding redundant computations.
- Print each count as they are found.
- Sum all counts and print the total, that will give the answer.

```python
# Program to count pairs of subsets of {0,...,9} whose union is size 3.
# We will enumerate all possible pairs without compression to avoid over-complexity.

from itertools import combinations

def count_pairs_with_union_size_3():
    universe = range(10)
    total_count = 0
    # Enumerate all subsets of size 0 to 3 (since the union size is 3)
    for size_A in range(4):
        for A in combinations(universe, size_A):
            set_A = set(A)
            for size_B in range(4):
                for B in combinations(universe, size_B):
                    set_B = set(B)
                    union_size = len(set_A | set_B)
                    if union_size == 3:
                        print(f"A: {set_A}, B: {set_B}")
                        total_count += 1
    print(f"Total pairs with union size 3: {total_count}")
