. Enumerated answers: a = -15
b = -10
c = -5. Expected Answer Type: ℤ
Given the system:

1. a + 5 = b  
2. 5 + b = c  
3. b + c = a

From (1): b = a + 5  
From (2): c = 5 + b = 5 + (a + 5) = a + 10  
Plug into (3): b + c = a  
=> (a + 5) + (a + 10) = a  
=> 2a + 15 = a  
=> a = -15  
Then b = a + 5 = -10  
and c = a + 10 = -5

Final answer:
<<<-15>>>
