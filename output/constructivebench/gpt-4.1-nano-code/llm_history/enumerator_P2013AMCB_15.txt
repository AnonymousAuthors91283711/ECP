The problem involves finding the minimal possible value of the absolute difference between the first elements of two sorted (descending) non-empty lists of non-negative integers whose sums add up to 2013. To assist in conjecturing and proving the minimal difference, I'll programmatically generate candidate list pairs with varying initial elements, ensuring the sum constraint, and look for the smallest absolute difference between their first elements.

The approach:
- Fix the first elements `a0` and `b0` with `a0 ≥ b0 ≥ 0`.
- For each pair, check if we can fill the lists with remaining elements summing appropriately to reach total 2013.
- Prioritize minimal differences, starting from 0 upwards.
- For each candidate difference, determine possible `(a0, b0)` pairs.
- Once the minimal difference is found, output all such pairs (or a feasible set), to assist in analyzing the minimal difference.

The code will:
- Iterate over `diff` from 0 upwards (to find the minimal).
- For each `diff`, iterate over possible `b0`.
- Derive `a0 = b0 + diff`.
- Check if the remaining sums can be distributed among the lists while maintaining sorted order.
- Print each candidate immediately when found.

```python
# Enumerate pairs of first elements of lists with a fixed difference to find the minimal difference
def main():
    total = 2013
    max_elem = total  # upper bound for list elements

    # Starting from difference 0 upwards
    for diff in range(0, total + 1):
        found_candidates = []
        for b0 in range(0, total + 1):
            a0 = b0 + diff
            if a0 > total:
                continue
            # Remaining sum after removing first elements
            remaining = total - (a0 + b0)
            if remaining < 0:
                continue
            # Check if we can select remaining elements for each list
            # with sum remaining/2 each, in descending order
            # For simplicity, assume each list has at least one element.
            # Distribute remaining sum evenly (or nearly evenly).
            for as_sum in range(0, remaining + 1):
                bs_sum = remaining - as_sum
                # Construct lists: start with first elements
                as_list = [a0]
                bs_list = [b0]
                # Append elements to reach sums
                # For simplicity, fill as_list and bs_list with minimal elements
                # (e.g., just assign remaining as sums to first elements)
                # Here, for minimal difference, the lists can just be the first element plus zeros
                # if sums match.
                # Check if sums are consistent
                if sum(as_list[1:]) + as_sum - as_list[0] <= 0 and sum(bs_list[1:]) + bs_sum - bs_list[0] <= 0:
                    # Valid candidate
                    print(f'diff={diff}, a0={a0}, b0={b0}')
                    # Because we're only interested in minimal difference, stop at first diff
        if diff > 0 and False:
            # To limit output, break after first found diff
            pass
        if diff == 0:
            # Store or print all candidates with zero difference
            pass
        elif diff > 0:
            # Once minimal difference is confirmed (the first with candidates), stop
            break
