  P2009AIMEI_13_answer := by sorry. Current Proposed Answer: fun s : ℕ => s. Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 35, which is at "fun s : ℕ => s" in "abbrev P2009AIMEI_13_answer : ℕ := fun s : ℕ => s", there is an error: type mismatch
  fun s => s
has type
  ℕ → ℕ : Type
but is expected to have type
  ℕ : Type
Possible Fix: Check if the expected type aligns with the provided type..

Minimum s: 0
. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The error arises because `abbrev P2009AIMEI_13_answer : ℕ := sorry` was replaced with `fun s : ℕ => s`. But the type of `fun s : ℕ => s` is `ℕ → ℕ`, a function, not `ℕ`. The goal is to define the final answer as a specific natural number `s`. Since the enumerated answer indicates the minimal possible `s` is `0`, the correct answer should simply be a constant value, i.e., `0`.

Therefore, the correct fixed answer expression is:

<<<0>>>

This expression satisfies the expected type `ℕ` and represents the minimal value satisfying the problem, aligning with the enumerated answer set starting at 0.
