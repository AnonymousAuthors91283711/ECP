The quadratic equation in p.1: x^2 - 2009 y + 2 y^2 = 0. For y=0, x=0; for y ≠ 0, solutions involve quadratic formula with discriminant 2009^2 - 8 y^2 ≥ 0, leading to y² ≤ (2009)^2/8, so y ∈ {0, ±‖bound‖}. The pattern shows solutions strongly depend on y=0 case, with x=0 only. Hence, the entire solution set is {(0, 0)}.
