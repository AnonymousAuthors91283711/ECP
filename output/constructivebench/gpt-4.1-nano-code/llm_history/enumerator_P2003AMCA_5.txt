This problem appears to involve finding digits A, M, C (each between 0 and 9) such that:

(10000A + 1000M + 100C + 10) + (10000A + 1000M + 100C + 12) = 123422

and the sum A + M + C equals some unknown answer, which we are to find.

Let's analyze the equations:

Sum of the first two numbers:
2 * (10000A + 1000M + 100C) + 12 = 123422

=> 2 * (10000A + 1000M + 100C) = 123410

=> 10000A + 1000M + 100C = 61705

Since A, M, C are digits 0..9, their maximum sum 9+9+9=27, but the number 61705 is consistent with the hundreds, thousands, and ten-thousands place.

Given the sum:
10000A + 1000M + 100C = 61705

Divide through by 100:
100A + 10M + C = 617.05

But since A, M, C are digits, and the total 617.05 cannot be obtained from integers, this indicates our approach is inconsistent because A, M, C are each between 0 and 9.

Reconsider:

Note that the two numbers are:

X = 10000A + 1000M + 100C + 10
Y = 10000A + 1000M + 100C + 12

Their sum:
X + Y = 2*(10000A + 1000M + 100C) + 22

Set this equal to 123422:

2*(10000A + 1000M + 100C) + 22 = 123422

=> 2*(10000A + 1000M + 100C) = 123400

=> 10000A + 1000M + 100C = 61700

Divide by 100:

100A + 10M + C = 617

But again, A, M, C are digits between 0..9, so their 100A + 10M + C would be at most 999, not 617.

This contradiction suggests I misinterpreted the initial constraints.

Perhaps the problem is that A, M, C are **not** necessarily single digits but are digits representing numbers (0..9). Alternatively, maybe the 'Fin 10' means each is an element from 0..9.

Looking at the theorem:

(10000 * A + 1000 * M + 100 * C + 10) + (10000 * A + 1000 * M + 100 * C + 12) = 123422

which simplifies to:

2*(10000 A + 1000 M + 100 C) + 22 = 123422

Then:

2 * (10000 A + 1000 M + 100 C) = 123400

=> 10000 A + 1000 M + 100 C = 61700

Divide by 100:

100A + 10M + C = 617

Again, impossible since A, M, C are digits 0..9, so they can't sum to 617.

I suspect that the code is in Lean syntax, where 'Fin 10' means A, M, C are elements from 0..9 (digits).

Given that, perhaps there's a typo or error. Alternatively, maybe the sum was meant to be:

(10000 * A + 1000 * M + 100 * C + 10) and (10000 * A + 1000 * M + 100 * C + 12) are concatenated or considered differently.

Looking for an alternative approach, perhaps the problem is to find A, M, C (digits 0..9) with the properties:

- The sum equals 123422

- A + M + C = some value.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum of these two numbers equals 123422:

X = 10000A + 1000M + 100C + 10

Y = same as above + 2

Their sum:

X + Y = 123422

X + (X + 2) = 123422

2X + 2 = 123422

=> 2X = 123420

=> X = 61710

Now, check if X can be represented as:

10000A + 1000M + 100C + 10 = 61710

So:

10000A + 1000M + 100C = 61700

Divide:
100A + 10M + C = 6.17

Not possible, as C is an integer digit.

Possible that the problem's code, in the theorem, uses the parameters A, M, C that are involved in forming certain numbers.

Given the difficulty, perhaps the problem is to find A, M, C in 0..9 such that:

(10000A + 1000M + 100C + 10) + (10000A + 1000M + 100C + 12) = 123422

and also:

A + M + C = ?

Our goal is to find A + M + C.

Given the sum:

2*(10000A + 1000M + 100C) + 22 = 123422

Then:

2*(some number) = 123400

=> the number:

10000A + 1000M + 100C = 61700

Divide both sides by 100:

100A + 10M + C = 617

which cannot be since A, M, C are digits (0..9). Therefore, no solutions if interpreted directly.

Possible that the problem is missing some information, or the code is corrupted.

Alternatively, perhaps it's looking for generic enumeration over A, M, C in 0..9 satisfying

(10000A + 1000M + 100C + 10) + (10000A + 1000M + 100C + 12) = 123422

which reduces to

2 * (10000A + 1000M + 100C) + 22 = 123422

=> 2 * (10000A + 1000M + 100C) = 123400

=> 10000A + 1000M + 100C = 61700

which cannot happen with A, M, C in 0..9.

***

This makes me think that perhaps the problem is not about the digits A, M, C, but about enumerating some parameters, or perhaps the problem wants to find the sum A+M+C with some constraints.

Given the context and the last line: "A + M + C = P2003AMCA_5_answer" where P2003AMCA_5_answer is an abbreviation, perhaps the main goal is to find what A+M+C is.

Given the initial calculations and the inconsistency, perhaps the goal is just to enumerate all triplets (A, M, C) in 0..9 where:

(10000*A + 1000*M + 100*C + 10) + (10000*A + 1000*M + 100*C + 12) = 123422

and then for each such triplet, compute A+M+C, and see what is possible.

Given the earlier discrepancy, perhaps we need to brute-force all A, M, C in 0..9 and check what sum yields.

Implement a simple enumeration:

- for A in 0..9
- for M in 0..9
- for C in 0..9
- compute sum = (10000*A + 1000*M + 100*C + 10) + (10000*A + 1000*M + 100*C + 12)
- check if equals 123422
- if so, output A + M + C

Now, sum:

Sum = 2*(10000*A + 1000*M + 100*C) + 22

Set equal to 123422:

2*(10000*A + 1000*M + 100*C) + 22 = 123422

=> 2*(value) = 123400

=> value = 61700

But can 10000*A + 1000*M + 100*C = 61700 with A,M,C in 0..9? No, maximum of:

A=9 => 90000

M=9 => 9000

C=9 => 900

Sum = 90000 + 9000 + 900 = 99900

So 61700 is less than max 99900. Is it feasible?

Let's check whether there's a combination with A, M, C in 0..9 satisfying:

10000*A + 1000*M + 100*C = 61700

Now, consider A:

A = 6 => 60000

Remaining 1700 for M and C:

1700 = 1000*M + 100*C

M,C in 0..9:

max for M,C:

Max M=9 => 9000 => too large.

In this case, 1000*M = such big numbers only if M=1, 6, etc. Let's try:

A=6:

Remaining: 61700 - 60000 = 1700

Then:

1000*M + 100*C = 1700

Possible:

M=1 => 1000*1=1000

Remaining: 1700 - 1000=700

Then C=7 => 100*7=700

Sum:

1000+700=1700

Yes! So:

A=6

M=1

C=7

Check sum:

Sum of digits: 6+1+7=14

From earlier, the sum:

Knowing that, check whether it satisfies the initial sum.

Sum:

(10000*6 + 1000*1 + 100*7 + 10) + (10000*6 + 1000*1 + 100*7 + 12)

Calculations:

First number:

10000*6=60000

1000*1=1000

100*7=700

Plus 10: total: 60000+1000+700+10=61710

Second number:

Same as above plus 2: 61712

Sum:

61710 + 61712= 123422

Exactly the target sum!

So, the triplet (A,M,C) = (6,1,7), and the sum:

A+M+C=6+1+7=14

Therefore, the answer is 14.

Now, in code, enumerate all possibilities:

- A in 0..9

- M in 0..9

- C in 0..9

- Compute sum as above.

- If sum matches 123422, store and output A+M+C.

Let's implement this.

```python
# Enumerate all A, M, C in 0..9, check for the condition, and output A+M+C if condition met
# Stream results as soon as found.

for A in range(10):
    for M in range(10):
        for C in range(10):
            total = 2 * (10000 * A + 1000 * M + 100 * C) + 22
            if total == 123422:
                answer = A + M + C
                print(answer)
```
