This problem provides a condition involving real numbers \(a, b\): \(\frac{5 + a + b}{3} = 33\). We are asked to find the value of \(\frac{a + b}{2}\). The goal is to enumerate possible answers based on this condition.

Since the condition is an equation involving \(a + b\), we can solve for \(a + b\) directly: from \(\frac{5 + a + b}{3} = 33\), multiply both sides by 3 to get \(5 + a + b = 99\), so \(a + b = 94\). Therefore, \(\frac{a + b}{2} = 47\).

But to follow your instructions, instead of hardcoding the answer, we will implement a Python enumeration that calculates \(a + b\) explicitly from the given condition and then computes \(\frac{a + b}{2}\).

Here's the Python program:

```python
# Enumerate possible solutions for a + b based on the given condition
# and print the corresponding (a + b)/2 value.
# Since the condition is an equation, this enumeration is straightforward.

# Given condition: (5 + a + b)/3 = 33
# Therefore: a + b = 3*33 - 5 = 99 - 5 = 94

# Enumerate candidate for a + b
candidate_sum = 3 * 33 - 5
print(candidate_sum)  # exact value of a + b

# Compute and print (a + b)/2
result = candidate_sum / 2
print(result)
```
