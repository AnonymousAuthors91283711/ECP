abbrev omnimath3294_answer : Prop := sorry
theorem omnimath3294 : 
  ¬ ∃ (a b : ℤ), (∃ (k : ℤ), a^5 * b + 3 = k^3) ∧ (∃ (m : ℤ), a * b^5 + 3 = m^3) ↔ omnimath3294_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Error: Program is empty. Expected Answer Type: Prop
Based on the symmetry and the structure of the equations, the only solutions likely occur when a or b are zero, which simplifies the expressions to cubic forms involving 3. The plausible answer is that the statement is always false, i.e., such (a, b) do not exist.

<<<False>>>
