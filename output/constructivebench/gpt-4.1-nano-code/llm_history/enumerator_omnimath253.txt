This problem appears to be about finding pairs of polynomial degrees with properties that prevent certain compositions. Since the question is high-level and domain-specific, a suitable approach is to generate possible degree pairs, especially small degrees, and test some conditions related to polynomial evaluations.

We'll:
- Enumerate pairs of degrees (n,m) for small polynomials (e.g., degrees up to 5).
- Assume monic polynomials with small coefficients to keep computations manageable.
- For each pair, generate random monic polynomials of degrees n and m.
- Check if the composition conditions hold (or fail), printing those that satisfy the non-equality condition in the theorem's conclusion.
- Since the problem involves a "for all t" condition, approximate over sampled t's and look for counterexamples.

This approach helps in conjecturing what pairs likely satisfy or violate the condition, guiding the proof.

```python
import numpy as np
from numpy.polynomial import Polynomial
import itertools

# Define small degree bounds
max_degree = 3
num_samples = 10  # number of t samples for evaluation

# Helper function to generate a monic polynomial of a given degree with small coefficients
def generate_monic_poly(degree):
    coeffs = np.random.randint(-5, 6, size=degree)
    # for monic, leading coefficient 1
    return Polynomial(np.append(coeffs, 1))

# Sample t values to test the evaluation condition
t_values = np.linspace(-10, 10, num_samples)

# Store pairs of degrees where the property possibly holds
found_pairs = []

for n, m in itertools.product(range(1, max_degree + 1), repeat=2):
    P = generate_monic_poly(n)
    Q = generate_monic_poly(m)
    # Check the condition ∀ t: P.eval(Q.eval(t)) ≠ Q.eval(P.eval(t))
    # We test over sampled t's to find a counterexample
    violates = False
    for t in t_values:
        p_val = P(t)
        q_val = Q(t)
        comp1 = P(q_val)
        comp2 = Q(p_val)
        # if at any t they are equal, we note potential violation
        if abs(comp1 - comp2) < 1e-6:
            violates = True
            print(f"Degree pair ({n},{m}) violates at t={t:.2f}")
            break
    if not violates:
        # If no violation over samples, conjecture they satisfy the property
        print(f"Possible pair: degrees ({n},{m})")
        found_pairs.append((n,m))
