This problem appears to involve identifying primes \( p < 1000 \) for which there exists a complex number \( z \) satisfying the given algebraic conditions: \( z^3 = (z^2 + 1) i \) and \( i z^2 = (z + 1)^2 \). Our goal is to find the primes \( p \) for which such \( z \) exists, then determine the greatest such prime under 1000.

Steps:
- For small primes \( p < 1000 \),
- We attempt to find a complex \( z \) satisfying the equations,
- Focus on solutions where \( z \) is algebraic (complex),
- To simplify, since the problem seems to involve algebraic equations, we test candidate primes,
- We identify which primes correspond to existing solutions, and pick the greatest.

Since symbolic algebra is complex, we use a numeric approximation approach:
- For each prime \( p \),
- Check for solutions \( z \) near various points in the complex plane,
- If solutions approximate satisfy the equations within a small tolerance, record the prime.

Here is a Python code that approximates the primes with such solutions:

```python
import sympy as sp

primes = list(sp.primerange(2, 1000))
candidate_primes = []

# Function to check if complex z approximately satisfies the equations
def check_equations(z, tol=1e-6):
    eq1 = abs(z**3 - (z**2 + 1)*sp.I)
    eq2 = abs(sp.I * z**2 - (z + 1)**2)
    return eq1 < tol and eq2 < tol

# Search over a grid of points in the complex plane
# Only need to find one approximate solution per prime
for p in primes:
    solutions_found = False
    for re in sp.frange(-10, 10, 1):
        for im in sp.frange(-10, 10, 1):
            z = re + sp.I * im
            if check_equations(z):
                candidate_primes.append(p)
                print(f"Prime {p} has solution near {z}")
                solutions_found = True
                break
        if solutions_found:
            break

if candidate_primes:
    print(f"The greatest prime satisfying the conditions is {max(candidate_primes)}")
else:
    print("No primes found satisfying the conditions under given search grid.")
```

This code searches for approximate solutions within a sampling grid; solutions are indicated by prints, and finally, the maximum prime identified is printed.
[refine_program]
The original Python program attempts to find primes under 1000 for which there exists a complex number solution satisfying the given equations. It searches over a coarse grid in the complex plane and prints solutions when found, then reports the maximum such prime. Since the grid is coarse and the checking relies on an approximate tolerance, it's very possible the search misses solutions, leading to no output or an empty result. 

From the problem's description, the code should find solutions if they exist and report the maximum prime under 1000 that admits such solutions. Given the existing code and its structure, it only searches a limited, coarse grid, which is unlikely sufficient for precise solutions, especially if solutions are not near the points checked.

**Acceptance judgement:** The code is not robust enough to confidently find solutions, and the output is empty, which does not meet the problem's requirement to find and report all solutions or the extremal one.

**Therefore, the original program should be rejected.**

---

**Corrected program:**

- Use symbolic solving with SymPy to directly solve the equations instead of a grid search.
- For each prime, check the existence of solutions analytically.
- When solutions exist, print the prime and the solutions.
- Find the maximum prime with solutions and print it explicitly.

```python
import sympy as sp

primes = list(sp.primerange(2, 1000))
candidate_primes = []

for p in primes:
    z = sp.symbols('z')
    # Define the equations:
    eq1 = z**3 - (z**2 + 1)*sp.I
    eq2 = sp.I * z**2 - (z + 1)**2
    # Solve the system:
    solutions = sp.solve([eq1, eq2], z, dict=True)
    # Check if solutions are real or complex; at least one solution indicates p works
    if solutions:
        candidate_primes.append(p)
        for sol in solutions:
            print(f"Prime {p} has solution near z = {sol[z]}")

if candidate_primes:
    print(f"The greatest prime satisfying the conditions is {max(candidate_primes)}")
else:
    print("No primes found satisfying the conditions.")
```
