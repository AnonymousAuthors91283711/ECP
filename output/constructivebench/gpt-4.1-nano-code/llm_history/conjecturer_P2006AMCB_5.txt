theorem P2006AMCB_5 : 
  IsLeast {t : ℝ | 0 ≤ t ∧ 5 * (t / 60) - 3 * (t / 60) = 1} P2006AMCB_5_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 30. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The set involves t such that (5t/60) - (3t/60) = 1, simplifying to (2t/60) = 1, hence t = 30. The minimum t satisfying conditions is 30.
