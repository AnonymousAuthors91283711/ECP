The problem appears to involve finding the least natural number \( k = m + n \) for parameters \( m, n \), and complex numbers \( x_j \), subject to certain sums of powers. The conditions are:

- \( m > n > 1 \),
- For all \( i < n-1 \), the sum \( \sum_j x_j^{i+1} = 1 \),
- \( \sum_j x_j^n = 2 \),
- \( \sum_j x_j^m = 4 \).

Our goal is to enumerate possible values of \( m,n,k \) that satisfy these constraints.

We will choose small values for \( n \) and \( m \) (say, up to 10) to look for candidates, checking whether such \( x_j \) can exist. For simplicity, assume the number of \( x_j \) is \( n \), and attempt uniform solutions or known roots of unity.

```python
# Enumerate small pairs of (m, n) with m > n > 1
# For each pair, check if there are plausible configurations of x_j
# that satisfy the sum conditions
# We will attempt to find such solutions for small n, m up to 10
