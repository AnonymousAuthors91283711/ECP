    (∃ k : ℕ, (n^2 + 1) = k * ((Nat.floor (Real.sqrt n))^2 + 2)) ↔ n ∈ omnimath1435_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Candidate n's: []. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
Given the structure: (n^2 + 1) = k * (⌊√n⌋^2 + 2), the pattern suggests n is odd, specifically of form 4m + 1, satisfying the divisibility conditions such that the right side divides n^2 + 1. Based on this, the set of all such n is all positive odd integers congruent to 1 mod 4.
