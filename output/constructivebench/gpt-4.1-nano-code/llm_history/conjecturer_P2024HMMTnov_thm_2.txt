Let's analyze the problem: for each number \( n \geq 2 \), the statement considers all pairs \( a, b \) with \( a + b = n \), and looks into the sum of digits of both \( a \) and \( b \). The minimal such \( n \) where for all such pairs at least one sum of digits is ≥ 7 appears to be 49, based on enumeration.

Since the minimal \( n \) satisfying the property is 49, and this aligns with the enumeration, then the answer matches this pattern.

Therefore, the closed-form expression is simply:

<<<49>>>
