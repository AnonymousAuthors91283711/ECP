The pattern in enumerated answers suggests pairs of conjugates, around a real part near -2.15, with specific imaginary parts. The real part appears close to -2.15, and the imaginary parts are approximately ±0.08. The symmetric conjugates indicate the principal value likely around the average of these pairs: roughly `-2.15 ± 0.08j`.  
Conjecture: The answer is a complex number with real part around -2.15 and imaginary part ±0.08.
