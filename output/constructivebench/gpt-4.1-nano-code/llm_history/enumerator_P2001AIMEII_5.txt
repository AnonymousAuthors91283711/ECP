The given problem appears to be to find the greatest integer \( n \) such that for any subset \( s \) of the interval \([4, n]\) with 10 elements, we can find three distinct elements \( a, b, c \in s \) forming a triangle (i.e., satisfying the triangle inequalities). This relates to the classic "subset of numbers forming a triangle" problem, often involving minimal and maximal bounds.

To solve, we will:

- Use a small set of sample values of \( n \).
- Generate all 10-element subsets of \([4, n]\).
- Check whether each subset contains three elements satisfying the triangle conditions.
- Record the maximum \( n \) for which the property holds for *all* subsets.

Efficiency:
- Limit the maximum \( n \) to keep computations manageable.
- Use combinatorial enumeration with early stopping when a counterexample is found.

Now, the implementation:

```python
from itertools import combinations

def has_triangle_triplet(s):
    # Check if any three elements form a valid triangle
    for a, b, c in combinations(s, 3):
        if a + b > c and a + c > b and b + c > a:
            return True
    return False

def check_n(n):
    # Check whether all 10-element subsets of [4, n] have a triplet forming a triangle
    s_list = list(range(4, n+1))
    for subset in combinations(s_list, 10):
        if not has_triangle_triplet(subset):
            return False
    return True

# Find the greatest n starting from a small value
max_n = 14  # small upper bound for efficiency
answer = None
for n in range(10, max_n + 1):
    print(f"Checking n={n}")
    if check_n(n):
        answer = n
        print(f"n={n} satisfies the property.")
    else:
        print(f"n={n} does NOT satisfy the property.")
        break

print(f"The greatest n satisfying the condition is: {answer}")
```
