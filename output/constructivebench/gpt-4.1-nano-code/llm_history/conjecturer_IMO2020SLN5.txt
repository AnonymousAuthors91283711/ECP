  ∃ p c, Prime p ∧ c ≠ 0 ∧ f = IMO2020SLN5_answer p c := by sorry. Enumerated answers: p=2, c=2: symmetric set condition holds (infinite in testing range).
p=2, c=4: symmetric set condition holds (infinite in testing range).
p=2, c=6: symmetric set condition holds (infinite in testing range).
p=2, c=8: symmetric set condition holds (infinite in testing range).
p=3, c=3: symmetric set condition holds (infinite in testing range).
p=3, c=6: symmetric set condition holds (infinite in testing range).
p=3, c=9: symmetric set condition holds (infinite in testing range).
p=5, c=5: symmetric set condition holds (infinite in testing range).
p=7, c=7: symmetric set condition holds (infinite in testing range).. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ → ℕ → ℕ
The pattern indicates solutions are when \(f(n) = c \cdot \text{(gcd)}(n,p)\) with \(p\) prime, \(c\neq 0\). Generalized, this matches the form: \(f(n) = c \cdot \text{gcd}(n, p)\).  
Final answer: <<<fun p c n => c * n.gcd p>>>
