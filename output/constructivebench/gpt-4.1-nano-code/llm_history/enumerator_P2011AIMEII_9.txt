This problem appears to involve maximizing a certain symmetric sum of products of six nonnegative variables summing to 1, with a given constraint on a particular triple product. The functions involve cyclic products over indices, with a focus on finding the greatest possible value of the sum of certain consecutive triple products, subject to the constraints.

To assist with conjecturing and obtaining the maximum, I will discretize the problem: test evenly spaced candidate points within the feasible domain (`x_i â‰¥ 0`, sum to 1), respect the special constraint (at least verify if the minimum triple product is above the threshold), and evaluate the sum over these points. This brute-force approach is feasible since the variables are constrained (sum to 1, all non-negative) and the search space can be sampled coarsely for small \( n \).

This implementation enumerates candidate points with a simple grid, evaluates the sum, and keeps track of the maximum found. It outputs candidate solutions as soon as they surpass previous bests, thus streaming partial results.

```python
import itertools
import math

# Number of points to partition the interval [0,1] for each variable
grid_points = 20

max_sum = -math.inf
best_candidate = None

# Generate candidate points with the constraint sum(x_i)=1, and x_i >=0
for coords in itertools.product(range(grid_points + 1), repeat=6):
    s = sum(coords)
    if s == 0:
        continue  # avoid all zeros
    # Normalize to sum to 1
    x = [c / s for c in coords]
    # Check the triple product constraint
    triple_products = [
        x[0]*x[2]*x[4],
        x[1]*x[3]*x[5]
    ]
    min_triple = min(triple_products)
    # Evaluate the sum for the cyclic sum of triple x_i x_{i+1} x_{i+2}
    cyclic_sum = sum(
        x[i] * x[(i+1)%6] * x[(i+2)%6] for i in range(6)
    )
    # Track if the triple product constraint holds
    if min_triple >= 1/540:
        # Update maximum if needed
        if cyclic_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = cyclic_sum
            best_candidate = x
            print(f"New max sum: {max_sum:.8f} at x = {x}")

print(f"Maximum sum found: {max_sum:.8f}")
print(f"Corresponding x: {best_candidate}")
```
