[write_program]
The problem appears to involve solving a polynomial equation of degree 5 with complex coefficients and listing all solutions. Since it's a high-school competition-level problem, the polynomial might have roots that can be guessed or approximated. To assist in conjecturing, I'll write a Python program that enumerates candidate roots using rational approximations or simple guesses, evaluates the polynomial, and outputs solutions that satisfy the equation within a small tolerance. For efficiency, I'll limit the search to small integers and rational fractions.

This approach helps find approximate roots, then we can analyze these to infer exact solutions or their pattern.

```python
# Enumerate potential roots: small integers and simple fractions
# Define the polynomial coefficients
coeffs = [1, -5, 11, -13, 9, -3]  # Corresponds to z^5 - 5z^4 + 11z^3 - 13z^2 + 9z - 3

# Generate candidate roots: integers from -10 to 10 and some rational candidates
candidates = list(range(-10, 11))
# Add some rational numbers as fractions
fractions = [(-2,1), (-1,1), (1,1), (2,1), (1,2), (3,2), (-3,2), (1,3), (-1,3)]
for num, den in fractions:
    candidates.append(num/den)

# Function to evaluate polynomial at a given complex number z
def poly(z):
    return (coeffs[0]*z**5 + coeffs[1]*z**4 + coeffs[2]*z**3 + coeffs[3]*z**2 + coeffs[4]*z + coeffs[5])

# Tolerance for approximate roots
tolerance = 1e-6

# To avoid duplicates, keep track of found roots
found_roots = set()

for candidate in candidates:
    z = complex(candidate)
    val = poly(z)
    if abs(val) < tolerance:
        # Round to avoid floating point issues
        real_part = round(z.real, 6)
        imag_part = round(z.imag, 6)
        root = complex(real_part, imag_part)
        if root not in found_roots:
            found_roots.add(root)
            print(f"Found root: {root}")
```
