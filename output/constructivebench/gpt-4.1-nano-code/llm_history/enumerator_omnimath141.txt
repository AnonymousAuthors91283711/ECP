The problem appears to involve an abstract property called `omnimath141_answer` that depends on `n`, with `n ≥ 2`. Without the specific definition, but based on the context of enumeration problems, let's assume we're dealing with a common mathematical pattern involving natural numbers greater than or equal to 2.

Suppose the goal is to find all candidate values of some property related to `n`. A typical pattern in enumeration problems (especially with constraints like `n ≥ 2`) is to look at values of `n` and associated properties, such as factors, possible partitions, or counts.

Given the minimal information, I will write a Python program that enumerates all `n` starting from 2 (with a small limit to keep output concise), printing each candidate under some assumed property. 

I'll assume the property might be "number of divisors," "possible partitions," or something similar, and that we're trying to list potential answers before confirming an extremal or specific answer.

The code:
```python
# Enumerate candidate solutions for n from 2 to 10
# Assuming the property involves divisors count or a simple pattern
def enumerate_candidates():
    limit = 10
    for n in range(2, limit + 1):
        # Placeholder for the property: here, as an example, consider the number of divisors
        divisors = [d for d in range(1, n + 1) if n % d == 0]
        print(f"n={n}, divisors={divisors}")

enumerate_candidates()
```

This code will list candidate values for `n` and their divisors, which is a common enumeration pattern. Adjust as needed once the precise property becomes clear.
