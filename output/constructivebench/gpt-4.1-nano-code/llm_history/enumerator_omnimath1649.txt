This problem involves finding a polynomial \( P \) of degree at most 2015 that interpolates the values \( Q(n+1) = 1/(n+1)^2 \) for \( n=0,\dots,2015 \). The key is recognizing that the function \( Q(n) \) resembles the sum of a telescoping sequence or related finite differences. The unique polynomial that interpolates these points is likely a rational function or a polynomial approximation involving telescoping sums.

Given the problem's structure and the constraints, a practical approach is to:
- Consider that \( Q(n) = 1/n^2 \) and that the polynomial \( P \) matches these 2016 points.
- To find the value at 2017, evaluate the polynomial at that point, then multiply by 2017 and take the floor.

Because the problem asks for an enumeration-based conjecture, and the polynomial is uniquely determined by the values at the points, we can approximate the value at 2017 using the known data. For simplicity, test small \( n \) values and approximate or directly compute the sum of telescoping differences to conjecture the value at 2017.

Below, we implement a Python approach:
- Generate the data points \( (n, 1/(n+1)^2) \) for \( n=0,\dots,2015 \).
- Use polynomial interpolation (e.g., Newton's divided differences or Lagrange) to construct the interpolating polynomial.
- Evaluate the polynomial at 2017 to determine the final answer.

The output truncates to essential enumeration to produce the conjecture.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.interpolate import BarycentricInterpolator

# Generate points (n, 1/(n+1)^2) for n = 0..2015
n_points = np.arange(2016)
values = 1 / (n_points + 1)**2

# Construct the interpolating polynomial
interpolator = BarycentricInterpolator(n_points, values)

# Evaluate at n=2017
value_at_2017 = interpolator(2017)
# Multiply by 2017
product = 2017 * value_at_2017
# Floor value
answer = int(np.floor(product))
print(answer)
```
