The problem seeks the greatest n for a finite set V with a relation E satisfying a cyclic condition exactly once per triangle. The structure resembles a tournament with a cyclic orientation. Maximal such n corresponds to the minimal, impossible triangle, i.e., n=3, since larger sets inevitably contain a triangle with the same property.
