Ground Truth Answer: 10
Proposed Answer: 1000
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes two arithmetic sequences a and b with common differences da and db respectively.
2. The sequences must satisfy that no term of a equals any term of b (∀ i j, a i ≠ b j).
3. We have two specific conditions:
   - a₂₀ + b₁₄ = 1000
   - b₂₀ + a₁₄ = s (which we're trying to find the least value of)

The ground truth answer is 10, while the proposed answer is 1000.

The key insight is that the sequences must be "interleaved" to satisfy the non-intersection condition while maintaining the given equation. The minimal difference between sequences that never intersect would lead to s=10, not 1000.

The proposed answer of 1000 is simply repeating one of the given values without proper derivation, and doesn't represent the minimal possible s satisfying all conditions.
