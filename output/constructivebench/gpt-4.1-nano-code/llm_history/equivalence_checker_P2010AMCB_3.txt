Ground Truth Answer: 5
Proposed Answer: 16
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

The problem asks for the number of natural numbers x such that:
1. x divides 48 (from a*x = 48 for some a)
2. x divides 64 (from b*x = 64 for some b)

In other words, we're looking for the number of common divisors of 48 and 64.

Let's find the prime factorizations:
- 48 = 2⁴ × 3¹
- 64 = 2⁶

The common divisors must be of the form 2^k where k ≤ min(4,6) = 4, and cannot include the prime 3 since it's not in 64's factorization.

Possible exponents for 2: 0,1,2,3,4 → 5 options.

Therefore, the correct number of common divisors is 5 (1,2,4,8,16).

The proposed answer is 16, which is just the largest common divisor, not the count of all common divisors.
