The problem appears to involve finding the supremum or maximum value of the ratio \(x/y\) under certain constraints involving positive integers \(x, y, z, u\), with the conditions specified. Given the constraints:

- \(x, y, z, u > 0\)
- \(x \geq y\)
- \(x + y = z + u\)
- \(2xy = zu\)

We are asked to find the greatest possible value of \(\frac{x}{y}\) over all such quadruples.

Given the symmetry and constraints, to explore all possibilities, we'll pick small sample values for \(x, y\) and derive \(z, u\) accordingly, ensuring the constraints hold. As \(x/y\) increases, so too do \(x\) and \(z\), so we'll attempt to maximize \(x/y\).

To keep the search efficient, we'll:

- Enumerate \(x\) and \(y\) over small ranges with \(x \geq y > 0\),
- For each pair, compute \(z, u\) from the constraints,
- Check if \(z, u\) are positive integers satisfying the constraints,
- Record the maximum \(x/y\).

Here's the program:

```python
# This program searches for the maximum ratio x/y under the constraints:
# x, y, z, u > 0; x >= y; x + y = z + u; 2xy = zu
# It enumerates small values to find candidate quadruples and reports the maximum ratio x/y.

max_ratio = 0
best_quad = None

# Enumerate small values for x and y
for y in range(1, 20):
    for x in range(y, 20):  # ensure x >= y
        # For each (x,y), find z, u satisfying the constraints
        # From the constraints: z + u = x + y, and 2xy = zu
        s = x + y
        # z + u = s, u = s - z
        # 2xy = z * u = z * (s - z)
        # So, z*(s - z) = 2xy
        target = 2 * x * y
        for z in range(1, s):  # z positive, less than s
            u = s - z
            if u > 0 and z * u == target:
                ratio = x / y
                print(f"Found: x={x}, y={y}, z={z}, u={u}, ratio={ratio}")
                if ratio > max_ratio:
                    max_ratio = ratio
                    best_quad = (x, y, z, u)

print(f"\nMaximum x/y ratio found: {max_ratio}")
print(f"Corresponding quadruple: {best_quad}")
```
