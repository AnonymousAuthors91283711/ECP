  omnimath450_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Possible max k=9: Constructing a graph with 9 universal vertices (clique of size 9) and one outside vertex connected to 4 of these.
Possible max k=8: Clique of size 8 and outside vertices connected accordingly to reach total 40 edges.
The maximum k achievable under these constraints is 9.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
