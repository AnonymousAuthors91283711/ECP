The problem involves probabilistic reasoning with specific constants and calculations for conditional probability. To reverse-engineer the potential answer, we'll enumerate all possible rational fractions with small denominators close to the given probability, then check if they match the calculated probability within a reasonable margin. We will experimentally identify the fraction representing the probability and verify coprimality.

```python
import math

# Helper function to check if two numbers are coprime
def are_coprime(a, b):
    return math.gcd(a, b) == 1

# Given parameters
p = 0.4
q = 0.3

# Compute r
r = (q - (1 - p) * (q / (2 - p))) / p

# Compute total probability of rain on at least one day
P_rain_both = p * r
P_rain_sat_only = p * (1 - r)
P_rain_sun_only = (1 - p) * (q / (2 - p))
P_rain_at_least_one_day = P_rain_both + P_rain_sat_only + P_rain_sun_only

# Convert the probability to a fraction approximation with small denominators
# Enumerate fractions with denominators from 1 to 1000
max_den = 1000
trial_fractions = []

for denom in range(1, max_den + 1):
    numerator = round(P_rain_at_least_one_day * denom)
    approx = numerator / denom
    diff = abs(P_rain_at_least_one_day - approx)
    # Accept fractions within a small tolerance
    if diff < 1e-4:
        # Simplify the fraction
        gcd_value = math.gcd(numerator, denom)
        a = numerator // gcd_value
        b = denom // gcd_value
        # Store if numerator and denominator are coprime
        if are_coprime(a, b):
            print(f"Possible fraction: {a}/{b} approximates {P_rain_at_least_one_day}")
            # Keep track of minimal numerator/denominator
            trial_fractions.append((a, b))
            
# Among all approximations, select the one with minimal denominator
candidate = min(trial_fractions, key=lambda x: x[1])
a, b = candidate

print(f"Candidate answer: a = {a}, b = {b}")
print(f"Check coprimality: {are_coprime(a, b)}")
```
