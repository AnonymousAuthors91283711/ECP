theorem omnimath3092 : 
  ∃ (t s : ℕ), 3 + t = 5 ∧ t + s = 7 ∧ t + t + t + s + s = omnimath3092_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: t=2, s=5, answer=16
. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the constraints: t=2, s=5, and the equations sum to 16, a simplified pattern suggests the answer is the total sum 3×t + 2×s, since 3 + t = 5 and t + s = 7. Replacing t=2, s=5 yields 3×2 + 2×5 = 6 + 10 = 16. 

Final answer: <<<3 * 2 + 2 * 5>>>
