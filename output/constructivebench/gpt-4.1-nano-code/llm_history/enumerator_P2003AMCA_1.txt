[write_program]
The problem appears to involve summations of sequences and their differences, likely aiming to find a general expression for the difference between sums of certain sequences. To assist, I will write a Python program that enumerates possible values, based on small sample values of n, and compares the sum differences to identify a pattern. Since the problem involves sums over ranges and manipulates sums of 2*(k+1) and (2*k + 1), let's numerically compute these for small n and look for a formula.

The difference simplifies to a sequence of values. I'll generate values for n from 1 up to 20 to observe the pattern:

Sum of 2*(k+1), k=0..n-1: sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 2*(k+1)
Sum of (2*k + 1), k=0..n-1: sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (2*k + 1)

We will compute these sums for each n, find their difference, and guess the tight formula.

```python
# Enumerate small n to analyze the sums and their differences
for n in range(1, 21):
    sum_first = sum(2 * (k + 1) for k in range(n))
    sum_second = sum(2 * k + 1 for k in range(n))
    difference = sum_first - sum_second
    print(f"n={n}: sum_first={sum_first}, sum_second={sum_second}, difference={difference}")
```

This script outputs the sequence of differences, from which we can observe if there's a pattern or formula, such as a linear function in n.
