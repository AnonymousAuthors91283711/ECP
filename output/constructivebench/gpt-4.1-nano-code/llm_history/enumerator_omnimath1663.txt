This Lean code defines an existential statement involving polynomials p and q of degree at most 2, satisfying certain evaluation conditions at points 1 through 5, and relates their ratio at 0 to some rational number `omnimath1663_answer`. For this problem, we want to find explicit examples of such polynomials p and q that fit these conditions and verify the ratio at 0.

A practical approach is to choose simple quadratic polynomials p and q that fit the key evaluation points, then verify their ratios at 0. Testing polynomial forms with undetermined coefficients recursively can be complex; instead, start with minimal-degree quadratics and solve for coefficients.

Let's pick specific polynomial candidates and test their conditions. Here's an example strategy:
- Assume q(x) = 1 (constant), then p(x) â‰  0 must satisfy p(n)/q(n) = n^3 at points 1..5. Since q(n)=1, p(n)=n^3.
- Construct p(x) as the interpolating polynomial passing through (1, 1), (2, 8), (3,27), (4,64), (5,125).
- Use polynomial interpolation to find p(x).
- Compute p(0) and q(0)=1, then find p(0)/q(0).

Since this is an exploratory program, we'll compute these values explicitly.

```python
import numpy as np

# Define points
x_points = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
y_points = x_points ** 3  # p(n) = n^3, q(n)=1

# Fit polynomial p(x) passing through the points
coeffs = np.polyfit(x_points, y_points, 4)  # degree 4 polynomial interpolating 5 points

# Evaluate p(0)
p0 = np.polyval(coeffs, 0)
# q(x) = 1
q0 = 1
ratio_at_zero = p0 / q0

print("Coefficients of p:", coeffs)
print("p(0):", p0)
print("q(0):", q0)
print("p(0)/q(0):", ratio_at_zero)

# For explicit form, reconstruct polynomial and evaluate at 0
from sympy import symbols, Poly, Rational

x = symbols('x')
# Define polynomial p(x) with computed coefficients
p_expr = sum(c * x ** i for i, c in enumerate(reversed(coeffs)))
p_expr = p_expr.expand()

# Output polynomial and ratio
print("Constructed p(x):", p_expr)
print("Ratio at 0:", p_expr.subs(x, 0))
```

This code constructs a polynomial p(x) fitting points where p(n) = n^3 and q(n) = 1, calculates p(0), and outputs the ratio. It works entirely within Python's numerical framework, providing explicit candidate polynomials and their evaluation at zero.
