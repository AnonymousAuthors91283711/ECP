The solutions satisfy \( x^y = y^{x - y} \) with positive integers \( x,y \). The pattern suggests that when \( y=1 \), solutions include \( x=1 \). For \( y=2 \), \( x=8 \); for \( y=3 \), \( x=9 \), indicating solutions at \( x=y^2 \) and certain linear relations, perhaps \( x=y+1 \). Condensed pattern points to solutions where \( x=y^k \) or \( x=y+ (k-1) \), but provided solutions only directly illustrate these. The general form accounts for these finitely many solutions.

. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ)
The given candidate answer set `{ (y, y^2), (y+1, y) }` does not properly define an element of `Set (ℕ × ℕ)` on its own because it references `y` as a variable, which is not fixed or quantified. Instead, the set should be expressed as a set of pairs `(x, y)` satisfying the corresponding relations, explicitly in a closed form free of free variables. From the enumerated solutions (x=1, y=1), (x=8, y=2), and (x=9, y=3), one can observe a pattern: for y=1, x=1; for y=2, x=8; for y=3, x=9. However, these solutions suggest a relation of the form \(x = y^2\) or \(x = y^2 + 1\) for some special cases, but directly from enumeration, the solutions do not necessarily fit a simple closed-form pattern; however, one pattern in the known solutions is:

- (x, y) = (1, 1)
- (x, y) = (8, 2)
- (x, y) = (9, 3)

An attempt to generalize these solutions involves considering the specific solutions rather than a general formula from the simple pattern. Based on the standard algebraic relation \(x^y = y^{x - y}\), the known solutions are specific, with y ≥ 1. It appears the set of solutions can be characterized by these specific points, possibly involving some pattern, but since the question asks for a general form, and the enumeration is finite, a more proper approach is to define the set explicitly.

Hence, a safe approach is to define the set as containing exactly the listed solutions for the specific y, or more generally, to define the set as the union over the solutions provided.

Given the constraints, the most precise answer reflecting the enumeration is:

\[
\boxed{
\left\{ (1, 1), (8, 2), (9, 3) \right\}
}
\]

as an explicit set of solutions, covering the known solutions for y=1, 2, 3.

Therefore, the corrected Lean answer is:

<<<{ (1, 1), (8, 2), (9, 3) }>>>

This set contains all solutions found and aligns with the enumerated solutions, fitting the set type `Set (ℕ × ℕ)`. This explicit formulation ensures it satisfies the type constraints and reflects the solutions listed.

**Note**: If the problem asks for a closed form, further algebraic analysis might be needed, but with the provided solutions, directly defining the set as explicitly enumerated solutions is the most straightforward correct approach.
