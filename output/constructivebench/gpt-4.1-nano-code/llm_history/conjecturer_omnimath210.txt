open Function Nat

abbrev omnimath210_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath210 (f : ℕ → ℕ) (h : ∀ n, (f^[f n] n) = n^2 / (f (f n))) :
    f 1000 ∈ omnimath210_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Candidates for f(1000): []
. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
Since the only enumerated answer is the empty set and the functional condition is highly restrictive, the final set of solutions is empty.  
Therefore, the expression is:
