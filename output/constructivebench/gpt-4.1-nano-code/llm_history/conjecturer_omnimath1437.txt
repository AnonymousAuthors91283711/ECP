The pattern suggests a symmetric expression with complex variables satisfying cyclic quadratic relations. Since the given conditions are symmetric in a, b, c and relate to quadratic forms with constants 1 and -2, the value of (a * b + b * c + c * a)^2 is likely a constant. Considering symmetry, set c = -a - b, then substitution hints the sum simplifies to a known constant. Given the structure, the answer is likely zero or a related constant involving complex conjugations or roots of unity. The conjecture aligns with symmetry and known algebraic identities.
