Minimum answer: 0
Maximum answer: 2. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests the difference spans from 0 to 2 in increments of 0.5, indicating a total range of 2. The minimal and maximal values are 0 and 2, respectively. Since the question asks for a closed-form expression, the answer is likely the difference between these bounds, which simplifies to 2.
