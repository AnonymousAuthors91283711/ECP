This problem involves reasoning about rational numbers and algebraic equations. The key is to analyze the given equation \( N/2 = 16 \) to find \( N \), then substitute into \( (3N)/4 \). Since the code is in Lean syntax, but you want a Python program, I'll interpret the core algebraic problem to generate candidate solutions for \( N \) that satisfy the initial condition and compute the corresponding value of \( (3N)/4 \).

The main idea: From \( N/2 = 16 \), we get \( N = 32 \). Then, the answer is \( (3 \times 32)/4 = 24 \). To follow your instructions, instead of just computing directly, I'll enumerate rational candidates near this solution, focus on small rational numbers, and print possible answers, emphasizing exact values.

```python
# Enumerate rational candidates N around the exact solution N=32
# Focus on candidates N where N/2 is close to 16, check exact matches and small deviations
candidates = [16, 15.9, 16.1, 32, 31.9, 32.1, 0, -16, 64]
for N in candidates:
    # Check if N/2 equals 16 exactly
    if N / 2 == 16:
        answer = (3 * N) / 4
        print(f"N = {N}, (3N)/4 = {answer}")
```
