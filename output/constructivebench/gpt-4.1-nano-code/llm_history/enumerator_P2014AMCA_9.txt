The problem appears to involve finding a relationship between an initial number `a`, the average `b` of five consecutive numbers starting from `a`, and some resulting value that must satisfy a certain property involving the same pattern shifted forward. My goal is to enumerate potential solutions for the answer to this function for small `a`, and understand or conjecture the relationship.

Because the provided statement involves averages of sequences of length 5, shifted by one, and the answer is expressed as `P2014AMCA_9_answer a b`, I will assume the aim is to find a function that, given `a` and `b`, maybe computes some central value or pattern.

Given the constraints:
- Use small `a` values to generate potential `b` based on the problem statement.
- Enumerate candidate answers for the function.
- Focus on exact or integer results.
- Output partial results immediately when a pattern or solution emerges.

Here's a straightforward approach:
- Iterate small non-negative integers for `a`.
- Compute `b` as the average of the sequence `a, a+1, a+2, a+3, a+4`, which simplifies to `a+2`.
- The second sequence starting at `b`, similarly, will have an average of `b+2`.
- Based on the pattern, the answer might be constant or related.
- Aggregate and observe the pattern for small values.

This approach guides us toward a likely constant or linear function. Let's implement this for small `a`, then analyze the results.

```python
# Since the problem involves averages of consecutive five numbers, the average is always a + 2
# For b: b = (a + (a+1) + (a+2) + (a+3) + (a+4)) / 5 = (5a + 10) / 5 = a + 2
# For the second sequence starting from b: b+ (b+1) + ... , average is (b + (b+1) + ... + (b+4))/5 = b + 2
# So, the pattern seems to relate to these averages.

# We'll enumerate small a values and output the candidate result

def enumerate_answers():
    for a in range(0, 10):
        b = a + 2
        # The second sequence's average is (b + (b+1) + (b+2) + (b+3) + (b+4))/5 = b + 2
        # For the answer function, assuming it's the average of the second sequence, it should be b + 2
        answer = b + 2
        print(answer)

enumerate_answers()
```

This code will generate the sequence of potential answers based on small `a`. The pattern revealed suggests the answer is simply `a + 4`, which matches the second sequence average. This may guide the conjecture about the closed-form expression.
