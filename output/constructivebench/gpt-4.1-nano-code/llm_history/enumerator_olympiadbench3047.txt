This problem involves transformations with logarithms and a specific relation given by the equation \( \log_b(\sqrt{2}) x = 20 \). To provide a structured approach for enumeration, I will assume the goal is to find the value of \( \log_b(\sqrt{x}) \) based on the relation involving \( x \). Since the exact function is unknown (\(sorry\)), we will approach by isolating \( x \) from the given logarithmic relation and then computing \( \log_b(\sqrt{x}) \).

The key steps:
- Given \( \log_b(\sqrt{2}) x = 20 \), interpret as \( \log_{c}(\text{something}) \) with a change of base.
- Express \( x \) explicitly.
- Compute \( \log_b(\sqrt{x}) \) for some base \(b\).

To assist with "enumeration" and conjecturing, I'll sample values and find corresponding \(\log_b(\sqrt{x})\).

```python
import math

# Parameters
# Choose a small sample for the base b, e.g., b=2, since log base 2 is common.
b = 2
log_sqrt2_base_b = math.log(math.sqrt(2), b)  # log_b(sqrt(2)), constant

# Enumerate possible x values that satisfy log_{sqrt(2)} x = 20
# by inversing the log relation: x = (sqrt(2)) ** 20
sqrt2 = math.sqrt(2)
x = sqrt2 ** 20

print(f"Sample x: {x}")

# Now compute log_b(sqrt(x))
sqrt_x = math.sqrt(x)
log_b_sqrt_x = math.log(sqrt_x, b)
print(f"log_b(sqrt(x)): {log_b_sqrt_x}")

# For varying parameters, suppose b varies over small integers
for b in range(2, 5):
    log_sqrt2_b = math.log(math.sqrt(2), b)
    # x from the relation
    x = math.sqrt(2) ** 20
    sqrt_x = math.sqrt(x)
    log_b_sqrt_x = math.log(sqrt_x, b)
    print(f"Base b={b} -> log_b(sqrt(x))={log_b_sqrt_x}")
```
