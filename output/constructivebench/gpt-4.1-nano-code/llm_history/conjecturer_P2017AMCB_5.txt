theorem P2017AMCB_5 : 
  let data := [6, 19, 33, 33, 39, 41, 41, 43, 51, 57]
  let Q1 := 33
  let Q3 := 43
  let IQR := Q3 - Q1
  let lowerBound := Q1 - (3 * IQR / 2)
  let upperBound := Q3 + (3 * IQR / 2)
  length (filter (fun x => x < lowerBound ∨ x > upperBound) data) = P2017AMCB_5_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 6
Number of outliers: 1. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The outlier detection method based on fences computes bounds as Q1 - 1.5×IQR and Q3 + 1.5×IQR. Given the data, only 6 is outside these bounds, which matches the enumerated answer. Based on pattern and context, the answer should be a constant representing the count of outliers. Since only 6 is outside, the count is 1.
