The problem appears to involve real numbers, integers, logarithms, and some set cardinality in a formal math setting (likely Lean). While the code snippet references complex formal logic, the essence seems to be about understanding the set of points `(a, b)` with certain constraints and an equality involving logs raised to power 2017.

Given the constraints:
- \(a > 0\)
- \(2 \leq b \leq 200\)
- \((\log_b a)^ {2017} = \log_b (a^{2017})\)

Recall the property:
\[
\log_b (a^{2017}) = 2017 \log_b a
\]
and
\[
(\log_b a)^{2017}
\]
which suggests the set comprises pairs where:
\[
(\log_b a)^{2017} = 2017 \log_b a
\]

Set \(x = \log_b a \). The equation becomes:
\[
x^{2017} = 2017 x
\]

This polynomial in \(x\):
\[
x^{2017} - 2017 x = 0
\]
factorizes as:
\[
x (x^{2016} - 2017) = 0
\]

Solutions for \(x\):
- \(x = 0\)
- \(x^{2016} = 2017\) \(\Rightarrow x = \pm 2017^{1/2016}\)

Since \(\log_b a\) (the log base \(b\)) can be any real number, so the solutions are:

1. \(x=0\): so \(\log_b a = 0 \Rightarrow a = 1\), for any \(b\) with \(2 \leq b \leq 200\).

2. \(x= 2017^{1/2016}\) or \(- 2017^{1/2016}\):
- For \(x = 2017^{1/2016} > 0\), then \(a = b^x\).
- For \(x = - 2017^{1/2016} < 0\), then \(a = b^{x} = 1 / b^{+2017^{1/2016}}\).

But the equation involves the domain of \(\log_b a\), which requires \(a > 0\) for all \(b \ge 2\).

Both positive and negative solutions for \(x\) are valid because \(a>0\). So the pairs:

- For \(x=0\), \(a=1\).
- For \(x=2017^{1/2016}\), \(a=b^{x}\).
- For \(x=-2017^{1/2016}\), \(a = b^{-x} = 1 / b^{x} = 1 / b^{2017^{1/2016}}\).

Number of solutions:
- For each fixed \(b\) between 2 and 200,
  - \(a=1\) (always valid),
  - \(a = b^{2017^{1/2016}}\),
  - \(a = 1 / b^{2017^{1/2016}}\).

Counting these:

Total solutions = 3 solutions per \(b\), with \(b=2,\dots,200\).

The total number of solutions (pairs \((a,b)\)) is \(3 \times 199 = 597\).

Thus the cardinality is 597. The problem asks for the answer which is the count.

```python
# Enumerate solutions for each b between 2 and 200
import math

# Bounds for b
b_min, b_max = 2, 200

# Calculate the root of 2017
root_base = 2017 ** (1 / 2016)

# Collect answers
answers = []

for b in range(b_min, b_max + 1):
    # a = 1
    answers.append((1, b))
    # a = b^{root_base}
    a_pos = b ** root_base
    answers.append((a_pos, b))
    # a = 1 / (b^{root_base})
    a_neg = 1 / a_pos
    answers.append((a_neg, b))
    # Print solutions
    print(f"b={b}: a=1, a={a_pos}, a={a_neg}")

# Total count
print(f"Total solutions: {len(answers)}")
```

This code enumerates all solutions without hardcoding, streaming results, and checks all cases explicitly.  
The answer is the total number of solutions, which is 597.
