The problem involves finding the least real number \( t \) such that \( 0 < t \) and \( \sin(\pi t - \pi/2) = -1 \). Considering the properties of sine, \( \sin(\theta) = -1 \) when \( \theta = 3\pi/2 + 2k\pi \). Then, we need \( \pi t - \pi/2 = 3\pi/2 + 2k\pi \). Solving for \( t \), the general form is \( t = 2 + 2k \).

Since \( t > 0 \), the smallest such \( t \) occurs at \( k=0 \), giving \( t=2 \). Our goal is to find the least such \( t \).

```python
# The task is to find the least t > 0 such that sin(π t - π/2) = -1
# sin(θ) = -1 when θ = 3π/2 + 2kπ for integers k
# Thus, π t - π/2 = 3π/2 + 2kπ
# => π t = 2π + 2kπ
# => t = 2 + 2k
# For the smallest t > 0, set k=0: t=2
# List candidate t's for small k to verify

candidate_ts = []
for k in range(0, 3):  # small k to illustrate
    t = 2 + 2*k
    candidate_ts.append(t)
    print(t)  # stream each candidate answer

# The minimal candidate is when k=0: t=2
print("Minimum t:", min(candidate_ts))
```
