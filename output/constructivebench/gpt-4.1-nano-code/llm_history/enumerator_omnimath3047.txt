The problem involves a competition among three players: Alvin, Bingyi, and Cheska, with total games and specific win ratios, leading us to find the total number of Bingyi’s wins based on the given parameters. Since the key is to compute Bingyi's total wins from the provided ratios, the approach is to use small sample values for the involved parameters, verify the calculations step-by-step, and then output the total number of Bingyi’s wins. We will assume the total games and the ratio parameters to simplify calculations, ensuring an exact integer result.

```python
# Enumerate small sample values for the parameters to compute Bingyi's total wins
total_games = 60
games_per_pair = total_games // 3  # 20 games per pair interaction

# Wins are calculated based on percentage ratios
# Assuming the number of wins per pair for each player is an integer
alvin_bingyi = games_per_pair  # 20
bingyi_cheska = games_per_pair  # 20
cheska_alvin = games_per_pair  # 20

# Calculate individual wins based on ratios
alvin_wins_ab = alvin_bingyi * 20 / 100  # 20 * 0.2 = 4
bingyi_wins_bc = bingyi_cheska * 60 / 100  # 20 * 0.6 = 12
cheska_wins_ca = cheska_alvin * 40 / 100  # 20 * 0.4 = 8

# Bingyi's total wins:
# Wins against Alvin (excluding those who lost to Alvin), plus wins against Cheska
bingyi_wins = (alvin_bingyi - alvin_wins_ab) + bingyi_wins_bc + (cheska_alvin - cheska_wins_ca)

# Convert to integer for exact count
bingyi_wins = int(bingyi_wins)

print(bingyi_wins)
```
