This problem appears to be quite complex, involving many quantifiers and coprimality conditions. It defines a set of integers `k` related to parameters `n`, `a`, and `b`, with coprimality and inequality conditions. The goal is to find the greatest such `k`. 

To assist in conjecturing the true maximum, we will:
- Choose small values for `n` (up to 99).
- For each `n`, determine possible `a` satisfying the constraints.
- For each `(n, a)` pair, verify the coprimality conditions.
- For each valid pair, compute `k = n - a` and track the maximum.

This enumeration will generate candidate `k` values for small `n`, helping to identify the greatest `k`.

```python
import math

def coprime(x, y):
    return math.gcd(x, y) == 1

max_k = -1
max_pairs = []

# Loop over small n values
for n in range(1, 100):
    # Possible a values: 0 < a < n (given conditions imply a positive a)
    for a in range(1, n):
        # Check the first condition: for all m <= n, if coprime with n + a then m=1
        # implies (n + a) is coprime only with 1 within [1, n]
        coprime_with_all = True
        for m in range(2, n+1):
            if coprime(n + a, m):
                # If coprime with some m > 1, violate the condition
                coprime_with_all = False
                break
        if not coprime_with_all:
            continue  # Next a

        # Check condition on b
        valid_b_found = True
        for b in range(a):
            # For each b, find two distinct m1,m2 â‰¤ n, neither 1, such that
            # both coprime with n + b
            coprimes_b = [m for m in range(2, n+1) if coprime(n + b, m)]
            if len(coprimes_b) < 2:
                # Not enough coprime candidates for m1, m2
                continue
            # Check if we can find two distinct such m1,m2
            m1, m2 = coprimes_b[0], coprimes_b[1]
            if m1 != m2:
                continue  # Found suitable pair
            # Otherwise, no valid pair; this b doesn't violate the condition
        # If all b's satisfy the condition
        if True:
            k = n - a
            print(k)
            if k > max_k:
                max_k = k
                max_pairs = [(n, a)]
# Output the maximum found `k` after enumeration
print("Maximum k:", max_k)
```
