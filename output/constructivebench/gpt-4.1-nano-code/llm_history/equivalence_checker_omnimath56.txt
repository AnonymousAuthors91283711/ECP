Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {
  (a, b, c, p) |
  (a = 1 ∧ b = 1 ∧ c = 1 ∧ p = 3) ∨
  (a = 1 ∧ b = 2 ∧ c = 2 ∧ p = 5)
}
<<<None>>>
Since the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's intentionally left undefined in Lean), we cannot verify whether the proposed answer is equivalent to it. The proposed answer provides two specific solutions, but without knowing the complete set of solutions in the ground truth, we cannot determine equivalence.
