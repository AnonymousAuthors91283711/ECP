The problem involves finding pairs \((a, b)\) of positive integers such that:
- \( a > 0 \)
- \( b > 0 \)
- \(\gcd(2a - 1, 2b + 1) = 1\)
- \(a + b\) divides \(4ab + 1\)

Our goal is to enumerate all such solutions explicitly.

By testing small values for \(a\) and \(b\), we seek solutions satisfying the divisibility and coprimality conditions. Since \(\gcd(2a - 1, 2b + 1) = 1\), \(a\) and \(b\) can vary, but the divisibility condition is restrictive. We prioritize small \(a, b\) because larger values will be computationally expensive.

I'll implement a brute-force enumeration for small values, checking the conditions, and print solutions as they are found.

```python
# Enumerate candidate pairs (a, b) for small values
max_a_b = 50  # limit for small search
for a in range(1, max_a_b + 1):
    for b in range(1, max_a_b + 1):
        from math import gcd
        # Check gcd condition
        if gcd(2 * a - 1, 2 * b + 1) != 1:
            continue
        # Check divisibility condition
        numerator = 4 * a * b + 1
        denominator = a + b
        if numerator % denominator == 0:
            print((a, b))
```
