Ground Truth Answer: {(1, 1)}
Proposed Answer: {(a, b) | a = 1 ∧ b = 1}
<<<True>>>
The ground truth answer {(1, 1)} and the proposed answer {(a, b) | a = 1 ∧ b = 1} are equivalent. Both specify exactly the same single pair (1, 1) as the solution. The first uses explicit enumeration while the second uses set builder notation, but they describe identical sets.
