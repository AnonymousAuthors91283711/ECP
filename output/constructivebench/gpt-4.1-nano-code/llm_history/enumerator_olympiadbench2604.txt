This problem involves finding the smallest natural number `n` greater than 20 that has two specific properties:
1. The list of digits of `n` starting from 20 (`digits 20 n`) is a palindrome.
2. The list of digits of `n` starting from 14 (`digits 14 n`) is also a palindrome.

For simplicity, and due to the constraints, we'll test multiple values of `n` starting from 21 upwards, check the digit properties, and find the smallest such number.

The key points:
- Use small bounds for `n` (like up to 100, for efficiency).
- Generate digit lists starting at specific positions and check Palindromes.
- Report the first `n` that satisfies both conditions.

```python
def is_palindrome(lst):
    return lst == lst[::-1]

def digits_of(n):
    return list(map(int, str(n)))

# The property involves digits from index 14 and 20
# Since indexing is 0-based, digit lists are sliced accordingly
# We look for the smallest n > 20 with both digit slices palindromes
for n in range(21, 200):  # limit to 200 for efficiency
    str_n = str(n)
    digits = list(map(int, str_n))
    # Ensure there are enough digits
    if len(digits) >= 20:
        digits20 = digits[20:]
        if is_palindrome(digits20):
            digits14 = digits[14:]
            if is_palindrome(digits14):
                print(n)
                break
```
[refine_program]
The provided code attempts to find the smallest integer n > 20 where both the digits from position 14 onwards and from position 20 onwards form palindromes. Since the smallest such n must have at least 21 digits (to have a digit at position 20, considering 0-based indexing), the code starts from 21 but limits to n < 200, which is too small to have 20-digit numbers. Therefore, the loop is insufficient to find such a number, leading to no output.

Furthermore, the problem involves large digit indices (14 and 20), meaning n must have at least 21+digits, i.e., at least 21 digits, which are far larger than 200. To find such a number, we should generate large numbers with at least 21 digits and check for palindromic suffixes starting at positions 14 and 20.

The code should:

- Loop over large n, at least with 21+ digits.
- Generate candidate numbers with at least 21 digits, e.g., starting from 10^20.
- Check the specified digit slices for palindrome property.
- Stop at the minimal such n.

**Acceptance judgment:** The original code is rejected because it cannot discover the valid n due to insufficient search range and assumptions about small n.

**Corrected Program:**

```python
def is_palindrome(lst):
    return lst == lst[::-1]

def digits_of(n):
    return list(map(int, str(n)))

# Start with the smallest number having at least 21 digits
n = 10**20  # smallest 21-digit number
while True:
    str_n = str(n)
    digits = list(map(int, str_n))
    # Ensure there's enough digits
    if len(digits) >= 21:
        digits20 = digits[20:]
        digits14 = digits[14:]
        if is_palindrome(digits20) and is_palindrome(digits14):
            print(n)
            break
    n += 1
```

This code searches over all integers with at least 21 digits, starting from the smallest 21-digit number, checking the specified palindromic suffixes until it finds the minimal n satisfying both conditions.
