The problem involves evaluating two logarithms: \(\log_b 4 (1/64)\) and \(\log_b 5 625\). To understand these, we can examine the values of \(b\) that satisfy these equations, assuming the base \(b\) is positive and not equal to 1.

- For \(\log_b 4 (1/64)\): this asks for the value \(x\) such that \(b^x = 1/64\).
- For \(\log_b 5 625\): this asks for the value \(y\) such that \(b^y = 625\).

Let's choose some plausible small bases and compute the corresponding logs, then output the pairs.

```python
# Enumerate small bases from 2 to 10
# For each base, compute the logs if they are exact powers, else approximate
# Prioritize exact powers to find exact values
bases = range(2, 11)
results = []

for b in bases:
    # Compute log base b of 1/64: find x such that b^x = 1/64
    # 1/64 = 2^-6, so for base 2, log_b(1/64) = -6
    # For other bases, attempt exact power if possible, else approximate
    try:
        # Check if 1/64 is a power of b
        import math
        x = math.log(1/64, b)
        # If x is close to an integer, treat as exact
        if abs(round(x) - x) < 1e-6:
            x = round(x)
        # For the second log: log_b(625)
        y = math.log(625, b)
        if abs(round(y) - y) < 1e-6:
            y = round(y)
        results.append(((b, x), (b, y)))
        print(f"For base {b}: log_b(1/64) ≈ {x}, log_b(625) ≈ {y}")
    except:
        continue
```
This code enumerates bases 2 through 10, computes the logs, checks for near-integer values, and prints immediate candidate answers, aiding in conjecturing the true values.
