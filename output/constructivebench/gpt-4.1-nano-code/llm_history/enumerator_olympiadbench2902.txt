This problem involves finding a rational number `n` that belongs to both the set of rationals with denominator 4 and those with denominator 6, and satisfies certain counting properties related to a parameter `T=19`. Specifically, it asks for a number `n` such that the number of common rationals less than `n` (and with denominators dividing both 4 and 6, i.e., denominator 12) equals `T - 1 = 18`.

Since `n` must be in both `S1` (denominator 4) and `S2` (denominator 6), the intersection is the set of rationals with denominator dividing the least common multiple 12. The intersection can be characterized as rationals of the form `k/12`.

The solution involves enumerating all `k/12` for `k` in some range until we have at least 19 such rationals, and then checking which such `k/12` yields exactly 18 rationals less than it among the common set.

Below is the code that performs this enumeration and finds such an `n`. We prioritize exact candidates, and only consider the rationals with denominators dividing 12 for simplicity.


```python
# This script enumerates rational numbers of the form k/12 (k integer),
# and finds one such that:
# - it is greater than all rationals with denominator 12 less than it, counting exactly 18.
# We generate candidate rationals in increasing order and check the count of smaller candidates.

def enumerate_common_rationals():
    max_k = 200  # upper bound for enumeration, covering enough candidates
    common_qs = []
    for k in range(-max_k, max_k+1):
        n = k/12
        common_qs.append(n)
    common_qs = sorted(set(common_qs))
    for i, n in enumerate(common_qs):
        # Count how many common rationals are less than n
        count_less = i
        if count_less == 18:
            print(n)
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    enumerate_common_rationals()
