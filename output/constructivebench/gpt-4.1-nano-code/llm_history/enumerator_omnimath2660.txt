The problem involves finding the greatest possible sum `s` of a list `l` of pairwise distinct primes under certain conditions:
- Each prime `p` in `l` is less than 50.
- Each `p` can be written as `a^k - 1` with `a, k ∈ ℕ`, `k ≥ 2`.
- The list `l` is pairwise increasing, i.e., `p_i < p_j` for `i < j`.

Our task is to enumerate all such primes and sum their values, then identify the greatest possible sum.

Because the prime numbers less than 50 are small, and the primes of the form `a^k - 1` (with `k ≥ 2`) are limited, the program will:
- Generate all primes less than 50.
- Check which satisfy `p+1 = a^k` for some `a, k ≥ 2`.
- Find all subsets of these primes that are pairwise increasing (which reduces to sorting).
- Compute sums for these subsets and identify the maximum.

Here's the implementation:

```python
# Find primes less than 50
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

primes_under_50 = [p for p in range(2, 50) if is_prime(p)]

# Check if p + 1 is a perfect power a^k with k ≥ 2
def is_power_plus_one(p):
    target = p + 1
    # For each k ≥ 2, check if there's an integer a such that a^k = p+1
    for k in range(2, int(target.bit_length()*0.5) + 2):
        a = int(round(target ** (1 / k)))
        for candidate in [a, a + 1, a - 1]:
            if candidate > 1 and candidate ** k == target:
                return True
    return False

# Collect primes satisfying the condition
valid_primes = [p for p in primes_under_50 if is_power_plus_one(p)]

# Generate all sums of subsets (since pairwise increasing is naturally maintained if we sort)
max_sum = 0
max_subset = []

# We generate all non-empty subsets
from itertools import combinations
for r in range(1, len(valid_primes) + 1):
    for subset in combinations(valid_primes, r):
        total = sum(subset)
        print(total)  # Stream partial results
        if total > max_sum:
            max_sum = total
            max_subset = subset

print("Maximum sum:", max_sum)
```
