Partial sum up to k=11: 1414. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern of terms is halving approximately, with the sequence related to powers of 2 and a decreasing sequence. Summing the terms: 707 + 354 + 177 + 88 + 44 + 22 + 11 + 6 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 1414. Therefore, the total sum converges to 1414, consistent with earlier partial sums. 

Final answer: <<<1414>>>
