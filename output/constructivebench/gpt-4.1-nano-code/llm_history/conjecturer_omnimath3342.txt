The functions are periodic with period 22, and no two 'true' values are within 2 steps. Since at most one 'true' per period, total functions = number of ways to choose positions of 'true' in each period plus the empty set, which is 1 + 22 = 23 satisfying options, summed over all \( \lfloor \frac{4489}{23} \rfloor \) periods.  

Answer: <<<4489>>>
