This problem involves analyzing the recursive function `f` defined over natural numbers and real numbers, and determining the minimal `n` such that there exists a finite set `s` of real numbers where all `x` satisfy `f n x = 0`, and the sum of elements in `s` exceeds 500,000. To aid in conjecturing and possibly proving the true answer, we can implement a Python program to simulate the behavior of `f` for small `n`, attempt to find such sets `s` with a large sum, and identify the least such `n`.

The function `f` resembles a process where at each step, the previous function influences the current, with shifts involving `|x - (n+1)|`. When `f n x = 0`, the function's recursive structure implies a relationship between the zeros at different `n`.

Given the nature of the problem, a reasonable approach is:
- For small `n` (say from 0 up to a threshold like 20), compute the zeros of `f n x`.
- For each `n`, find solutions `x` where `f n x = 0`.
- Collect these `x` and check if their sums can surpass 500,000.
- Output each candidate set when found.

This brute-force simulation is feasible due to the recursive structure, and it helps in understanding the zeros' distribution.

```python
import math

def compute_zeros(n, max_x=1e4, resolution=1.0):
    zeros = set()
    # Search within a range for zeros; this range can be adjusted as needed
    for x in [i * resolution for i in range(int(max_x / resolution) + 1)]:
        if is_zero_f(n, x):
            zeros.add(round(x, 6))
    return zeros

def is_zero_f(n, x):
    # Recurse based on the definition
    if n == 0:
        return 0 == 0  # f 0 x = 0 for any x, so zeros are trivial; focus on other n
    elif n == 1:
        return abs(x - 1) == 0
    else:
        val = f_n_minus_1(n - 1, abs(x - (n + 1)))
        return val == 0

def f_n_minus_1(n, x):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return abs(x - 1)
    else:
        return f_n_minus_1(n - 1, abs(x - n))

def main():
    max_n = 20
    threshold_sum = 500000
    for n in range(max_n + 1):
        zeros = compute_zeros(n)
        total = sum(zeros)
        print(f"n={n}, zeros={sorted(zeros)}, sum={total}")
        if total > threshold_sum:
            print(f"Candidate: n={n} with sum={total}")
            break
