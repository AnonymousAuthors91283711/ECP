This problem involves solving an equation involving nested square roots: sqrt(x + nested_sqrt(2008, x)) - sqrt(x) = 1. The goal is to explore possible solutions for x ≥ 0 and identify the specific answer that satisfies the equation. 

Since the input code uses 'nested_sqrt', which is not standard, I'll assume it refers to some nested radical expression like nested_sqrt(2008, x) = sqrt(2008 + x). The problem then reduces to solving for x in the equation:

sqrt(x + sqrt(2008 + x)) - sqrt(x) = 1

Let's analyze the problem algebraically:

Let y = sqrt(x). Then:

sqrt(y^2 + sqrt(2008 + y^2)) - y = 1

Rearranged, this becomes:

sqrt(y^2 + sqrt(2008 + y^2)) = y + 1

Squaring both sides:

y^2 + sqrt(2008 + y^2) = (y + 1)^2 = y^2 + 2y + 1

Subtract y^2:

sqrt(2008 + y^2) = 2y + 1

Now, square again:

2008 + y^2 = (2y + 1)^2 = 4y^2 + 4y + 1

Bring all to one side:

0 = 4y^2 + 4y + 1 - 2008 - y^2 = 3y^2 + 4y - 2007

Now, solve for y:

3y^2 + 4y - 2007 = 0

Use quadratic formula:

y = [-4 ± sqrt(16 - 4*3*(-2007))]/(2*3)

Discriminant:

D = 16 - 4*3*(-2007) = 16 + 4*3*2007 = 16 + 12 * 2007 = 16 + 24084 = 24000

Calculate sqrt(24000):

Since sqrt(24000) ≈ 154.919

Now, compute:

y = [-4 ± 154.919]/6

Two solutions:

1. y ≈ (-4 + 154.919)/6 ≈ 150.919/6 ≈ 25.153

2. y ≈ (-4 - 154.919)/6 ≈ -158.919/6 ≈ -26.486

Since y = sqrt(x) ≥ 0, discard negative solution.

Thus, y ≈ 25.153, and x = y^2 ≈ 25.153^2 ≈ 632.66

We should verify this:

Compute sqrt(x + sqrt(2008 + x)) - sqrt(x)

Calculate:

sqrt(632.66 + sqrt(2008 + 632.66)) - sqrt(632.66)

Compute 2008 + 632.66 ≈ 2640.66

sqrt(2640.66) ≈ 51.39

Then:

sqrt(632.66 + 51.39) ≈ sqrt(684.05) ≈ 26.17

Finally:

26.17 - 25.15 ≈ 1.02 ≈ close to 1, considering rounding errors.

Therefore, approximate solution x ≈ 632.66.

To find the exact form, note that:

Discriminant D = 24000 = 16 * 1500

sqrt(D) = 4 * sqrt(1500) = 4 * sqrt(1500)

Earlier, we had:

y = [-4 + sqrt(D)]/6

Expressed exactly:

y = [-4 + 4 * sqrt(1500)]/6 = ( -4 + 4 * sqrt(1500) ) / 6 = (4 * ( -1 + sqrt(1500) ))/6 = (2/3) * ( -1 + sqrt(1500) )

Since x = y^2:

x = ( (2/3) * ( -1 + sqrt(1500) ) )^2

= (4/9) * ( -1 + sqrt(1500) )^2

Therefore, the exact answer for x is:

x = (4/9) * ( sqrt(1500) - 1 )^2

Now, the code should compute and enumerate candidate solutions around this value, and print the answer accordingly.

Here's the code:

```python
# Enumerate approximate candidate solutions near the algebraic solution

import math

# Exact form derived: x = (4/9) * (sqrt(1500) - 1)^2
exact_x = (4/9) * (math.sqrt(1500) - 1)**2
print(f"Approximate exact solution: x ≈ {exact_x}")

# For verification and possible candidates, explore around the approximate value
for delta in [0, 1, -1, 0.5, -0.5]:
    candidate = exact_x + delta
    if candidate >= 0:
        lhs = math.sqrt(candidate + math.sqrt(2008 + candidate)) - math.sqrt(candidate)
        # Output the difference to check closeness to 1
        print(f"x = {candidate:.3f}, lhs = {lhs:.4f}")
```
