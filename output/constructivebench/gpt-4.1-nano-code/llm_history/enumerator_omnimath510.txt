The problem involves calculating a weighted sum over elements in certain unions and intersections of sets. To assist in conjecturing the true answer, I will write a Python script that enumerates all elements in the union of the given sets, checks for each element which set membership conditions hold, and computes the corresponding sum with the provided weights. I'll print each contribution immediately as it's calculated to simulate streaming partial results.

The sets are small, so full enumeration is feasible. The core of the calculation involves checking membership for each element in the union of the sets and summing the contributions accordingly.

```python
# Enumerate all elements in the union of alice, bob, and charlie
alice = {1, 2, 3, 4}
bob = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
charlie = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

# Collect all elements in the union
elements = set().union(alice, bob, charlie)

total_sum = 0.0

for x in sorted(elements):  # Sorted for consistent ordering
    weight = 0
    # Check conditions for each case
    if x in alice and x in bob and x not in charlie:
        contribution = 1 * (1/4) * (1/5) * (5/6)
        print(f'Element {x}: in alice, in bob, not in charlie -> contribution={contribution}')
        weight += contribution
    if x in alice and x not in bob and x in charlie:
        contribution = 1 * (1/4) * (4/5) * (1/6)
        print(f'Element {x}: in alice, not in bob, in charlie -> contribution={contribution}')
        weight += contribution
    if x not in alice and x in bob and x in charlie:
        contribution = 1 * (3/4) * (1/5) * (1/6)
        print(f'Element {x}: not in alice, in bob, in charlie -> contribution={contribution}')
        weight += contribution
    total_sum += weight

print(f'Total sum of contributions: {total_sum}')
```
This code will dynamically compute and print each contribution, aiding in the conjecture of the sum's value.
