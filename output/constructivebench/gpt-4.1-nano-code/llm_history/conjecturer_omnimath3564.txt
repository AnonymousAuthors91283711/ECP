. Enumerated answers: Enumerating candidate polynomials and checking the relation:
Found solution: P(x) = 0
Found solution: P(x) = 0 + 0*x^1
Found solution: P(x) = 0 + 0*x^1 + 0*x^2. Expected Answer Type: Set (Polynomial ℝ)
The polynomial P(x) = 0 (the zero polynomial) trivially satisfies the functional equation for all x ≠ 0, as all evaluations are zero, making both sides equal. No other polynomials from the enumeration satisfy the condition consistently, so the only set is {0}.
