The problem appears to involve counting the size of a certain set of tuples with a divisibility condition involving powers modulo 3^7. To assist conjecturing, we'll enumerate small cases and check divisibility conditions directly, focusing on manageable small parameters. Since the problem involves triplets of elements from Fin (3^6), and the key condition involves sums of cubes modulo 3^7, let's select small example values to test the divisibility and count solutions.

We'll implement enumeration over all possible triplets `(t.1, t.2.1, t.2.2)` with manageable bounds, compute `(t.1^3 + t.2.1^3 + t.2.2^3) % 3^7`, and count how many satisfy the divisibility condition. We'll print each triplet and its condition check in real-time, and finally, output the total count modulo 1000, which aligns with the problem statement's intended value.

```python
# Enumerate small sample values from 0 to 729 (3^6)
# For demonstration, limit to smaller ranges to keep runtime reasonable
print("Starting enumeration over small sample of triplets from 0 to 8 for testing purposes.")
count = 0
for t1 in range(9):  # small subset instead of 3^6 for speed
    for t21 in range(9):
        for t22 in range(9):
            sum_cubes = (t1**3 + t21**3 + t22**3) % (3**7)
            condition = (sum_cubes == 0)
            print(f"t=({t1},{t21},{t22}) -> sum_cubes={sum_cubes} -> condition={condition}")
            if condition:
                count += 1
print(f"Count of solutions in small sample: {count}")
print(f"Answer modulo 1000: {count % 1000}")
```
