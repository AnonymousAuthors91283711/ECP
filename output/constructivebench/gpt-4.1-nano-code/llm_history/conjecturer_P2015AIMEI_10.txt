. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern and approximate values suggest that the polynomial's evaluations are close to a sinusoidal function with amplitude about 12, oscillating between 12 and -12, and passing through zero near points where cosines are zero. The extreme value at f(0) being roughly 72 indicates the polynomial behaves similarly to a scaled cosine or sine function shifted vertically.

Given the pattern, the most consistent closed-form answer for the absolute value, considering the oscillation amplitude and approximate pattern, is roughly 72, which aligns with the candidate answer listed.

Therefore, the explicit formula for |f(0)| in closed form is 72.
