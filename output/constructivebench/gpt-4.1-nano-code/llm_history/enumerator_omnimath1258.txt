This problem involves characterizing the size of the set of functions `a` from `Fin 200` to `ℤ` that satisfy the conditions:
- For all `i`, `0 ≤ a i ≤ 202`.
- `a` is strictly monotonic.
- There exists a positive integer `N` such that for each `i`, there exists a `j` with `a i + a j ≡ N (mod 203)`.

The key issues:
- `a` is strictly increasing from `0` to `202`, so the number of such functions is limited.
- The problem relies on modular properties involving 203.
- The constraints on monotonicity severely limit the choices for `a`.

Because `a` is strictly monotonic and bounded between 0 and 202, the number of possible functions is equal to the number of strictly increasing sequences of length 200 taking values from [0..202].

The total number of such sequences is `C(203, 200)` (since choosing 200 increasing values out of 203 possible values). Among these sequences, we need to determine how many meet the modular condition involving `N`.

The reasoning suggests that all such sequences that satisfy the modular condition will have particular structure, likely related to the fact that addition modulo 203 behaves in a cyclic manner.

Given the symmetry and modularity, each strictly increasing sequence corresponds uniquely to choosing 200 increasing elements, and the modular condition imposes a uniformity that might reduce the count substantially.

For a rough enumeration:
- Total strictly increasing sequences: `C(203, 200)`, which is `203` (since choosing 200 out of 203).

Given the problem asks for the size of such functions set, and based on the constraints, the size is likely to be 203.

Thus, the approximate size of the set is 203.

```python
from math import comb

# Number of strictly increasing sequences from 0 to 202 of length 200:
total_sequences = comb(203, 200)  # Equals 203

# Given the modular condition, all sequences are plausible candidates, as the modular condition
# can be satisfied by a suitable N for each sequence.
# Therefore, the set size is 203.

print(203)
