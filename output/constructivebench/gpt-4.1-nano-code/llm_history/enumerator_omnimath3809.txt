This problem involves finding the least integer \( s \) of the form \( a^3 + b^3 - 60ab(a + b) \) that is at least 2012. To assist in conjecture, we will systematically enumerate pairs \((a, b)\) within a small range, compute their corresponding values, and track the minimum \(s \geq 2012\).

```python
# Enumerate pairs (a, b) within a small range to find the minimal s >= 2012
# for s = a^3 + b^3 - 60 * a * b * (a + b)

threshold = 2012
min_s = None
min_pair = None

# Choosing a small range for a and b
for a in range(-10, 11):
    for b in range(-10, 11):
        s = a**3 + b**3 - 60 * a * b * (a + b)
        if s >= threshold:
            print(f"a={a}, b={b}, s={s}")
            if (min_s is None) or (s < min_s):
                min_s = s
                min_pair = (a, b)

# After enumeration, print the minimal found s and corresponding pair
print(f"Minimum s >= {threshold} is {min_s} for pair {min_pair}")
```
