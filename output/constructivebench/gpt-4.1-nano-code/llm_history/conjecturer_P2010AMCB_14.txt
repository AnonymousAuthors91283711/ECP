The answer involves finding the minimal possible maximum sum of adjacent pairs (a+b, b+c, c+d, d+e) with positive a,b,c,d,e summing to 2010. Distributing values evenly minimizes the maximum pair sum; since the total is 2010 divided over 5 variables, each roughly 402. The maximum of pairs occurs when sums are balanced, near 403 or 404. Therefore, the minimal maximum sum is 404, achieved for a nearly uniform distribution.
