This problem involves analyzing the sum of digits of very large powers. Specifically, it gives us A as the sum of the digits of \( 4444^{4444} \), and B as the sum of the digits of A. The value we want is the sum of the digits of B.

Since directly computing \( 4444^{4444} \) is infeasible, and because the sum of digits is congruent modulo 9 to the original number, we can employ properties of digital root and modular arithmetic to narrow options.

Observations:
- The sum of digits of a number modulo 9 equals the number modulo 9.
- \( 4444 \equiv 4444 \mod 9 \)
- \( 4444 \equiv (4+4+4+4) = 16 \equiv 7 \mod 9 \)

Thus, \( 4444^{4444} \equiv 7^{4444} \mod 9 \). Since \( 7^3 \equiv 1 \mod 9 \), powers of 7 modulo 9 repeat every 3 steps:
- \( 7^1 \equiv 7 \)
- \( 7^2 \equiv 4 \)
- \( 7^3 \equiv 1 \)
- \( 7^{4444} \equiv 7^{(4444 \bmod 3)} \)

Calculate \( 4444 \mod 3 \):
- \( 4+4+4+4 = 16 \equiv 16 \mod 3 \equiv 1 \)
- So, \( 4444 \equiv 1 \mod 3 \).
- Therefore, \( 7^{4444} \equiv 7^{1} \equiv 7 \mod 9 \).

Hence, the sum of digits of \( 4444^{4444} \) modulo 9 is 7, so the digit sum \( A \) satisfies \( A \equiv 7 \mod 9 \).

Next, \( B \) is the sum of digits of \( A \):
- Since \( A \equiv 7 \mod 9 \), the sum of its digits \( B \) is also \(\equiv 7 \mod 9 \), as sum of digits preserves the digital root.

Finally, the sum of digits of \( B \):
- Since \( B \equiv 7 \mod 9 \), the sum of its digits should also be \(\equiv 7 \mod 9\).

The repeated digital sum reduces to a single digit between 1 and 9, matching the digital root directly. Since the final sum must be \(\equiv 7 \mod 9\), it must be 7.

Therefore, the answer is 7, as it's the only single-digit number satisfying the congruence and the properties of digit sums.
