The problem defines a functional equation involving a function \(f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) with conditions:

- \(f(0) + 1 = f(1)\)
- For all real \(x, y\), \(f(x y - x) + f(x + f y) = y f x + 3\)

The goal (based on the theorem structure) is to find the explicit form of \(f\), which is given in the placeholder `abbrev omnimath3569_answer : ℝ → ℝ := sorry`. 

To assist in conjecture, I will generate candidate solutions by assuming simple forms such as linear functions; then, verify them systematically over small sample points. 

The approach:
- Try linear functions \(f(x) = a x + b\)
- Use the functional equation to solve for parameters \(a, b\) over small sample values
- Output candidate solutions immediately upon finding consistent parameters

This way, we can stream possible answers, prioritize simple solutions, and help conjecture the true form of \(f\).

```python
# Enumerate candidate linear functions of the form f(x) = a * x + b
# Test over small sample points to find consistent parameters satisfying the functional equation
# Recatenate solutions immediately when found

def test_linear(a, b):
    # Check the functional equation for some sample points x, y
    test_points = [(0, 0), (1, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 1)]
    for x, y in test_points:
        lhs = (a * (x * y - x) + b) + (a * (x + a * y + b) + b)
        rhs = y * (a * x + b) + 3
        if abs(lhs - rhs) > 1e-8:
            return False
    return True

# Find parameters a, b satisfying the initial condition and the equation
for a in [-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:
    for b in range(-5, 6):
        # Check the initial condition: f(0)+1 = f(1) --> b + 1 = a + b --> 1 = a
        if a != 1:
            continue
        if test_linear(a, b):
            print(f"Candidate solution: f(x) = {a} * x + {b}")
```
