theorem P2015AIMEI_3 : 
  Nat.Prime P2015AIMEI_3_answer ∧ ∃ (n : ℕ), 0 < n ∧ 16 * P2015AIMEI_3_answer + 1 = n ^ 3 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Prime P: 307, 16*P+1: 4913 = 17^3. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the enumeration, the prime is 307, and 16 * 307 + 1 = 4913 = 17^3. The answer must satisfy the relation 16 * p + 1 = n^3 for some n and p prime. The general form: p = (n^3 - 1)/16. As n=17, p=307. 

<<<(17^3 - 1) / 16>>>
