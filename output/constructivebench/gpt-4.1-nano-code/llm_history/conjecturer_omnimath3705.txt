abbrev omnimath3705_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath3705 :
  {n : ℕ | ∃ k : ℤ, k > 0 ∧ k ^ 3 = n ∧ ¬(10 ∣ n) ∧ ∃ m : ℤ, m ^ 3 = (n / 1000)} = omnimath3705_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Error: Program is empty. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
Based on the pattern, the set consists of natural numbers n such that n = k^3 with k > 0, divisible by 1000, and the cube root of n/1000 is an integer m. The key constraints are n = (1000 m)^3 = 10^9 m^3, with m^3 being an integer and n divisible by 10^3, ensuring the divisibility condition.

Final answer in Lean syntax: 
<<<{n : ℕ | ∃ m : ℤ, 0 < m ∧ n = 10^9 * m ^ 3}>>>
