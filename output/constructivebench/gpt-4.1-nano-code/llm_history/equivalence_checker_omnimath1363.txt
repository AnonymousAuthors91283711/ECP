Ground Truth Answer: 1005
Proposed Answer: 2010
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the greatest number k such that there exists a real polynomial p(x) with:
   - No real roots (∀x: eval x p ≠ 0)
   - All coefficients from degree 0 to 2010 are either -1 or 1
   - The coefficient of x^2010 is 1
   - k counts how many coefficients from degree 0 to 2009 are -1

2. The ground truth answer is 1005, which suggests that the maximum number of -1 coefficients is exactly half of the possible coefficients (from 0 to 2009, which is 2010 terms).

3. The proposed answer is 2010, which would mean all coefficients from 0 to 2009 could be -1. However, this would violate the condition that the polynomial has no real roots. A polynomial with all negative coefficients up to degree 2009 and a positive coefficient at 2010 would necessarily have a real root by the Intermediate Value Theorem.

4. The correct maximum is indeed 1005, as we can alternate between positive and negative coefficients in a way that prevents real roots while maximizing the number of -1 coefficients.
