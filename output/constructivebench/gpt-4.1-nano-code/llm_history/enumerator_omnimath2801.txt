The problem involves finding the number of subsets \( s \) of pairs in \( \text{Fin}(6) \times \text{Fin}(6) \) such that:
- no pair \((a, b)\) in \( s \) satisfies \( a = b \) (no loops),
- for every \( a \), the number of pairs incident to \( a \) (either \((a, b)\) or \((b, a)\) in \( s \)) equals 3 (each vertex has degree 3).

This corresponds to counting 3-regular simple graphs on 6 vertices, avoiding loops.

Since the problem is highly combinatorial, we approximate via enumeration:

- The graph has 6 vertices, each of degree 3, so the total edges are \( \dfrac{6 \times 3}{2} = 9 \).
- The total number of such graphs equals the number of 3-regular graphs on 6 vertices.

 enumeration with small \( n = 6 \):
- For each possible graph, check if it matches the degree constraints.

```python
import itertools
from collections import defaultdict

# Vertices labeled 0..5
vertices = range(6)

# Generate all possible edges without loops
edges = list(itertools.combinations(vertices, 2))
edge_to_index = {edge: i for i, edge in enumerate(edges)}

# Counter for graphs with degree 3
count = 0

# We will generate all subsets of edges (combinations)
for edges_mask in range(1 << len(edges)):
    deg = [0]*6
    for i in range(len(edges)):
        if (edges_mask >> i) & 1:
            a, b = edges[i]
            deg[a] += 1
            deg[b] += 1
    if all(d == 3 for d in deg):
        count += 1
        # Each subset corresponds to a 3-regular graph
        # For debugging, can print the graph
        # Uncomment below to see graphs
        # s_edges = [edges[i] for i in range(len(edges)) if (edges_mask >> i) & 1]
        # print(s_edges)

print("Number of 3-regular graphs on 6 vertices:", count)
```

This code enumerates all subsets of possible edges without loops, checks for graphs where each vertex has degree exactly 3, and counts them. The output gives the total number of such graphs, which helps in the conjecturing and understanding of the original problem's answer.
