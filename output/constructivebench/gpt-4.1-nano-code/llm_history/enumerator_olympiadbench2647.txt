The problem involves finding integer triples (x, y, z) satisfying the equations:
1. \( x y - z^2 = y^2 z - x \)
2. \( y^2 z - x = 14 \)

Given the second condition, \( y^2 z - x = 14 \), we can express \( x = y^2 z - 14 \). 

Substituting into the first:
\( (y^2 z - 14) y - z^2 = y^2 z - y \)

Simplify:
\( y^3 z - 14 y - z^2 = y^2 z - y \)

Bring all to one side:
\( y^3 z - y^2 z - 14 y + y - z^2 = 0 \)

Factor:
\( y^2 z ( y - 1 ) - 13 y - z^2 = 0 \)

Now, for various small integer y, z, check if the corresponding x is integral, and verify the bounds.

Let's limit by small y, z within -10 to 10, and compute candidate solutions. For each, check if x is integer and compute the squared sum to compare with the bound.

```python
# Enumerate small integer solutions for y and z, then find corresponding x
# and check the constraints. Print all solutions found.

max_abs = 10  # limit for small search

for y in range(-max_abs, max_abs + 1):
    for z in range(-max_abs, max_abs + 1):
        # Compute x from second equation: x = y^2 z - 14
        x = y**2 * z - 14
        # Check if first equation holds:
        # x y - z^2 == y^2 z - x
        lhs = x * y - z ** 2
        rhs = y ** 2 * z - x
        if lhs == rhs:
            # Compute sum of squares
            sum_sq = x ** 2 + y ** 2 + z ** 2
            # Output the solution immediately
            print(f"x={x}, y={y}, z={z}, sum_squares={sum_sq}")
```
This code searches for small solutions, and among them, we can identify candidates to verify the bounds and potentially find the answer as described.
