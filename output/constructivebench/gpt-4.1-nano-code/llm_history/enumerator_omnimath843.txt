The problem defines a set of quadruples \((x, y, z, w)\) satisfying a system of equations involving products and sums, and asks to determine its cardinality. To assist in the conjecture, I will write a Python script to enumerate potential solutions with small sample values, checking all combinations within a reasonable range. This approach helps estimate whether the set is finite or infinite and, if finite, its size.

The script will:
- Fix small ranges for \(x, y, z, w\) (e.g., \(-10\) to \(10\))
- Check the four equations simultaneously
- Immediately print solutions when found
- No hardcoded ground-truth needed

This approach streamlines possible answer evaluation without overcomplicating the enumeration.

```python
# Enumerate all 4-tuples (x, y, z, w) within [-10, 10]
# and check if they satisfy the given equations simultaneously.
# Print each solution immediately upon finding one.

import itertools

# Define the range for enumeration
range_min, range_max = -10, 10

# Store solutions count
solutions_count = 0

for x, y, z, w in itertools.product(range(range_min, range_max + 1), repeat=4):
    # Avoid division by zero in product terms if any
    if any(val == 0 for val in (x, y, z, w)):
        continue  # skip zero to prevent division issues, although not necessarily needed here
    # Equations:
    # 1) x = z + w + z * w * x
    eq1 = x == z + w + z * w * x
    # 2) z = x + y + x * y * z
    eq2 = z == x + y + x * y * z
    # 3) y = w + x + w * x * y
    eq3 = y == w + x + w * x * y
    # 4) w = y + z + y * z * w
    eq4 = w == y + z + y * z * w
    if eq1 and eq2 and eq3 and eq4:
        print(f"Solution found: (x={x}, y={y}, z={z}, w={w})")
        solutions_count += 1

print(f"Total solutions found: {solutions_count}")
```
