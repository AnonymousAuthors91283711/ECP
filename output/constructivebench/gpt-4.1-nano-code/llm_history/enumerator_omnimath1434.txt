The problem appears to involve analyzing the limit behavior of the sequence \( a_n = n \cdot r \cdot \sqrt{1 - \cos(2 \pi / n)} \) as \( n \to \infty \), with \( r > 0 \). The goal is to find or conjecture the value of the limit (denoted by `omnimath1434_answer r`), using an approach that involves small sample cases.

The key insight is to analyze the behavior of \( 1 - \cos(2 \pi / n) \) for large \( n \). For small \( x \), \( \cos x \approx 1 - x^2/2 \), so:

\[
1 - \cos(2\pi / n) \approx (2\pi / n)^2 / 2 = 2 \pi^2 / n^2
\]

Therefore,

\[
a_n \approx n \cdot r \cdot \sqrt{2 \pi^2 / n^2} = n \cdot r \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2} \pi}{n} = r \sqrt{2} \pi
\]

This suggests that the sequence tends to \( r \sqrt{2} \pi \).

Our task is to verify this approximation through computation for sample values of \( n \), then produce this conjecture via enumeration. 

Here's a program that will:
- select small \( n \) values,
- compute the sequence,
- print each value,
- and finally, hypothesize the limit as \( r \sqrt{2} \pi \).

```python
import math

# Parameters
r = 1.0  # testing with r=1 for simplicity
max_n = 20  # small range for enumeration

# Enumerate sequence values
for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
    value = n * r * math.sqrt(1 - math.cos(2 * math.pi / n))
    print(f"n={n}, sequence={value}")

# Conjectured limit based on analysis
limit_approx = r * math.sqrt(2) * math.pi
print(f"Conjectured limit as n→∞: {limit_approx}")
```
