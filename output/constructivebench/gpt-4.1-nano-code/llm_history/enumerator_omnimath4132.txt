The problem involves positive real numbers a, b, c with a product of 1/8, and we need to analyze the sum \( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + a^2b^2 + b^2c^2 + c^2a^2 \). Specifically, the goal is to find or estimate the minimum of this sum under the given constraints. 

Since the problem is symmetric in a, b, c, and involves the constraint \( abc = 1/8 \) (which suggests a potential equality condition at the extremum), the candidates tend to be symmetrical or near-symmetrical solutions. For simplicity and due to non-nationality constraints, I will sample specific positive triples \( (a, b, c) \) that satisfy the product constraint and evaluate the sum. 

Given the symmetry, I will attempt a straightforward approach:
- Set \( a = b = c \) to find an initial candidate.
- Then, vary one variable while fixing the product constraint, to check potential minima.

### Explored sample:
- Symmetric \( a = b = c \). Since \( a^3 = 1/8 \), \( a = (1/8)^{1/3} \), which is approximately \( 0.5 \).
- For this symmetric solution: \( a = b = c \approx 0.5 \), compute the sum.
- Also test slightly asymmetric triples that satisfy the product constraint.

```python
import math

# Compute symmetric candidate where a = b = c, so a^3 = 1/8
a_sym = (1/8)**(1/3)  # cube root of 1/8
sum_sym = (a_sym**2)*3 + (a_sym**2)**2*3  # a^2 summed and squared terms
print(f"Symmetric solution: a=b=c={a_sym:.4f}")
result_sym = a_sym**2 * 3 + (a_sym**2)**2 * 3
print(f"Sum at symmetric point: {result_sym:.4f}")  # exact calculation

# Now, test asymmetric candidates
# For example, fix a, b, then c = (1/8)/(a*b), and evaluate
test_values = [
    (0.6, 0.2),
    (0.7, 0.2),
    (0.5, 0.3),
]

for a, b in test_values:
    c = (1/8) / (a * b)
    if c > 0:
        sum_val = a**2 + b**2 + c**2 + a**2*b**2 + b**2*c**2 + c**2*a**2
        print(f"a={a:.2f}, b={b:.2f}, c={c:.2f} => sum={sum_val:.4f}")
```
