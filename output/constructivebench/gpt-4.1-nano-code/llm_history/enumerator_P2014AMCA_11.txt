The problem appears to be about finding a unique real number \( d \) that satisfies certain conditions, involving velocities \( v_1 = 35 \), \( v_2 = v_1 + 15 = 50 \), and timing equations. The goal is to determine the value of \( d \) that aligns with the provided constraints.

Let's analyze the equations:
- \( d_1 = v_1 \cdot 1 = 35 \)
- \( d_2 = d - d_1 \)
- \( t_2 = d_2 / v_2 = (d - 35)/50 \)
- Total time: \( 1 + t_2 \)
- Scheduled time: \( d / v_1 - 1 = d / 35 - 1 \)

Condition:
\[
\text{total_time} = \text{scheduled_time} - 0.5
\]
which leads to:
\[
1 + \frac{d - 35}{50} = \frac{d}{35} - 1 - 0.5
\]
Simplify:
\[
1 + \frac{d - 35}{50} = \frac{d}{35} - 1.5
\]
Bring all to common forms and solve for \( d \). Implementing this as a search over small candidate values of \( d \), verifying the equality.

Here's a Python script that searches for the unique \( d \) satisfying the conditions with small samples, printing the candidate solutions for evidence:

```python
# Analytically solving the equation for d:
# 1 + (d - 35)/50 = d/35 - 1.5

# Rearranged:
# (d - 35)/50 - d/35 = -2.5

# To avoid complex algebra, we'll iterate over possible d values to find solutions.

for d in range(0, 1001):  # check d from 0 to 1000
    total_time = 1 + (d - 35) / 50
    scheduled_time = d / 35 - 1
    if abs(total_time - (scheduled_time - 0.5)) < 1e-6:  # consider floating precision
        print(f"d = {d}, total_time = {total_time}, scheduled_time = {scheduled_time}")
```

This systematically searches within a reasonable range, identifies the unique \( d \) that fits the constraints, and prints the answer immediately.
