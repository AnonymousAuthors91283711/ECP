The problem seems to involve the following key parts:
- Finding the least natural number \( k \) such that there exist coprime \( m, n \) with \( k = m + n \),
- And the ratio \( \frac{m}{n} \) matches a certain rational expression.

The ratio expression is:
\[
\frac{26^3 \times 10 + 10^3 \times 26 - 26 \times 10}{26^3 \times 10^3}
\]

Step-by-step approach:
- Compute numerator and denominator explicitly.
- Simplify the fraction.
- Search for coprime \( m, n \) that satisfy the ratio exactly.
- Find the minimal \( k = m + n \).

Below is a Python program that:
- Calculates the ratio numerically.
- Iterates over small coprime pairs \( m, n \).
- Finds those matching the ratio exactly (considering rational equality).
- Prints candidates immediately, with the smallest \( m + n \).

```python
from math import gcd

# Compute the ratio from the problem
numerator = (26**3) * 10 + (10**3) * 26 - 26 * 10
denominator = (26**3) * (10**3)
ratio_value = numerator / denominator

# To handle floating potential inaccuracies, compare rational forms directly
# The ratio should be rational, so store numerator and denominator separately
ratio_num = numerator
ratio_den = denominator

answers = []

# Due to the nature of the problem (likely small integers), limit searches
max_mn = 100  # arbitrary small limit for m,n

for n in range(1, max_mn + 1):
    # Find m such that m/n == ratio_num/ratio_den
    # => m = ratio_num/ratio_den * n
    m_numer = ratio_num * n
    m_denom = ratio_den

    # If m_numer divides evenly into m_denom, then potential integer m
    if m_numer % m_denom == 0:
        m = m_numer // m_denom
        if m > 0 and gcd(m, n) == 1:
            k = m + n
            print(f"Found coprime pair (m={m}, n={n}) with sum {k}")
            answers.append(k)

# Output the minimal k found
if answers:
    min_k = min(answers)
    print(f"Minimum k satisfying conditions: {min_k}")
else:
    print("No coprime pair found within range that exactly matches the ratio.")
```
