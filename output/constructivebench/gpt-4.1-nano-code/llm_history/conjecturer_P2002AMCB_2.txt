abbrev P2002AMCB_2_answer : ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem P2002AMCB_2 (x : ℝ) : 
    (3 * x - 2) * (4 * x + 1) - ((3 * x - 2) * 4 * x) + 1 = P2002AMCB_2_answer x := by sorry. Enumerated answers: x = -1, answer = -4
x = 0, answer = -1
x = 1, answer = 2
x = 2, answer = 5. Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
The pattern in enumerated answers suggests a linear function of x: as x increases by 1, answer increases by 3. Testing points shows the values (-4, -1, 2, 5) for x = -1, 0, 1, 2. Calculate slope: (5 - (-4)) / (2 - (-1)) = 9/3 = 3. Find intercept: answer at x=0 is -1, so intercept is -1. Final formula: 3 * x - 1.
