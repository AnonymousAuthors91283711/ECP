. Enumerated answers: Subset: (1, 4, 20), Product: 80, Sum: 25. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
To find the sum of the subset T with product 80, from the given set S, the subset is {1, 4, 20}; their sum is 25. The pattern suggests summing the elements of this specific subset. 

Final expression in Lean:
<<<25>>>
