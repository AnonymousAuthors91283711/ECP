The problem involves analyzing the roots of a polynomial \( P = X^3 - 3X^2 + 1 \), and summing the cube roots of each shifted root \( 3r_i - 2 \). 

Key steps:
- Find the roots \( r_i \) of \( P \).
- Compute \( 3r_i - 2 \) for each root.
- Sum the cube roots of these values.

Since explicit root calculations are complex algebraically, we use small sample values corresponding to the roots, then compute the sum of the cube roots numerically. The roots of \( P \) are known to be real (by analysis or numerical approximation). 

The code enumerates approximate roots, computes the desired sum, and outputs the sum as a float, illustrating the approximate answer without hardcoding.

```python
import numpy as np

# Polynomial coefficients for P = X^3 - 3X^2 + 1
coeffs = [1, -3, 0, 1]

# Find roots numerically
roots = np.roots(coeffs)

# Compute sum of cube roots of (3 * root - 2)
total = 0
for r in roots:
    value = 3 * r - 2
    # Compute cube root, handling negative values
    cbrt = np.cbrt(value)
    total += cbrt
    print(f"Root: {r}, 3*root - 2: {value}, cube root: {cbrt}")

print(f"Approximate sum: {total}")
```
