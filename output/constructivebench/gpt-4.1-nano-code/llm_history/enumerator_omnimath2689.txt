This problem involves a simple proportional relationship: `fridayPoints = wednesdayPoints * 80 / 100`. The theorem wants to find a function `omnimath2689_answer` such that `fridayPoints` equals this function of `wednesdayPoints`. We need to enumerate possible candidates for `omnimath2689_answer` that match the given relationship.

Given the formula, the exact answer should be `wednesdayPoints * 80 / 100`, which might not be an integer. To stay consistent with natural numbers, we can consider the integer division `wednesdayPoints * 80 // 100`. The program should enumerate some initial values of `wednesdayPoints` with small sample values, print the exact computation, and verify the result matches the expected `fridayPoints`.

```python
# The code enumerates small sample values for wednesdayPoints
# and computes the corresponding fridayPoints using integer division.
# It prints each computed answer to assist in conjecturing the exact function.

def omnimath2689_answer(wednesdayPoints):
    return wednesdayPoints * 80 // 100

# Sample range of wednesdayPoints (e.g., 0 to 99)
for wednesdayPoints in range(100):
    answer = omnimath2689_answer(wednesdayPoints)
    print(f'wednesdayPoints={wednesdayPoints} -> answer={answer}')
```
