Ground Truth Answer: { (Nat.factorial k - 1, 1, 1) | k ∈ {n | 1 < n} } ∪ 
  { (1, Nat.factorial k - 1, 1) | k ∈ {n | 1 < n} } ∪

Proposed Answer: {
  (1, 1, 1),
  (1, 1, 5),
  (1, 5, 1),
  (5, 1, 1)

Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all triples (a,b,c) of positive integers where:
   - a*b+1 is a factorial
   - b*c+1 is a factorial
   - c*a+1 is a factorial

2. The ground truth answer gives:
   - All triples where two elements are 1 and the third is (k!-1) for k>1
   - This is an infinite set since k can be any integer >1

3. The proposed answer gives:
   - (1,1,1) which fits (1*1+1=2=2!)
   - Three permutations of (1,1,5) where 1*5+1=6=3!
   - But misses all other cases like (1,1,23) since 23*1+1=24=4!

The proposed answer is incomplete as it only lists a few specific cases and misses the general pattern and infinite other solutions. The ground truth answer correctly captures all solutions.
