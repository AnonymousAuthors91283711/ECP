Ground Truth Answer: 9/10
Proposed Answer: (3 / 4) / (5 / 6)
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer.

The problem gives us:
(5/6)*V₁ = (3/4)*V₂ with V₁, V₂ > 0
and asks us to find V₁/V₂.

From the equation:
(5/6)*V₁ = (3/4)*V₂
We can solve for V₁/V₂ by dividing both sides by V₂ and then by (5/6):
V₁/V₂ = (3/4)/(5/6) = (3/4)*(6/5) = 18/20 = 9/10

The proposed answer is (3/4)/(5/6), which is exactly the intermediate step we used to get to 9/10. While not fully simplified, it is mathematically equivalent to the ground truth answer of 9/10.
