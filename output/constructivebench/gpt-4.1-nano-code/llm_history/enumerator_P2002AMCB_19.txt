The problem gives three equations involving positive real numbers \(a, b, c\):

1. \(a (b + c) = 152\)
2. \(b (c + a) = 162\)
3. \(c (a + b) = 170\)

Our goal is to find an expression for \(a b c\). To do this, I'll write a Python script that enumerates small positive values for \(a, b, c\) respecting the equations approximately, then identifies the value of \(a b c\). Since the equations are continuous, we'll set a reasonable search range and step size.

---

**Explanation:**
- Use small sample values for \(a, b, c\) in ranges around the approximate ratios suggested by dividing RHS by the sums.
- For each triplet, check how closely they satisfy the equations.
- Record solutions where the equations are satisfied within a small tolerance (say \(1 \times 10^{-2}\)).
- When solutions are found, output \(a \times b \times c\).

This approach won't be exact but should guide toward the true answer.

```python
import itertools

# Parameters for enumeration
max_value = 50
step = 0.5
tolerance = 1e-2

# To store potential solutions
solutions = []

# Enumerate possible (a, b, c)
for a in [x * step for x in range(1, int(max_value / step) + 1)]:
    for b in [x * step for x in range(1, int(max_value / step) + 1)]:
        for c in [x * step for x in range(1, int(max_value / step) + 1)]:
            # Check the equations approximately
            eq1 = abs(a * (b + c) - 152)
            eq2 = abs(b * (c + a) - 162)
            eq3 = abs(c * (a + b) - 170)
            if eq1 < tolerance and eq2 < tolerance and eq3 < tolerance:
                abc = a * b * c
                print(f"Found solution: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, a*b*c={abc}")
                solutions.append(abc)

# If multiple solutions, find the range or extremum as needed
if solutions:
    print(f"Approximate minimal a*b*c: {min(solutions)}")
    print(f"Approximate maximal a*b*c: {max(solutions)}")
```
