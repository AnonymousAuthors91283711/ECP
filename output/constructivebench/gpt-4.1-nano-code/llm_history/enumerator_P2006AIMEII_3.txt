This problem asks to find the greatest exponent \(k\) such that \(3^k\) divides the product \(P = \prod_{i=0}^{99} (2i+1)\). Since the product involves only odd numbers, none of these factors are divisible by 3 at first glance. We need to count how many factors of 3 appear in the product, which involves analyzing each odd number \(2i+1\) for divisibility by 3, and especially for higher powers of 3 dividing these numbers.

To do this efficiently:
- Iterate over \(i = 0\) to 99.
- Check the divisibility of \(2i+1\) by 3, 9, 27, etc., to find the total exponent of 3 dividing \(P\).
- Sum these exponents across all factors.

Let's implement this enumeration method, counting factors of 3 at each level, and then determine the maximum \(k\).

```python
# Enumerate factors of 3 in the product of odd numbers 1,3,5,...,199
total_exponent = 0
for i in range(100):
    num = 2 * i + 1
    count = 0
    temp = num
    while temp % 3 == 0:
        count += 1
        temp //= 3
    total_exponent += count
    print(f"Number: {num}, exponent of 3: {count}")
print(f"Total exponent: {total_exponent}")
```
