The problem appears to relate to combinatorial enumeration involving functions from Fin n to Fin 2, with constraints involving guesses and minimality conditions. Without explicit ground truth, our goal is to find the minimal number `m` such that there exists a set of guesses covering all functions `s` from `Fin n` to `Fin 2` under the given conditions.

Given the complexity, and for demonstration, I'll choose small values for `n` and `k`. For example, consider `n=3` and `k=1`. The key is to enumerate minimal guesses sets with cardinality `m`, verifying the property for all functions.

To satisfy the requirements:
- Stream answers as found.
- Enumerate candidates for `m` starting from small values up to a threshold.
- Use only small parameters for efficiency.

Here's a Python script that simulates this enumeration, focusing on finding the minimal `m` that covers all functions with the specified properties.

```python
import itertools

# For small n and k, define the sets of functions and guesses
n = 3  # Length of the input domain
k = 1  # Hamming distance constraints

# Generate all functions s: Fin n -> Fin 2 (represented as tuples of bits)
all_functions = list(itertools.product([0, 1], repeat=n))

# Function to compute the "guess" set and check the coverage
def check_guess_set(guess_set):
    for s in all_functions:
        # For each function s, verify if it is covered by the guess set
        covered = False
        for u in guess_set:
            # Count difference between u and s
            diff = sum(1 for ui, si in zip(u, s) if ui != si)
            if diff == k:
                covered = True
                break
        if not covered:
            return False
    return True

# Since each guess is a function from Fin n to Fin 2, generate all guesses
all_guesses = list(itertools.product([0, 1], repeat=n))

# Search for minimal m such that there exists a set of guesses covering all functions
max_m = 7  # Limit m to avoid excessive computation
for m in range(1, max_m + 1):
    # Generate all subsets of guesses of size m
    for guesses in itertools.combinations(all_guesses, m):
        if check_guess_set(guesses):
            print(f"Minimal m found: {m} with guesses: {guesses}")
            break  # Found the minimal, move to next m
    else:
        continue
    break  # Exit outer loop if minimal m found
```

This enumeration finds and prints the minimal number `m` of guesses needed to cover all functions with the specified properties for small `n` and `k`. Adjustments can be made for different parameters. The program stream-lines results, focusing on a small, illustrative example.
