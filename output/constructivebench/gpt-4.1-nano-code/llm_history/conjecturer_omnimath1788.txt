Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Let's analyze the pattern: the candidate solutions involve symmetric variations, with the key relation \(a^2 - b c = 14\) among other similar equations. The candidates with large negative \(a, b, c\) yield sums with absolute value decreasing from 60 down to 20 as the parameters change. The pattern suggests that the sum's absolute value depends linearly on how \(b, c\) shift from \(-20\).

Since the solutions seem to mainly revolve around \(a=b=c=-20\) giving sum \(−60\) with absolute value 60, and other variations adjusting these values, the final consistent answer appears to be the maximum absolute value encountered, which is 60, especially from the candidate \(a = b = c = -20\).

\(\boxed{
\text{Answer} = 60
}\)
