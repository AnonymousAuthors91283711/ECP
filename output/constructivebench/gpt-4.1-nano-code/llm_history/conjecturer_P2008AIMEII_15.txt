Maximum n: 13. Expected Answer Type: ℤ
The pattern indicates the set contains symmetric pairs around zero, with max at 13. Therefore, the answer is the maximum value satisfying the condition, i.e., 13.

Maximum n: 13. Expected Answer Type: ℤ
The problem asks for the greatest integer n such that there exists an integer m with n^2 = (m+1)^3 - m^3. Simplify the RHS:

(m+1)^3 - m^3 = (m^3 + 3m^2 + 3m + 1) - m^3 = 3m^2 + 3m + 1.

So the set is { n ∈ ℤ | ∃ m ∈ ℤ, n^2 = 3m^2 + 3m + 1 }.

This is a quadratic Diophantine equation relating n and m. The question reduces to analyzing the values of m for which 3m^2 + 3m + 1 is a perfect square, then choosing the maximum positive n satisfying that.

Observing the pattern from the enumerated answers, notably ±1 and ±13, suggests that the maximum occurred at n=13.

Therefore, the greatest such n is 13, and the corresponding m can be checked to exist (though not strictly required here).

The formula for the answer set maximum is thus n=13.

Answer in Lean:

<<<13>>>
