The problem provides the following conditions:

- a, b, c, d > 0
- a³ = b²
- c⁵ = d⁴
- c - a = 77

We need to find d - b.

To solve this, we can:

1. Express a in terms of b: a = (b²)^{1/3} = b^{2/3}
2. Since a > 0 and integer, b^{2/3} must be an integer, so b must be a perfect cube: let b = m³, then:
   a = (m³)^{2/3} = m^{2}
3. Similarly, c and d satisfy c⁵ = d⁴. For d and c positive integers, d = c^{5/4}. To have d integer, c must be a perfect 4th power: c = n^{4}. Then:
   d = c^{5/4} = (n^{4})^{5/4} = n^{5}

4. The relation c - a = 77 becomes n^{4} - m^{2} = 77.

Thus, the problem reduces to finding positive integers m, n satisfying:
- n^{4} - m^{2} = 77

We can iterate small positive integers for m and n to find solutions, then compute d - b.

```python
# Enumerate small positive integers for m and n to find solutions
# of n^4 - m^2 = 77, then compute d - b = n^5 - m^3
# ensuring all are positive integers.

# Set limits for search to keep computation quick
m_limit = 50
n_limit = 20

for n in range(1, n_limit + 1):
    c = n ** 4
    for m in range(1, m_limit + 1):
        if c - m ** 2 == 77:
            a = m ** 2
            b = m ** 3
            c_value = c
            d = n ** 5
            diff = d - b
            print(f"m={m}, n={n} => a={a}, b={b}, c={c_value}, d={d}, d - b={diff}")
```
