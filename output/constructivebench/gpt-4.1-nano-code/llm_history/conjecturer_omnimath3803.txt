  omnimath3803_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Feasible coloring found with k=1
No feasible coloring with k=2
No feasible coloring with k=3
No feasible coloring with k=4
No feasible coloring with k=5
Maximum feasible k: 1. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<1>>>
The maximum feasible k, given the constraints, is 1 as only k=1 satisfies the coloring's neighbor conditions.
