theorem omnimath3898 (f : ℚ → ℤ) :
  (∀ (x : ℚ) (a : ℤ) (b : ℤ), 0 < b → f ((f x + a) / b) = f ((x + a) / b)) ↔ f ∈ omnimath3898_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {f | (∃ c : ℤ, f = fun _ => c) ∨ (f = fun x => ⌊x⌋) ∨ (f = fun x => ⌈x⌉)}
Proposed Answer: {f : ℚ → ℤ | ∀ x,∃ c : ℤ, f x = c} ∪ {f : ℚ → ℤ | ∃ (a b : ℤ), b ≠ 0 ∧ ∀ x, f x = ⌊a * x + b⌋}
Let me analyze the two answers:

1. Ground Truth Answer: This states that f must be either:
   - A constant function (f(x) = c for some c ∈ ℤ)
   - The floor function (f(x) = ⌊x⌋)
   - The ceiling function (f(x) = ⌈x⌉)

2. Proposed Answer: This states that f must be either:
   - Any function where each output is some integer (which is trivially true for all f: ℚ → ℤ)
   - Or a function of the form f(x) = ⌊a*x + b⌋ for some a,b ∈ ℤ with b ≠ 0

The problems with the proposed answer:
1. The first condition is trivial and doesn't restrict f at all
2. The second condition is more general than needed (allowing arbitrary linear transformations before floor)
3. It misses the ceiling function case entirely
4. The b ≠ 0 condition is incorrect (should be about the coefficient relationship)
