The problem involves understanding the recursive definition of sequence `a(n)` with the relation:

\[
a(n+1) = n \times \left\lfloor \frac{a(n)}{n} \right\rfloor + 1
\]

and the condition that \(a(30) = 30\). The goal is to find the cardinality of solutions for \(a(1)\), i.e., how many different positive integers \(x\) satisfy the conditions given.

Key insight:
- The recursive formula can be rewritten as: \(a(n+1) = n \times \left\lfloor \frac{a(n)}{n} \right\rfloor + 1\).
- For each \(a(n)\), the value of \(a(n+1)\) depends on \(\left\lfloor \frac{a(n)}{n} \right\rfloor\), which must be an integer.
- The value of \(a(n)\) is constrained to produce \(a(30)=30\) after 29 steps, with various options possibly at each step.

A brute-force enumeration starting from feasible \(a(1)\) values, then iterating forward, can identify all initial \(a(1)\) values that satisfy the final condition.

Below is a Python program that:
- Enumerates possible initial values \(a(1) \in \{1, 2, ..., 30\}\)
- Simulates the recursion to check if \(a(30) = 30\)
- For each initial \(a(1)\), records whether the sequence reaches \(a(30)=30\)

This approach aligns with the requirement to enumerate solutions and determine the count of solutions.

```python
# Enumerate all plausible initial a(1), simulate the recursion, and count solutions with a(30)=30
def sequence_reaches_30(a1):
    a = a1
    for n in range(1, 30):
        q = a // n
        a = n * q + 1
    return a == 30

solutions = []
for a1 in range(1, 31):
    if sequence_reaches_30(a1):
        solutions.append(a1)
        print(f"Found solution: a(1) = {a1}")

print(f"Total solutions for a(1): {len(solutions)}")
```

This code immediately prints each initial \(a(1)\) that leads to \(a(30)=30\), fulfilling the streaming output requirement, and finally reports the total number of such solutions.
