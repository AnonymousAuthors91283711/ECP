Ground Truth Answer: 398
Proposed Answer: (2^ (2^10) - 1) % 1000
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer.

The problem is calculating the sum of all differences (a - b) where a > b and both a and b are powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^10, then finding that sum modulo 1000.

The ground truth answer is 398.

The proposed answer suggests (2^(2^10) - 1) % 1000. Let's evaluate this:
- 2^10 = 1024
- 2^1024 is an extremely large number
- (2^1024 - 1) mod 1000 would not give us 398

Moreover, the correct approach would be to calculate the sum of all ordered pairs where a > b, which would be:
sum_{i=1}^{10} sum_{j=0}^{i-1} (2^i - 2^j)

This is not equivalent to 2^(2^10) - 1.
