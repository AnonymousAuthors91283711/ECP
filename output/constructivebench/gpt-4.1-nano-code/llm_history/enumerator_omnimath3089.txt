The problem asks to find the number of integer solutions \( p = (x, y) \) satisfying:
- \( y = 4x + 3 \)
- \( 25 < x < 75 \)
- \( 120 < y < 250 \)

First, since \( y = 4x + 3 \), the bounds on \( y \) imply:
\[
120 < 4x + 3 < 250
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
117 < 4x < 247
\]
Dividing through by 4:
\[
29.25 < x < 61.75
\]

Given \( x \) is an integer:
\[
x \in \{30, 31, 32, \dots, 61\}
\]

Check which of these satisfy the original bounds \( 25 < x < 75 \) (already holds for all from 30 to 61). Now check the bounds on \( y \):
- For each \( x \) from 30 to 61, \( y = 4x + 3 \).

Ensure \( y \) is strictly between 120 and 250:
- \( y = 4x + 3 \)
- For \( x=30 \), \( y=4*30+3=123 \), which is >120 and <250.
- For \( x=61 \), \( y=4*61+3=247 \), which is >120 and <250.

So valid \( x \) are from 30 to 61 inclusive, giving solutions.

Total solutions: \( 61 - 30 + 1 = 32 \).

```python
# Count the number of integer solutions for x in range
# where y = 4x + 3, bounds on y are 120 < y < 250
count = 0
for x in range(30, 62):
    y = 4 * x + 3
    if 120 < y < 250:
        print((x, y))
        count += 1

# Output the total count
print("Total solutions:", count)
```
