Ground Truth Answer: 4^7
Proposed Answer: 2^7
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking which of the given options (n² = 2³ or n² = 3⁵ etc.) has a natural number solution n.

2. We need to check each case:
   - 2³ = 8 → no integer n satisfies n²=8
   - 3⁵ = 243 → no integer n satisfies n²=243
   - 4⁷ = (2²)⁷ = 2¹⁴ → (2⁷)² = 2¹⁴ → n=2⁷=128 works
   - 5⁹ → not a perfect square
   - 6¹¹ → not a perfect square

3. The ground truth correctly identifies 4⁷ as the only case that works (since 4⁷ is a perfect square).

4. The proposed answer 2⁷ is incorrect because:
   - While 2⁷=128 is indeed the n that satisfies n²=4⁷
   - The problem asks for the right-hand side of the equation (the power expression), not the solution n
   - Therefore, 2⁷ is the solution n, not the expression that equals n²
