Ground Truth Answer: 7 * 2023
Proposed Answer: 2023
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
- We need to find the smallest positive natural number n that is:
  1) A perfect square (n = k² for some k)
  2) Divisible by 2023 (2023 ∣ n)

Ground Truth Answer (7 * 2023):
- 7 * 2023 = 14161
- 14161 = 119² (perfect square)
- 2023 divides 14161 (14161/2023 = 7)
- This is indeed the smallest such number because:
  - The prime factorization of 2023 is 7 × 17 × 17
  - To make a perfect square divisible by 2023, we need at least one more 7 (to make both 7 and 17² appear)
  - Thus minimal n = 7 × 2023 = 7² × 17² = (7×17)² = 119²

Proposed Answer (2023):
- 2023 is not a perfect square (√2023 ≈ 44.98)
- Therefore it doesn't satisfy the condition n = k²

Conclusion:
The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the problem's conditions, while the ground truth answer does.
