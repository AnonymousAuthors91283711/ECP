This problem appears to involve solving an algebraic equation involving a real variable x, specifically (2 + x + 10) / 3 = x, and identifying the answer in a way that allows exploration of possible solutions.

Let's write a Python program to solve the equation algebraically, enumerate candidate solutions, and stream out potential answers to help with conjecture and proof.

The equation simplifies to (x + 12) / 3 = x, which leads to x + 12 = 3x, or 12 = 2x, so x = 6.  
However, per instructions, we want to discover or confirm such solutions systematically, possibly through enumeration or small parameter search.

Here's a small Python program to do that:

```python
# Program to explore solutions of (x + 12)/3 = x
# Enumerate candidate x values in a small range to identify solutions

for candidate in range(-10, 11):
    x = candidate
    lhs = (x + 12) / 3
    if abs(lhs - x) < 1e-8:
        print(f"Candidate solution found: x = {x}")
        # Streaming the found solution
        # Since the algebra suggests a single solution, we stop after confirming it
```

This approach checks integers from -10 to 10 for solutions, streamlining the enumeration process.  
The expected exact solution is x = 6, and the program will find and print that.
