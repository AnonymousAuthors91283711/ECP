The problem asks to find the number of integers \( x \) such that \(|x| < 3 \pi\). Since \( x \) is an integer, we need to determine all integers within that interval. 

Given \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), \( 3 \pi \approx 9.4247 \). The integers satisfying \( |x| < 9.4247 \) are those with \(|x| \leq 9\), i.e., from \(-9\) up to \(9\). Count of such integers is \(19\).

The code will verify this by explicitly enumerating all integers in the interval and counting them, then printing the count.

```python
# Enumerate all integers x with |x| < 3 * pi, where pi â‰ˆ 3.14159
import math

pi = math.pi
limit = 3 * pi  # approximately 9.4247

# Find integer bounds
min_x = -math.floor(limit)
max_x = math.floor(limit)

# Generate integers in the interval
answers = [x for x in range(min_x, max_x + 1) if abs(x) < limit]

# Print each answer immediately (streaming)
for ans in answers:
    print(ans)

# Output the total count as the answer for the theorem
print("P2021AMCB_1_answer:", len(answers))
```
