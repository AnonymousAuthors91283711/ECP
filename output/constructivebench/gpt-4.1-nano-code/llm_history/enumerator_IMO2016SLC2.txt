The problem appears to concern a combinatorial number theory setup involving a grid of functions with divisibility, equal row and column sums, and uniqueness of entries. To assist in conjecturing the possible values of `n`, I will simulate small feasible parameters and enumerate all possible arrays `(f i j)` satisfying the constraints, especially focusing on small `r`, `c` and `f` values.

Since the theorem involves the existence of an array of positive integers dividing `n`, with unique entries, constant row sums, and constant column sums, I will:

- Select small values for `r` and `c` (like 1, 2, or 3)
- Generate all functions `f : Fin r → Fin c → ℕ` with entries dividing a candidate `n`
- Check constraints
- Output all `n` values for which such arrangements exist.

This Brute-force enumeration will help identify candidate `n` values, especially the minimal ones satisfying the conditions.

```python
# Enumerate small r, c, and f to find all n values satisfying the constraints.
from itertools import product

# Constraints: r, c small, entries divide n, unique entries, equal row and column sums
max_r, max_c = 3, 3  # small sizes for feasibility
candidate_ns = set()

# Explore possible n values up to a reasonable limit
n_limit = 20

for n in range(1, n_limit + 1):
    for r in range(1, max_r + 1):
        for c in range(1, max_c + 1):
            # Generate all functions f: Fin r → Fin c → ℕ with entries dividing n
            # For entries, we consider all possible values from 1 up to n
            positions = [(i, j) for i in range(r) for j in range(c)]
            # For each position, possible values are divisors of n
            # Compute divisors of n
            divisors = [d for d in range(1, n+1) if n % d == 0]
            # Generate all possible assignments
            all_assignments = product(divisors, repeat=len(positions))
            for assignment in all_assignments:
                f_values = [assignment[k] for k in range(len(positions))]
                # Check for uniqueness
                if len(set(f_values)) != len(f_values):
                    continue
                # Reshape into matrix
                matrix = [f_values[i*c:(i+1)*c] for i in range(r)]
                # Check if all row sums are equal
                row_sums = [sum(row) for row in matrix]
                if len(set(row_sums)) != 1:
                    continue
                # Check if all column sums are equal
                col_sums = [sum(matrix[i][j] for i in range(r)) for j in range(c)]
                if len(set(col_sums)) != 1:
                    continue
                # All constraints satisfied, record n
                print(f"Found valid configuration for n={n}, r={r}, c={c}")
                candidate_ns.add(n)
print("Candidate n values:", sorted(candidate_ns))
```
