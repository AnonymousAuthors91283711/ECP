The problem appears to be a mathematical theorem involving functions, but it is incomplete (uses `sorry`) and references a set `omnimath3557_answer` with an unspecified definition. To assist in conjecturing an answer, I will implement a Python script that enumerates polynomial functions of low degree, testing the inequality:

\[ \forall x, y \in \mathbb{R},\quad f(x + y) + y \leq f(f(f(x))) \]

The goal is to generate candidate functions \(f\), especially simple functions like linear or quadratic, and verify whether they satisfy the inequality for multiple sample points, aiming to find functions that satisfy or violate it.

Since the problem is rich and complex, I will focus on enumerating simple functions, such as linear functions \(f(x) = a x + b\), over a small parameter space, printing those that satisfy the inequality on a grid of sample points.

```python
import numpy as np

# Sample parameter ranges for linear functions f(x) = a * x + b
a_values = np.linspace(-10, 10, 21)  # coefficients a from -10 to 10
b_values = np.linspace(-10, 10, 21)  # coefficients b from -10 to 10

# Sample points for testing
x_points = np.linspace(-5, 5, 5)
y_points = np.linspace(-5, 5, 5)

def f_linear(a, b, x):
    return a * x + b

# Enumerate candidate linear functions
for a in a_values:
    for b in b_values:
        satisfies_all = True
        for x in x_points:
            for y in y_points:
                left = f_linear(a, b, x + y) + y
                # Compute f(f(f(x)))
                val = f_linear(a, b, x)
                f1 = f_linear(a, b, val)
                f2 = f_linear(a, b, f1)
                right = f2
                if left > right + 1e-8:  # Allow small epsilon
                    satisfies_all = False
                    break
            if not satisfies_all:
                break
        if satisfies_all:
            print(f'Candidate: f(x) = {a:.2f} * x + {b:.2f} satisfies the inequality on samples.')
```
