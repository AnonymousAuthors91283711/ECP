  {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ φ n = 2002^2 - 1} = omnimath3328_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Target phi value: 4008003. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The pattern in enumeration suggests the answer involves all n satisfying φ(n) = 4008003. Since φ is multiplicative and for n = p q with distinct primes p, q, φ(n) = (p - 1)(q - 1). Factoring 4008003 yields prime factors 2001 and 2002, so for p - 1 = 2001, p = 2002, and for q - 1 = 2002, q = 2003. Therefore, n = 2002 * 2003 = 4008006, which satisfies φ(n)=4008003. The set includes all such n, i.e., n=2002*2003.
