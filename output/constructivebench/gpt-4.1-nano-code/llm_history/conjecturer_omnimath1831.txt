abbrev omnimath1831_answer : Set ℂ := sorry
theorem omnimath1831 (a b c : ℂ) :
    a^2 = b - c ∧ b^2 = c - a ∧ c^2 = a - b ↔ a + b + c ∈ omnimath1831_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Solution sum: 0.0+0.0*i. Expected Answer Type: Set ℂ
The pattern suggests the solution involves the sum being zero, with potential complex solutions. Given the symmetry, the sum a + b + c equals zero, fitting the enumerated answer as a specific set containing 0.0+0.0*i. For closure, define the set containing this single element for simplicity.
