[write_program]
This problem involves Fibonacci numbers and a certain rational expression involving Fibonacci ratios. To assist in conjecturing and identifying the true value of `omnimath658_answer`, I will write a Python program that computes Fibonacci numbers at these high indices, evaluates the expression, and then attempts to find the numerator and denominator in simplest form. The code will attempt to identify the exact value or at least provide a clear approximation, streaming out answers as it computes.

The key is to efficiently generate Fibonacci numbers at very high indices (using fast doubling), then compute the ratio, simplify the resulting fraction, and check the numerator's absolute value.

```python
# Python program to analyze the given Fibonacci ratios and compute the target value

def fib_fast_doubling(n):
    """Return (F(n), F(n+1)) using fast doubling."""
    if n == 0:
        return (0, 1)
    a, b = fib_fast_doubling(n >> 1)
    c = a * (2 * b - a)
    d = a * a + b * b
    if n & 1:
        return (d, c + d)
    else:
        return (c, d)

# Compute Fibonacci numbers at large indices
f2002, _ = fib_fast_doubling(2002)
f2003, _ = fib_fast_doubling(2003)
f2004, _ = fib_fast_doubling(2004)

# Calculate the ratio r
r_num = f2003
r_den = f2002
r = r_num / r_den - f2004 / f2003

# Convert r to a fraction to simplify
from math import gcd
# r as a fraction
numerator = r_num * f2003 - f2004 * r_den
denominator = f2002 * f2003

# Simplify the fraction
g = gcd(numerator, denominator)
numerator_simplified = numerator // g
denominator_simplified = denominator // g

print(f"f2002 = {f2002}")
print(f"f2003 = {f2003}")
print(f"f2004 = {f2004}")
print(f"Computed numerator before gcd = {numerator}")
print(f"Computed denominator before gcd = {denominator}")
print(f"Simplified fraction: {numerator_simplified}/{denominator_simplified}")
print(f"Absolute numerator = {abs(numerator_simplified)}")
print(f"Ratio r = {numerator_simplified}/{denominator_simplified}")
```
