theorem P2005AIMEII_1 : 
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | 6 ≤ n ∧ choose n 6 = 6 * choose n 3} P2005AIMEII_1_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n = 13 satisfies the condition: C(13,6) = 6 * C(13,3) = 1716. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests searching for n where C(n,6) = 6 * C(n,3). Simplifying the ratio reveals that n must satisfy the algebraic relation n(n−1)(n−2) = 6(n−3)(n−4)(n−5), which when solved yields n=13 as the minimal solution satisfying the condition.
