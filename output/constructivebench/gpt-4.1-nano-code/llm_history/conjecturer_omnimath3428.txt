abbrev omnimath3428_answer : ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3428 (s t : ℝ) : 0.1 * s = t ↔ s = omnimath3428_answer t := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 0
5.0
-10
23.0
1000. Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
Given the equivalence 0.1 * s = t, solving for s yields s = t / 0.1 = 10 * t. The list of enumerated answers suggests the intended specific value; among options 0, 5.0, -10, 23.0, 1000, the only consistent choice tied to the division by 0.1 is s = 10 * t. Thus, the answer is a function multiplying t by 10.
