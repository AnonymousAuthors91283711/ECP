The problem involves determining the value of \(a + b + c\) for a quadratic function \(f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) with a given functional relation \(f(x + 3) = 3x^2 + 7x + 4\), and also knowing that \(f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c\). 

Given \(f(x + 3) = a(x + 3)^2 + b(x + 3) + c\), we can expand this and match it with the explicit form \(3x^2 + 7x + 4\) to find \(a, b, c\).

Instead of hardcoding the answer, the enumeration approach involves checking for \(a, b, c\) through the equations derived, matching coefficients, and then computing \(a + b + c\).

Here's a concise Python script to automate checking possible quadratic coefficients for the consistency of the equation and printing the sum:

```python
# Enumerate small rational candidates for a, b, c and verify the functional equation
# f(x+3) = a*(x+3)^2 + b*(x+3) + c should equal 3x^2 + 7x + 4 for all x
# We match coefficients of powers of x to find possible (a, b, c) triples
# Since the functional equation holds for all x, coefficients of powers must match

# We solve the system:
# a*(x+3)^2 + b*(x+3) + c = 3x^2 + 7x + 4
# Expand left:
# a*(x^2 + 6x + 9) + b*x + 3b + c = 3x^2 + 7x + 4

# Equate coefficients:
# For x^2: a = 3
# For x: 6a + b = 7
# Constant: 9a + 3b + c = 4

# We can directly compute these:
possible_as = [3]  # from x^2 coefficient
for a in possible_as:
    b = 7 - 6 * a
    c = 4 - 9 * a - 3 * b
    print(f"a = {a}, b = {b}, c = {c}")
    answer = a + b + c
    print(f"Sum a + b + c = {answer}")
```
