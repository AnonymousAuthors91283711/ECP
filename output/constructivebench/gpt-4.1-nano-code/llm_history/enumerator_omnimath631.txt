This problem appears to involve a function \( a(i,j) \) defined over natural numbers, with a specific recurrence relation, and initial conditions. Our goal is to find \( a(128,1) \bmod 10 \). Since the value depends on a recurrence, the natural approach is to analyze the given conditions.

Given:
- \( a(1,j) = j^j \)
- \( a(i+1,j) = a(i,j) + a(i,j+1) \)
- want \( a(128,1) \bmod 10 \)

The recurrence suggests that increasing \( i \) adds a certain pattern. Let's try to compute the first few \( a(i,j) \) values modulo 10, then identify a pattern.

Note:
- \( a(1,j) = j^j \)
- Using the recurrence repeatedly, see if the pattern simplifies.

We will systematically compute \( a(i,j) \bmod 10 \) starting with \( i=1 \) up to some small values, then treat the recurrence to find \( a(128,1) \bmod 10 \).

```python
# Compute a(i,j) modulo 10 via the recurrence:
# a(1,j) = j^j % 10
# a(i+1,j) = a(i,j) + a(i,j+1) (mod 10)

# We will store values for i from 1 to 128 and j starting from 1
# But directly computing all would be large. Instead, look for pattern.
# Since the recurrence resembles a convolution, attempt to find the pattern for a small case.

# We can note that for i=1:
# a(1,j) = j^j mod 10

# Let's first generate the sequence for i=1, j=1..10
# and analyze how a(i,j) grows with i.

max_j = 10
# initial row (i=1)
row = [pow(j, j, 10) for j in range(1, max_j + 1)]

# For subsequent i
for i in range(2, 129):  # up to i=128
    new_row = []
    for j in range(max_j):
        val = (row[j] + (row[j+1] if j+1 < max_j else 0)) % 10
        new_row.append(val)
    row = new_row

# After looping, row[0] is a(128,1) mod 10
print("a(128,1) mod 10 =", row[0])
```
