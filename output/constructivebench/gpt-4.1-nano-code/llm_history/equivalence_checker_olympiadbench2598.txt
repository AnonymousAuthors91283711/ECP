Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: 1938
Since the problem is about finding Charlie's birth year given certain constraints, and the proposed answer is a specific year (1938), but we don't have the ground truth answer to compare against, we cannot determine equivalence. The problem appears to be a mathematical puzzle where we'd need to verify whether 1938 satisfies all given constraints, but without the ground truth or the ability to compute the solution, we can't make a determination.
