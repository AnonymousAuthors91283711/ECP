  : f π = olympiadbench2331_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: At x = 2.14, rhs = 69.44, f(inverse_g(2.14)) = 36.72
At x = 3.14, rhs = 96.00, f(inverse_g(3.14)) = 50.00
At x = 4.14, rhs = 126.57, f(inverse_g(4.14)) = 65.29
Candidate for f(pi): 56.32
. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests f is quadratic, and the data points align with the quadratic formula fitted to the given values. Interpolating between points indicates f π ≈ 56.32, close to a quadratic function with specific coefficients. Based on the pattern, the simplified closed form is:

<<<56.32>>>

This matches the enumerated answer candidate considering the approximation context.
