Let's understand the problem:

- `P(n) = n^2 + n + 1`.
- We look for a "fragrant" set `s` of natural numbers where, for each element `x` in `s`, `x` and the product of the other elements are *not* coprime.
- The sets `s` are formed from values of `P(k)` with `k` in some interval `[a, a + b]`.

The goal is to find the least `b` such that such a set exists for some `a`, and specify the number `b`.

To assist, we'll test small values of `a` and `b`, enumerate all possible sets `s` built from the interval `[a, a + b]`, check the `IsFragrant` property.

Here's a Python program that systematically searches for minimal `b` by testing small `a` and `b`. It reports-the smallest `b` for which the `IsFragrant` set exists.

```python
from itertools import combinations
import math

def P(n):
    return n * n + n + 1

def are_coprime(a, b):
    return math.gcd(a, b) == 1

def is_fragrant(s):
    # For each x in s, check that gcd of x and product of others > 1 (i.e., not coprime)
    for x in s:
        prod_others = 1
        for y in s:
            if y != x:
                prod_others *= y
        if math.gcd(x, prod_others) == 1:
            return False
    return True

# Search for minimal b
max_b = 20  # upper limit for b
for b in range(1, max_b + 1):
    found = False
    for a in range(1, 100):  # limit to a=100 to prevent long run
        interval = [a + k for k in range(b + 1)]
        # Generate all non-empty subsets
        for r in range(1, len(interval) + 1):
            for subset in combinations(interval, r):
                s = set(P(k) for k in subset)
                if is_fragrant(s):
                    print(f"Found fragrant set with a={a}, b={b}: {s}")
                    print(f"Minimal b = {b}")
                    found = True
                    break
            if found:
                break
        if found:
            break
    if found:
        break
```
