The pattern suggests the answer is \(2^{2001} \mod 127\). Since \(2^7 - 1 = 127\), and by Fermat's little theorem, \(2^{126} \equiv 1 \pmod{127}\). Reducing the exponent \(2001 \mod 126\) gives \(2001 \equiv 57 \pmod{126}\), so \(2^{2001} \equiv 2^{57} \pmod{127}\). Computing \(2^{57} \bmod 127\) yields 64.
