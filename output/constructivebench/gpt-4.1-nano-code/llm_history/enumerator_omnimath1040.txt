This problem asks to analyze all possible total scores achieved by answering 6 problems, each scored either 0, 1, or 7, and determine the total number of distinct possible scores.

We want to enumerate all potential sums s = ∑ x_i, where each x_i ∈ {0, 1, 7} for i = 1 to 6.

Since each problem's score can be 0, 1, or 7, the total score can range from 0 (all zeros) up to 6*7=42 (all sevens). We will generate all combinations accordingly and output the distinct sums.

Because the total number of combinations is small (3^6=729), we can brute-force all x_i assignments efficiently.

Here's the code:

```python
# Enumerate all possible total scores for 6 problems with scores from {0, 1, 7}
def main():
    possible_scores = set()
    # Iterate over all possible assignments using nested loops or Cartesian product
    for x1 in (0, 1, 7):
        for x2 in (0, 1, 7):
            for x3 in (0, 1, 7):
                for x4 in (0, 1, 7):
                    for x5 in (0, 1, 7):
                        for x6 in (0, 1, 7):
                            s = x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 + x6
                            # Print each sum immediately
                            print(s)
                            possible_scores.add(s)
    # Output total number of distinct possible scores
    print("Total distinct scores:", len(possible_scores))

main()
```
