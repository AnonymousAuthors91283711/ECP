n: 550. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The problem involves solving the system:
\[ 5m=12k \quad \text{and} \quad 11(m+50)=25(k+50). \]
From the first, \( m=\frac{12k}{5} \). Substituting into the second:
\[ 11\left(\frac{12k}{5}+50\right)=25(k+50) \]
which simplifies to find \(k\). The smallest positive integer solution satisfying both conditions is with \(k=500\)

Thus, the minimal \(n = k+50 = 550\).

. Enumerated Answers: k: 500
m: 1200
n: 550. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The goal is to define P2022AIMEII_1_answer as a ℕ that represents the minimal n satisfying the given conditions. The current candidate is `fun n : ℕ => 550`, which is a function mapping n to 550, leading to a type mismatch. Since the theorem states `IsLeast {n | ...} P2022AIMEII_1_answer`, P2022AIMEII_1_answer should be a specific natural number, not a function.

Given the enumerated answer indicates the minimal n is 550, and the commentary states the expected answer is ℕ := 550, the correct implementation should simply assign that number directly.

Therefore, the fixed answer expression should be:

<<<550>>>

This defines P2022AIMEII_1_answer as the numeral 550, matching the expected type ℕ.
