abbrev olympiadbench2315_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem olympiadbench2315 (n : ℝ) (h₁ : 0 ≤ n) (h₂ : n ≤ 100) :
    (10 * (1 + n/100) * 75 * (1 - n/100)) * (15 * (1 + n/100) * 75 * (1 - n/100)) = 345600
    ↔ n = olympiadbench2315_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Candidate n: 60, value: 345600.0000000002
Verification for n=60: 345600.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Since the value is constant at n=60 that satisfies the equation and the candidate n is 60, the closed-form answer is this specific point. The pattern suggests n = 60. 

Final answer: <<<60>>>
