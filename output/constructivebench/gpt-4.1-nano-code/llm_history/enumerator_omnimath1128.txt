This problem involves counting the number of functions `f : Fin 15 â†’ Bool` such that:

- Exactly 6 inputs map to `true`.
- For every `x` where `f x = false`, at least one neighbor `(x+1) % 15` or `(x-1) % 15` maps to `true`.

We need to enumerate all such functions satisfying these conditions, then count their number.

The core challenge: these are equivalent to arrangements of `true` and `false` on a circle of length 15, with exactly 6 `true`s, where each `false` is adjacent to at least one `true`. We will generate all subsets of size 6, verify the neighbor condition, and count valid functions.

Here is the Python code that enumerates all such functions.

```python
from itertools import combinations

# Total number of elements
N = 15
# Number of true values required
K = 6

def is_valid_mask(mask):
    # For each position where f(x) = false, check neighbors
    for x in range(N):
        if not (mask & (1 << x)):
            left = (x - 1) % N
            right = (x + 1) % N
            # Check if at least one neighbor is true
            if not ((mask & (1 << left)) or (mask & (1 << right))):
                return False
    return True

valid_counts = 0
for comb in combinations(range(N), K):
    # Construct bitmask for selected positions
    mask = 0
    for x in comb:
        mask |= 1 << x
    if is_valid_mask(mask):
        valid_counts += 1
        # Print the function as a list of booleans
        answer = [False] * N
        for x in comb:
            answer[x] = True
        print(answer)

print("Total valid functions:", valid_counts)
```
