The problem involves finding pairs (A, B) of natural numbers where B = A + 1, and such that the expressions involving A and B satisfy an equality: \( B^2 + 2B + 3 = A^2 + 2A + 3 \). Since \( B = A + 1 \), we can substitute B into the equation, simplify, and find all pairs satisfying the conditions. We need to identify the minimal sum \( s = A + B \) where this holds.

We will:
- Fix small values of A (since the problem is algebraic and quadratic, small A are likely candidates).
- For each candidate A, evaluate B = A +1.
- Check if the equality holds.
- Keep track of the sums and determine the minimal one where the equality is true.

Here's the program:

```python
# Since B = A + 1, substitute into the expressions:
# lhs = B^2 + 2B + 3
# rhs = A^2 + 2A + 3
# Check if lhs = rhs
# We iterate over small non-negative integers A to find minimal sum A + B.

max_A = 100  # small sample limit
answers = []

for A in range(max_A + 1):
    B = A + 1
    lhs = B * B + 2 * B + 3
    rhs = A * A + 2 * A + 3
    if lhs == rhs:
        s = A + B
        print(f"Found solution: A={A}, B={B}, sum={s}")
        answers.append(s)

if answers:
    min_sum = min(answers)
    # Output the minimal sum as the key answer
    print(f"Minimal sum s = {min_sum}")
else:
    print("No solutions found within range.")
```
