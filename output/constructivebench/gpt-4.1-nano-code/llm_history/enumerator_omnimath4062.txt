The problem essentially asks for the set of all integers \( n \geq 2 \) such that a certain combinatorial property holds. Specifically, for each such \( n \), the theorem considers a finite set \( s \subset \mathbb{Z} \) of size \( n \), with injective mapping \( s \to \mathbb{Z} \), and a sum condition modulo \( n \). The equivalence involves the existence of an injective function from \( \{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\} \) into \( s \) satisfying a certain sum condition modulo \( n \).

To understand this problem, note:
- It involves combinatorics (finite sets, injective functions).
- Modular arithmetic (sums modulo \( n \)).
- The statement is symmetric enough that small values of \( n \) might reveal patterns.

Our goal:
- Enumerate candidate values of \( n \) starting from 2 upwards.
- For each \( n \), determine whether the property holds or not.
- Output all \( n \) satisfying the property.

Because the theorem's structure suggests the property might hold or not depending on divisibility properties or specific configurations, and to keep things simple and efficient, we can:
- Fix small sample sets \( s \).
- Construct injective functions \( f \).
- Check the sum condition.

Since the theorem is full of variables and universal quantifiers, our enumeration will be heuristic to identify candidate \( n \)s for which the equivalence might hold.

```python
# Enumerate n from 2 to an upper bound
# For each n, attempt to verify the property by testing small sets s and functions f
# We focus on the key sum modulo n condition
# We use small sample sets (e.g., s as consecutive integers) and injective functions

max_n = 20  # upper bound for enumeration
answers = []

for n in range(2, max_n+1):
    property_holds = False
    # Generate a small set s of size n, e.g., s = {0, 1, ..., n-1}
    s = list(range(n))
    # Generate all injective functions from [0, n-1] to s
    from itertools import permutations
    is_satisfied = False
    for perm in permutations(s):
        # Define f as the permutation
        f = list(perm)
        # Compute sum of i+1 times f(i)
        total = sum((i+1) * f[i] for i in range(n))
        if total % n == 0:
            is_satisfied = True
            break
    # If for this s and some f the sum condition is satisfied, store n
    if is_satisfied:
        answers.append(n)
        print(n)
```
