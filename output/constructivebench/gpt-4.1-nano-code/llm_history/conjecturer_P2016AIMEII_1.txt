. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The current proposed answer `(fun p => p * (p + 1) * 2)` is a function, not a specific natural number. The problem asks for a specific answer, which, based on the enumeration, is `P = 12`. 

To fix this, we should define `P2016AIMEII_1_answer` as that concrete number, i.e., `12`. The additional parameters `r, b, c, d` are variables introduced in the theorem and are derived from this answer but are not part of the definition of `P2016AIMEII_1_answer`.

Below is the corrected answer:

<<<12>>>
