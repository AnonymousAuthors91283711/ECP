. Enumerated answers: n=7: 6 and 28 are perfect. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the hints and pattern, perfect numbers are 6 and 28. The answer is the maximum perfect number less than or equal to n, which corresponds to 28 in this context. Final Lean expression:

<<<28>>>

This aligns with the enumeration and the known perfect numbers.
