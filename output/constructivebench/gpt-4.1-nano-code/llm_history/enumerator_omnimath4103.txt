This problem appears to ask us to find the set `omnimath4103_answer` of polynomials over ℝ satisfying a specific condition involving all real numbers a, b, c with the relation a * b + b * c + c * a = 0.

To assist with this, I will:
- Select small sample values for a, b, c satisfying the relation.
- Explore candidate polynomials, especially low degrees.
- Check the condition for these candidates.
- Stream solutions matching the condition, aiming to find all such polynomials.

Below is an enumeration approach that:
- Tests polynomials of degree ≤ 2 with small coefficients.
- For each polynomial, tests multiple sample triples satisfying a * b + b * c + c * a = 0.
- Streams candidate solutions that meet the condition.

```python
import numpy as np

# Define the polynomial class
class Polynomial:
    def __init__(self, coeffs):
        self.coeffs = coeffs  # list of coefficients, constant first
    def eval(self, x):
        return sum(c * x**i for i, c in enumerate(self.coeffs))
    def degree(self):
        return len(self.coeffs) - 1

# Generate sample (a, b, c) satisfying a*b + b*c + c*a = 0
def generate_samples():
    samples = []
    # Try small integers for a, b, c
    for a in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
        for b in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
            if a == 0 and b == 0:
                c_list = [0, 1, -1]
            else:
                # Solve for c: a*b + b*c + c*a=0 => c(b + a) = -a*b
                denom = b + a
                if denom != 0:
                    c = -a*b / denom
                    if abs(c) <= 2:
                        c_list = [c]
                    else:
                        continue
                else:
                    # When b + a=0, then a*b=0, c arbitrary
                    c_list = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]
            for c in c_list:
                if abs(c) <= 2:
                    samples.append((a, b, c))
    return samples

samples = generate_samples()

# Candidate polynomials up to degree 2 with small coefficients
candidate_coeffs = []
for c0 in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
    for c1 in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
        for c2 in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
            # Limit degrees to 0,1,2
            coeffs = [c0]
            if c1 != 0:
                coeffs.append(c1)
            if c2 != 0:
                coeffs.append(c2)
            candidate_coeffs.append(coeffs)

# Stream candidates satisfying the condition
for coeffs in candidate_coeffs:
    P = Polynomial(coeffs)
    valid = True
    for (a, b, c) in samples:
        # Check the condition for each sample
        left = P.eval(a - b) + P.eval(b - c) + P.eval(c - a)
        right = 2 * P.eval(a + b + c)
        if abs(left - right) > 1e-8:
            valid = False
            break
    if valid:
        print(f"Candidate polynomial: {coeffs} satisfies the condition.")
