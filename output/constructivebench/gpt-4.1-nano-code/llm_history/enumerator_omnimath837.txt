This problem involves finding the least value of a sum involving a function f: ℤ → ℤ satisfying several properties, including a functional equation, positivity, and a product being a perfect square. To explore solutions, we should attempt small sample functions that meet the constraints, especially focusing on the functional equation and the positivity condition.

We will:
- Test simple candidate functions (e.g., linear functions like f(n) = n, constant functions, or small polynomial forms).
- Verify if they satisfy the functional equation.
- Check the positivity condition.
- Find the value of s = f(1) + f(2).
- Conclude the minimal such s over these candidates.

Because we cannot "solve" the entire problem symbolically easily here, we will implement a brute-force enumeration over small candidate functions or parameters, directly testing for solutions that respect the equation and conditions, and recording their s.

This enumeration helps us conjecture the smallest s and can guide a formal proof later.

```python
# We explore simple candidate functions f(n) = a * n + b with small integer coefficients
# to satisfy the functional equation for some small set of n, and positivity.
# We also check the product condition for some small k and f(2015)*f(2016) = k^2.

# Because the functional equation involves quadratic forms, start with linear functions
# and test; more complex functions could be added if needed.

def check_solution(a, b):
    # Check the functional equation for a few small integer values
    # The functional equation:
    # f(x^2 - 3 y^2) + f(x^2 + y^2) = 2 (x + y) f(x - y)
    # for example for x,y in small ranges.
    for x in range(-3, 4):
        for y in range(-3, 4):
            f_val1 = a * (x**2 - 3 * y**2) + b
            f_val2 = a * (x**2 + y**2) + b
            lhs = f_val1 + f_val2
            rhs = 2 * (x + y) * (a * (x - y) + b)
            if lhs != rhs:
                return False
    # Check positivity for positive n
    for n in range(1, 10):
        v = a * n + b
        if v <= 0:
            return False

    # Try small integer k to see if f(2015)*f(2016) = k^2
    f2015 = a * 2015 + b
    f2016 = a * 2016 + b
    product = f2015 * f2016
