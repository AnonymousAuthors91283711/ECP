. Enumerated answers: At x=-1, Q(x)=2, and P(2)=2. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The key points: Q is x² + 2x + 3, and P satisfies P(Q(x)) equals a degree 6 polynomial. Substitute x = -1: Q(-1) = 2, and P(2) = evaluate at x=-1. P evaluated at 2 matches the polynomial's value at 2, which should be easily computed. The pattern suggests P(2) = 2.

To produce a correct, compile-able answer in Lean, I need to evaluate P at 2, given the polynomial composition and the specifics of Q. The key insight is that at x = -1, Q(-1)=(-1)^2 + 2*(-1)+3 = 1 - 2 + 3= 2. We are told P(Q(x)) equals a polynomial evaluated at x, specifically P(Q(x)) = x^6 + 6x^5 + 18x^4 + 32x^3 + 35x^2 + 22x + 8. Therefore, evaluating this at x= -1 yields P(2) = (-1)^6 + 6*(-1)^5 + 18*(-1)^4 + 32*(-1)^3 + 35*(-1)^2 + 22*(-1) + 8. Computing:

(-1)^6 = 1
6 * (-1)^5= 6 * (-1) = -6
18 * (-1)^4= 18 * 1= 18
32 * (-1)^3= 32 * (-1)= -32
35 * (-1)^2= 35 * 1= 35
22 * (-1)= -22
Adding 8: total sum= 1 - 6 + 18 - 32 + 35 - 22 + 8 = (-5 + 18 - 32 + 35 - 22 + 8) = 13 - 32 + 35 - 22 + 8= (-19 + 35 - 22 + 8)= 16 - 22 + 8= -6 + 8= 2.

Thus, P(2) = 2, so the answer is 2. 

In Lean, I will define the explicit answer as 2, which is a real number (ℝ), and ensure that we resolve the parse errors by removing extraneous comments and properly defining the abbreviation.

This answer is consistent with the algebraic evaluation and the pattern observed in the polynomial.
