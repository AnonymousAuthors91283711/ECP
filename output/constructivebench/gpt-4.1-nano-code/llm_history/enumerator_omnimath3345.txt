The problem appears to involve a complex nested product of rational expressions over finite sets, with the goal of discovering the form of `omnimath3345_answer` and possibly simplifies it. Due to its high complexity, we will analyze small sample values, test specific inputs, and attempt to identify a pattern through enumeration.

Since the original environment involves Leagues of formal proofs and advanced mathlib usage, but the task here is to generate a Python enumeration to conjecture the answer, I will focus on the core numerical behavior.

Approach:
- Select small fixed `x` values (e.g., `x=1`, `x=-1`, `x=0.5`, `x=2`).
- For each `x`, compute the nested products over small ranges (e.g., `range(3)`) to get an approximate value.
- Print these results to identify potential pattern or simple formulas (e.g., constant, linear, exponential).
- The code will run quickly, providing insight for the conjecture.

Because the original formula involves division, guard against division by zero.

```python
# Explore the nested product for small ranges and sample x values
import math

def nested_product(x, limit=3):
    total = 1.0
    for m in range(limit):
        for n in range(limit):
            numerator = x**(n + m) + x**(n + m + 2) + x**(2 * n + 1) + x**(2 * m + 1)
            denominator = x**(2 * n) + 2 * x**(n + m) + x**(2 * m)
            if denominator == 0:
                # Skip or handle zero denominator
                continue
            total *= numerator / denominator
    return total

sample_xs = [1, -1, 0.5, 2]
for x in sample_xs:
    result = nested_product(x)
    print(f"x = {x}, nested product â‰ˆ {result}")
```
