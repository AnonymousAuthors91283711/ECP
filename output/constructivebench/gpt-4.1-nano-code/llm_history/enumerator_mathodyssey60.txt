The problem is a typical Fibonacci-like sequence with initial conditions, and an equation involving terms of the sequence. We need to find all positive integer pairs (p.1, p.2) satisfying 5 * F p.1 - 3 * F p.2 = 1, and count them. Since F is the standard Fibonacci sequence with F(1)=1, F(2)=1, and F(n+1)=F(n)+F(n-1).

We'll enumerate small pairs (p.1, p.2), compute F(p.1), F(p.2), check the condition, and record how many such pairs satisfy it. As the Fibonacci numbers grow rapidly, we'll limit p.1 and p.2 to a manageable total, say up to 30, to ensure efficiency.

```python
# Generate Fibonacci numbers up to max_n
def generate_fibonacci(max_n):
    fib = [0, 1, 1]
    for i in range(3, max_n + 1):
        fib.append(fib[i-1] + fib[i-2])
    return fib

# Enumerate pairs and check the equation
max_n = 30  # sample limit for Fibonacci indices
fib = generate_fibonacci(max_n)

answers = []
for p1 in range(1, max_n + 1):
    for p2 in range(1, max_n + 1):
        if 5 * fib[p1] - 3 * fib[p2] == 1:
            answers.append((p1, p2))
            print(f"Answer pair: (p.1={p1}, p.2={p2}), F(p.1)={fib[p1]}, F(p.2)={fib[p2]}")
mathodyssey_answer = len(answers)
print(f"Total solutions found: {mathodyssey_answer}")
```
