The problem involves finding triples \((x, y, z) \in \mathbb{R}^3\) satisfying the system:

\[
\begin{cases}
x^2 y + y^2 z = 1040 \\
x^2 z + z^2 y = 260 \\
(x - y)(y - z)(z - x) = -540
\end{cases}
\]

The third equation suggests the variables are distinct (since the product is non-zero).

Approach:
- We choose small integer sample values for \(x, y, z\).
- For each candidate, check if the equations approximately hold.
- Since the equations involve quadratic terms, expect solutions in some small range.

Given the complexity, we'll iterate over small ranges for \(x, y, z\) (e.g., -20 to 20), check the equations, and output solutions that satisfy both equations within a small tolerance.

```python
# Enumerate small integer triples and check the system approximately
import math

def check_system(x, y, z, tol=1e-3):
    eq1 = abs(x**2 * y + y**2 * z - 1040)
    eq2 = abs(x**2 * z + z**2 * y - 260)
    eq3 = (x - y) * (y - z) * (z - x) + 540  # since we want product = -540
    if eq1 < tol and eq2 < tol and abs(eq3) < tol:
        print((x, y, z))
        return True
    return False

# Search over possible small integer ranges
for x in range(-20, 21):
    for y in range(-20, 21):
        for z in range(-20, 21):
            check_system(x, y, z)
```
