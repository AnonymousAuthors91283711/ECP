. Enumerated answers: 0. Expected Answer Type: ℤ
The pattern suggests the sum x + y + z, balancing the cubic form with coefficients. Due to symmetry and the structure of the equation, the greatest sum achieved when the cubic terms cancel with equal and opposite contributions is 0, considering all integer solutions. 

Thus, the maximum sum s possible is 0.
