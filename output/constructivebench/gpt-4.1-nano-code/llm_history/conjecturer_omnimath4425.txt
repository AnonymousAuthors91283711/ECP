theorem omnimath4425 : 
  (∃ a b, 0 < a ∧ 0 < b ∧ a ≠ b ∧ 
    Infinite {n | 0 < n ∧ (a^n + b^n) ∣ (a^(n+1) + b^(n+1))}) ↔ omnimath4425_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Pair (a=2, b=6), n=1 -> divisible
Pair (a=3, b=6), n=1 -> divisible
Pair (a=5, b=10), n=2 -> divisible. Expected Answer Type: Prop
The pattern suggests pairs with specific ratios, such as (2,6), (3,6), (5,10), which relate to multiples and their divisibility properties. The divisibility condition involves powers of a and b, indicating that for each pair, the ratio a/b may govern infinite divisibility at certain n.

Given the pattern, a generalized statement is: for all pairs (a,b) with a dividing b and a factorization pattern that produces divisibility at specific n. Alternatively, the existing examples indicate that such pairs are of the form where a divides b and related to powers.

Thus, a concise, closed-form existential statement is: there exists positive a,b with a dividing b, forming pairs like (k, 2k ) for k > 0, where divisibility at some n occurs infinitely often.

Final formula: 

<<<∃ a b : ℕ, a > 0 ∧ b > 0 ∧ b = 2 * a>>>
