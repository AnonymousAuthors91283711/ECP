theorem olympiadbench2084 (f : ℕ → ℕ) :
  (∀ x y, x < f y + f (y + f x - 1) ∧ f y < x + f (y + f x - 1) ∧ f (y + f x - 1) < x + f y) ↔ f = olympiadbench2084_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Error: Program is empty. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
The pattern suggests the pattern involves linear functions, possibly suggesting f(n) = n or a similar linear form. Given the symmetry and inequalities, the consistent solution aligns with f(n) = n.
