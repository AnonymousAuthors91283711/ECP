Ground Truth Answer: 0
Proposed Answer: 3
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about counting the number of positive integers c that satisfy a certain quadratic condition involving a very large prime p (specifically, a Mersenne prime 2²⁴⁰³⁶⁵⁸³ - 1).

2. The condition requires that for all combinations of s₁ and s₂ being ±1, there exists a rational root r to the quadratic equation r² + s₁*p*r + s₂*c = 0.

3. For a quadratic equation x² + bx + c = 0 to have rational roots, the discriminant b² - 4c must be a perfect square and the roots must be rational.

4. Given that p is an extremely large prime, it's highly unlikely that any small c would satisfy all four combinations of (±1, ±1) to produce perfect square discriminants.

5. The ground truth answer is 0, suggesting no such c exists that satisfies all four conditions simultaneously.

6. The proposed answer is 3, which contradicts the ground truth.

Given that p is prime and very large, and considering the constraints on the discriminants for all four cases, the ground truth answer of 0 appears correct while the proposed answer of 3 seems incorrect.
