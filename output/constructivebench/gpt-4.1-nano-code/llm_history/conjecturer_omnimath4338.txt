abbrev omnimath4338_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath4338 (n : ℕ) :
  (∀ (a b : Fin n → ℝ), (∀ k, |a k| + |b k| = 1) → 
    ∃ (ε : Fin n → ℝ), (∀ k, ε k = -1 ∨ ε k = 1) ∧ 
    |∑ i, ε i * a i| + |∑ i, ε i * b i| ≤ 1) ↔ n ∈ omnimath4338_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Answer set for n where property likely holds: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
