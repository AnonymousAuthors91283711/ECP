Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (n - 1) * (-1) + (if n % 2 = 0 then 0 else (-1)^((n - 1) / 2))
Proposed Answer: fun n => 2 * (n - 1)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes two sequences a(n) and g(n) with specific recurrence relations and initial conditions. The solution needs to satisfy all given constraints.

2. Ground Truth Answer:
   - a(n) = (n-1)*(-1) (linear sequence)
   - g(n) = if n%2=0 then 0 else (-1)^((n-1)/2) (alternating pattern)
   - This satisfies all given conditions when combined

3. Proposed Answer:
   - Only provides a linear term 2*(n-1)
   - Doesn't account for the alternating pattern needed in g(n)
   - Doesn't satisfy the given conditions (e.g., a(3)+g(3)=1 would require 4 + g(3)=1, but g(3) would need to be -3, which isn't consistent with the recurrence)

The proposed answer is completely different from the ground truth and doesn't satisfy the problem's conditions.
