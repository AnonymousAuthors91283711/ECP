The problem appears to involve characterizing real numbers α such that for each positive integer n, the integer n divides the sum of floors: sum_{i=0}^{n-1} ⌊(i+1) * α⌋. To explore solutions, we can:

- Fix small values of α, e.g., rational numbers with small numerator/denominator.
- For each candidate, check whether the divisibility condition holds for n up to some small limit.
- If it always holds, include that α in the set.
- Since the set might involve rationals with specific properties, we test some rational candidates systematically.

To do this efficiently, we generate candidate α values as rationals with small numerator and denominator, evaluate the sum over n up to a limit (say 10), and check divisibility. Upon finding such α, we output immediately to stream potential solutions.

```python
# Enumerate small rational numbers and check the divisibility condition for n up to 10
# Store and print solutions as we find them.

from math import gcd
from itertools import product

def check_condition(alpha, limit=10):
    for n in range(1, limit + 1):
        total = 0
        for i in range(n):
            total += int((i + 1) * alpha)
        if total % n != 0:
            return False
    return True

solutions = set()

# Limit numerator and denominator to small integers for enumeration
max_num = 5
max_den = 5

for num, den in product(range(1, max_num + 1), range(1, max_den + 1)):
    # Simplify fraction
    g = gcd(num, den)
    num_simpl = num // g
    den_simpl = den // g
    alpha = num_simpl / den_simpl
    if alpha not in solutions:
        if check_condition(alpha, limit=10):
            solutions.add(alpha)
            print(f"Found potential solution α = {alpha:.3f}")
```
