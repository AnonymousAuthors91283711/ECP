The problem involves the variables \(x, y, z, T\) with given relationships, and asks us to find the value of \(x + z\). Based on the given equations:
- \( T = \frac{1}{40} \)
- \( x + y = 5 \)
- \( x^2 - y^2 = \frac{1}{T} \) (which simplifies to \(40\))
- \( x - z = -7 \)

Our goal is to find \(x + z\).

Step-by-step reasoning:
- From \(x + y = 5\): \( y = 5 - x \).
- Substitute into \( x^2 - y^2 = 40 \):
  \[
  x^2 - (5 - x)^2 = 40
  \]
- Expand:
  \[
  x^2 - [25 - 10x + x^2] = 40
  \]
- Simplify:
  \[
  x^2 - 25 + 10x - x^2 = 40
  \]
  \[
  10x - 25 = 40
  \]
- Solve for \(x\):
  \[
  10x = 65
  \]
  \[
  x = 6.5
  \]
- Find \(y\):
  \[
  y = 5 - 6.5 = -1.5
  \]
- Using \( x - z = -7 \), find \(z\):
  \[
  z = x + 7 = 6.5 + 7 = 13.5
  \]
- Finally, compute \( x + z \):
  \[
  6.5 + 13.5 = 20
  \]
