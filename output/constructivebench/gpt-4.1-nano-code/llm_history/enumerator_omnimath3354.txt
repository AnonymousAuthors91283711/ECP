This problem involves summing powers of the imaginary unit over a finite interval, likely related to geometric series. To assist in conjecturing the sum, we will explicitly compute the sum for i from 0 to 2009 of (i^th power of i), focusing on the cases where i mod 4, because powers of i cycle every 4 steps: i^0=1, i^1=i, i^2=-1, i^3=-i, then repeats.

The cumulative sum is then:

sum_{i=0}^{n} i^k, with i mod 4 determining i^k.

We will generate partial sums for small sample, then extend to 2009 using the pattern, listing partial results, to help conjecture for the sum.

```python
# Enumerate sums of complex powers over the interval 0..N, focusing on powers of i
# i mod 4 determines i^i: 
# i mod 4 = 0 -> 1
# i mod 4 = 1 -> i
# i mod 4 = 2 -> -1
# i mod 4 = 3 -> -i

# Since exponent is i, not just i mod 4, powers are: (i)^i
# For small i, compute i^i directly, noting i-th power of i:

import cmath

def complex_power(i):
    return cmath.exp(cmath.log(i) * i)

def sum_complex_powers(N):
    total = 0 + 0j
    for i in range(N + 1):
        power = complex_power(i)
        total += power
        print(f"Sum up to {i}: {total}")
    return total

# Compute for small N to observe pattern, then for N=2009
# For demonstration, compute N=10
sum_complex_powers(10)

# For larger N, assuming the pattern repeats every 4 terms
# Could generate an approximate total for N=2009
# But actual implementation for 2009 would require either direct computation or pattern analysis
```
[refine_program]
The analysis indicates that the provided program computes and prints partial sums of i^i for small N (up to 10), but it does not compute the sum for N=2009 as specified. Also, the output is only print statements, and the code does not return or print the final sum for N=2009, nor does it produce a single answer suitable for the theorem statement.

Since the problem involves summing i^i over the range 0..2009, and the code does not do this directly nor produces an answer, the output is empty or incomplete. Moreover, the code focuses on small N and comments about patterns, but it does not provide the final sum or the answer.

Therefore, the code as-is does not satisfy the requirements and should be rejected. An accurate solution should compute the sum for N=2009 and print the result immediately, focusing on correctness and the immediate output per the program requirements.

<<<False>>>

Below is a corrected Python program that computes the sum of i^i for i=0 to 2009, quickly and efficiently, printing the result immediately:

```python
import cmath

def complex_power(i):
    # Handle i=0 separately to avoid math domain errors
    if i == 0:
        return 1
    return cmath.exp(cmath.log(i) * i)

def main():
    total = 0 + 0j
    N = 2009
    for i in range(N + 1):
        power = complex_power(i)
        total += power
    # Immediately print the final sum
    print(total)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The problem in the provided code is that the function `complex_power(i)` is improperly implementing exponentiation for the imaginary unit \(i\). Specifically, it takes `cmath.log(i)` where `i` is an integer, leading to errors: 

- `cmath.log(0)` is undefined (logarithm of zero is not defined).
- For `i=1`, `cmath.log(1)` is 0, so `cmath.exp(0 * 1) = 1`, which is correct.
- For other integers, the code does not correctly compute \(i^i\). It interprets `i` as a number rather than the imaginary unit (which should be \( \mathbb{j} \) in Python). 

The goal is to compute:

\[
\sum_{i=0}^{2009} (\mathbb{j})^{i}
\]

where \(\mathbb{j} = \sqrt{-1}\). This sum involves powers of \(i\):

- When \(i = 0\), \((\mathbb{j})^0 = 1\).
- When \(i = 1\), \(\mathbb{j}^1 = \mathbb{j}\).
- When \(i \ge 2\), powers cycle every 4, because \(\mathbb{j}^4 = 1\).

Sequence:

\[
\mathbb{j}^0=1,\quad
\mathbb{j}^1=\mathbb{j},\quad
\mathbb{j}^2=-1,\quad
\mathbb{j}^3=-\mathbb{j},\quad
\mathbb{j}^4=1,\quad \text{then repeats}
\]

Sum over the 4-term cycle:

\[
1 + \mathbb{j} + (-1) + (-\mathbb{j}) = 0
\]

Total sum from \(i=0\) to 2009:

- There are 2010 terms.
- Number of full cycles: \(2010 // 4 = 502\) (since \(4 \times 502 = 2008\))
- Remaining terms: \(2010 - 4 \times 502 = 2\)

Sum of full cycles: \(502 \times 0 = 0\)

Remaining terms are \(i
