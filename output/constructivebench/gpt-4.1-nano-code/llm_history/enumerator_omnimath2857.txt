This problem involves solving for pairs (x, y) of non-negative integers satisfying the equation:

\[5 x^2 - 4 x y + 2 x + y^2 = 624,\]

with constraints \(0 \leq x \leq y\).

Our goal is to find the total number of solutions \((x, y)\), i.e., the size of the set, and possibly enumerate solutions to help conjecture or verify the count.

Approach:
- Choose small bounds for \(x\), since \(x\) appears quadratically.
- For each \(x\), solve for \(y\):
  
  \(5 x^2 + 2 x + y^2 - 4 x y = 624\),
  
  which can be viewed as a quadratic in \(y\):
  
  \(y^2 - 4 x y + (5 x^2 + 2 x - 624) = 0\).

- For each \(x\), check if the discriminant of this quadratic in \(y\):

  \(\Delta = (4 x)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (5 x^2 + 2 x - 624)\)

  is a perfect square, and if so, find corresponding integral \(y\).

- Enforce \(y \geq x \geq 0\).

Here's the enumerator:

```python
import math

solutions = []

# Bounding x: since y >= x >= 0, and y^2 <= total, estimate x max.
# Let's choose x up to about 50 for a safe margin.
for x in range(0, 51):
    # Quadratic in y: y^2 - 4x y + (5x^2 + 2x - 624) = 0
    a = 1
    b = -4 * x
    c = 5 * x * x + 2 * x - 624
    discriminant = b * b - 4 * a * c
    if discriminant < 0:
        continue
    sqrt_disc = int(math.isqrt(discriminant))
    if sqrt_disc * sqrt_disc != discriminant:
        continue
    # Two solutions for y:
    for sign in [1, -1]:
        y_num = -b + sign * sqrt_disc
        if y_num % (2 * a) != 0:
            continue
        y = y_num // (2 * a)
        if y < 0:
            continue
        if y >= x:
            solutions.append((x, y))
            print(f"Solution: x={x}, y={y}")

print(f"Total solutions: {len(solutions)}")
```
