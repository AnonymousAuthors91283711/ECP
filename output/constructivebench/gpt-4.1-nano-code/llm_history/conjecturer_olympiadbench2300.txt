Given the geometric progression with common ratio r and the arithmetic sequence with difference d, the algebraic relations imply that a 4 and a k are multiples of a 1 with ratios s and s^((k-1)/3), respectively, only when k ≡ 4 mod 3. Thus, the set of valid k is those congruent to 4 mod 3; i.e., all positive integers where k mod 3 = 1, starting from 4 and above. 

Answer:
<<<{ k : ℕ | k ≥ 4 ∧ k % 3 = 1 }>>>
