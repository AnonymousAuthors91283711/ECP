The problem appears to be related to the Fibonacci sequence, with a focus on the minimal size of sets that contain differences equal to Fibonacci numbers. The sequence defined by F satisfies the recurrence of Fibonacci, with initial conditions F(0)=0, F(1)=1.

The core question: For each n â‰¥ 2, determine the minimal size of a set S of integers such that, for every k in [2, n], there exist two elements in S differing by F(k).

Approach:
- For small n, explicitly construct candidate sets S.
- For each n, enumerate sets up to a certain size, check the difference conditions.
- Use the minimal size found and print it.
- Justify through enumeration, not relying on known closed-forms.

The code will:
- For given n, attempt to find the smallest set S satisfying the difference property by trying set sizes from 2 upwards.
- For computational efficiency, generate candidate sets with small sizes first.
- For each candidate, verify all Fibonacci differences up to n.

```python
import itertools

def fibonacci(k):
    # Generate Fibonacci number recursively or iteratively
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(k):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a

def can_represent_all_fib_differences(S, n):
    # Check if for all k in [2, n], exists x,y in S with x - y = F(k) or y - x = F(k)
    for k in range(2, n + 1):
        target = fibonacci(k)
        found = False
        for x in S:
            if x + target in S or x - target in S:
                found = True
                break
        if not found:
            return False
    return True

def find_min_set(n, max_size=10):
    # For sizes from 2 to max_size, generate subsets and check
    # Use small candidate sets to limit runtime
    for size in range(2, max_size + 1):
        for S in itertools.combinations(range(-100, 101), size):
            S_set = set(S)
            if can_represent_all_fib_differences(S_set, n):
                print(f"n={n}, minimal size={size}, set={S_set}")
                return size
    print(f"n={n}, no set found up to size {max_size}")
    return None

def main():
    # Test for n from 2 to 5 (small values)
    for n in range(2, 6):
        find_min_set(n, max_size=8)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
