The problem involves solving a system of two equations in real numbers:

1. \( x^2 + 3xy + y^2 = 909 \)
2. \( 3x^2 + xy + 3y^2 = 1287 \)

We need to find the value of \( x + y \). To do this, we'll examine possible sums \( S = x + y \) and verify the equations for candidate values. Since the problem is high school level, we can test small integer values around approximate solutions to find consistent solutions.

Approach:
- Fix small sample values for \( x + y = S \).
- Express the quadratic relations in terms of \( S \) and possibly \( xy \).
- For each candidate \( S \), find possible \( xy \) that satisfy both equations, verifying the system.
- Output the sum \( x + y \) when solutions are found.

Let's implement an enumeration for \( S \) in a reasonable range based on the approximate size of the variables, with bounds for efficiency.

```python
# Enumerate possible sums S = x + y in a small range
# For each S, try possible y and compute x = S - y
# then verify the equations.

import math

def check_solution(x, y):
    eq1 = x**2 + 3*x*y + y**2
    eq2 = 3*x**2 + x*y + 3*y**2
    return math.isclose(eq1, 909, rel_tol=1e-9) and math.isclose(eq2, 1287, rel_tol=1e-9)

# Search bounds based on approximate sizes
for S in range(-40, 41):  # sum from -40 to 40
    for y in range(-40, 41):
        x = S - y
        if check_solution(x, y):
            print(f"Solution found with x + y = {S}")
```
