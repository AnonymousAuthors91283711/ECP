theorem omnimath796 : 
  Nat.card {x : ℝ | abs (abs (abs (abs x - 2) - 2) - 2) = abs (abs (abs (abs x - 3) - 3) - 3)} = omnimath796_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: x = -4.5
x = 4.5. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests the values where the expressions inside absolute values simplify to equal constants. Given the enumeration, the key points are symmetric about 0 and relate to the constants 2 and 3, with ±4.5 appearing as solutions. Since the set of solutions includes only those points, and the count for each is 1, the total cardinality is 2.  
Thus, the answer is 2.  
<<<2>>>
