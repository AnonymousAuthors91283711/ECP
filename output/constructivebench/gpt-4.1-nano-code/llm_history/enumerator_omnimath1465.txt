This problem involves analyzing a polynomial \( p(x) \) with roots related to \(\tan y\), \(\tan 2y\), and \(\tan 3y\), where \( y \) is some real number. Since \(\tan y\), \(\tan 2y\), \(\tan 3y\) are related trigonometrically, the key is to find conditions on \(a, b, c\) such that \( p(x) \) has these roots, and that the polynomial's coefficients satisfy the specified properties.

Given the roots are \(\tan y\), \(\tan 2y\), \(\tan 3y\), and the polynomial is degree 3 with leading coefficient 1, the polynomial must be:
\[
p(x) = (x - r_1)(x - r_2)(x - r_3)
\]
and the roots satisfy certain identities because \(\tan 2y = \frac{2 \tan y}{1 - \tan^2 y}\),
\(\tan 3y = \frac{3 \tan y - \tan^3 y}{1 - 3 \tan^2 y}\).

The coefficients relate to the roots via Vi√®te's formulas:
\[
a = - (r_1 + r_2 + r_3), \quad
b = r_1 r_2 + r_2 r_3 + r_3 r_1, \quad
c = - r_1 r_2 r_3.
\]

Since \(\tan y = t\), then:
\[
r_1 = t, \quad r_2 = \frac{2t}{1 - t^2}, \quad r_3 = \frac{3t - t^3}{1 - 3 t^2}.
\]

For small sample values of \( t \): choose \( t \) in integer/rational range to find corresponding \( a, b, c \).

Let's pick small rational values \( t \in \{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2\} \) to generate candidate coefficients.

The program will:
- For each \( t \),
- compute roots \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \),
- compute \( a, b, c \),
- print these triplets as potential solutions.

```python
# Enumerate small rational t values to find candidate polynomial coefficients
# Roots are based on tangent relations
t_values = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]
for t in t_values:
    # Avoid division by zero in roots
    if abs(1 - t**2) < 1e-8 or abs(1 - 3 * t**2) < 1e-8:
        continue
    r1 = t
    r2 = 2 * t / (1 - t**2)
    r3 = (3 * t - t**3) / (1 - 3 * t**2)
    a = - (r1 + r2 + r3)
    b = r1 * r2 + r2 * r3 + r3 * r1
    c = - r1 * r2 * r3
    print(f"t = {t}: a = {a:.3f}, b = {b:.3f}, c = {c:.3f}")
```
