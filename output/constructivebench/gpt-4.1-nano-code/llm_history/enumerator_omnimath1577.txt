This problem asks us to find the size of the set of natural numbers n with properties:
- n > 0
- n ≤ 2009
- Odd ⌊log₂ n⌋

We want to enumerate all such n for each relevant value of k = ⌊log₂ n⌋, where 0 ≤ k ≤ ⌊log₂ 2009⌋. 

Since 2009 ≈ 2^10.97, the maximum log₂ n for n ≤ 2009 is 10. 

For each k, n ranges from 2^k to 2^{k+1} - 1, intersected with n ≤ 2009, and only those with odd k need to be counted.

Here's the approach:
- For k in 0..10:
  - Determine the lower and upper bounds for n
  - Limit upper bound to min(2^{k+1} - 1, 2009)
  - For all n in that range, check if ⌊log₂ n⌋=k and n ≤2009
  - Check if k is odd
  - Count all such n, print each during enumeration

This allows us to count exactly how many n satisfy the conditions.

```python
import math

# Determine the maximum k based on 2009
max_k = int(math.log2(2009))  # approx 10

total_count = 0
for k in range(max_k + 1):
    lower_bound = 2**k
    upper_bound = min(2**(k + 1) - 1, 2009)
    if k % 2 == 1:
        for n in range(lower_bound, upper_bound + 1):
            # Confirm log2 n is indeed k
            if math.floor(math.log2(n)) == k:
                print(n)
                total_count += 1

print("Total count:", total_count)
```
