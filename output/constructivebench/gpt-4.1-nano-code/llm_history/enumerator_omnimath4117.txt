The problem involves a complex combinatorial minimum counting question related to markings on an n x n grid, with constraints involving adjacency and parity conditions. Our goal is to find, for a given even positive integer n, the minimal number k of marked points such that the marking satisfies the given adjacency rules, and to show that this minimal number is indeed the least such k.

Since the problem is complex and involves combinatorial structures on finite grids, we will write a small enumeration of candidate markings for small sample n values (e.g., n=2, n=4). We'll generate all configurations with a small number of marked points, check adjacency conditions, and record minimal k that satisfies the properties.

This approach maximizes efficiency by:
- Limiting the enumeration to small n (such as n=2,4).
- Early pruning when adjacency conditions fail.
- Printing each candidate configuration and its k immediately when found.

Now, here's a Python script to perform this enumeration:

```python
import itertools

def is_adjacent(x, y):
    # Check adjacency between two grid points (x,y)
    return abs(x[0] - y[0]) + abs(x[1] - y[1]) == 1

def check_marking(n, marked_points):
    # For each marked point, ensure there's a neighbor (adjacent marked point) or satisfy the condition
    for x in marked_points:
        found = False
        for y in marked_points:
            if x != y and is_adjacent(x, y):
                found = True
                break
        if not found:
            return False
    return True

# Sample enumeration for small even n
for n in [2, 4]:
    print(f"n = {n}")
    points = [(i, j) for i in range(n) for j in range(n)]
    min_k = None
    # Try all subsets of points, from 0 to total
    for k in range(1, n*n+1):
        for marked in itertools.combinations(points, k):
            if check_marking(n, marked):
                print(f"Marked points (k={k}): {marked}")
                if min_k is None or k < min_k:
                    min_k = k
        if min_k is not None:
            print(f"Minimal k for n={n} is {min_k}")
            break
```

This code enumerates small configurations on 2x2 and 4x4 grids, printing all marking patterns that satisfy adjacency conditions, and identifies minimal k values. It provides immediate answers and can be scaled or adapted further for more complex constraints.
