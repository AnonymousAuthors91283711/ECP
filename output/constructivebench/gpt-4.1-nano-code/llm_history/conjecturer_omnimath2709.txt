<<<(x - 3)^2 = 36>>>

Since hx: x = -3 is given, substituting yields (x - 3)^2 = ( -3 - 3)^2 = (-6)^2 = 36. The pattern indicates the answer is a constant, 36, for the specified x.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The main error is that in the answer definition, the variable `x` is undefined in the scope of the abbreviation. Since `x` is a parameter of the theorem but not available at the top level, we need to define the answer as a closed-form expression that depends on the variable `x`, or as a property that holds for that `x`. 

Given the enumerated answers, and since `x = -3`, the value of `(x - 3)^2` is 36. The general form for `(x - 3)^2` is just the square of `(x - 3)`. Since the question seems to be about the value of this expression at `x = -3` (per the assumption `hx : x = -3`), the relevant value is 36, and the expression is a constant 36.

However, to make the code compile, `abbrev omnimath2709_answer` cannot directly depend on a variable `x` that is not in scope. Instead, it should be a fixed value that matches the theorem statement, or be a function from `ℝ` to `ℝ`. 

Based on your request for a fixed form and the observed pattern, I will define the answer as the constant value of `(x - 3)^2` when `x = -3`, which is 36:

<<<36>>>

This is a closed-form answer that matches the particular case given by `hx` and the enumeration. Alternatively, one could define it as `(x - 3)^2` in a context where `x` is implicit or provided. But for the purpose of this problem, providing the explicit constant `36` is the simplest fix that compiles and matches the known value at `x = -3`.
