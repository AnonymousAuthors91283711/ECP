The problem appears to involve solving a system of three cubic equations in real variables \(x, y, z\):

\[
\begin{cases}
x^3 = 3x - 12y + 50 \\
y^3 = 12y + 3z - 2 \\
z^3 = 27z + 27x
\end{cases}
\]

In order to assist in conjecturing and possibly solving, we should enumerate small integer solutions (since high degrees and constants suggest potential for some manageable rational or integer solutions). We'll check small integer values around zero, both positive and negative, to identify potential solutions. 

The plan:
- Test \(x, y, z\) in some small ranges, say from -10 to 10.
- For each candidate, check if the equations hold (allowing for floating point tolerance).
- Print solutions immediately as they are found.

Here's the code:

```python
# Enumerate small integer candidates for (x, y, z)
# Check solutions for the system of equations
# x^3 = 3x - 12y + 50
# y^3 = 12y + 3z - 2
# z^3 = 27z + 27x

def verify(x, y, z):
    eps = 1e-6
    eq1 = abs(x**3 - (3*x - 12*y + 50))
    eq2 = abs(y**3 - (12*y + 3*z - 2))
    eq3 = abs(z**3 - (27*z + 27*x))
    return eq1 < eps and eq2 < eps and eq3 < eps

for x in range(-10, 11):
    for y in range(-10, 11):
        for z in range(-10, 11):
            if verify(x, y, z):
                print((x, y, z))
```
