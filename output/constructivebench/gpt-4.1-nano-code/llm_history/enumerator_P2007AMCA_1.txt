This problem involves calculating the costs for Susan and Pam based on given formulas, then finding the difference. The formulas involve percentage discounts applied to 20 items, and the task is to enumerate all possible answers to aid in conjecture and verification.

Let's explicitly compute the costs using the formulas:
- Susan's cost: \(4 \times (20 - (20 \times 25 / 100))\)
- Pam's cost: \(5 \times (20 - (20 \times 30 / 100))\)

Then compute their difference.

We'll write a Python script that:
- Enumerates possible values based on the formulas.
- Prints intermediate calculations.
- Reports the difference.

No hardcoding of final answer; this helps in understanding and verifying.

```python
# Enumerate and verify costs for Susan and Pam
def compute_costs():
    items = 20
    # possible discounts
    susan_discount_rate = 25  # as percentage
    pam_discount_rate = 30

    # Calculate discounted items
    susan_items_after_discount = items - (items * susan_discount_rate / 100)
    pam_items_after_discount = items - (items * pam_discount_rate / 100)

    # Calculate total costs
    susan_cost = 4 * susan_items_after_discount
    pam_cost = 5 * pam_items_after_discount

    # Print intermediate results
    print(f"Susan's discounted items: {susan_items_after_discount}")
    print(f"Pam's discounted items: {pam_items_after_discount}")
    print(f"Susan's cost: {susan_cost}")
    print(f"Pam's cost: {pam_cost}")

    # Print the difference
    difference = pam_cost - susan_cost
    print(f"Difference (Pam - Susan): {difference}")

# Run the computation to enumerate possible answers
compute_costs()
```
