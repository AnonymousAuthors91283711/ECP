This problem involves iterating a function defined on triples of non-negative integers and examining the maximum value of a certain component when at least one component becomes zero. The iteration depends on the initial values (a=15, b=14, c=13). The goal is to find the maximum possible value of a particular answer (likely a component of the resulting triple) over all iterations that terminate with at least one component being zero.

Since the exact `P2004AMCA_7_answer` function is not provided, I will assume it returns the maximum component achieved during the iteration. To explore this, the code will:
- Start from initial `(a, b, c) = (15, 14, 13)`.
- Run the iteration a certain number of steps (say, up to 100).
- Track the maximum value of each component when at least one component is zero.
- Print the maximum found during this process.

This approach is a heuristic to conjecture the maximum possible resulting value.

```python
# This code enumerates iteration results starting from (15,14,13),
# tracking the maximum component value with at least one zero component encountered.
# It simulates the iterative process up to a fixed number of steps.

def iterate_triple(x, y, z):
    # Apply the given rule based on maximum component
    if x >= y and x >= z:
        return (x - (y + z + 1), y + 1, z + 1)
    elif y >= x and y >= z:
        return (x + 1, y - (x + z + 1), z + 1)
    else:
        return (x + 1, y + 1, z - (x + y + 1))

initial = (15, 14, 13)
max_steps = 100
max_value = 0

x, y, z = initial
for _ in range(max_steps):
    # Track the maximum component when at least one component is zero
    if x == 0 or y == 0 or z == 0:
        max_value = max(max_value, x, y, z)
        print(f"Encountered zero: ({x}, {y}, {z}), max so far: {max_value}")
    x, y, z = iterate_triple(x, y, z)

print(f"Maximum component value during iteration: {max_value}")
```
