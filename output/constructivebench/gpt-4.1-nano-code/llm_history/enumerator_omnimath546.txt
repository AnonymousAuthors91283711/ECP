Let's analyze the problem. We need to find all integers \( m \) such that there exists an integer \( k \) with:

\[ k^2 = m^2 + 6m + 28 \]

Rearranged:

\[ k^2 = m^2 + 6m + 28 \]

Complete the square for the right side:

\[ m^2 + 6m + 9 + 19 = (m + 3)^2 + 19 \]

So,

\[ k^2 = (m + 3)^2 + 19 \]

Set \( n = m + 3 \). The equation becomes:

\[ k^2 = n^2 + 19 \]

which equates to:

\[ k^2 - n^2 = 19 \]

Factor as a difference of squares:

\[ (k - n)(k + n) = 19 \]

Since 19 is prime, the divisors are only ±1 and ±19. The possible pairs:

1. \( (k - n, k + n) = (1, 19) \)

2. \( (k - n, k + n) = (-1, -19) \)

3. \( (k - n, k + n) = (19, 1) \)

4. \( (k - n, k + n) = (-19, -1) \)

Solve each pair for \( k, n \):

For pair (1): 

\[ k - n = 1 \]
\[ k + n = 19 \]

Add:

\[ 2k = 20 \Rightarrow k = 10 \]
\[ n = 19 - k = 19 - 10 = 9 \]

then \( m = n - 3 = 9 - 3 = 6 \).

Similarly, for pair (2):

\[ k - n = -1 \]
\[ k + n = -19 \]

Adding:

\[ 2k = -20 \Rightarrow k = -10 \]
\[ n = -19 - (-10) = -19 + 10 = -9 \]

then \( m = -9 - 3 = -12 \).

Pair (3):

\[ k - n = 19 \]
\[ k + n = 1 \]

Adding:

\[ 2k = 20 \Rightarrow k = 10 \]
\[ n = 1 - 10 = -9 \], so \( m = -9 - 3 = -12 \) (duplicate).

Pair (4):

\[ k - n = -19 \]
\[ k + n = -1 \]

Adding:

\[ 2k = -20 \Rightarrow k = -10 \]
\[ n = -1 - (-10) = 9 \Rightarrow m = 9 - 3 = 6 \) (duplicate).

Therefore, the solutions are:

- \( m = 6 \)
- \( m = -12 \)

The sets of \( m \) are \( \{ -12, 6 \} \).

Now, to match the code structure, we can generate these values programmatically for verification, and possibly extend to search within some small bounds for other solutions.

Here's the code:

```python
# Enumerate all integer solutions m where k^2 = (m+3)^2 + 19
# Since (k - n)(k + n) = 19, divisors are ±1 and ±19
# Possible pairs lead to solutions m = -12 and 6

# Generate solutions based on divisor pairs
solutions = []

# Divisor pairs for 19: (1, 19), (-1, -19), (19, 1), (-19, -1)
divisor_pairs = [(1, 19), (-1, -19), (19, 1), (-19, -1)]

for d1, d2 in divisor_pairs:
    k = (d1 + d2) // 2
    n = (d2 - d1) // 2
    m = n - 3
    # Append the distinct m solutions
    solutions.append(m)
    print(m)
```
