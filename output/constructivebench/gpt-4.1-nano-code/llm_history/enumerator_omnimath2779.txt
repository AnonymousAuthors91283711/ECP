This problem involves finding positive real numbers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( \lfloor x \rfloor \times x = 36 \) and \( \lfloor y \rfloor \times y = 71 \), and then determining their sum \( x + y \). The goal is to enumerate candidate solutions for \( x \) and \( y \), then compute \( x + y \). Since both \( x \) and \( y \) are determined by their floors and the equations, we can explore possible floor values and solve for \( x \) and \( y \).

Approach:
- For each possible integer floor value \( n \) where \( n \times x = 36 \), \( x = 36 / n \). To ensure \( \lfloor x \rfloor = n \), we check if \( 36/n \) has floor \( n \), i.e., \( n \leq 36/n < n+1 \).
- Similarly for \( y \), with \( \lfloor y \rfloor = m \), \( y = 71 / m \), and check the same condition.
- Enumerate all such candidate pairs, compute their sum, and print immediately.

This approach is efficient because it limits enumeration to relevant integer floors.

```python
# Enumerate possible floor values for x and y based on the equations
for n in range(1, 37):  # since n*n <=36, n up to 36
    x = 36 / n
    if int(x) == n:
        for m in range(1, 72):  # similarly for y, m up to 71
            y = 71 / m
            if int(y) == m:
                answer = x + y
                print(f"n={n}, x={x}, m={m}, y={y}, sum={answer}")
```
