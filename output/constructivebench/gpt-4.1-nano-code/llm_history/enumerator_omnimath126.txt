This problem appears to be a mathematical conjecture involving positive integers \(a, b, c, d\) with sum \(s\), where \(s \geq 4\). The key is to find all possible sums \(s\) such that:

\[ s = a + b + c + d \]
and
\[ s \mid a b c + a b d + a c d + b c d \]

The goal is to enumerate potential solutions and identify all such values of \(s\).

To make the problem manageable, we will consider small positive integers \(a, b, c, d\), with \(a, b, c, d \geq 1\). We will limit the search to small bounds, say up to 20, to avoid excessive computation.

For each combination, if the conditions are met, we print the sum \(s\).

```python
# Enumerate small positive integers a, b, c, d up to 20
# For each combination, check if s divides the sum of the specified products
# Collect and print all such sums s found

max_val = 20
results = set()

for a in range(1, max_val + 1):
    for b in range(1, max_val + 1):
        for c in range(1, max_val + 1):
            for d in range(1, max_val + 1):
                s = a + b + c + d
                # Only consider s >= 4 (already guaranteed since all are positive)
                numerator = a*b*c + a*b*d + a*c*d + b*c*d
                # Check divisibility
                if s != 0 and numerator % s == 0:
                    print(s)
                    results.add(s)
# Optional: list all unique s found
print("Unique sums s:", sorted(results))
```
