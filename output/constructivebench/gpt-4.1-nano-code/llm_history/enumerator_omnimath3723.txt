The problem appears to concern the expression \(a^4 + 4b^4\) and its primality, with some conjecture about which pairs \((a, b)\) make this prime. Typically, such problems involve small values of \(a\) and \(b\) and look for all solutions where the expression yields a prime. To assist in conjecturing and verification, we'll enumerate small positive integer pairs \((a, b)\), check whether \(a^4 + 4 b^4\) is prime, and potentially find all solutions up to some small bounds.

Since the task asks for efficient enumeration, and considering the potential size, we'll limit our search to small \(a, b \leq 20\). For each pair, we'll check if \(a^4 + 4 b^4\) is prime. When primes are found, we'll print the pair immediately.

```python
import sympy

# Define upper bounds for a and b (small due to nature of enumeration)
MAX_A = 20
MAX_B = 20

# Enumerate pairs (a, b)
for a in range(1, MAX_A + 1):
    for b in range(1, MAX_B + 1):
        value = a**4 + 4 * b**4
        # Check if the value is prime
        if sympy.isprime(value):
            print(f"Pair (a={a}, b={b}) yields prime: {value}")
```
