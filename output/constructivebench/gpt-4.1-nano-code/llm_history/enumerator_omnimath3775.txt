The problem appears to involve combinatorial reasoning about selecting red squares on an 8x8 grid, with certain conditions on row and column subsets. The statement seems to be about the minimal number of red squares needed so that, for any red set of size n, and any choice of 4 rows and 4 columns, there exists at least one red square outside those 4 rows and 4 columns.

This resembles a combinatorial covering or blocking problem, asking for the minimal red set size such that any 4x4 subgrid is "missed" by some red square outside it, which might relate to minimal number of red squares to "cover" the grid in a certain combinatorial sense.

To explore minimal or extremal n, we can brute-force small values of n from 0 upward, checking if the condition holds for all choices, and stopping at the smallest where it holds (if search is practical).

Since the problem is combinatorial, I'll implement a brute-force check ove small n, with small sample subsets, and verify the property. To avoid exponential computation, we will limit ourselves to small checks and demonstrate the process.

```python
import itertools

# Grid size
size = 8
half = 4  # size of rows/columns subset

# Function to check if for a given red set, the property holds:
# For *every* choice of 4 rows and 4 columns, exists a red square outside these sets
def property_holds(red_set):
    rows_list = list(itertools.combinations(range(size), half))
    cols_list = list(itertools.combinations(range(size), half))
    for rows in rows_list:
        for cols in cols_list:
            # Check if there's a red square outside the 4x4 subgrid
            outside_reds = [ (i, j) for (i, j) in red_set
                               if i not in rows and j not in cols ]
            if len(outside_reds) == 0:
                return False
    return True

# Brute-force minimal red set size n
for n in range(0, size*size+1):
    found = False
    for red_set in itertools.combinations( ((i,j) for i in range(size) for j in range(size)), n ):
        red_set = set(red_set)
        if property_holds(red_set):
            print(f"Minimal n: {n}")
            print(f"Red set example: {sorted(red_set)}")
            found = True
            break
    if found:
        break
```
