The problem appears to be about finding the minimal size `k` of a set `A` of integers such that every integer `m` can be written as `a^n mod 100` for some `a` in `A` and some positive integer `n`. We need to find the least such `k` and provide representative solutions.

Since directly automating in formal proof environments is complex, I'll instead write a Python program to enumerate small sets `A` and check whether their elements generate all residues modulo 100 via powers. For efficiency, we'll limit the size of `A` and the base elements.

The code will:
- Test sets `A` of size `k` starting from 1 upwards.
- For each set, generate the power residues of each element up to a certain threshold.
- Check if the union covers all residues modulo 100.
- Print the minimal `k` where coverage is complete.

```python
import itertools

# Generate all elements for A, check for the minimal size k
max_element = 20  # limit for base elements to keep runtime manageable
target_mod = 100

def power_residues(base, max_power=20):
    residues = set()
    current = 1
    for n in range(1, max_power + 1):
        current = (current * base) % target_mod
        residues.add(current)
        if len(residues) == target_mod:
            break
    return residues

def covers_all_residues(A):
    all_residues = set()
    for a in A:
        all_residues |= power_residues(a)
        if len(all_residues) == target_mod:
            return True
    return False

for k in range(1, 8):  # search for minimal set size up to 7
    found = False
    for A in itertools.product(range(1, max_element), repeat=k):
        if covers_all_residues(A):
            print(f"Found set of size {k}: {A}")
            found = True
            break
    if found:
        print(f"Minimal size k = {k}")
        break
```

This program attempts small sets systematically, finds the minimal size that covers all residue classes under powers, and outputs representative solutions. Adjust `max_element` and `max_power` for more thoroughness with a performance trade-off.
