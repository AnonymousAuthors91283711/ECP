The problem seems to analyze prime numbers of the form n^n + 1 for integers n between 1 and 15, inclusive. We want to enumerate which n values produce prime results for n^n + 1. To assist in the conjecture, we'll compute n^n + 1 for each n in [1, 15], check if it's prime, and output the known prime instances immediately. Since the goal is to guess the set of n for which n^n + 1 is prime, we will generate and print those n-values and their n^n + 1 when prime, then define the collection accordingly.

```python
import math

# Function to test primality
def is_prime(x):
    if x < 2:
        return False
    if x in (2, 3):
        return True
    if x % 2 == 0:
        return False
    sqrt_x = int(math.isqrt(x))
    for i in range(3, sqrt_x + 1, 2):
        if x % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

prime_n_values = []
for n in range(1, 16):
    val = n ** n + 1
    if is_prime(val):
        print(f"n={n}, n^n+1={val} is prime")
        prime_n_values.append(n)

# Set of n for which n^n+1 is prime
omnimath3348_answer = set(prime_n_values)
print(f"Answer set: {sorted(omnimath3348_answer)}")
```
