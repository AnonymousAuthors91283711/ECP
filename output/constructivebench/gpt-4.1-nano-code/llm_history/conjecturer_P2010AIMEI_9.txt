theorem P2010AIMEI_9 :
  IsGreatest {s : ℝ | ∃ a b c : ℝ, 
    a^3 - a*b*c = 2 ∧ 
    b^3 - a*b*c = 6 ∧ 
    c^3 - a*b*c = 20 ∧ 
    s = a^3 + b^3 + c^3} 
  P2010AIMEI_9_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 21.571428571428573
16
Maximum s: 21.571428571428573. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests the maximum sum occurs at specific real roots, likely when a,b,c are roots of a cubic polynomial with these symmetric conditions. Given the numerical approximation (≈21.57), the exact value resembles \( \frac{152}{7} \). Therefore, the closed form is:

<<<(152/7)>>>

This captures the maximum sum exactly.
