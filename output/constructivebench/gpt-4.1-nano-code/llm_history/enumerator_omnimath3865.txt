The problem appears to be a formal statement in Lean theorem prover syntax involving polynomials over ℝ and some condition on a polynomial P related to its evaluations at shifted points, with a parameter m ≠ 0. The goal is to find the set of such polynomials P (i.e., to determine `omnimath3865_answer`) satisfying this identity for all real x.

To assist in conjecturing and proving the solution, we will interpret this as finding all P ∈ ℝ[X] satisfying:
\[
(x^3 - m x^2 + 1) P(x+1) + (x^3 + m x^2 + 1) P(x-1) = 2 (x^3 - m x + 1) P(x),
\forall x \in \mathbb{R}
\]

We'll approach this by testing candidate forms for P, such as low-degree polynomials, since the identity holds for all real x, allowing polynomial coefficient comparisons. We choose a small degree range and specific values of m for experimentation.

We will:
- Pick small m values, e.g., m=1.
- Test polynomial degrees from 0 up to 3 (since the identity involves degree 3 polynomial terms).
- For each degree, derive the coefficients satisfying the equation.
- Print the candidates instantly when found.

This will help conjecture the general form of P.
