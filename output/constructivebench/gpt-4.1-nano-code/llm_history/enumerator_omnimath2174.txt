The problem appears to involve comparing the ratio of the size of a specific subset of Fin n to the total size of Fin n, expressed as a rational number functionally dependent on n. To explore this, I will:

- Enumerate Fin n for small n (say up to 8).
- For each n, count the number of elements satisfying x.val + 1 = n, which simplifies to x.val = n - 1.
- Compute the ratio of this subset size to the total size n.
- Collect and output these ratios as fractions, emitting exact rational values.

This approach will help hypothesize the form of the answer function omnimath2174_answer.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def enumerate_ratios(max_n=8):
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        total = n
        # subset: x where x.val + 1 = n => x.val = n - 1
        subset_size = 1 if n > 0 else 0  # For n >=1, exactly one x: x.val = n-1
        ratio = Fraction(subset_size, total)
        print(f"n={n}, subset size={subset_size}, total={total}, ratio={ratio}")

enumerate_ratios()
```
