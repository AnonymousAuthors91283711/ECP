abbrev P2005AMCB_1_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem P2005AMCB_1 : 
  (1000 / 2) * 1 - (1000 / 5) * 2 = P2005AMCB_1_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 100.0. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests the answer involves the terms `(1000 / 2) * 1` and `(1000 / 5) * 2`, which evaluate to 500 and 400 respectively. their difference is 100. 

Thus, the closed form is a constant summing or subtracting these components, resulting in 100.
