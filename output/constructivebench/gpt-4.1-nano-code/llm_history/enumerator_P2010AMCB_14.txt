This problem appears to be about finding five positive integers \( a, b, c, d, e \) summing to 2010, and then minimizing the maximum of certain pairwise sums. Specifically, the value \( M \) is the maximum among these sums:
\[
\max(a + b,\, b + c,\, c + d,\, d + e).
\]
Our task is to find the minimal such \( M \).

To approach this, we need to:
- Find a combination of positive integers \( a, b, c, d, e \) summing to 2010,
- Minimize the maximum of the four pair sums.

Since the problem is only asking for an enumeration approach, and to keep computation efficient with small sample parameters, we'll:
- Use a binary search over possible \( M \) (candidate maximum sum),
- For each candidate \( M \), check if there's a feasible assignment,
- Once the minimal feasible \( M \) is found, output it.

Here's a simplified Python implementation to attempt this:

```python
# Approach: Binary search on M, checking feasibility by trying to assign variables
# so that each of the sums a+b, b+c, c+d, d+e <= M,
# with all variables positive and sum to 2010.

def feasible(M, total=2010):
    # We need to find positive a,b,c,d,e with sum 2010,
    # and with the pair sums <= M:
    # a + b <= M
    # b + c <= M
    # c + d <= M
    # d + e <= M
    # all variables > 0

    # Let's try to fix b, c, d to satisfy the pair sums constraints
    for b in range(1, M):
        for c in range(1, M):
            # from b + c <= M
            if b + c > M:
                continue
            for d in range(1, M):
                # c + d <= M
                if c + d > M:
                    continue
                # d + e <= M => e <= M - d
                e_max = M - d
                if e_max <= 0:
                    continue
                # Now, a + b <= M => a <= M - b
                a_max = M - b
                # also a > 0
                a_min = 1
                a_upper = min(total - (b + c + d + 1), a_max)  # total minus other vars
                # total sum: a + b + c + d + e = 2010
                # so a = 2010 - (b + c + d + e)
                # us re-arranging variables:
                # a = total - (b + c + d + e)
                # with a > 0, e <= e_max
                min_a = max(1, total - (b + c + d + e_max))
                max_a = a_upper
                if min_a <= max_a:
                    # we found feasible a
                    a = min_a
                    e = total - (a + b + c + d)
                    if 1 <= e <= e_max:
                        return True
    return False

# Binary search on M
low, high = 2, 2010  # minimal sum of two positives is at least 2
result = None
while low <= high:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    if feasible(mid):
        result = mid
        high = mid - 1
    else:
        low = mid + 1

print("Minimal maximum pair sum M:", result)
```

This code performs an approximate enumeration by searching for the minimal possible value of \( M \), checking feasibility by enumerating small ranges of \( b, c, d \). The actual minimal value will be the answer.

Note: Further optimization can be done, but this implementation demonstrates enumeration and binary search for the minimal maximum sum given constraints.
