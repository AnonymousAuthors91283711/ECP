The problem involves parameters T and K, with T fixed at 362, and K defined as the square root of T - 1. We want to evaluate the absolute value of the expression \((K - 20)(K + 1) + 19K - K^2\).

Since T = 362, K = sqrt(361) = 19. We can verify this and then directly compute the expression for K = 19, avoiding unnecessary complexity.

We'll write a small program that:
- Sets T = 362
- Calculates K = sqrt(T - 1)
- Calculates the expression inside the absolute value
- Prints the result immediately

Since the problem seems straightforward with a fixed T, we only need to process this specific case, but to follow instructions, we'll generalize slightly over this calculation.

```python
import math

# Fixed parameter
T = 362
# Compute K based on T
K = math.sqrt(T - 1)

# Compute the expression
expression = (K - 20) * (K + 1) + 19 * K - K ** 2

# Output the absolute value
answer = abs(expression)
print(answer)
```

This code computes the exact answer for the given parameters, instantaneously producing a concrete value.
