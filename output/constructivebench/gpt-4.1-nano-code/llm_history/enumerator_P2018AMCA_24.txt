The problem involves finding the greatest value c in [0,1] such that the volume of certain sets involving c, p, and measures over intervals is maximized. Since the exact logic is complex and involves measure theory, we will approximate by sampling points in the specified regions and empirically searching for the maximum c that satisfies the measure condition. We will iterate over candidate c's from 0 to 1 in small steps, estimate the volumes, and print each candidate answer.

```python
import numpy as np

# Define the intervals
x_range = np.linspace(0, 1, 50)
y_range = np.linspace(0.5, 2/3, 50)  # Interval for p.2
candidate_cs = np.linspace(0, 1, 100)  # candidate c's in [0,1]

# Function to estimate volume of the set for a given c
def estimate_volume(c):
    count = 0
    total = 0
    for x in x_range:
        for p2 in y_range:
            # Condition for the set in the volume
            cond = ((x < c < p2) or (p2 < c < x))
            if cond:
                count += 1
            total += 1
    return count / total  # proportion of points satisfying the condition

# Search for the greatest c where the measure exceeds a threshold
# We'll check where the measure remains non-zero or exceeds a small epsilon
max_c = None
epsilon = 0.01  # threshold for significance

for c in candidate_cs:
    volume_estimate = estimate_volume(c)
    print(f"c = {c:.2f}, estimated volume = {volume_estimate:.3f}")
    if volume_estimate > epsilon:
        max_c = c

print(f"Estimated greatest c satisfying the measure condition: {max_c}")
```
