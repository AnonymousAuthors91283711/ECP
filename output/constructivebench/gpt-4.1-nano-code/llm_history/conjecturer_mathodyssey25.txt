. Enumerated answers: K 1 1.ncard = 1. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests the set size increases cumulatively considering the partition restrictions. Since the answer for K 1 1 is 1, and the sets are formed via a recursive rule that disallows intersecting subsets, the total number of elements in K n n appears to be \(2^{n-1}\). 

This aligns with recursive combinatorial growth, as each addition doubles possible configurations while respecting the disjoint intersection rule. 

Final answer:

<<<2^(2004 - 1)>>>
