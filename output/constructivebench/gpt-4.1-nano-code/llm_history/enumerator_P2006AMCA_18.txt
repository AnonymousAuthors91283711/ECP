The problem involves a functional equation involving a function `f` satisfying `f x + f (1/x) = x` for all `x` in a domain `D`. The additional property states that `D` is minimal with respect to this property. We want to explore possible solutions for `f` and the corresponding domain `D` to help understand the problem.

To assist the conjecture:
- We will consider the functional equation and attempt to find candidate functions.
- Since the problem is about the set `D` and the function `f`, and `f` is related to the equation `f x + f (1/x) = x`, it suggests that `f` might be related to the identity function or similar simple functions.
- We'll explore solutions numerically for small `x`, examine possible minimal domains, and print candidate solutions as we find them.

Here's a Python program that:
- Enumerates sample `x` values (`x` and `1/x`) within a small range.
- Attempts to find functions `f(x)` that satisfy the relation with simple forms.
- Prints candidate `D` and functions `f` that satisfy the equation for these small samples.
- Uses numerical guesses to help understand the structure.

The program avoids hard coding but tries plausible forms based on the symmetry of the functional equation.

```python
import sympy as sp

# Candidate functions to test: linear, constant, etc.
x = sp.symbols('x')
candidate_functions = [
    lambda x: x / 2,           # f(x) = x/2
    lambda x: x - 1,           # f(x) = x - 1
    lambda x: 1 - x,           # f(x) = 1 - x
    lambda x: 0.5 * x + 0.5,   # f(x) = 0.5 x + 0.5
    lambda x: x / 3
]

# Sample points for testing
test_points = [0.1, 1, 2, 3]

print("Testing candidate functions for the functional equation f(x) + f(1/x) = x")

for idx, f in enumerate(candidate_functions):
    domain_candidates = set()
    print(f"\nChecking candidate function f_{idx+1}:")
    for val in test_points:
        try:
            f_val = f(val)
            inv_val = f(1/val)
            sum_val = f_val + inv_val
            print(f"x={val:.2f}: f(x)={f_val:.2f}, f(1/x)={inv_val:.2f}, sum={sum_val:.2f}")
            # Check if sum approximates x
            if abs(sum_val - val) < 0.1:
                # Possible candidate for domain
                domain_candidates.add(val)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error evaluating at x={val}: {e}")

    if domain_candidates:
        D_sample = domain_candidates
        print(f"\nSample domain D includes: {sorted(D_sample)}")
        print("Possible functions that satisfy the equation on this sample:")
        print(f"f_{idx+1}")
```
