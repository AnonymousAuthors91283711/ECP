This problem asks to find the number of functions from a 6-element finite set to itself, where for each element `i`, `f(i)` is not equal to `i`, nor to its immediate neighbors `(i+1)%6` and `(i-1)%6`. This is equivalent to counting permutations of 6 elements avoiding fixed points and adjacent swaps, i.e., a derangement with constraints.

To enumerate all functions meeting the criteria, we'll:
- Generate all permutations of 6 elements.
- Filter those where no element maps to itself, nor to its neighbors.
- Count and print them immediately as we find them.

Since the total number of permutations is manageable (720), this brute-force enumeration is feasible and efficient. We won't hardcode results; instead, we'll perform enumeration and count.

```python
import itertools

def is_valid(f):
    # Check for each position i if f(i) != i, (i+1)%6, (i-1)%6
    for i, val in enumerate(f):
        if val == i or val == (i + 1) % 6 or val == (i - 1) % 6:
            return False
    return True

permutations = itertools.permutations(range(6))
count = 0

for perm in permutations:
    if is_valid(perm):
        print(perm)
        count += 1

print("Total valid functions:", count)
```
