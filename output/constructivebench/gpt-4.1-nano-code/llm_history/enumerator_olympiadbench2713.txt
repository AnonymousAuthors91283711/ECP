The problem involves evaluating the sum of cubes of cosines of angles related to 7th roots of unity: \(\cos(2\pi/7)\), \(\cos(4\pi/7)\), and \(\cos(8\pi/7)\). Since \(8\pi/7 = 2\pi - 6\pi/7\), and because \(\cos(\theta)\) is periodic and symmetric, we can relate these values to algebraic numbers satisfying a minimal polynomial derived from roots of unity.

The key idea is the identities involving cosine powers for these angles. To help conjecture the sum, we can approximate these cosines and then sum their cubes. This estimation can guide to the exact algebraic expression.

Here's a Python program to approximate these values and compute their cubes, streaming partial results:

```python
import math

# Define the angles
angles = [2 * math.pi / 7, 4 * math.pi / 7, 8 * math.pi / 7]

# Approximate cosines
cosines = [math.cos(angle) for angle in angles]

# Compute cubes of these cosines
cubes = [c ** 3 for c in cosines]

# Stream results for each cosine and its cube
for i, (c, c3) in enumerate(zip(cosines, cubes), 1):
    print(f"cos({angles[i-1]:.4f}) ≈ {c:.6f}")
    print(f"({c:.6f})^3 ≈ {c3:.6f}")

# Sum of the cubes
sum_cubes = sum(cubes)
print(f"Sum of cubes ≈ {sum_cubes:.6f}")
```

Running this script provides approximations that support conjecturing the exact algebraic value, which is known from classical results related to the roots of unity sums.
