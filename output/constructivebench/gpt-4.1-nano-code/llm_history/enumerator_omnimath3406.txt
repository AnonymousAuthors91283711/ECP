This problem involves the ratio of bananas to total fruits (apples + bananas). To find the exact value, we substitute the given numbers and compute the ratio as a rational number.

- apples = 12
- bananas = 15 + 3 = 18

Total fruits = apples + bananas = 12 + 18 = 30

Bananas / total fruits = 18 / 30 = 3/5 = 0.6

The answer is exactly 3/5; using rational arithmetic ensures exactness.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# parameters
apples = 12
bananas = 15 + 3
total = apples + bananas

# compute exact ratio
answer = Fraction(bananas, total)
print(answer)  # outputs 3/5
```
