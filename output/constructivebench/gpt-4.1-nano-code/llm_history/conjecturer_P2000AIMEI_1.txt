theorem P2000AIMEI_1 : 
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ ∀ (a b : ℕ), a * b = 10^n → (0 ∈ digits 10 a ∨ 0 ∈ digits 10 b)} P2000AIMEI_1_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n = 8 satisfies the property.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The property states that for all factors of \(10^n\), one must contain 0 as a digit, which is true for \(n=8\) since \(10^8\) factors involve numbers with guaranteed zeros. The minimal such \(n\) satisfying this is 8.
