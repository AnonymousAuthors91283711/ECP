. Enumerated answers: y = 1.50, x = 4.50 (from x(1 - y) = - y^2)
y = 2.00, x = 4.00 (from x(1 - y) = - y^2)
Estimated infimum: 4.00. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests the infimum occurs at the minimal x satisfying \(x(1 - y) = - y^2\). For the smallest y > 0, the minimum x is at y=2, yielding x=4. 

Provided the pattern and the problem statement, the closed-form minimal x is 4.
