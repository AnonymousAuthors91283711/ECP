The problem involves finding the number of natural numbers \(k\) such that \(k\) is a perfect square and divides \(10^{10}\). To solve this, we need to:

- Find all divisors \(k\) of \(10^{10}\).
- Among those divisors, identify which are perfect squares \(m^2\).

Since \(10^{10} = (2 \times 5)^{10} = 2^{10} \times 5^{10}\), every divisor \(k\) can be written as \(2^a 5^b\), where \(0 \le a, b \le 10\).

- For \(k\) to be a perfect square, \(a\) and \(b\) must be even.
- Count the number of pairs \((a, b)\) with \(a, b\) even, within \(0 \le a, b \le 10\).

Possible even exponents for \(a, b\) are \(0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10\).

Total options for \(a\): 6 (since 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10).

Total options for \(b\): 6 similarly.

Number of such divisors (which are perfect squares dividing \(10^{10}\)) is \(6 \times 6 = 36\).

We will write Python code to enumerate and confirm these divisors.

```python
# Enumerate all divisors of 10^10 that are perfect squares
# 10^10 = 2^10 * 5^10
# Divisors: 2^a * 5^b where 0 <= a, b <= 10
# For perfect squares, a and b must be even
# Exponents: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10

divisors_count = 0
for a in range(0, 11, 2):  # even exponents for 2
    for b in range(0, 11, 2):  # even exponents for 5
        k = (2 ** a) * (5 ** b)
        print(k)
        divisors_count += 1

print(f"Total perfect square divisors dividing 10^10: {divisors_count}")
```
