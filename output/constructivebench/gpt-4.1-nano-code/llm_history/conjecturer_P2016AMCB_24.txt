The problem seeks the least n such that the set of quadruples with GCD 77 and LCM n has a specific count (196). Given the enumeration, the pattern indicates that the least n occurs when the quadruple factors reflect divisibility and multiples of 77.

My conjecture is that the minimal n matches the least common multiple (LCM) of the minimal quadruple factors satisfying the GCD condition.

Since the minimal factors where all are multiples of 77 and their GCD is 77, the smallest such set has all factors equal to 77, resulting in LCM = 77.

However, the count (196) suggests factors are more composite, but minimal n aligning with these counts is 5929, which is 77².

Thus, the minimal n is 5929.

<<<77 * 77>>>
