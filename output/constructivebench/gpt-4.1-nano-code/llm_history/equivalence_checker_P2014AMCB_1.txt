Ground Truth Answer: 37
Proposed Answer: (13 + 1) + 5 * 6
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step.

1. The problem gives us three conditions:
   - p + n = 13
   - n + 1 = p
   - p + 5 * n = answer

2. From the second condition (n + 1 = p), we can substitute p in the first equation:
   (n + 1) + n = 13 → 2n + 1 = 13 → 2n = 12 → n = 6

3. Then p = n + 1 = 7

4. Now calculate p + 5 * n = 7 + 5 * 6 = 7 + 30 = 37

The ground truth answer is 37. The proposed answer is (13 + 1) + 5 * 6 = 14 + 30 = 44, which is incorrect.

<<<False>>>
