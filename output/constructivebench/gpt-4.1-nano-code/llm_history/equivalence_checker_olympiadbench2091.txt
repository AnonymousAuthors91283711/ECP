Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (2 * n / 3) + 1
Proposed Answer: fun n => (n - 1) * (n - 2) / 2
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the maximum number of distinct triples (a,b,c) where a+b+c = n and all a's are distinct, all b's are distinct, and all c's are distinct.

2. The ground truth answer suggests a linear growth (2n/3 + 1), which makes sense as we're constrained by the sum and distinctness conditions.

3. The proposed answer gives a quadratic formula ((n-1)(n-2)/2), which would grow much faster than the ground truth answer. For example:
   - For n=3: ground truth = 3, proposed = 1
   - For n=6: ground truth = 5, proposed = 10
   - For n=9: ground truth = 7, proposed = 28

The proposed answer is clearly incorrect as it grows too rapidly and doesn't match the ground truth in simple cases. The quadratic formula suggests many more triples than are actually possible under the given constraints.
