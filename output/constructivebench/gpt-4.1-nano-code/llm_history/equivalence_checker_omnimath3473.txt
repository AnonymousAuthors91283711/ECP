abbrev omnimath3473_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath3473 : (110 : ℚ) / 100 * 500 = omnimath3473_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 550
Proposed Answer: (11/10) * 500
<<<True>>>

The proposed answer (11/10) * 500 is equivalent to the ground truth answer 550 because:
1. 110/100 simplifies to 11/10
2. (11/10) * 500 = 550
Both expressions evaluate to the same final result.
