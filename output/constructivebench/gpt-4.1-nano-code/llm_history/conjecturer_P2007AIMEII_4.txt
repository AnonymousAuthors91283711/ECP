theorem P2007AIMEII_4 :
  ∃ (w₁ w₂ : ℕ), -- widget and whoosit production rates per worker per hour
  (100 * w₁ = 300 ∧ 100 * w₂ = 200) ∧ -- first condition
  (2 * 60 * w₁ = 240 ∧ 2 * 60 * w₂ = 300) ∧ -- second condition
  (3 * 50 * w₂ = P2007AIMEII_4_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Solution from condition 1: w1=3.0, w2=2.0, answer=300.0
Solution from condition 2: w1=2.0, w2=2.5, answer=375.0. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the conditions:
- From first: w₁=3, w₂=2, answer=300
- From second: w₁=2, w₂=2.5, answer=3*50*2.5=375

Choosing the consistent integer answer, answer = 300, corresponding to w₁=3, w₂=2.

Final expression satisfying ℕ: <<<3 * 50 * 2>>>

And, to match the pattern, answer: 300.
