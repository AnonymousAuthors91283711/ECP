The problem involves computing the value of the sum (or product) of terms involving powers of 1/10, and expressing the sum as a logarithm ratio. Specifically, the expression is:

\[
\frac{\log \left(\prod_{k=0}^{8} \left(1 + 2 \times \left(\frac{1}{10}\right)^{k+1}\right)\right)}{\log \left(\frac{1}{10}\right)}
\]

This simplifies to summing the logs (since log of a product is sum of logs) and dividing by log(1/10). Recognizing that:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{8} \left(1 + 2 \times 10^{-(k+1)}\right)
\]

is a product over terms that can be expanded, but it's easier to evaluate directly or approximate numerically. We will generate all the factors, compute their product, then compute the ratio of logs for an exact answer.

Here's a Python program to evaluate this expression directly by enumerating each factor to produce partial answers immediately, favoring exact rational approximations by converting to floats.

```python
import math

# Enumerate each factor in the product
product = 1.0
for k in range(9):
    factor = 1 + 2 * 10 ** -(k+1)  # term in the product
    print(f"Factor for k={k}: {factor}")
    product *= factor

# Compute the ratio: log(product) / log(1/10)
ratio = math.log(product) / math.log(1/10)

print(f"Product of factors: {product}")
print(f"Expression value: {ratio}")

# Since log(1/10) = -log(10), the ratio should be positive
```

This program computes the product explicitly, streams each factor, and outputs the final ratio. It helps to conjecture the approximate value, which is useful for the proof or further simplification.
