The problem asks to find all triples of natural numbers (p, q, r) such that p, q, r are prime, and the equation (p / q) - 4 / (r + 1) = 1 holds. To assist in formulating a conjecture and eventually proving the solution, I will enumerate small prime triples that satisfy this equation. Given the structure, we can fix small prime values for p, q, and r, verify the equation, and output all solutions found. The approach prioritizes exact matches and stops after testing prime values up to a manageable limit.

```python
# Enumerate small primes up to a limit and check for solutions to (p/q) - 4/(r+1) = 1
from sympy import primerange
from fractions import Fraction

# Set maximum prime to consider
MAX_PRIME = 50

# Generate small prime list
primes = list(primerange(2, MAX_PRIME + 1))

solutions = []

for p in primes:
    for q in primes:
        for r in primes:
            # Compute left side
            left = Fraction(p, q) - Fraction(4, r + 1)
            # Check if left equals 1 exactly
            if left == 1:
                solutions.append((p, q, r))
                print((p, q, r))
```
