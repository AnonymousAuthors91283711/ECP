Based on the problem, we need to find the value of \(f(1)\) given the properties:
- \(f\) is monotonically increasing,
- For all \(x > 0\), \(f(f(x) + 2/x) = -1\).

Our approach is to analyze the functional equation and see if we can deduce the value of \(f(1)\). The key step is to consider specific values of \(x\) and explore the possible form of \(f\).

We approximate by trying various small positive values \(x\), and see how \(f\) might behave, especially at \(x=1\). Since the problem asks for the value of \(f(1)\), we proceed to compute \(f\) at various points, leveraging the functional equation. To do so, pick sample values: for example, \(x=1\), then try nearby points or iterated applications.

We will do a brute-force enumeration of possible candidate values for \(f(1)\) based on the constraints, and relate these to the functional equation.

```python
# Enumerate possible values for f(1), approximate to rational fractions or decimal guesses.
# Since f is monotonic, we consider possible consistent values based on the functional equation.
# For simplicity, choose a small range of candidate values around -1, because f(f(x) + 2/x) = -1 suggests f might relate to -1 at some points.
# Explore candidate f(1) in a small set.

import math

# Candidate values for f(1)
candidates = [-1.5, -1.25, -1.0, -0.75, -0.5]

# For each candidate, check the consistency with the functional equation at x=1
for val in candidates:
    # Set initial guess for f(1)
    f1 = val
    # Compute f(f(1) + 2/1) = f(f(1)+2) should be -1
    arg = f1 + 2
    # Since we lack explicit form, approximate f at arg as a function of candidate
    # Assuming monotonicity, f(arg) >= f(1) for arg > 1, <= for arg < 1
    # For simplicity, test if it can be close to -1
    # We assume f is constant or linear near these points
    # Display candidate with a note
    print(f"Candidate f(1) = {f1}, f(f(1)+2) ~ -1? {'Yes' if abs(-1) < 0.1 else 'No'}")
```
