The problem provides two equations involving real numbers \( a \) and \( r \):

\[
\begin{cases}
a r = 2 \\
a r^3 = 6
\end{cases}
\]

From the first equation, \( a = \frac{2}{r} \). Substituting into the second:

\[
\left(\frac{2}{r}\right) r^3 = 6 \implies 2 r^2 = 6 \implies r^2 = 3
\]

Since \( r \neq 0 \), \( r = \pm \sqrt{3} \). Then:

- If \( r = \sqrt{3} \), \( a = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \).
- If \( r = -\sqrt{3} \), \( a = \frac{2}{-\sqrt{3}} = -\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \).

Expressed with rationalized denominator:

\[
a = \pm \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} = \pm \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}
\]

The two solutions for \( a \) are:

\[
a = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3} \quad \text{or} \quad a = - \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}
\]

The conjectured answer appears to focus on the positive root:

\[
a = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3}
\]

Below is a Python code that enumerates these solutions directly, consistent with the problemâ€™s outline, emphasizing the two solutions based on the quadratic structure.

```python
import math

# Compute the two solutions for a
solution1 = (2 * math.sqrt(3)) / 3
solution2 = - (2 * math.sqrt(3)) / 3

print(solution1)
print(solution2)
# The main candidate answer (positive root)
print("Candidate answer:", solution1)
```
