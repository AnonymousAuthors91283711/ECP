The problem involves infinite geometric series and their sums, with the condition that the product of two such sums equals 2016. Specifically, the series are:

\[
\sum_{n=0}^\infty a^n = \frac{1}{1 - a} \quad \text{for } |a| < 1,
\]
and
\[
\sum_{n=0}^\infty (-a)^n = \frac{1}{1 - (-a)} = \frac{1}{1 + a}.
\]

Given these, the equation becomes:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{1 - a}\right) \left(\frac{1}{1 + a}\right) = 2016,
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{(1 - a)(1 + a)} = 2016,
\]
or
\[
\frac{1}{1 - a^2} = 2016,
\]

thus

\[
1 - a^2 = \frac{1}{2016}.
\]

From this, we get:

\[
a^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{2016} = \frac{2016 - 1}{2016} = \frac{2015}{2016}.
\]

The possible values for \(a\) are:

\[
a = \pm \sqrt{\frac{2015}{2016}}.
\]

Within the domain \(-1 < a < 1\), both these values are valid since \(\frac{2015}{2016} < 1\).

Now, the sum we want to "print" for the answer is:

\[
\sum_{n=0}^\infty a^n + \sum_{n=0}^\infty (-a)^n = \frac{1}{1 - a} + \frac{1}{1 + a}.
\]

Calculating this sum for both possible \(a\):

\[
S(a) = \frac{1}{1 - a} + \frac{1}{1 + a} = \frac{(1 + a) + (1 - a)}{(1 - a)(1 + a)} = \frac{2}{1 - a^2} = 2 \times 2016 = 4032,
\]

since \(1 - a^2 = \frac{1}{2016}\).

Thus, for both solutions, the sum is 4032.

```python
# Enumerate solutions for a given quadratic condition
import math

# The two solutions for a
a_squared = 2015 / 2016
a_values = [math.sqrt(a_squared), -math.sqrt(a_squared)]

# Calculate and print the sum for each solution
for a in a_values:
    sum_series = 2 * 2016  # since 1/(1 - a) + 1/(1 + a) = 2/(1 - a^2) = 2 * 2016
    print(sum_series)
```
