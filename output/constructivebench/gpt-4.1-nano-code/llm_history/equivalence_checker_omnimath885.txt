Ground Truth Answer: 1267
Proposed Answer: 7 * 8 / 2 * (7 + 1)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the minimal sum of a 7-element subset of natural numbers where:
   - All elements are positive
   - All elements are distinct
   - Every non-empty subset has an average that's an integer

2. The ground truth answer is 1267, which is known to be the correct minimal sum for such a set.

3. The proposed answer is 7 * 8 / 2 * (7 + 1) which simplifies to:
   7 * 4 * 8 = 224

4. 224 is clearly different from 1267, and much smaller, so it cannot be correct.

The proposed answer appears to be attempting some combinatorial calculation, but it's not giving the correct minimal sum for this problem.
