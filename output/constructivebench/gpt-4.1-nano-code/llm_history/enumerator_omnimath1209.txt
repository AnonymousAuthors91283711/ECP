[write_program]
Below is a Python program that systematically searches for this type of problem's solutions by enumerating small complex number pairs and computing the required expressions. It prints answers as it finds them, focusing on exact decimal approximations and respecting the constraints:

- Enumerates small integers for real and imaginary parts.
- Computes the complex expressions and their magnitudes.
- Checks the specified conditions.
- Prints each qualifying answer immediately.
- Limits search space for efficiency.

```python
# Enumerate complex pairs (w, z) with small integer parts
# and check the conditions: |w+z|=1, |w^2 + z^2|=14, and compute |w^3 + z^3|.

def complex_magnitude(c):
    return (c.real**2 + c.imag**2)**0.5

def main():
    results = set()
    max_imag = 5  # boundary for imaginary parts to keep search efficient
    max_real = 5

    for wr in range(-max_real, max_real + 1):
        for wi in range(-max_imag, max_imag + 1):
            for zr in range(-max_real, max_real + 1):
                for zi in range(-max_imag, max_imag + 1):
                    w = complex(wr, wi)
                    z = complex(zr, zi)
                    sum_wz = w + z
                    if abs(sum_wz) - 1.0 > 1e-6:
                        continue  # |w+z| not approximately 1
                    sum_wz_sq = w**2 + z**2
                    if abs(sum_wz_sq) - 14.0 > 1e-6:
                        continue  # |w^2 + z^2| not approximately 14
                    sum_wz_cub = w**3 + z**3
                    abs_cub = abs(sum_wz_cub)

                    # Save and print the current answer
                    answer = abs_cub
                    if answer not in results:
                        results.add(answer)
                        print(f"w={w}, z={z} => |w^3 + z^3| â‰ˆ {answer:.6f}")

    main()
