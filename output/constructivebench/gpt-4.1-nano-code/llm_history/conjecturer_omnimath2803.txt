theorem omnimath2803
(a b : ℝ)
(hab : a = (2 / 3) * b ∧ b ≠ 0)
: (9 * a + 8 * b) / (6 * a) = omnimath2803_answer :=
sorry
. Enumerated answers: 3.5. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Because a = (2/3) * b, substituting into (9*a + 8*b)/(6*a):
(9*(2/3)*b + 8*b)/(6*(2/3)*b) simplifies to (6b + 8b)/(4b) = 14b / 4b = 14/4 = 7/2 = 3.5. 

Lean expression:

<<<(7 / 2)>>>
