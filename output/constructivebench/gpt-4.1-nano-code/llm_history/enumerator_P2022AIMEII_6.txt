The problem defines a sequence \(x_i\) over a finite domain, with constraints on monotonicity, sum of absolute values, total sum, and the difference between specific terms. The goal is to find the greatest possible value of \(d = x_{75} - x_{15}\). Since you requested a Python enumeration to assist in conjecture, we will consider small sample parameters, discretized possible values, and search systematically, prioritizing exact (discrete) candidates.

Key points:
- The sequence \(x_i\) is nondecreasing: \(x_i \leq x_{i+1}\).
- Sum of absolute values is 1: \(\sum |x_i| = 1\).
- The total sum is zero: \(\sum x_i = 0\).
- The difference \(d = x_{75} - x_{15}\).

Given these, the configuration that maximizes the difference likely involves assigning the smallest (most negative) value to earlier terms and the largest (positive) to later terms, respecting the monotonicity. Since the total sum is zero, and the absolute values sum to 1, the extremal solutions tend to concentrate all "positive mass" at one point and all "negative mass" at another, with the sequence nondecreasing in between.

For enumeration:
- Use small steps, e.g., values \(-1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1\).
- Fix small subset of possible \((x_i)\) configurations satisfying the sum constraints.
- Generate candidate sequences and compute \(d\).

The code below performs an efficient enumeration of potential configurations using these discretizations.

```python
# Enumeration to estimate maximum difference d = x[75] - x[15]
# discretize possible values for x_i: -1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1
# constrain to sequences with nondecreasing order, sum of absolutes = 1, sum x_i = 0

from itertools import combinations_with_replacement, permutations

# Small discretization of possible x_i values
possible_values = [-1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1]

max_d = None
max_sequence = None

# For efficiency, focus on sequences where the sum of absolute values is 1
# We iterate over possible counts of positive and negative values summing to absolute value 1
# and assign them to the sequence in nondecreasing order

# Generate combinations with replacement of length 100
# to pick values, but to reduce runtime, limit to key configurations

# Instead, directly construct candidate sequences based on candidate partitionings

# Approach:
# - Assign -1 to some positions, 1 to others, rest 0, keeping sum of abs ==1
# - Maintain that sequence is nondecreasing
# - Compute d

for neg_count in range(1, 101):
    for pos_count in range(1, 101):
        # Total absolute sum: neg_count * 1 + pos_count * 1 = neg_count + pos_count
        total_abs = neg_count + pos_count
        if total_abs != 1:
            continue
        # Assign -1 to first neg_count positions, 0 to the middle, 1 to last pos_count positions
        seq = [-1]*neg_count + [0]*(100 - neg_count - pos_count) + [1]*pos_count
        # Sequence is nondecreasing if sorted as is
        sequence = seq
        # Compute d = x_{75} - x_{15}
        d = sequence[75] - sequence[15]
        # Check if sum of sequence is zero
        if sum(sequence) == 0:
            # Update maximum
            if (max_d is None) or (d > max_d):
                max_d = d
                max_sequence = sequence
            print(f"Candidate sequence: {sequence}")
            print(f"Difference x_75 - x_15 = {d}")
# After enumeration, output the maximum found
print(f"Maximum difference found: {max_d}")
```

This code:
- Considers simple extremal distributions.
- Checks for sequences respecting the total sum zero and absolute sum 1.
- Computes differences \( x_{75} - x_{15} \).
- Streams candidates and updates the maximum found.

Running this code helps to conjecture the maximum difference achievable under the constraints, guiding the proof in the original problem.
