The problem appears to ask for a ratio involving the count of odd factors of 21! over all factors of 21!. To assist in conjecturing the value, I will enumerate the factors of 21!, identify the odd factors, and then compute their counts for ratio calculation. Since 21! is fixed, I'll sample the factors up to a reasonable limit, but carefully focusing on the specific factors involved.

Here's the plan:
- Fix n=21, so 21! is known.
- List all factors of 21! (a large number but manageable with a proper approach).
- Identify odd factors among them.
- Compute the ratio of counts as real numbers.

Given the constraints, I’ll:
- Use small sample enumeration (e.g., factors up to 10^3) combined with prime factorization reasoning.
- Since the total number of factors of 21! is huge, I’ll approximate counts via divisor counting approach in code.
- Emphasize correctness for small samples illustrating the ratio.

```python
import math

# Calculate factorial of 21
n = 21
factorial_21 = math.factorial(n)

# Function to get all factors of a number (up to a certain limit)
def get_factors(num, limit=10**4):
    factors = set()
    for k in range(1, int(math.isqrt(limit)) + 1):
        if num % k == 0:
            factors.add(k)
            factors.add(num // k)
    return factors

# Get factors of 21! reasonably
factors = get_factors(factorial_21, limit=10**4)

# Separate odd factors
odd_factors = {k for k in factors if k % 2 == 1}

# Count total factors and odd factors
total_count = len(factors)
odd_count = len(odd_factors)

# Output the ratio as a float
ratio = odd_count / total_count

# Print results
print("Total factors of 21! (sample):", total_count)
print("Odd factors of 21! (sample):", odd_count)
print("Ratio of odd factors to total factors:", ratio)
```
