Maximum sum of A: 39. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on enumeration, the maximum sum is achieved when A contains all numbers 1 to 9 excluding 3 and 2, and with certain combinations; yet the pattern indicates the maximum sum centers around selecting high elements, especially 9 and those prior, with constraints from B. The maximum sum is 39.

Thus, an explicit expression for the maximum sum s is:

<<<37 + 2>>>
