Ground Truth Answer: fun ⟨x, y⟩ => 2 * x + (y - x^2)
Proposed Answer: fun _ => 61
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding a + b given certain conditions about quadratic equations and midpoints.

2. The ground truth answer `fun ⟨x, y⟩ => 2 * x + (y - x^2)` is derived from:
   - The conditions imply we have two points (x₁,x₁²) and (x₂,x₂²) on the parabola y = x²
   - Their midpoint is (5,101)
   - The line through these points has equation y = a*x + b
   - Calculating a and b from these conditions gives a + b = 2*5 + (101 - 5²) = 10 + (101-25) = 86

3. The proposed answer `fun _ => 61` is a constant function that always returns 61, regardless of input.

The ground truth answer correctly calculates a + b = 86 for the given midpoint (5,101), while the proposed answer incorrectly gives 61. They are not equivalent.
