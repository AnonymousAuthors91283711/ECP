The problem involves finding the greatest integer \( s \) such that there exist non-negative integers \( a, b, c, d, e \) satisfying the equation:

\[ 625a + 250b + 100c + 40d + 16e = 15^3 \]

and

\[ a + b + c + d + e = s \]

Since \( 15^3 = 3375 \), the problem reduces to expressing 3375 as a sum of the given weighted terms, and maximizing the sum \( a + b + c + d + e \).

---

We will enumerate all possible combinations respecting the constraints and find the maximum total count \( s \). The code will:

- Loop over feasible \( a, b, c, d, e \) values
- Compute the sum, check if the weighted sum equals 3375
- Track the maximum \( s \) found
- Immediately print each valid \( s \)

Efficient bounds:
- For \( a \), maximum is \( 3375/625 = 5.4 \Rightarrow 5 \)
- For \( b \), at each \( a \), maximum is \( (3375 - 625a)/250 \)
- For \( c \), maximum similarly based on remaining
- For \( d \), track remaining and limit accordingly
- For \( e \), determined directly by remaining

```python
# Enumerate all combinations of (a, b, c, d, e) that satisfy the weighted sum
# and find the maximum sum s = a + b + c + d + e.

max_s = 0
# Since 625*5=3125, max a = 5
for a in range(6):
    remain_a = 3375 - 625 * a
    if remain_a < 0:
        break
    # b max: 250 * b <= remaining
    max_b = remain_a // 250
    for b in range(max_b + 1):
        remain_b = remain_a - 250 * b
        # c max: 100 * c <= remaining
        max_c = remain_b // 100
        for c in range(max_c + 1):
            remain_c = remain_b - 100 * c
            # d max: 40 * d <= remaining
            max_d = remain_c // 40
            for d in range(max_d + 1):
                remain_d = remain_c - 40 * d
                # e determined exactly
                if remain_d >= 0 and remain_d % 16 == 0:
                    e = remain_d // 16
                    s = a + b + c + d + e
                    if s > max_s:
                        max_s = s
                        print(s)
```
