The problem appears to define an unknown answer `omnimath2942_answer` as some natural number satisfying the linear equation `3 + 11 * k`, and then states an existential theorem claiming such a `k` exists. To explore possible answers, we can enumerate some small values of `k` and compute `3 + 11 * k`. Since no bounds are specified, we'll print candidate answers for `k` from 0 upward. If the actual answer is the minimal such value, this approach should help conjecture it.

```python
# Enumerate values of k from 0 to 20, printing corresponding solutions to the equation 3 + 11*k
for k in range(21):
    answer = 3 + 11 * k
    print(f"k = {k}, answer = {answer}")
```
