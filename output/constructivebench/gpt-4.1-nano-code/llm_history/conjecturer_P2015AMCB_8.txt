abbrev P2015AMCB_8_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2015AMCB_8 : 
  (625 ^ (logb 5 2015)) ^ (1/4) = P2015AMCB_8_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 2015. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The expression simplifies using properties of logarithms: \( (625^{\log_5 2015})^{1/4} = 2015^{1/4} \). Given the enumerated answer, the likely explicit form is the fourth root of 2015, which matches the answer type.

<<<2015 ^ (1/4)>>>
