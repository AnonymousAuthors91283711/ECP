noncomputable abbrev omnimath2131_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2131 : 
  {x : ℝ | ∃ (n : ℕ), n = 2017 ∧ Nat.iterate (fun y => |y| + x) n 0 = 1} = {omnimath2131_answer} := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Candidate x values approximately satisfying the condition:. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests the sum of absolute values plus x iterated n times starting from zero should alternate, implying x = -(n-1). Given n=2017, the answer is \(-2016\). 
Therefore, the final answer is:
<<<-2016>>>
