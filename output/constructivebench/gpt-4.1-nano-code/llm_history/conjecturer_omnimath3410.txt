abbrev omnimath3410_answer : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3410 (x y : ℝ) : 20 * (x + y) - 19 * (y + x) = omnimath3410_answer x y := by sorry. Enumerated answers: x=0, y=0 -> answer=0
x=1, y=0 -> answer=1
x=0, y=1 -> answer=1
x=-1, y=1 -> answer=0
x=0.5, y=0.5 -> answer=1.0
x=-2, y=3 -> answer=1
x=1.5, y=-0.5 -> answer=1.0
x=-1.5, y=-2.5 -> answer=-4.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ → ℝ
The pattern suggests the answer depends only on the sum x + y, scaled appropriately; differences cancel out. From enumerations, answer appears to be 2 * (x + y). 

Thus, the simplified closed form is 2 times the sum of x and y.
