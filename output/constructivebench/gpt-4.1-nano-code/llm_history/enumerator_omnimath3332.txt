This problem involves sorting a list of very large numbers raised to high exponents, where the goal appears to be verifying the sorted order of the given list. Since directly computing these large powers precisely is impractical, we can compare their logarithms to determine the order. This approach avoids massive computations and allows for efficient enumeration.

Here's the approach:
- Compute the logarithm of each number to compare their sizes.
- Generate all permutations of the list, check if they are sorted in non-decreasing order according to the logs.
- As soon as a sorted permutation is found, print it.
- Since the list is small (4 elements), checking all permutations (24 total) is feasible.
- We output the sorted list as per the theorem's goal, matching the insertion sort of the list.

```python
import math
from itertools import permutations

# List of large numbers (powers of numbers)
numbers = [5**56, 10**51, 17**35, 31**28]

# Compute logs to compare sizes without heavy computation
logs = [math.log(x) for x in numbers]

# Generate all permutations
for perm in permutations(numbers):
    perm_logs = [math.log(x) for x in perm]
    # Check if permutation is sorted non-decreasingly by log
    if all(perm_logs[i] <= perm_logs[i+1] for i in range(len(perm)-1)):
        print(list(perm))
        break
```
