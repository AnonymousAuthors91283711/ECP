The problem involves summing over k from 0 to 99 of the expression 1 / (2 * floor(sqrt(k+1)) + 1). Let's analyze the structure:

- For each k, compute m = floor(sqrt(k+1)).
- The term becomes 1 / (2m + 1).
- The sum across k depends on the value of m.

Floor of sqrt(k+1) remains constant over certain ranges:

- when m = 1, k+1 in [1, 4], k in [0, 3]
- when m = 2, k+1 in [4, 9], k in [3, 8]
- when m = 3, k+1 in [9, 16], k in [8, 15]
- and so on, up to m â‰ˆ 10, since sqrt(100) = 10.

Let's find these ranges systematically and sum the contributions, noting the floor values:

We will enumerate m from 1 up to 10, determine the corresponding k-range, and sum.

```python
# Enumerate m from 1 to 10, find corresponding k ranges, sum terms.

for m in range(1, 11):
    start = (m - 1) ** 2  # k+1 start
    end = m ** 2          # k+1 end (inclusive)
    # k ranges from start - 1 to end - 2
    k_start = start - 1
    k_end = end - 2
    count = k_end - k_start + 1
    term_value = 1 / (2 * m + 1)
    total_contribution = count * term_value
    # Since partial sums are requested, print each contribution
    print(f"m={m}, k-range=({k_start},{k_end}), count={count}, term={term_value}, contribution={total_contribution}")
```

Running this code will output the sum of the series by summing these contributions. The total sum is the sum over all m's contributions.

```python
for m in range(1, 11):
    start = (m - 1) ** 2
    end = m ** 2
    k_start = start - 1
    k_end = end - 2
    count = k_end - k_start + 1
    term_value = 1 / (2 * m + 1)
    contribution = count * term_value
    print(contribution)
```
