Let's analyze the problem step-by-step.

The theorem involves finding the least natural number n > 0 such that:

\[
\frac{n + 1}{2n + 1} < \frac{1}{100}
\]

Our goal is to compute the smallest n satisfying this inequality.

Rearranging the inequality:

\[
\frac{n + 1}{2n + 1} < \frac{1}{100}
\]

Cross-multiplied (noting all quantities positive):

\[
100(n + 1) < 2n + 1
\]

Simplify:

\[
100n + 100 < 2n + 1
\]

Bring all n's to one side:

\[
100n - 2n < 1 - 100
\]

\[
98n < -99
\]

Since \( n \ge 1 \), and the left side is positive, but the right side is negative, the inequality cannot hold for any positive n.

Hence, the set of such n is empty, which suggests there is no n > 0 satisfying the inequality.

But to confirm, we can verify for small n:

- For n=1: \(\frac{2}{3} \approx 0.6667\) > 0.01
- For n=10: \(\frac{11}{21} \approx 0.5238\) > 0.01
- For n=100: \(\frac{101}{201} \approx 0.5025\) > 0.01

As n increases, \(\frac{n+1}{2n+1} \to \frac{1}{2}\), which is always greater than 0.01. So, no positive n makes the ratio less than 1/100.

So the set is empty.

I'll write code to verify this behavior for small n values.

```python
# Enumerate n from 1 to 200 to verify if any satisfy the inequality
# Since the ratio approaches 0.5 and never falls below 0.01, there should be none
for n in range(1, 201):
    value = (n + 1) / (2 * n + 1)
    if value < 1/100:
        print(f"Found n={n} with ratio={value}")
print("No n > 0 satisfies the inequality.")
```
This code exhaustively checks small n and confirms the suspected emptiness of the set.
