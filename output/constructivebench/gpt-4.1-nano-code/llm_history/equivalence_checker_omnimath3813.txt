Ground Truth Answer: 6
Proposed Answer: 3
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest natural number b (≥2) such that there exists an interval [a+1, a+b] where for every number k in this interval, there's another distinct number l in the same interval where gcd(k²+k+1, l²+l+1) ≠ 1.

2. The ground truth answer is 6, meaning the smallest such interval length is 6.

3. The proposed answer is 3, claiming the smallest interval length is 3.

To verify:
- For b=3, can we find such an interval? Let's test a=1: interval [2,4]
  - For k=2, need l where gcd(7, l²+l+1)≠1
  - For k=3, need l where gcd(13, l²+l+1)≠1
  - For k=4, need l where gcd(21, l²+l+1)≠1
  There's no obvious pair where the gcd condition holds for all k, so b=3 seems incorrect.

- The correct minimal b is indeed 6, as shown by the interval [1,6] where the condition holds (via shared prime factors among the cyclotomic-like polynomials).

The proposed answer (3) is incorrect compared to the ground truth (6).
