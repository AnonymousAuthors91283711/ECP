[write_program]
This code appears to be a Lean theorem involving a custom recursive sequence, and it asks for computing certain p-adic valuations, likely to determine divisibility properties at primes 2 and 5. To assist in conjecturing the answer, I'll write a Python program that recursively generates the sequence values for small n, then computes their p-adic valuations to compare.

Since the sequence is defined with base cases and recursion:
- custom_sequence(0) = 2
- custom_sequence(1) = 5
- custom_sequence(n+2) = custom_sequence(n) * custom_sequence(n+1)

I will generate values for n up to 14 (as in the theorem), but to avoid huge computations, we'll just compute these up to n=14 explicitly.

Then, I will compute:
- The 2-adic valuation of custom_sequence(14)
- The 5-adic valuation of custom_sequence(14)

Finally, print the minimum of these two valuations to aid in conjecturing the answer.

```python
import sys

def generate_sequence(n):
    seq = [2, 5]
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        seq.append(seq[i-2] * seq[i-1])
    return seq

def p_adic_valuation(n, p):
    count = 0
    while n % p == 0 and n > 0:
        n //= p
        count += 1
    return count

# Generate sequence up to n=14
sequence = generate_sequence(14)

# Compute p-adic valuations for custom_sequence(14)
val_2 = p_adic_valuation(sequence[14], 2)
val_5 = p_adic_valuation(sequence[14], 5)

# Output results for comparison
print(f"custom_sequence(14) = {sequence[14]}")
print(f"Valuation at 2: {val_2}")
print(f"Valuation at 5: {val_5}")
print(f"Minimum valuation: {min(val_2, val_5)}")
```
