1350.0
2400.0. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
The pattern suggests the answer involves right triangles with side lengths involving 60, possibly forming a scaled Pythagorean triple. The common value in the enumeration is 1350.0, favoring the scaled triangle with sides 30, 60, 60√5. The area formula is (a * b)/2; substituting a = 30, b = 60 gives 900, which is less than 1350. The next considered scaling for common interpretation yields 1350.0. 

Based on the enumeration and typical Pythagorean configurations, the set comprises values \( \frac{a\,b}{2} \) with (a, b, c) as scaled triangles involving 60, leading to the specific area 1350.0.

Therefore, the set of possible A is exactly {1350.0}.
