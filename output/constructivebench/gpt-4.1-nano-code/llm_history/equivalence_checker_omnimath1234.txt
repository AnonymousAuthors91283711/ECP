  let S := ∑ k in Finset.range 2009, if Even k then choose 2009 k else 0
  log 2 S = omnimath1234_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 1004
Proposed Answer: 2008
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves calculating the sum of even binomial coefficients C(2009, k) for k from 0 to 2008 (since Finset.range 2009 gives numbers from 0 to 2008).

2. The sum of even binomial coefficients for (1+1)^n is known to be 2^(n-1). For odd n (like 2009), this holds exactly.

3. Therefore, S = 2^(2009-1) = 2^2008.

4. Taking log base 2 of S gives log₂(2^2008) = 2008.

5. The ground truth answer claims this should be 1004, which would only be correct if we were taking log base 4 (since 4^1004 = 2^2008), but the problem clearly specifies log base 2.

The proposed answer (2008) is correct, while the ground truth answer (1004) is incorrect for log base 2.
