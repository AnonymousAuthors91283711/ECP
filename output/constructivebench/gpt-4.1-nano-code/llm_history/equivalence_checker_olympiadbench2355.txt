Ground Truth Answer: 2/9
Proposed Answer: 1
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves two dice rolls:
   - First roll uses initialFaces [1,2,3,4,6,8]
   - Second roll's faces depend on the first roll's outcome (odd/even)

2. For the probability calculation:
   - Total outcomes: 6 (first roll) * 6 (second roll) = 36
   - Favorable outcomes where second roll shows '2':
     - If first roll is odd (1,3): second roll faces become [2,2,6,4,6,8] → count of 2's is 2
     - If first roll is even (2,4,6,8): second roll faces become [1,1,3,2,3,4] → count of 2's is 1
     - Total favorable: 2 (for 1) + 2 (for 3) + 1 (for 2) + 1 (for 4) + 1 (for 6) + 1 (for 8) = 8

3. Probability calculation:
   - 8 favorable / 36 total = 2/9 (simplified)

The ground truth answer (2/9) is correct, while the proposed answer (1) is incorrect.
