This problem involves a specific polynomial with binomial coefficient-based coefficients and asks for the floor of the product of its nonreal roots. The polynomial resembles the expansion of \((X - 1)^4\) with some additional constant, but the constant term suggests a relation to binomial coefficients and roots of unity.

Given the structure:
\[ p(X) = X^4 - 4X^3 + 6X^2 - 4X - 2005 \]
which resembles the binomial expansion of \((X - 1)^4 = X^4 - 4X^3 + 6X^2 - 4X + 1 \),
but with a constant term \(-2005\) instead of \(+1\).

The roots are related to solutions of the polynomial, which is nearly \((X-1)^4 = 2006\). Solving:
\[(X - 1)^4 = 2006 \]

The roots are:
\[ X = 1 + \sqrt[4]{2006} e^{i\pi k/2} \quad \text{for } k = 0, 1, 2, 3 \]

The roots come in pairs of conjugates, where the nonreal roots are for \(k = 1, 3\). For these:
- \(z_1 = 1 + r e^{i\pi/2} = 1 + r i\)
- \(z_3 = 1 + r e^{i 3\pi/2} = 1 - r i\)

where \(r = \sqrt[4]{2006}\).

Their product:
\[ z_1 z_3 = (1 + r i)(1 - r i) = 1 - r^2 i^2 = 1 + r^2 \]

since \(i^2 = -1\).

Given that \(r^4 = 2006\), then \(r^2 = \sqrt{2006}\).

Therefore:
\[ P = \prod_{z \text{ nonreal}} z = 1 + \sqrt{2006} \]

The problem asks for the floor of the real part of \(P\):
\[ \lfloor P \rfloor = \lfloor 1 + \sqrt{2006} \rfloor \]

Estimate \(\sqrt{2006}\):
- \(44^2 = 1936\)
- \(45^2 = 2025\)

Since 2006 is between 1936 and 2025, \(\sqrt{2006}\) is between 44 and 45.

Interpolating roughly:
\[
44 + \frac{2006 - 1936}{2025 - 1936} = 44 + \frac{70}{89} \approx 44 + 0.7865 \approx 44.7865
\]

Thus:
\[
P \approx 1 + 44.7865 \approx 45.7865
\]
and
\[
\lfloor P \rfloor = 45
\]

```python
# Approximate the value of sqrt(2006)
import math
r = math.sqrt(2006)
product_nonreal_roots = 1 + r
# Output the floor of the product
print(math.floor(product_nonreal_roots))
```
