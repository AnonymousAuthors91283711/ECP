This problem involves analyzing the set \(\{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid \exists y > 0, x > 0 \wedge x + y^2 = xy\}\) and finding its infimum. To assist in conjecturing, we'll enumerate candidate values of \(x\) based on fixed small \(y\) values and check whether \(x\) satisfies the given conditions, then estimate the infimum through these results.

Our plan:
- Fix small \(y\) values and solve for \(x\).
- For each \(y\), find \(x\) satisfying the equation \(x + y^2 = xy\) which simplifies to \(x(1 - y) = - y^2\).
- For each \(x\), check if \(x > 0\) and \(y > 0\).
- Output all such \(x\), and eventually identify the infimum candidate.

```python
# Enumerate possible y > 0 values
y_values = [0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2]
possible_xs = []

for y in y_values:
    # Solve for x: x(1 - y) = - y^2
    denom = 1 - y
    if abs(denom) > 1e-8:
        x = - y**2 / denom
        # Check x > 0 and y > 0
        if x > 0:
            print(f"y = {y:.2f}, x = {x:.2f} (from x(1 - y) = - y^2)")
            possible_xs.append(x)
    elif abs(denom) < 1e-8:
        # Then the equation reduces or no solution; skip
        pass

# Estimate the minimal x from enumerated solutions
if possible_xs:
    min_x = min(possible_xs)
    print(f"Estimated infimum: {min_x:.2f}")
```
