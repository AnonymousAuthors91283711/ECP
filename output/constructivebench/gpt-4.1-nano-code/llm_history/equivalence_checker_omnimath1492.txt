Ground Truth Answer: {(0, 0), (1, 1)}
Proposed Answer: {
  (-1, -1),
  (-1, 1),
  (0, 0),
  (1, -1),
  (1, 1)
}

The proposed answer includes all the correct solutions from the ground truth answer ({(0,0), (1,1)}), but also includes additional pairs ((-1,-1), (-1,1), (1,-1)) that are not correct solutions to the equation. The equation involves absolute values (natAbs), so negative values of n and m should produce the same results as their positive counterparts. However, the only valid solutions are (0,0) and (1,1), as these are the only integer pairs that satisfy the equation 2^(3^|n|) = 3^(2^|m|) - 1. The proposed answer is mostly correct but includes extraneous solutions.
