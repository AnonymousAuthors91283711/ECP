. Enumerated answers: 9954. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the cyclic conditions and the nature of the divisibility, the pattern suggests the answer is a fixed rearrangement sum of digits. The two modular constraints involve shifts of the digits, hinting at a constant value. Since the enumerated solutions include 9954, which likely results from digit permutation properties, the closed-form answer is a sum involving the digits E,V,I,L. Based on patterns, the answer is the sum of E, V, I, L, multiplied appropriately. With the divisibility constraints and typical digit properties, the consistent fixed answer fitting the problem is 9954.
