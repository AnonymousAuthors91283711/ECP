Your task appears to involve a high-school level mathematics problem involving particular parameters, but the provided code module `Mathlib` and the theorem `omnimath2876` with `sorry` placeholders suggest that the core problem is to find a specific value or establish a specific output for a function defined over natural numbers.

Since the problem requires enumerating possible answers and verifying a particular example, I will implement a Python script that systematically explores small values, matching the given parameters (`a=15`, `n=51`) and streams answers, focusing on matching the targeted solution of 218, without pre-hardcoding, and capable of examining candidate answers effectively.

From the information, the main goal appears to be to find the value of `omnimath2876_answer a n`, especially when `a=15`, `n=51`. To maximize efficiency, I will assume the task is to count or compute some property, and I'll attempt to evaluate plausible responses, perhaps by series or divisor considerations, and print candidate answers as they are found.

Below is a Python script that enumerates through small candidate values for a parameter (like `a`, `n`), and computes an expression relevant to the problem (for example, sum of divisors, factorials, or combinations), striving to find the value 218 when `a=15`, `n=51`. It will print every answer it computes within reasonable bounds, prioritizing these as per instructions.

```python
# We attempt to compute candidate answers based on small parameters.
# Since the problem references specific values a=15, n=51 and an answer 218,
# we'll generate candidate answers based on possible small computations.

def candidate_answers():
    max_a = 20  # small sample values for 'a'
    max_n = 60  # small sample values for 'n'
    for a in range(1, max_a + 1):
        for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
            # Example candidate computation: sum of first 'a' numbers times n divided by some factor
            answer = (a * (a + 1) // 2) * n  # sum of 1..a times n
            # For some answers, check if close to 218 for specific parameters
            # And print every computed answer to assist conjecture
            print(f"Testing a={a}, n={n}, candidate answer={answer}")
            if a == 15 and n == 51:
                # Specifically check for the provided example
                if answer == 218:
                    print(f"Found target answer 218 for a={a}, n={n}")
                elif abs(answer - 218) <= 10:
                    print(f"Close answer {answer} for a={a}, n={n}")
