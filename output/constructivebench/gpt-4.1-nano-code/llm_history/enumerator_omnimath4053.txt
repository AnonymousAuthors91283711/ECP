This problem appears to involve analyzing polynomials with integer coefficients with respect to prime factorization properties of evaluated values at natural numbers. The key insight is that for larger `n`, the prime factors count of `n` influences the restrictions on the evaluations of `P`.

Since `sorry` indicates a placeholder, the goal is likely to characterize all such polynomials `P` satisfying the condition for all sufficiently large `n`. Given the context, we can hypothesize that the set `omnimath4053_answer` consists of very specific polynomials, possibly constant or linear, ensuring the prime factors behave as described.

We will:
- Consider simple polynomials: constant polynomials and linear polynomials with integer coefficients.
- Enumerate possible candidates up to some small bounds.
- Recognize that high power prime factors constraints suggest some consistent pattern: the evaluation at large `n` might always produce numbers with prime factors constrained by a given relation.

Here's a Python program that generates candidate polynomials of degree 0 or 1 with small integer coefficients, evaluates their values at small `n`, and checks the prime factor counts to spot patterns. It outputs each candidate polynomial as soon as it is identified as satisfying heuristic constraints, streamlining the candidate exploration.

```python
import sympy
from sympy import primerange

# Function to count prime factors with multiplicity
def prime_factor_count(n):
    count = 0
    for p in primerange(2, n+1):
        while n % p == 0:
            n //= p
            count += 1
        if n == 1:
            break
    return count

# Generate candidate polynomials of degree 0 or 1 with small integer coefficients
# P(x) = c or P(x) = a*x + b
candidates = []

# Degree 0: constant polynomials with coefficients -3..3
for c in range(-3, 4):
    candidates.append((c,))

# Degree 1: linear polynomials with coefficients -3..3
for a in range(-3, 4):
    for b in range(-3, 4):
        candidates.append((a, b))

# Test candidates at small n and check prime factors
for coeffs in candidates:
    if len(coeffs) == 1:
        c = coeffs[0]
        def P(x): return c
    else:
        a, b = coeffs
        def P(x): return a * x + b

    # Check over small range of n
    valid = True
    for n in range(1, 6):
        val = P(n)
        abs_val = abs(val)
        # Count prime factors
        count_pf = prime_factor_count(abs_val) if abs_val > 1 else 0
        # Condition: if prime_factor_count > n's prime factor count (rough check)
        n_pf_count = prime_factor_count(n) if n > 1 else 0
        if count_pf > n_pf_count + 1:
            valid = False
            break
    if valid:
        print(f"Candidate polynomial: {coeffs}")
```
