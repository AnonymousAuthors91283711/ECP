[write_program]
The problem appears to deal with colorings of a 3D grid (n x n x n), considering all possible colorings with `k` colors, and finding the greatest number of colors such that certain uniformity conditions hold across all slices in each dimension. To assist in formulating and conjecturing the answer, we'll write a program to test small values of `k` (number of colors) for a fixed `n` and check whether the conditions hold universally. We will:

- Fix small `n` (say, 3 for simplicity).
- Iterate over candidate `k` (from 1 upwards).
- For each `k`, perform a simplified check: verify whether any coloring violates the uniformity condition.
- Since exhaustive search over all colorings is huge, limit the search to small subsets (e.g., random or systematically check representative colorings).
- Initialize with `k=1` and go upward, printing findings immediately.
- We won't fully verify the theorem, but will aid in conjecture by testing small cases.

```python
import itertools

def check_coloring(n, k, coloring):
    # Check uniformity condition for all orientations and slices
    for orientation in range(3):
        for slice_idx in range(n):
            # Collect colors on the slice
            slice_colors = set()
            for i in range(n):
                for j in range(n):
                    coord = [0,0,0]
                    coord[orientation] = slice_idx
                    coord[(orientation+1)%3] = i
                    coord[(orientation+2)%3] = j
                    color = coloring[tuple(coord)]
                    slice_colors.add(color)
            if len(slice_colors) != 1:
                return False
    return True

    # Generate all colorings (can be large; here limit for small n)
    # For demonstration, process only a few colorings
    total_cells = n ** 3

                    idx +=1
        yield coloring
