[write_program]
This appears to be a Lean theorem involving basic powers of 2, but the structure is not directly related to Python enumeration. The statement is:

\[ 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 \]

which can be directly calculated. The problem seems to be asking for enumerating a possible answer for some value, with a focus on verifying or finding the sum.

Given the code, the theorem `omnimath2792` claims that:

\[ 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 = \text{omnimath2792_answer} \]

which by direct calculation is:

\[ 8 + 4 + 2 = 14 \]

So, an appropriate Python program to enumerate possible answers approaches constructing sums of powers of 2, or more generally, enumerates candidate sums of such terms, printing exact or approximate results.

Because the problem suggests enumeration, and the sum is straightforward, I'll write a program that systematically evaluates sums of powers of 2, maybe with varying exponents, to confirm such sums or to generate similar candidate sums.

Here's the Python code that enumerates sums of 2's powers for exponents 1 to 3:

```python
# Enumerate sums of powers of 2 for exponents 1 to 3
# Print each sum immediately

max_exponent = 3
for subset_mask in range(1, 1 << max_exponent):  # iterate over all non-empty subsets
    sum_value = 0
    exponents_used = []
    for i in range(max_exponent):
        if (subset_mask & (1 << i)) != 0:
            exp = i + 1
            sum_value += 2 ** exp
            exponents_used.append(exp)
    # Only print sums up to total of 3 terms
    print(f"Sum of powers for exponents {exponents_used}: {sum_value}")
```

This code enumerates all non-empty subsets of exponents 1, 2, 3 and sums their powers of 2, printing each result immediately. It is efficient, direct, and stream-based.
