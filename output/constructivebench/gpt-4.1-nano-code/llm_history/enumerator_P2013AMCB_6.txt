This problem appears to involve finding the value of `x + y` given the equation involving `x^2 + y^2`, which suggests completing the square or using geometric interpretations (e.g., circle equations). Since the answer must be obtained algorithmically and the structure resembles completing the square, we can consider the following approach:

- Recognize the given equation as a circle in terms of `x` and `y`.
- Complete the square for both `x` and `y` to find the center and radius of the circle.
- The maximum/minimum of `x + y` occurs at the points on the circle in the direction of the vector `(1, 1)`.
- Compute the maximum (or a particular value) of `x + y` by projecting the circle onto this direction.

Implement a small enumeration over candidate points or directly compute the extremal value using algebraic operations.

```python
import math

# Given equation: x^2 + y^2 = 10x - 6y - 34
# Complete the square:
# x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y = -34
# (x^2 - 10x + 25) + (y^2 + 6y + 9) = -34 + 25 + 9
# (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 0
# Wait, check arithmetic:
# Add 25 to both sides: x^2 - 10x + 25
# Add 9 to both sides: y^2 + 6y + 9
# Total added: 25 + 9 = 34
# Sum on RHS: -34 + 34 = 0
# So the circle is centered at (5, -3) with radius 0, i.e., point (5, -3)
# Hence, x = 5, y = -3, and x + y = 2

# The equation reduces to a single point, so the solution is unique
print("Answer: 5 + (-3) =", 5 - 3)
```
