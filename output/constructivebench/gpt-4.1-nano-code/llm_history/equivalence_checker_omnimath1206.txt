Ground Truth Answer: fun a b c => (1 / (a + 1)) + (1 / (b + 1)) + (1 / (c + 1))
Proposed Answer: fun a b c => -2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us a cubic equation (X-a)(X-b)(X-c) = X³ - X + 1, which means a, b, c are its roots.
2. The ground truth answer computes the sum of reciprocals of (each root + 1).
3. The proposed answer simply returns -2 for any inputs.

To check equivalence:
- From Vieta's formulas for X³ - X + 1 = 0, we know:
  a + b + c = 0
  ab + bc + ca = -1
  abc = -1
- The ground truth expression can be rewritten as:
  (1/(a+1) + 1/(b+1) + 1/(c+1)) = [(b+1)(c+1) + (a+1)(c+1) + (a+1)(b+1)] / [(a+1)(b+1)(c+1)]
- Numerator expands to 3 + 2(a+b+c) + (ab+bc+ca) = 3 + 0 + (-1) = 2
- Denominator expands to 1 + (a+b+c) + (ab+bc+ca) + abc = 1 + 0 + (-1) + (-1) = -1
- Therefore the sum equals 2/(-1) = -2

The proposed answer correctly gives -2, which matches the ground truth's computation.
