. Enumerated answers: (2, 2, 3)
. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ × ℕ)
Given (p.Prime ∧ p^x - y^p = 1) and the enumeration (2, 2, 3), the general solution adheres to p = 3, x = 2, y = 2, satisfying 3^2 - 2^3 = 1. This pattern suggests the answer set contains solely this triple, generalizable by the singleton set.
