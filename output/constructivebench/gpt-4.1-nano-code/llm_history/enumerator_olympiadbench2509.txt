The problem involves solving a system of three equations involving logarithms with base \( a \). Given the constraints \( a > 0 \) and \( a \neq 1 \), and the equations:

\[
\begin{cases}
\log_a (3 + b) + c = 5 \\
\log_a (5 + b) + c = 4 \\
\log_a (11 + b) + c = 3
\end{cases}
\]

We want to find all triples \((a, b, c)\) satisfying these equations.

Since the logarithms involve base \( a \), it is natural to consider specific sample values of \( a \) that are positive and not one (e.g., \( a = 2, 3, 0.5 \)). For each value, we can solve for \( b \) and \( c \) accordingly and check if they satisfy the equations.

The equations suggest that the differences between the logs are constant:  
\[
(\log_a (3 + b) + c) - (\log_a (5 + b) + c) = 1 \Rightarrow \log_a \frac{3 + b}{5 + b} = 1,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
\frac{3 + b}{5 + b} = a^1 = a.
\]
Similarly,
\[
\frac{5 + b}{11 + b} = a^{1} \text{ or consistent ratios} \text{, or variations thereof}.
\]

But to stay within the requirements, the code will iterate over sample \( a \) and compute corresponding \( b, c \).

Here's the Python program to do that.

```python
# Enumerate sample base values a and solve systematically
# for b, c satisfying the given equations.

import math

# Sample base values for a (try several positive values not equal to 1)
sample_as = [0.5, 2, 3]

# Threshold for b (to limit search)
b_min, b_max, step_b = -20, 20, 0.5

for a in sample_as:
    if a <= 0 or a == 1:
        continue
    print(f"Trying base a = {a}")
    for b in [b_min + i * step_b for i in range(int((b_max - b_min)/step_b) + 1)]:
        # Compute c from first equation: c = 5 - log_a(3 + b)
        # Check if 3 + b > 0 for log definition
        if 3 + b <= 0:
            continue
        c1 = 5 - math.log(3 + b, a)
        # Validate second equation: check if log_a(5 + b) + c â‰ˆ 4
        if 5 + b <= 0:
            continue
        c2 = 4 - math.log(5 + b, a)
        # Validate third equation
        if 11 + b <= 0:
            continue
        c3 = 3 - math.log(11 + b, a)
        # Check consistency within a small tolerance
        if abs(c1 - c2) < 1e-5 and abs(c2 - c3) < 1e-5:
            c = (c1 + c2 + c3) / 3
            print(f"Found candidate: a={a:.2f}, b={b:.2f}, c={c:.2f}")
```
