. Enumerated Answers: Numerator: 6
Denominator: 19
Fraction: 6/19
Sum of numerator and denominator: 25. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The error occurs because the answer expression is incorrectly written with delimiters <<< and also involves a sum that is not of type ℕ. We need to produce a proper ℕ value that matches the sum of numerator and denominator, which is 25, given that m=6 and n=19 are coprime, with the fraction 6/19.

Since the problem asks for the value of m + n as a ℕ, the correct answer should be the sum 25, representing the total of numerator and denominator, consistent with the enumeration. The previous proposal mixes the numerical expression with the delimiter syntax that Lean does not recognize.

Therefore, the simplest correct answer, following the expected definition, is the number 25 directly, which is ℕ, the sum of numerator and denominator.

. Enumerated Answers: Numerator: 6
Denominator: 19
Fraction: 6/19
Sum of numerator and denominator: 25. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The given problem involves identifying the sum of numerator and denominator of a fraction with certain coprimality conditions. The fraction provided in the enumeration is \( \frac{6}{19} \) with numerator 6 and denominator 19, which are coprime, and their sum is 25. Since the goal is to provide a concrete value of type ℕ representing this sum, and avoid any syntax errors, the correct response is simply the natural number 25. The previous errors arose from including extraneous words and syntax that are not valid in Lean.

Thus, the fixed answer, enclosed with delimiters, directly states the number 25, which matches the enumeration and the logical deductions.
