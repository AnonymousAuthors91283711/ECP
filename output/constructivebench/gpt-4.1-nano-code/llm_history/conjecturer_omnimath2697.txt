theorem omnimath2697 : 
  ∃! (w : ℚ), 3/5 * w = 1/3 ∧ w = omnimath2697_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Candidate w: 5/9
Candidate w: 5/9
Exact solution: 5/9
Verified solution: 5/9. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The equation is (3/5)*w = 1/3. Solving for w yields w = (1/3) * (5/3) = 5/9. This confirms the candidate answer.  
Final answer: <<<5/9>>>
