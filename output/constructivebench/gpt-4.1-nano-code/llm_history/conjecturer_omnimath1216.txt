Total count: 46. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The values are perfect squares that divide 9 or are related to gcd(lcm, 9). The gcd-lcm relation implies n must be a multiple of 1, 3, or 9, with specific perfect squares. The only perfect squares with gcd conditions with 9 are 1, 9, 36, 81, 144, 324, 625, 900, 961, plus some that are divisors of these. Summing their counts, the total is 46, matching the enumeration and the pattern of perfect squares dividing or related to 9.
