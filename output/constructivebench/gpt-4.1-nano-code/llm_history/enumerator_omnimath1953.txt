This problem involves analyzing functions \(f : \mathrm{Fin}\,5 \to \mathrm{Fin}\,5\) with a property `IsNasty`, characterized by the condition that no two distinct elements a, b satisfy \(f(a) = b\), \(f(b) = a\), and \(a \neq b\). Equivalently, `IsNasty` functions are those containing no 2-cycle (no pair of elements swapped). The theorem wants the enumeration of such functions' cardinality, which involves counting functions avoiding 2-cycles.

Key observations:
- \(\mathrm{Fin}\,5\) has 5 elements: {0,1,2,3,4}.
- Total functions: \(5^5 = 3125\).
- We need to find the number of functions WITHOUT any 2-cycle (no swapped pairs).

Approach:
- For each possible combination of fixed points, 1-cycles, and cycles of length ≥ 3, count the functions avoiding 2-cycles.
- For each subset of elements involved in 2-cycles, exclude functions creating such cycles.
- Since directly computing is complex, we settle with a sample enumeration of functions that satisfy the condition.

In the code:
- We'll consider small sample functions, especially those with no 2-cycle.
- For illustration, we generate all functions f : {0,1,2,3,4} → {0,1,2,3,4}, test whether they contain 2-cycles, and count the valid ones.
- Due to combinatorial explosion, we limit to small, manageable enumeration.

This code computes and counts functions with no 2-cycle, then outputs the count.

```python
# Enumerate all functions from Fin 5 to Fin 5 and count those with no 2-cycle
from itertools import product

def has_2_cycle(f):
    # Check if there's a pair a ≠ b with f(a)=b and f(b)=a
    for a in range(5):
        for b in range(a+1, 5):
            if f[a] == b and f[b] == a:
                return True
    return False

count_no_2_cycle = 0

# Generate all functions as tuples of length 5 with values 0..4
for f in product(range(5), repeat=5):
    if not has_2_cycle(f):
        print(f)
        count_no_2_cycle += 1

print("Total functions with no 2-cycle:", count_no_2_cycle)
```
