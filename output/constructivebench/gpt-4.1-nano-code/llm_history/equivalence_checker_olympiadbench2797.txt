Ground Truth Answer: 95
Proposed Answer: 85
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the greatest rational number r satisfying certain conditions, and then asking for the sum of its numerator and denominator.

2. The ground truth answer is 95, which means the rational number in question would be something like x/y where x + y = 95.

3. The proposed answer is 85, suggesting a different rational number where numerator + denominator = 85.

4. The expression given is r = 6/7 + 5/49 * (1 / (1 - 1/49)). Let's simplify this:
   - The geometric series part sums to 1/(1-1/49) = 49/48
   - So r = 6/7 + (5/49)*(49/48) = 6/7 + 5/48
   - 6/7 = 288/336, 5/48 = 35/336
   - r = 323/336
   - 323 + 336 = 659, which doesn't match either answer

Wait, this suggests neither answer is correct based on the given expression. However, looking back at the problem statement, there might be a different interpretation:

The problem defines r as the greatest rational in a set defined by a more complex condition, and then gives a specific expression for r. The ground truth answer (95) likely comes from correctly evaluating this expression, while the proposed answer (85) is incorrect.

Since the ground truth is 95 and proposed is 85, they are different.
