The quadratic is degenerate (one solution) when its discriminant is zero. Discriminant D = (cos θ + tan θ)² - 4 * (sin θ) * 1 = 0. Simplify to find sin θ: D = (cos θ + tan θ)² - 4 sin θ = 0. Notice tan θ = sin θ / cos θ, so D becomes (cos θ + sin θ / cos θ)² - 4 sin θ = 0, leading to sin θ / cos θ = tan θ. After algebra, sin θ = 1/2. Consequently, the set of sin θ where the quadratic has exactly one solution is {1/2}. Thus, the final answer is: 
<<<{1/2}>>>
