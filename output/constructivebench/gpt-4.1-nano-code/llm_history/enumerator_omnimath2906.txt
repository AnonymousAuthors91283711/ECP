This problem involves finding the value of the expression \(4x^2 - 3x^2\) when \(x = 2\), and then defining that as `omnimath2906_answer`. Since the expression simplifies to \(x^2\), the answer should be \(2^2 = 4\). 

To demonstrate the enumeration approach without hard-coding, we'll write a Python script that evaluates the expression for small candidate values around 2, confirms the exact match, and outputs the result. This helps in understanding or conjecturing the answer.

```python
# Enumerate candidate values for x around 2
candidates = [1.9, 1.95, 2.0, 2.05, 2.1, 2.2]

# Evaluate the expression for each candidate
for x in candidates:
    result = 4 * x**2 - 3 * x**2
    print(f"For x = {x}, 4x^2 - 3x^2 = {result}")

# Since x = 2 is given as hx, explicitly output the simplified result
x_exact = 2
answer = 4 * x_exact**2 - 3 * x_exact**2
print(f"At x = {x_exact}, the value is {answer}")
```
