The pattern indicates functions that tend to infinity linearly or polynomially, i.e., functions with asymptotic behavior consistent with polynomial or linear growth, which tend to infinity as x → ∞ and satisfy the condition P. The class of functions with this property include all affine functions of the form f(x) = a * x + b with real a, b.

Hence, the explicit set of functions is all functions of the form f(x) = a * x + b for some reals a, b.
