The problem investigates solutions to a system of three equations involving positive real variables \(x, y, z\):
\[
\begin{cases}
x + \frac{y}{z} = 2 \\
y + \frac{z}{x} = 2 \\
z + \frac{x}{y} = 2
\end{cases}
\]
with all variables \(x, y, z > 0\). We need to find all possible sums \(s = x + y + z\) of solutions, and then identify the set of possible sums.

To approach this, I will examine solutions with small positive numbers, seeking patterns or bounds for \(x + y + z\). Since we're to enumerate solutions, I'll try small rational values and see if they satisfy the system, then derive the sum.

I'll write a Python program that:

- Enumerates small positive rational values of \(x, y, z\) within a custom small set.
- Checks whether these solutions satisfy the equations within a small tolerance.
- Records and prints the sums \(x + y + z\).
- Looks for extremal values (minimum and maximum sums) within the search range.

This brute-force method provides insight; for a more precise answer, symbolic algebra or algebraic manipulation would be best, but here, enumeration gives a constructive fallback.

```python
# Enumerate small positive rational values for x, y, z
import math

solutions = set()
limit = 5  # upper bound for enumerations
step = 0.1  # step size for enumerations

for ix in range(1, int(limit / step)):
    x = ix * step
    for iy in range(1, int(limit / step)):
        y = iy * step
        # derive z from the first equation: x + y/z = 2 => y/z = 2 - x
        rhs_z = 2 - x
        if abs(rhs_z) < 1e-8:
            continue  # avoid division by zero
        z = y / rhs_z
        if z <= 0 or z > limit:
            continue
        # check second equation: y + z/x ≈ 2
        lhs2 = y + z / x
        if abs(lhs2 - 2) > 1e-2:
            continue
        # check third equation: z + x/y ≈ 2
        lhs3 = z + x / y
        if abs(lhs3 - 2) > 1e-2:
            continue
        s = x + y + z
        solutions.add(round(s, 2))
        print(f"Found solution: x={x:.2f}, y={y:.2f}, z={z:.2f}, sum={s:.2f}")

if not solutions:
    print("No solutions found in enumeration.")
else:
    print("Possible sums (approximate):", sorted(solutions))
```
