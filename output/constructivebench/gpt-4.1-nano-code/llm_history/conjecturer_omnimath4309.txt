The problem involves sequences of multiset transformations with specific rules, starting from initial multisets. Analyzing the transformations and target, the process resembles a finite process that likely cannot reach the state {51, 49, 5} from all 1s within 105 steps. Since the constructions involve merging and splitting, the answer corresponds to whether the sum is preserved and the parity constraints. Given the transformations' nature, the problem probably asserts that it is impossible.

Therefore, the final answer is:

<<<False>>>
