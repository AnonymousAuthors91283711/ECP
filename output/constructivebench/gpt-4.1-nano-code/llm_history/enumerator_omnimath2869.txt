To solve the system:
\[
\begin{cases}
10x + y = 75 \\
10y + x = 57
\end{cases}
\]
we want to find integers \(x, y\) satisfying both equations with \(x, y > 0\).

Given the small constraints, we can iterate over possible integer values for \(x\) and \(y\). Since \(10x + y = 75\), possible \(x\) are from 1 to 7, and similarly for \(y\). Checking all pairs within these ranges:

```python
# Enumerate potential solutions for the given system
for x in range(1, 8):  # because 10*x + y = 75, so x <= 7
    for y in range(1, 8):
        if 10 * x + y == 75 and 10 * y + x == 57:
            print(f"Found solution: x={x}, y={y}")
            print(f"x + y = {x + y}")
```
