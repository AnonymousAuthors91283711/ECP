The problem appears to involve finding the numerator and denominator of a particular product related to Fermat numbers, specifically the product \(\prod_{k=0}^9 (2^{2^k} + 1)\), which is known to be related to Fermat numbers. We need to compute this product and then find coprime integers \(m, n\) such that the product equals \(m/n\), with \(m + n\) as the target.

Given the nature of Fermat numbers, Fermat's Little Theorem tells us that these numbers are pairwise coprime. The product is an integer, and the product involves known Fermat numbers.

We'll compute this product step-by-step for \(k=0\) to \(k=9\), keeping track of the numerator and denominator. Since each term is integer, the product is an integer, so numerator will be the product of all \(2^{2^k}+1\)'s, and denominator=1. The sum \(m + n\) simplifies to numerator + 1.

Here's a Python script to compute the product:

```python
# Compute the product of Fermat numbers from k=0 to 9
product = 1
for k in range(10):
    term = 2 ** (2 ** k) + 1
    print(f"Fermat number F_{k} = {term}")
    product *= term
print(f"Product of first 10 Fermat numbers: {product}")
# Since each is integer, numerator = product, denominator = 1
m = product
n = 1
print(f"m = {m}, n = {n}")
print(f"Sum m+n = {m + n}")
```

This code outputs the exact product and then its sum, which is the answer to the problem's requirement.
