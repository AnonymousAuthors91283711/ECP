. Expected Answer Type: (ℤ → ℤ) → Prop
The pattern indicates solutions are either constant, linear with zero y-term, or quadratic with specific coefficients. The linear solutions are of the form f(x) = c·x with c in ℤ, and the constant solution is f(x) = 0. The quadratic solutions correspond to f(x) = k·x² with k in {−2, −1, 0, 1, 2}. Collectively, these cover all solutions.
