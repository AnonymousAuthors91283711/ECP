. Enumerated answers: 2019. Expected Answer Type: ℤ
The pattern suggests that the supremum of the set is achieved at the maximum value of f(2019), which given the conditions, can reach 2019 in the best case when f remains constant at its upper limit. Therefore, the answer is the maximum value, 2019.
