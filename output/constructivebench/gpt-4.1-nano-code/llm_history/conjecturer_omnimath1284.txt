Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The sum of counts for all triples with x + y + z ≤ 8 and the relevant counts correspond to a pattern decreasing from 17 to 7 for x=1 and symmetric counts for x=2, with the total sum consistently equaling 144 over all triples. The total count for x+ y + z ≤ 8 is obtained via summation over these distributions, which sum to 120 across all relevant triples, with total possible x added. Given the pattern, the sum of all such counts divided by 20×6³ yields 1/20. Therefore, the answer is 1/20.
