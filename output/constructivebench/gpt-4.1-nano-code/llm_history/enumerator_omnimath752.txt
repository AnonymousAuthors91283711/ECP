This problem involves counting integers \(a\) between 1 and 200 inclusive such that \(a^a\) is a perfect square. We aim to enumerate all candidates for \(a\), check if \(a^a\) is a perfect square, and count the total number matching this condition. The approach is:

- For each \(a\) from 1 to 200:
  - Compute \(a^a\) (must be precise and efficient).
  - Check if \(a^a\) is a perfect square (by comparing \(\sqrt{a^a}\) squared).
- Count and print each \(a\) satisfying the condition.

Note: For large \(a\), \(a^a\) could be extensive, but Python handles big integers efficiently.

```python
import math

count = 0
for a in range(1, 201):
    # Compute a^a
    val = pow(a, a)
    # Take integer square root
    root = int(math.isqrt(val))
    # Check if perfect square
    if root * root == val:
        print(a)
        count += 1

print("Total count:", count)
```
