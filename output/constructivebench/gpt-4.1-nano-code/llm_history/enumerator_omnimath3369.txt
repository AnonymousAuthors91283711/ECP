This problem involves exploring positive integers \( n \) between 1 and 100 such that \( n = \gcd(a^2, b^3) \) for some positive integers \( a, b \). The goal is to enumerate all possible values of \( n \) that satisfy these conditions and identify the candidate \( n \).

Key insights:
- \( \gcd(a^2, b^3) = n \), with \( a, b > 0 \).
- To find all such \( n \), we can iterate through \( a, b \) in a small range, compute \( \gcd(a^2, b^3) \), and store unique \( n \) values between 1 and 100.
- We will output these values immediately when found.

This enumeration approach ensures no hardcoding of specific answers and lists all possible \( n \) values in the range.

```python
import math

# Set range limit for a and b to keep computations small
limit = 30
results = set()

for a in range(1, limit + 1):
    a_squared = a * a
    for b in range(1, limit + 1):
        b_cubed = b * b * b
        n = math.gcd(a_squared, b_cubed)
        if 0 < n <= 100:
            if n not in results:
                results.add(n)
                print(n)
```
