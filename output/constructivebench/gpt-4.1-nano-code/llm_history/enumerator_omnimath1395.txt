This problem appears to involve number theory, specifically divisibility conditions involving two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\). The goal is to characterize pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a \times b \mid a^{2017} + b\).

To aid conjecture, we'll enumerate small pairs \((a, b)\), check the divisibility, and observe patterns. We won't hardcode the answer, instead iterating over small ranges and printing the pairs satisfying the divisibility.

```python
# Enumerate small positive integers a, b, check divisibility of a*b | a^2017 + b
max_value = 20  # limit for enumeration
for a in range(1, max_value + 1):
    for b in range(1, max_value + 1):
        # Compute a^2017 + b
        numerator = a ** 2017 + b
        denominator = a * b
        # Check if a*b divides a^2017 + b
        if numerator % denominator == 0:
            print((a, b))
```
