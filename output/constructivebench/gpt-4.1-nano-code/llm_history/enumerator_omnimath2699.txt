This problem involves finding positive integers \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(x + xy = 391\) with the additional constraints that \(x > y > 0\). The theorem states that for such \(x, y\), \(x + y = \) a certain answer, and it asserts uniqueness.

To assist in guessing and verifying the answer, we'll enumerate candidate pairs \((x, y)\) with \(x > y > 0\) satisfying \(x + xy = 391\). Since \(x + xy = x(1 + y) = 391\), \(x\) must be a divisor of 391. We will:
- Find divisors of 391,
- For each divisor \(x\), compute \(y = \frac{391 - x}{x}\),
- Verify if \(y\) is a positive integer less than \(x\),
- Output \(x + y\) for each valid pair.

This enumeration should reveal the candidate answer(s).

```python
# Enumerate divisors of 391 and find valid (x, y), then print x + y
def enumerate_candidates():
    N = 391
    candidates = []
    for x in range(1, N + 1):
        if N % x == 0:
            y = (N // x) - 1
            if y > 0 and x > y:
                sum_xy = x + y
                print(f"Found candidate: x={x}, y={y}, x + y={sum_xy}")
                candidates.append(sum_xy)
    if candidates:
        print("Candidate sums x + y:", set(candidates))
    else:
        print("No candidates found.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    enumerate_candidates()
```
