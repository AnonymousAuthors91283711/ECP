Based on the properties, especially the distribution like multiplication and the special case op 2 2 = 4, the operation resembles standard multiplication ops with eventual simplification to a known function. The candidate matching these constraints and the expected answer type ℝ is simply op a b = a * b.

. Enumerated Answers: Candidate solution: op a b = a * b. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Given the error and the context, `omnimath3347_answer` is intended to be a specific real number, not a function. The attempted answer `fun y : ℝ => y` is a function of type `ℝ → ℝ`, which does not match the expected type `ℝ`.

The problem involves an operation `op` with properties similar to multiplication, especially considering the special value `op 2 2 = 4` and distributivity over multiplication. The key is that `op` is analogized to multiplication, and the question asks for an `y` such that `op x y = x`.

Since `op` resembles multiplication (due to distributivity and the specific value at 2), the solution `y` satisfying `op x y = x` would be the multiplicative identity, which is 1.

Thus, the answer should be a real number `1`. 

**Final answer:** `1`

<<<1>>>
