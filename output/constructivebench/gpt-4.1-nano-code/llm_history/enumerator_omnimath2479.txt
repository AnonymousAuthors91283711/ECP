This problem involves analyzing a sequence of functions \(f\) from \(\mathbb{N}\) to \(\mathbb{N}\), constrained by a recurrence relation and positivity, and then counting how many such functions satisfy an upper bound at \(n=2010\). The key points:

- Each \(f\) satisfies \(f(n) > 0\).
- For \(n > 2\), \(f(n) = 3f(n-1) - 2f(n-2)\).
- The set \(T\) includes solutions with \(f(2010) \leq 2^{2012}\).
- The goal is to compute the cardinality of \(T\), which corresponds to the number of valid functions.

Since the recurrence is linear with constant coefficients, we can analyze its solutions, parameterized by initial conditions \(f(1)\) and \(f(2)\), which are positive integers.

The recurrence relation's characteristic polynomial is:
\[ r^2 - 3r + 2 = 0 \]
with roots:
\[ r=1 \text{ and } r=2 \]
So, all solutions have the form:
\[ f(n) = A \cdot 1^{n} + B \cdot 2^{n} = A + B \cdot 2^{n} \]
where \(A, B \in \mathbb{Z}\), determined by initial conditions:
\[ f(1) = A + 2B \]
\[ f(2) = A + 4B \]

Given \(f(n) > 0\) for all \(n\), especially at \(n=1,2\), and the recurrence, the solutions are:

- For all positive \(A, B\) with \(A + 2B > 0\) and \(A + 4B > 0\), the sequence is positive for all \(n\). Checking explicitly shows the sequence is positive if \(A, B \geq 1\) (since \(f(1)=A+2B \geq 3\), \(f(2)=A+4B \geq 5\)).

- The value at \(n=2010\) is:
\[ f(2010) = A + B \cdot 2^{2010} \]

To satisfy \(f(2010) \leq 2^{2012}\):
\[ A + B \cdot 2^{2010} \le 2^{2012} \]

Since \(A \geq 1\), \(B \geq 1\), the number of solutions corresponds to the count of integer pairs \((A, B)\) where:

\[ 1 \leq A \leq 2^{2012} - B \cdot 2^{2010} \]
and
\[ B \geq 1 \]
\[ A \geq 1 \]
\[ A + B \cdot 2^{2010} \leq 2^{2012} \]

Because \(A \ge 1\), rewrite as:
\[ A \leq 2^{2012} - B \cdot 2^{2010} \]

For each \(B\), the number of valid \(A\) is:
\[ \max(0, 2^{2012} - B \cdot 2^{2010}) \]

Since the upper bound must be at least 1:
\[ 2^{2012} - B \cdot 2^{2010} \geq 1 \]
\[ B \leq \frac{2^{2012} - 1}{2^{2010}} \]

Calculate bounds:

\[ 2^{2012} = 2^{2} \times 2^{2010} = 4 \times 2^{2010} \]
\[
\Rightarrow 2^{2012} - 1 = 4 \times 2^{2010} - 1
\]

Thus:

\[ B \leq \frac{4 \times 2^{2010} - 1}{2^{2010}} = 4 - \frac{1}{2^{2010}} \]

Since \(B\) is a positive integer, and fraction is less than 1, the maximum \(B\) is 3 (as:

- For \(B=1\):
\[ A \leq 4 \times 2^{2010} - 2^{2010} = 3 \times 2^{2010} \]
Number of \(A\): \(3 \times 2^{2010}\)
- For \(B=2\):
\[ A \leq 4 \times 2^{2010} - 2 \times 2^{2010} = 2 \times 2^{2010} \]
Number of \(A\): \(2 \times 2^{2010}\)
- For \(B=3\):
\[ A \leq 4 \times 2^{2010} - 3 \times 2^{2010} = 1 \times 2^{2010} \]
Number of \(A\): \(2^{2010}\)

For \(B=4\):
\[ A \leq 4 \times 2^{2010} - 4 \times 2^{2010} = 0 \]
which is invalid since \(A \ge 1\).

Hence, the total count is the sum over \(B=1\) to 3:

\[ \text{Total} = (3 \times 2^{2010}) + (2 \times 2^{2010}) + (2^{2010}) = (3 + 2 + 1) \times 2^{2010} = 6 \times 2^{2010} \]

This is approximately \(6 \times 2^{2010}\) valid solutions.

**Python code to enumerate these solutions:**

```python
# Enumerate all solutions (A, B) for the recurrence with positivity constraints
max_B = 3
max_A_per_B = {
    1: 3 * 2**2010,
    2: 2 * 2**2010,
    3: 1 * 2**2010,
}
for B in range(1, max_B + 1):
    max_A = max_A_per_B[B]
    for A in range(1, max_A + 1):
        f2010 = A + B * 2**2010
        # Check if f(2010) within bounds
        if f2010 <= 2**2012:
            print(f"B={B}, A={A}, f(2010)={f2010}")
```
