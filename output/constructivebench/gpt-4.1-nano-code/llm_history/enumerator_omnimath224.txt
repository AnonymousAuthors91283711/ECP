The problem involves finding the maximum natural number \( N \) such that, for every finite set of pairs \(\text{pairs}\) with certain properties, there exists a finite set \(\text{erased}\) satisfying some conditions, and \( N \) is bounded above by the size of a related subset. To assist in conjecturing the exact maximum \( N \), we simulate possible \(\text{pairs}\) and \(\text{erased}\) sets with small, manageable examples.

Key points:
- \(\text{pairs}\) is a set of 68 pairs of integers.
- No pair of the form \((k,k)\) and its negation \((-k, -k)\) both exist if \(k>0\).
- We need a set \(\text{erased}\) such that no two elements sum to zero, and \(\text{erased}\) covers all pairs via membership.
- The size \(N\) of the bounding set is at most the size of a filtered subset of \(\text{pairs}\).

Given the constraints, we approximate by:
- Using small sample sets with a manageable number of pairs.
- Enumerating all possible \(\text{pairs}\) with specific patterns.
- Generating \(\text{erased}\) sets that satisfy the sum-avoiding condition.
- Recording the maximum size \(N\) observed.

The code:
- Samples a small number of pairs.
- For each configuration, generates potential \(\text{erased}\) subsets.
- Checks the sum condition.
- Outputs the maximum \(N\).

```python
# Helper function to generate pairs with specific conditions
def generate_pairs(max_k=5):
    pairs = []
    for k in range(1, max_k+1):
        pairs.append((k, -k))
        pairs.append((-k, k))
    return pairs

# Generate small sample pairs
pairs = generate_pairs()

# Generate all subsets of pairs (for small size, manageable)
from itertools import chain, combinations

def all_subsets(s):
    return chain.from_iterable(combinations(s, r) for r in range(len(s)+1))

max_N = 0
best_sets = []

for subset_pairs in all_subsets(pairs):
    pair_set = set(subset_pairs)
    # For this subset, generate candidate erased sets
    # by selecting elements involved in pairs at most
    elements_in_pairs = {x for pair in pair_set for x in pair}
    # Possible erased sets: all subsets of elements_in_pairs
    for erased in all_subsets(elements_in_pairs):
        erased_set = set(erased)
        # Check sum-avoiding condition
        if any((a in erased_set and b in erased_set and a + b == 0) for a in erased_set for b in erased_set):
            continue
        # Check coverage: each pair must have at least one element in erased
        if all((x in erased_set or y in erased_set) for (x, y) in pair_set):
            N = len(pair_set)
            if N > max_N:
                max_N = N
                best_sets = [pair_set]
            elif N == max_N:
                best_sets.append(pair_set)

# Print results
for s in best_sets:
    print(f"Maximum N found: {max_N}")
    print(f"Corresponding pairs: {s}")
