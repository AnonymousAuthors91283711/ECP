The problem involves analyzing the overlap of two time-based probability-like functions within a time interval [600, 660]. Specifically, it examines where the fractional parts of t/90 and t/80 are close to 1/2 within 1/8, and finds the ratio of the volume of their intersection to the total interval. To explore this, I will write a Python program that enumerates possible values of t in small steps within [600, 660], computes the conditions, and outputs the ratio corresponding to the measure of the overlapping intervals.

Since this is a mathematical approximation problem, the script will:

- Loop through t in small increments (e.g., 0.01).
- Check whether the fractional parts satisfy the inequalities.
- Remove the need for approximate division by 80 and 90 by directly computing mod 80 and 90.
- Count the total points and points satisfying the conditions.
- Finally, compute and print the ratio, which approximates the measure.

This code serves as a numerical approximation to help conjecture the exact answer.

```python
# Enumerate values of t from 600 to 660 in small steps, compute the measure where the conditions hold
import numpy as np

T_start = 600
T_end = 660
step = 0.01

total_points = 0
matching_points = 0

for t in np.arange(T_start, T_end, step):
    # Compute fractional parts of t/90 and t/80
    frac_90 = (t / 90) % 1
    frac_80 = (t / 80) % 1
    
    # Check if both are within 1/8 of 1/2 (i.e., between 0.375 and 0.625)
    if abs(frac_90 - 0.5) <= 1/8 and abs(frac_80 - 0.5) <= 1/8:
        matching_points += 1
    total_points += 1

ratio = matching_points / total_points
print(f"Estimated ratio of overlap: {ratio}")
```
