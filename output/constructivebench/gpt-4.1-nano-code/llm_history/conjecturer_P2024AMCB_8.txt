    logb 2 x * logb 3 x = 2 * (logb 2 x + logb 3 x) ↔ x = P2024AMCB_8_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Error: Program is empty. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The equation simplifies to a quadratic in logs: (log₂ x)(log₃ x) = 2(log₂ x + log₃ x). Using change of variables, set a = log₂ x, b = log₃ x, then relate a and b via change of base. Solving yields x = 2^{2} = 4. The only positive solution satisfying the equation is x=4.
