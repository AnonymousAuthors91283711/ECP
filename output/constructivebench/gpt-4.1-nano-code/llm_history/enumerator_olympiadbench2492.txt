The problem involves counting the number of pairs (a, b) in A Ã— B where a^b is even, then expressing the ratio as a rational number. To do this, we'll enumerate all pairs, check which satisfy the condition, and compute the ratio explicitly.

Here's the reasoning:
- A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
- B = {6, 7, 8}
- Compute a^b for each pair
- Count pairs where a^b is even
- Calculate the ratio: (number of even a^b) / total number of pairs

We'll generate all pairs, filter those with an even power, and compute the exact ratio. This approach ensures precision and complete enumeration.

```python
# Enumerate all pairs (a, b) in A x B
A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
B = [6, 7, 8]
total = len(A) * len(B)
even_count = 0

for a in A:
    for b in B:
        power = a ** b
        if power % 2 == 0:
            print(f"Pair ({a}, {b}): {a}^{b} = {power} (even)")
            even_count += 1

# Output the ratio as a fraction
from fractions import Fraction
ratio = Fraction(even_count, total)
print(f"Number of pairs with even a^b: {even_count}")
print(f"Total pairs: {total}")
print(f"Ratio: {ratio}")
```
