Ground Truth Answer: fun x y => 2 * x + y + 2015
Proposed Answer: fun x y => (2018 * (x + y) + 2017 * (2018 - 1)) / 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive sequence a(n) with base cases a(1)=x and a(3)=y, and a recurrence relation for n>1.

2. The ground truth answer gives a simple linear expression in terms of x and y.

3. The proposed answer is much more complex, involving multiplication and division operations that don't clearly relate to the problem's structure.

Key observations:
- The proposed answer introduces terms like 2018*(x+y) which don't match the ground truth's 2x+y
- The ground truth has a constant term 2015 while the proposed has a complex term involving 2017*(2018-1)/2
- The recurrence relation suggests the sequence should have linear behavior, which the ground truth reflects
- The proposed answer's complexity suggests it might be incorrect or solving a different problem

The answers are clearly not equivalent in form or content.
