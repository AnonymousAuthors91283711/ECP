Here's an approach to enumerate possible total lawns mowed, considering small rational approximations and simplifying assumptions. I'll calculate individual rates, then sum their contributions over 2 hours, and print each intermediate total. This aligns with your specs: immediate print, avoid hardcoded ground truth, and efficiency.

```python
# Python program to enumerate possible total lawns mowed by Dennis, Edward, and Shawn over 2 hours

# Rates in lawns per hour
dennis_rate = 60 / 48  # lawns per hour
edward_rate = 60 / 48
shawn_rate = 60 / 24

# Total rate
total_rate = dennis_rate + edward_rate + shawn_rate

# Working duration in hours
duration = 2

# Because rates are rational (120/48 and 60/24), represent them as fractions for accuracy
from fractions import Fraction

dennis_rate = Fraction(60, 48)
edward_rate = Fraction(60, 48)
shawn_rate = Fraction(60, 24)

total_rate = dennis_rate + edward_rate + shawn_rate

# Possible total lawns mowed, in rational form
total_lawns = total_rate * duration

# Since the problem involves rational numbers, enumerate reasonable integer approximations
# For simplicity, we scale all in numerator form
max_multiplier = 50  # limit to prevent excessive output
for n in range(1, max_multiplier + 1):
    total = total_rate * n
    # Display the total lawns for each n, in floating-point approximation
    approximated_total = float(total)
    print(f"Total lawns for {n} hours scaled: {approximated_total:.4f}")

# Also, explicitly check and print the exact value
exact_total = total_rate * duration
print(f"\nExact total lawns mowed in {duration} hours: {exact_total} (as Fraction)")
```
