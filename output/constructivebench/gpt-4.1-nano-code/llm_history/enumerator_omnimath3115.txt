This problem involves solving the equation \(2^n = 8^{20}\) for \(n\). Since \(8 = 2^3\), then \(8^{20} = (2^3)^{20} = 2^{60}\). The goal is to find \(n\) such that \(2^n = 2^{60}\) and to check uniqueness.

To assist in conjecturing, we can enumerate \(n\) values and compare \(2^n\) to \(2^{60}\). Since \(2^n\) grows rapidly, we'll check values around 60, well below, and well above, just to confirm.

Here's a Python script that methodically computes and checks a small range of \(n\) values to find solutions:

```python
# Enumerate n from 0 up to 120 to find solutions to 2^n = 8^20
# 8^20 simplifies to 2^60, so we're looking for n=60
# Search range: 0 to 120 (to find the exact match and verify uniqueness)

for n in range(0, 121):
    value = 2 ** n
    target = 2 ** 60  # equivalent to 8^20
    print(f"n={n}, 2^n={value}")
    if value == target:
        print(f"Solution found: n={n} satisfies 2^{n} = 8^{20}")
```

This code:
- Checks powers of two within a specified range
- Prints each \(n\) with the corresponding \(2^n\)
- Identifies the \(n\) which satisfies the equation

Run this to find the exact \(n\) and verify whether it is unique.
