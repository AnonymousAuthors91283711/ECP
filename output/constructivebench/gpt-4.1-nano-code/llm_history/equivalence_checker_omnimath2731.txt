abbrev omnimath2731_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2731 (x : ℝ) :
    (5 + x) / 2 = 7 ∧ (x + 9) / 2 = 12 ∧ (5 + 9) / 2 = 10 ↔ x = omnimath2731_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 15
Proposed Answer: 9.0
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us three equations combined with ∧ (AND) operations:
   - (5 + x)/2 = 7
   - (x + 9)/2 = 12
   - (5 + 9)/2 = 10

2. The third equation (5 + 9)/2 = 10 is always true (14/2=7), so it doesn't affect the solution.

3. Solving the first equation:
   (5 + x)/2 = 7 → 5 + x = 14 → x = 9

4. Solving the second equation:
   (x + 9)/2 = 12 → x + 9 = 24 → x = 15

5. The ground truth answer is 15 (which satisfies the second equation)
6. The proposed answer is 9.0 (which satisfies the first equation but not the second)

The proposed answer only satisfies one of the two meaningful equations, while the ground truth satisfies both. Therefore, they are not equivalent.
