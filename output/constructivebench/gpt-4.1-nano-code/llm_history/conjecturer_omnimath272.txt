Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: Set (Polynomial ℤ)
The patterns suggest the set omnimath272_answer includes all polynomials where the coefficient of x² is not -3, specifically those with coefficient -2 or higher, as B values are minimized at coefficients -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, or 3.

Answer: <<<{f : Polynomial ℤ | f.coeff 2 ≠ -3}>>>
