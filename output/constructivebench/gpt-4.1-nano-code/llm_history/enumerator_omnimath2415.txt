This problem involves counting integer triples `(x, y, z)` satisfying four constraints:

1. \( x + y + z = 525 \)
2. \( 7 \mid x \) (x divisible by 7)
3. \( 5 \mid y \) (y divisible by 5)
4. \( 3 \mid z \) (z divisible by 3)

To enumerate solutions efficiently, we can:

- Iterate over possible `x` divisible by 7.
- For each `x`, iterate over possible `y` divisible by 5.
- Calculate `z = 525 - x - y`, then check if `z` divisible by 3.
- Count all valid solutions.

We will execute this enumeration in Python, printing each solution as we find it, then output the total count. This approach aligns with the requirement to stream answers, prioritize exact matches, and avoid excessive computation.

```python
# Enumeration of integer triples (x, y, z) with x + y + z = 525
# where x divisible by 7, y divisible by 5, z divisible by 3.

count = 0
# To limit iteration, choose bounds based on divisibility constraints
# x in multiples of 7, y in multiples of 5, z in multiples of 3.
for x in range(0, 526, 7):
    for y in range(0, 526 - x, 5):
        z = 525 - x - y
        if z >= 0 and z % 3 == 0:
            count += 1
            print(f"Solution: x={x}, y={y}, z={z}")

print(f"Total solutions: {count}")
```
