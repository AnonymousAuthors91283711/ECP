sorry

Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {f : ℝ → ℝ | (∀ x, 0 ≤ x ∧ x < 2 → f x ≠ 0) ∧ f 2 = 0 ∧ (∀ x, 0 ≤ x ∧ x < 2 → f x > 0) ∧
    (∀ x y, f (x * f y) * f y = f (x + y)) }
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is mostly correct but has some differences from the original problem statement:
1. The original requires f x ≥ 0 for all x, while the proposed answer only specifies f x > 0 for 0 ≤ x < 2
2. The original has the condition ∀ x, f x ≥ 0 as a separate condition, while the proposed answer embeds it in the 0 ≤ x < 2 case
3. The proposed answer is missing the general non-negativity condition for all x ∈ ℝ

The functional equation part is correct, but the domain/constraint differences make this "Close" rather than fully equivalent.
