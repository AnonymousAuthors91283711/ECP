This problem involves verifying and possibly computing the sum \(2 + \frac{3}{100} + \frac{5}{1000}\). To assist in conjecturing and confirming the true answer, I will write a Python program that calculates this sum precisely, considering exact decimal values, and outputs the potential answer immediately when computed. The task is straightforward and suitable for precise floating-point arithmetic, as the sum is small and straightforward.

Since the problem explicitly involves addition of decimals, the main goal is to enumerate the answer step-by-step with high precision. We will print the exact sum and also the approximate decimal value.

```python
# Calculate the sum exactly using fractional representations for accuracy
from fractions import Fraction

# Define each term explicitly for maximum accuracy
two = Fraction(2, 1)
three_over_100 = Fraction(3, 100)
five_over_1000 = Fraction(5, 1000)

# Sum them up
total_fraction = two + three_over_100 + five_over_1000

# Convert to float for approximate decimal representation
total_decimal = float(total_fraction)

# Stream the exact fractional result
print(f"Exact value: {total_fraction}")
# Stream the approximate decimal value
print(f"Approximate decimal: {total_decimal}")
```
