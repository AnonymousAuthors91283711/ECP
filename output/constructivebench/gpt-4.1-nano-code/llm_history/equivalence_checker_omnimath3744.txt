Ground Truth Answer: {(1, 1, 3, 1)}
Proposed Answer: {(x, y, z, t) | x = 1 ∧ y = 1 ∧ z = 3 ∧ t = 1}
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is exactly equivalent to the ground truth answer. Both specify the single solution (1, 1, 3, 1), just expressed in different forms - the ground truth as an explicit set containing one tuple, and the proposed answer as a set defined by conditions that yield exactly that same tuple. The conditions x=1 ∧ y=1 ∧ z=3 ∧ t=1 uniquely identify the same solution (1, 1, 3, 1).
