abbrev omnimath3504_answer : Set ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3504 (x : ℝ) : 
  x / 2 < x^2 ∧ x^2 < x ↔ x ∈ omnimath3504_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {x | x / 2 < x^2 ∧ x^2 < x}
Proposed Answer: {x : ℝ | 0.5 < x ∧ x < 1}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the set of real numbers x where x/2 < x² and x² < x.

2. Ground truth answer correctly represents this as the set of x satisfying both inequalities.

3. Proposed answer claims the solution is x between 0.5 and 1.

Analysis of inequalities:
- x² < x implies 0 < x < 1 (since x² ≥ x elsewhere)
- x/2 < x² implies x < 0 or x > 0.5 (by solving the inequality)

Combining these:
- For 0 < x < 1, the second inequality requires x > 0.5
- Therefore, the solution is indeed 0.5 < x < 1

The proposed answer is correct, though it could be more explicit about excluding x ≤ 0 cases (which are already excluded by x² < x).
