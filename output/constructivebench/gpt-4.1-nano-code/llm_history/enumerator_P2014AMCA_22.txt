The problem asks us to count the number of ordered pairs (p.1, p.2) with p.1 in [1,2012] and p.2 in ℕ such that:

\[ 2^{p.1} \leq 5^{p.2} < 2^{p.1+1} \]

This can be rearranged into inequalities for p.2:

\[ p.2 \geq \log_5(2^{p.1}) = p.1 \times \log_5(2) \]
\[ p.2 < \log_5(2^{p.1+1}) = (p.1 + 1) \times \log_5(2) \]

Let’s define \( L = \log_5(2) \).

Since \( p.2 \) is an integer, for each \( p.1 \), the \( p.2 \) must satisfy:

\[ p.2 \in [ \lceil p.1 \times L \rceil , \lfloor (p.1 + 1) \times L - \varepsilon \rfloor ] \]

(But because of strict inequalities, we need to be precise with the bounds).

Since the original inequality involves strict inequality on the right, the maximum \( p.2 \) must be less than \( (p.1+1) \times L \), but not including it. For the lower bound, it is inclusive.

Note: For this count, we'd compute the range of integer \( p.2 \) for each \( p.1 \), then sum over all \( p.1 \).

Given that the problem involves floating point calculations of logs, but we want exactness, we can use Python's `math.log` for log base change:

\[ \log_5(x) = \frac{\log(x)}{\log(5)} \]
and similarly for \(\log(2)\).

We will enumerate \( p.1 \) from 1 to 2012, compute the bounds for \( p.2 \), count integers within, and sum these counts.

Below, we implement this counting.

```python
import math

# Precompute log(2) and log(5)
log2 = math.log(2)
log5 = math.log(5)

# Use change of base to compute the logarithm
def log_base(x, base):
    return math.log(x) / math.log(base)

total_pairs = 0
# For each p in 1..2012
for p1 in range(1, 2013):
    lower_bound = p1 * log_base(2, 5)  # p.1 * log_base(5)(2)
    upper_bound = (p1 + 1) * log_base(2, 5)  # (p.1 + 1) * log_base(5)(2)
    # Since the inequality is:
    # 2^{p.1} <= 5^{p.2} < 2^{p.1+1}
    # => p.2 >= lower_bound, p.2 < upper_bound
    # p.2 is integer, so:
    # p.2 in [ceil(lower_bound), floor(upper_bound - epsilon)]
    # Because strict inequality on the right, we'll subtract a tiny epsilon
    epsilon = 1e-15
    min_p2 = math.ceil(lower_bound)
    max_p2 = math.floor(upper_bound - epsilon)
    count_p2 = max(0, max_p2 - min_p2 + 1)
    # Immediately print each count for debugging/streaming
    print(f"p1={p1}, p2 range=[{min_p2},{max_p2}], count={count_p2}")
    total_pairs += count_p2

print("Total number of pairs:", total_pairs)
```
