This problem appears to involve reasoning about multisets of size \(n\) with elements from \(\mathrm{Fin}\,6\), and counts of certain elements exceeding a threshold. Given the sets of counts \([28, 20, 19, 13, 11, 9]\), we are asked about the least \(n\) such that for all multisets \(s\) of size \(n\), there exists an element \(i\) with both \(s.count i \geq 15\) and the counts in the multiset satisfy the bounds.

We will:
- Experiment with subset sizes \(n\), starting from small values.
- For each \(n\), check if there's a multiset \(s\) of that size **without** any element \(i\) for which \(s.count i \geq 15\). When an example of such a multiset is found, it disproves the minimality.
- Continue increasing \(n\) until we can no longer find such a counterexample, confirming the minimal \(n\).

The trial involves generating all possible count distributions summing to \(n\), but given the constraints, a direct brute-force is unfeasible for very high \(n\). Instead, we'll test small values and look for counterexamples.

```python
# Enumerate multisets of size n over 6 elements to determine the minimal n
# such that for every multiset s of size n, there exists an element with count >=15.

from itertools import combinations_with_replacement

max_n = 50  # Upper limit for search
found_counterexample = False
answer = None

for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
    # Generate possible count distributions over 6 elements summing to n
    # with all counts less than 15 (to find counterexamples)
    def generate_counts(total, parts, max_count):
        if parts == 1:
            if total < max_count:
                yield [total]
            return
        for c in range(min(total, max_count)):
            for rest in generate_counts(total - c, parts - 1, max_count):
                yield [c] + rest

    # Look for counterexample: sum of counts == n with all counts < 15
    counterexample_found = False
    for counts in generate_counts(n, 6, 15):
        if sum(counts) == n:
            # Check if any count >=15? No, by construction
            # This multiset avoids having any element with count >=15
            # So it's a counterexample
            counterexample_found = True
            break
    if counterexample_found:
        # Found a multiset of size n with no element >=15
        print(f"n={n} is NOT sufficient.")
    else:
        # For this n, no such multiset exists, minimal n is n
        answer = n
        print(f"Minimal n such that in any multiset of size {n}, some element has count >=15: {answer}")
        break
```
