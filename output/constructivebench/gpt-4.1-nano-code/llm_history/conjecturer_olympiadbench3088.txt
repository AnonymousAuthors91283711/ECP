Maximum sum A+B found: 12
All candidates with maximum sum:
A=5, B=7, sum=12. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The errors stem from attempting to use A and B as identifiers directly inside an `if` expression in Lean without properly defining them as variables. Moreover, the goal is to produce a fixed value based on conditions, specifically when A + B reaches the maximum sum (which is 12), and A = 5, B = 7 is the only combination satisfying the conditions with the maximum sum.

Given the enumerated answers, the only candidate with maximum sum is A=5, B=7. The problem asks for a closed form expressing the answer based on the maximum sum condition, and, from the enumeration, the answer should be 5 + 7 = 12. Since the only candidate for the maximum sum with the given constraints is (A=5, B=7), the answer should be 12.

Therefore, the answer can be expressed as a fixed constant 12 because the maximum sum A+B = 12 occurs precisely when (A, B) = (5, 7). So, I propose the fixed answer:

<<<12>>>

This matches the enumerated candidate and directly satisfies the problem's requirement to identify the maximum sum value under the specified constraints.
