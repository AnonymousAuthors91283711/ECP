This problem involves computing the product of the series: (1 + 1/2) * (1 + 1/3) * ... * (1 + 1/9). To understand the value of this product, we can express each term as a fraction and look for telescoping patterns. My strategy is to evaluate the product step-by-step, and because the problem is straightforward, we can compute the exact fractional value directly.

I'll generate code to enumerate the partial products step-by-step, print each intermediate result, and then output the final product as an exact rational number to assist in conjecturing the overall value.

```python
# Enumerate the partial products of the series (1 + 1/n) for n from 2 to 9
from fractions import Fraction

# Initialize the product as 1
product = Fraction(1, 1)
# Loop through n=2 to 9
for n in range(2, 10):
    # Multiply the current product by (1 + 1/n)
    term = Fraction(n + 1, n)
    product *= term
    # Print the partial product after each multiplication
    print(f"After multiplying by (1 + 1/{n}): {product}")

# At the end, print the final exact product
print("Final product:", product)
```
