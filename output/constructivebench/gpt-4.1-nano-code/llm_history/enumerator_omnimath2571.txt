This problem involves counting functions \(f: \text{Fin } 3 \to \text{Fin } 3 \to \text{Bool}\) such that for every fixed \(p\), exactly two \(s\) satisfy \(f p s\), and for every fixed \(s\), exactly two \(p\) satisfy \(f p s\). In other words, \(f\) corresponds to a bipartite graph between two sets of size 3, where each vertex has degree exactly 2.

Since the sets are size 3, and each vertex must have degree 2, this corresponds to a perfect 2-regular bipartite graph between two copies of \(\{0,1,2\}\). Each such graph is a disjoint union of cycles covering all vertices: in this bipartite setting for size 3, the only 2-regular bipartite graph is the union of two 3-cycles, which, because bipartite graphs have even cycles, must be the bipartite union of two 3-cycles (which are triangles), but in bipartite graphs, the cycles are length at least 4, so 3-cycles are impossible.

Therefore, the only possible configurations are 2-regular bipartite graphs with degree 2 on each vertex, which form 4-cycles, possibly larger. But since the total vertices are 3 on each side and each node degree is 2, the total number of edges is 6 (since each of the 3 vertices on each side has degree 2). Each such graph is a 2-regular bipartite graph with equal degrees, which corresponds to a union of cycles covering all vertices. Because total edges are 6 and degrees are 2, the structure must be one 6-cycle or multiple cycles covering the vertices.

In the size 3 case, the only possible such bipartite graphs with all vertices degree 2 are the union of two 3-cycles, impossible in bipartite graphs (since 3-cycle is odd). The only cycles are of even length, so in this case, the configuration is a perfect matching with each vertex degree 1, which contradicts degree 2.

Actually, with degree 2 on size 3 on both parts, the only possible configuration is the union of disjoint cycles of length 4 or 6, but with only 3 vertices in each part, it's impossible to create a cycle longer than 4. The only possible configuration is a 4-cycle with one vertex connected to 2 edges, which doesn't satisfy the degree requirement.

Thus, the only possible graphs are those where for each fixed p, exactly two s satisfy \(f p s\), and similarly for s fixed, exactly two p satisfy \(f p s\).

Let's analyze possible configurations computationally:

- Each row (fixed p) has exactly two 'true's',
- Each column (fixed s) has exactly two 'true's.

All such \(f\) correspond to 3x3 0/1 matrices with row sum 2 and column sum 2.

Number of all 3x3 0/1 matrices with row sum 2 and column sum 2:

- The number of ways to choose each row with exactly two 1s among 3 positions: \(\binom{3}{2} = 3\).
- For three rows, total possible combinations: \(3^3=27\).
- Among these, only those with column sums at 2 are valid.

Enumerate all 3x3 matrices with row sum 2:

```python
import itertools

all_matrices = []
for rows in itertools.product([0,1], repeat=3):
    for second in itertools.product([0,1], repeat=3):
        for third in itertools.product([0,1], repeat=3):
            matrix = [rows, second, third]
            if all(sum(row)==2 for row in matrix) and [sum(matrix[i][j] for i in range(3)) for j in range(3)] == [2,2,2]:
                all_matrices.append(matrix)
```

But to avoid recomputation; more straightforwardly, generate all matrices with row sum 2, then filter for column sum 2.

Since total options are manageable (only 27), verify their counts and output.

Now, code to enumerate all 3x3 Boolean matrices with row sum 2 and column sum 2:

```python
import itertools

def generate_matrices():
    matrices = []
    for rows in itertools.product([0,1], repeat=3):
        if sum(rows) == 2:
            # For second and third row
            for r2 in itertools.product([0,1], repeat=3):
                if sum(r2) == 2:
                    for r3 in itertools.product([0,1], repeat=3):
                        if sum(r3) == 2:
                            matrix = [list(rows), list(r2), list(r3)]
                            # Check column sums
                            col_sums = [sum(matrix[i][j] for i in range(3)) for j in range(3)]
                            if col_sums == [2,2,2]:
                                matrices.append(matrix)
    return matrices

matrices = generate_matrices()

# Count and print
for idx, m in enumerate(matrices, 1):
    print(f"Matrix {idx}:")
    for row in m:
        print(row)
    print()
print(f"Total: {len(matrices)}")
```

Running this code gives the count of such matrices, which corresponds to the functions \(f\). The total number of such matrices equals the number of functions satisfying the conditions.

**Answer:** The total count is the number of such matrices.

Let's encapsulate this in the wanted format:

```python
# Count all 3x3 Boolean matrices with each row and column summing to 2.
import itertools

# Generate all matrices with each row sum 2
matrices = []
for rows in itertools.product([0, 1], repeat=3):
    if sum(rows) == 2:
        for r2 in itertools.product([0, 1], repeat=3):
            if sum(r2) == 2:
                for r3 in itertools.product([0, 1], repeat=3):
                    if sum(r3) == 2:
                        matrix = [list(rows), list(r2), list(r3)]
                        # Check column sums
                        col_sums = [sum(matrix[i][j] for i in range(3)) for j in range(3)]
                        if col_sums == [2, 2, 2]:
                            matrices.append(matrix)

# Output each such matrix as an answer (each corresponds to a valid f)
for idx, m in enumerate(matrices, 1):
    print(f"Answer {idx}:")
    for row in m:
        print(row)
    print()
print(f"Total number of such functions: {len(matrices)}")
```

This program enumerates all valid functions \(f\), each represented as a matrix, and outputs each one immediately (streaming). It respects the problem's constraints and is efficient given the small size.
[refine_program]
The provided Python program systematically enumerates all 3x3 boolean matrices where each row and column sums to exactly 2. The condition `(∀ p, (univ.filter (fun s => f p s)).card = 2) ∧ (∀ s, (univ.filter (fun p => f p s)).card = 2)` precisely captures the matrices with each row and column summing to 2. 

However, the program as given does not include print statements inside the nested loops, nor does it output any results. Consequently, it produces no output, which explains the "Error: Program outputs empty result". According to the instructions, the program must print each answer immediately when found, and the final output should contain the maximum (or relevant extremum) answer.

Since the problem does not specify an upper or lower bound to enumerate to, the correct approach is to:
- For each matrix satisfying the sum constraints, print the matrix.
- After enumeration, if a maximum or minimum is needed, explicitly output that value.

In this case, since the enumerated matrices are simply all matrices with each row and column sum to 2, the count of such matrices is known to be small, and we can output their count or the matrices themselves.

**Judgment:**  
The original program is *not* accepted because it produces no output, violates the requirement to print answers immediately, and therefore does not fulfill the problem's specifications.

**Corrected Program:**

```python
import itertools

# Enumerate all 3x3 matrices with boolean entries
for rows in itertools.product([0,1], repeat=3):
    for second in itertools.product([0,1], repeat=3):
        for third in itertools.product([0,1], repeat=3):
            matrix = [rows, second, third]
            # Check row sums
            if all(sum(row)==2 for row in matrix):
                # Check column sums
                col_sums = [sum(matrix[i][j] for i in range(3)) for j in range(3)]
                if col_sums == [2, 2, 2]:
                    # Immediately print found matrix
                    print(matrix)
```
