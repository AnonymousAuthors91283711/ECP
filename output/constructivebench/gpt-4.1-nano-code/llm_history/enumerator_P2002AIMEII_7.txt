The problem appears to be about finding the smallest positive integer \(k\) such that the sum of the squares from \(i=0\) to \(i=k\), inclusive, is divisible by 200. In other words, we seek the minimal \(k \geq 1\) satisfying:
\[
\left(\sum_{i=0}^{k} i^2 \right) \equiv 0 \pmod{200}
\]

The sum of squares up to \(k\) is given by:
\[
\sum_{i=0}^{k} i^2 = \frac{k(k+1)(2k+1)}{6}
\]

Our goal is to find the smallest \(k \geq 1\) for which this sum is divisible by 200.

Given the task, we will:
- Enumerate \(k\) starting from 1 upwards.
- Compute the sum of squares using the formula.
- Check divisibility by 200.
- Output every \(k\) that satisfies the condition immediately, until the smallest is found (since the problem asks for the least such \(k\)), then stop.

```python
# Enumerate k starting from 1 upwards
k = 1
while True:
    sum_squares = k * (k + 1) * (2 * k + 1) // 6
    if sum_squares % 200 == 0:
        print(k)
        break
    k += 1
```
