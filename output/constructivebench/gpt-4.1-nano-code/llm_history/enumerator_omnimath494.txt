The problem involves counting the number of quadruples (x1, y1, x2, y2) with specific bounds and the condition that x1 < x2 and y1 < y2, where x1, x2 are from 0..4 and y1, y2 from 0..5. We want to find the size of this set.

This corresponds to choosing two x-values and two y-values such that the first pair's x and y are less than the second pair's x and y. Effectively, for each pair of x-values (x1 < x2), and each pair of y-values (y1 < y2), there is exactly one quadruple satisfying x1 < x2 and y1 < y2 with those values.

Number of ways to choose (x1, x2) with x1 < x2: C(5, 2) = 10
Number of ways to choose (y1, y2) with y1 < y2: C(6, 2) = 15

For each of these pairs, there is exactly one combination of (x1, y1, x2, y2) satisfying the inequalities.

Total: 10 * 15 = 150.

Here's the code to enumerate and confirm this count:

```python
# Enumerate all possible quadruples and count those satisfying x1 < x2 and y1 < y2
# x1, x2 in 0..4; y1, y2 in 0..5

result = 0
for x1 in range(5):
    for x2 in range(5):
        if x1 < x2:
            for y1 in range(6):
                for y2 in range(6):
                    if y1 < y2:
                        # Immediate printing of each valid quadruple
                        print((x1, y1, x2, y2))
                        result += 1
print("Total count:", result)
```
