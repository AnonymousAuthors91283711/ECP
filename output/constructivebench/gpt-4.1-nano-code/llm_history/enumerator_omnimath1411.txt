The problem asks for the greatest natural number \( n \) such that \( (2004)! \) divides \( ((n!)!)! \). To approach this, we'll approximate the divisibility condition and enumerate candidate \( n \) values starting from small, verifying divisibility conditions based on factorial prime exponents. We prioritize small samples, since large \( n \) rapidly lead beyond our computational capacity.

We will:
- Use prime factor exponents to verify divisibility.
- Iterate \( n \) from a reasonable small point upwards.
- Stop when divisibility fails, recording the maximum \( n \) that still satisfies the divisibility.

Due to the constraints and the complexity, the code will use an approximation of prime exponent calculations, focusing on key primes dividing \( 2004! \).

```python
import math

# Function to compute the exponent of prime p in x!
def prime_factor_exponent(x, p):
    count = 0
    div = p
    while div <= x:
        count += x // div
        div *= p
    return count

# Compute prime factors of 2004! for divisibility
def factorial_prime_factors(n):
    # Only consider primes up to n
    primes = [p for p in range(2, n+1) if all(p % d != 0 for d in range(2, int(p**0.5)+1))]
    factors = {}
    for p in primes:
        exp = prime_factor_exponent(n, p)
        factors[p] = exp
    return factors

# Exponent of prime p in ((n!)!)!
def exponent_in_facination(n, p):
    # exponent of p in (factorial)! is sum_{k=1}^{floor((n)!/p^k)}
    # for large factorials, approximate using Legendre's formula
    return prime_factor_exponent(math.factorial(n), p)

# Precompute prime exponents for 2004!
target_factors = factorial_prime_factors(2004)

max_n_found = 0
# test n from some small range up to a threshold
for n in range(1, 50):  # small sample due to computational complexity
    n_fact = math.factorial(n)
    # Now compute exponents in ((n!)!)!
            # for each prime, check if (n!)! contains enough prime factors
    satisfies = True
    for p, required_exp in target_factors.items():
        exp_in_n_fact_factorial = prime_factor_exponent(n_fact, p)
        if exp_in_n_fact_factorial < required_exp:
            satisfies = False
            break
    if satisfies:
        print(n)  # streaming the results
        max_n_found = n
print("Maximum n satisfying the conditions:", max_n_found)
```
