This problem involves defining a function spade(x, y) = (x + y)(x - y) and evaluating spade 3 (spade 4 5). To assist, I'll enumerate all possible values of spade 4 5, then compute spade 3 that result from substituting that value.

Since spade 4 5 = (4 + 5)(4 - 5) = 9 * (-1) = -9, directly. The expression becomes spade 3 (-9) = (3 + (-9))(3 - (-9)) = (-6)(12) = -72.

I will write a Python program that, for demonstration purposes, checks a small sample of values close to 4 and 5 as small enumeration, then computes their spade values, and ultimately computes the answer.

```python
# Enumerate possible pairs (x, y) near (4, 5) to check spade values
# For high school level, just explicitly compute the specific expression:
# spade 4 5 = (4+5)*(4-5) = 9 * (-1) = -9
# Then compute spade 3 with that result
# Let's generalize to small sample of y values around 5 for demonstration, even if trivial here

# Since spade 4 5 is fixed, directly compute its value:
y_value = 5
x_value = 4
spade_4_5 = (x_value + y_value) * (x_value - y_value)

# Evaluate final expression spade 3 (spade 4 5)
x_final = 3
result = (x_final + spade_4_5) * (x_final - spade_4_5)

print(f"spade(4, 5) = {spade_4_5}")
print(f"spade(3, spade(4, 5)) = {result}")
```
