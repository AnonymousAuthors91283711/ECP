theorem olympiadbench2502
    (f : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ)
    (hf : ∀ k x, f k x = Real.sin x ^ 6 + Real.cos x ^ 6 + k * (Real.sin x ^ 4 + Real.cos x ^ 4)) :
    {k : ℝ | ∃ c : ℝ, f k c = 0} = olympiadbench2502_answer :=
  sorry
. Enumerated answers: All such k: []. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
The pattern in the enumerated answers suggests that the set is empty, since no k satisfies the condition for any c.  
Hence, the final answer is the empty set.
