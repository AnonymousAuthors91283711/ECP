Ground Truth Answer: fun _ => 1
Proposed Answer: fun x : ℚ => x ^ (1 / 2)
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem is about finding all functions f: ℚ → ℚ that satisfy the given functional equation for positive rationals.

2. The ground truth answer is the constant function f(x) = 1, which clearly satisfies:
   - f(x² * f(y)²) = f(x² * 1²) = 1
   - (f(x))² * f(y) = 1² * 1 = 1
   So it satisfies the equation.

3. The proposed answer is f(x) = √x (x^(1/2)), but:
   - For x=2, y=2 (both >0), f(2² * f(2)²) = f(4 * (√2)²) = f(4*2) = f(8) = √8
   - (f(2))² * f(2) = (√2)² * √2 = 2 * √2 = √8
   - While this works for these values, the function √x is not generally rational-valued for rational inputs (e.g., √2 is irrational), violating the f: ℚ → ℚ condition.

The proposed solution fails because it doesn't maintain the codomain restriction to ℚ.
