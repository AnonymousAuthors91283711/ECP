This problem asks to find the greatest number N of a particular form involving a sequence d_i with constraints, such that N is less than or equal to 4^2013 - 1, and the remainder when dividing by 210 is some value (which we need to determine). The sequence d_i has each element less than 4 (i.e., d_i ∈ {0,1,2,3}), becomes zero after some index k, and N is expressed as a sum involving d_i and 4^i.

In essence, N is a number less than 4^2013 that can be expressed as a sum of d_i * 4^i, where the d_i are digits in {0,1,2,3} with trailing zeros (beyond some index). To find the greatest remainder mod 210, we'll focus on the largest possible N just less than 4^2013 with these constraints, and then compute N mod 210.

Because 4^2013 is huge, brute-force enumeration is infeasible. But since the D digits are less than 4, and the trailing zeros condition means the sequence is finite in non-zero values, the largest N is obtained by taking all d_i = 3 for i = 0..(2012), which sums to (a geometric series):

N_max = ∑_{i=0}^{2012} 3 * 4^i = 3 * (4^{2013} - 1) / (4 - 1) = 3 * (4^{2013} - 1) / 3 = 4^{2013} - 1.

Thus, the maximum N matching the pattern is N = 4^{2013} - 1, which is exactly the bound given.

Now, we compute (4^{2013} - 1) mod 210.

Since 210 = 2 * 3 * 5 * 7, we'll compute this remainder efficiently using modular exponentiation.

```python
# Python code to compute 4^2013 mod 210 and thus (4^2013 - 1) mod 210

def mod_exp(base, exponent, modulus):
    result = 1
    base %= modulus
    for _ in range(exponent):
        result = (result * base) % modulus
    return result

# Since 4^2013 is large, use pow with modulus efficiently
power_mod = pow(4, 2013, 210)
remainder = (power_mod - 1) % 210
print(remainder)

# The maximum N under these constraints is 4^2013 - 1
# Since the sequence with all d_i=3 yields this N,
# the answer for (4^2013 - 1) mod 210 is 'remainder'.
