Ground Truth Answer: fun (m, n) => Nat.gcd (m + 1) n = 1
Proposed Answer: fun ⟨m, n⟩ => (n ∣ m + 1) ∧ (∃ p : Polynomial ℤ, p = ∑ i in Finset.range n, (-1)^i * Nat.choose (n - 1) i * X ^ (i * (n - 1)))
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

The ground truth states that gcd(m+1, n) = 1, meaning m+1 and n are coprime.

The proposed answer has two parts:
1. n divides m+1 (n ∣ m+1)
2. A specific polynomial construction

The first part of the proposed answer (n ∣ m+1) is actually stronger than the ground truth (gcd(m+1,n)=1). For example:
- If m=2, n=3: gcd(3,3)=3≠1 (ground truth false), n∣m+1 is true (3∣3)
- If m=3, n=2: gcd(4,2)=2≠1 (ground truth false), n∣m+1 is true (2∣4)
- If m=2, n=1: gcd(3,1)=1 (ground truth true), n∣m+1 is true (1∣3)

The proposed answer would incorrectly return true for cases where n divides m+1 but gcd(m+1,n)≠1. The second part about the polynomial construction doesn't seem to compensate for this.
