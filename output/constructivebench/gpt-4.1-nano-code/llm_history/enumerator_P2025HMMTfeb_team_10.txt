The problem asks to explore possible values of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the sum of squares \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\) and the product \(abc\), for positive integers \(a, b, c\). We want to enumerate potential values of \(n = \gcd(a^2 + b^2 + c^2, abc)\).

Key observations:
- \(a, b, c\) are positive integers.
- The gcd divides both sum and product.
- For small values, we can systematically check triples \((a, b, c)\) with small parameters.

Approach:
- Fix small ranges for \(a, b, c\) (e.g., 1 to 10).
- For each triple, compute \(d = \gcd(a^2 + b^2 + c^2, abc)\).
- Collect and print each \(d\).

This helps conjecture the set of possible gcd values.

```python
import math

found = set()

# Enumerate small positive integer triples
for a in range(1, 11):
    for b in range(1, 11):
        for c in range(1, 11):
            sum_squares = a**2 + b**2 + c**2
            product = a * b * c
            d = math.gcd(sum_squares, product)
            # Print each gcd value immediately
            print(d)
            found.add(d)

# The set 'found' contains all gcd values observed
```
