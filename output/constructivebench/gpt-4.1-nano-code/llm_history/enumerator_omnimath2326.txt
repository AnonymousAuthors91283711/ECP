The problem defines a property P over triples (x, y, z) of real numbers, where P holds iff x, y, z are nonnegative and sum to 1. It asks for the greatest possible value of v = x + y² + z³ among all such triples. To help conjecture and prove the maximum, we will generate possible candidate triples (x, y, z) with small, systematic variations, compute v, and determine the maximum among these.

Since the constraints are linear inequalities and equalities, the candidates of interest are at boundary points where some variables are zero or at critical points. For the enumeration, we choose small values for variables within [0,1], especially focusing on potential maximizing points: corners like (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), as well as points on edges and faces (e.g., (0.5, 0.5, 0)). We will generate these systematically, compute v, and output each.

The approach:
- Enumerate points with variables 0 or 1, and some fraction values within [0,1].
- For each, check the property P (which is guaranteed by construction).
- Compute v = x + y² + z³.
- Track the maximum v found.

Because the problem is at high school contest level, we limit ourselves to a small set of candidate points.

```python
# Enumeration of candidate points
candidates = []

# Corners where one variable is 1 and others 0
corners = [(1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1)]

# Edges between corners (with fractions)
edges = [
    (0.5, 0.5, 0),
    (0.5, 0, 0.5),
    (0, 0.5, 0.5),
    (0.75, 0.25, 0),
    (0.75, 0, 0.25),
    (0, 0.75, 0.25),
]

# Faces with points
faces = [
    (0.25, 0.25, 0.5),
    (0.25, 0.5, 0.25),
    (0.5, 0.25, 0.25),
    (0.1, 0.1, 0.8),
    (0.8, 0.1, 0.1),
    (0.1, 0.8, 0.1),
]

# Combine all candidate points
for pt in corners + edges + faces:
    x, y, z = pt
    # sum to 1 check (should be true for given points)
    if abs(x + y + z - 1) < 1e-8 and all(n >= 0 for n in (x,y,z)):
        v = x + y**2 + z**3
        print(f"Candidate {pt}: v = {v}")
        candidates.append((v, pt))

# Find the maximum value
max_v, max_pt = max(candidates, key=lambda t: t[0])
print(f"Maximum v found: {max_v} at point {max_pt}")
```
