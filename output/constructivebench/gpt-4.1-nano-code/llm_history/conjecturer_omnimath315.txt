The issue stems from attempting to define `omnimath315_answer` as an abbreviation dependent on `n`, but in the context, `n` is a parameter of the theorem, not directly accessible inside the abbreviation definition. Instead, the intended approach is to provide a fixed, concrete tuple that matches the provided answer for the specific input `n = 1988`, which yields the tuple `(1989, 1989, 1990, 3978)`.

The correct form should be a fixed tuple of concrete natural numbers, not parameterized by `n`. This aligns with the enumerated answer `(1989, 1989, 1990, 3978)` directly matching the given calculations for `n=1988`.

Thus, the fix is to replace the parameter-dependent definition with a concrete tuple, and the notation should be written as a fixed value directly.

<<<(1989, 1989, 1990, 3978)>>>

This explicit tuple corresponds to the results calculated and matches the known answer. It is a closed form in Lean that is independent of variable `n` and compiles properly, matching the expected answer pattern.
