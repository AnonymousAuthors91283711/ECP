The problem involves finding the greatest value of x satisfying a rational equation, with the solution expressible in the form a + sqrt(b + sqrt(c)), where a, b, c are positive integers summing to 263. To assist, we'll numerically investigate the solutions of the given equation in the real domain, focusing on potential candidate solutions near the points where the denominators are undefined (excluded points).

We'll test a range of x values around these critical points, look for solutions, then check whether solutions can be expressed as the specified nested radical form. Given the structure, we expect the solutions to lie somewhere between the excluded points, likely near the larger ones (17, 19).

Below is an approximate numerical search, printing solutions as soon as they are found.

```python
import numpy as np

# Define the function for which we find roots
def f(x):
    if x in [3, 5, 17, 19]:
        return None  # Skip undefined points
    return 3 / (x - 3) + 5 / (x - 5) + 17 / (x - 17) + 19 / (x - 19) - (x ** 2 - 11 * x - 4)

# Search parameters
x_min, x_max = 16, 20  # Focus around critical points, especially near 17 and 19
step = 0.01

# Collect potential solutions
solutions = []

# Iterate over the range to find sign changes indicating roots
x_vals = np.arange(x_min, x_max, step)
for i in range(len(x_vals) - 1):
    x1, x2 = x_vals[i], x_vals[i+1]
    if None in (f(x1), f(x2)):
        continue
    val1, val2 = f(x1), f(x2)
    if val1 * val2 < 0:
        # Sign change detected, approximate root by bisection
        low, high = x1, x2
        for _ in range(50):  # 50 iterations for precision
            mid = (low + high) / 2
            f_mid = f(mid)
            if f_mid is None:
                break
            if f_mid * val1 < 0:
                high = mid
                val2 = f_mid
            else:
                low = mid
                val1 = f_mid
        root = (low + high) / 2
        print(f"Found approximate root at x = {root:.6f}")
        solutions.append(root)

# For each solution, attempt to match the radical form
# Since root approximation is close, check for nested radical form
for sol in solutions:
    # Based on approximation, try to find integers a, b, c
    # Since the form is a + sqrt(b + sqrt(c)), consider candidate a near int part
    a_candidate = int(round(sol))
    residual = sol - a_candidate
    if residual < 0:
        continue
    # Approximate sqrt(c + b) as residual, guess c and b
    # Set constraints: b, c positive integers, residual â‰ˆ sqrt(b + sqrt(c))
    # Nested radicals suggest c small, test c from 1 to 100
    for c in range(1, 101):
        inner = residual ** 2
        # inner = b + sqrt(c)
        sqrt_c = np.sqrt(c)
        b = inner - sqrt_c
        if b > 0 and abs(b - round(b)) < 0.01:
            b_int = int(round(b))
            # Check sum
            total = a_candidate + b_int + c
            if total <= 263:
                print(f"Candidate solution: a={a_candidate}, b={b_int}, c={c}, sum={total}")
