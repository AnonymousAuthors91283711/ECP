Ground Truth Answer: 50
Proposed Answer: 0
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a scenario with paddle speed (7) and swim speed (2) over 1.5 hours (90 minutes). It asks for the time difference in minutes between two paths that result in equal distances.

2. The ground truth answer is 50 minutes, which is a reasonable solution given the speeds and time constraints.

3. The proposed answer is 0, which would imply no time difference between the paths. This contradicts the scenario where different speeds would naturally create time differences when covering equal distances.

4. The proposed answer of 0 doesn't make sense in this context because:
   - With different speeds (7 vs 2), equal distances would require different times
   - The equations in the problem statement would not be satisfied with t₁ = t₂
   - The ground truth shows there should be a significant time difference
