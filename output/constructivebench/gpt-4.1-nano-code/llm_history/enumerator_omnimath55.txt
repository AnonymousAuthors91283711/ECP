[write_program]
The problem appears to involve permutations of finite sets and the sum of minimal values of the images under such permutations, potentially with the goal of finding the minimal such sum for each `n`. To assist, we'll write a Python program that enumerates all permutations of `{0, 1, ..., n-1}` (for small `n`) and computes the sum as given, then finds the minimal value over all permutations.

Since the task is from a Lean theorem involving permutations (`Equiv.Perm`) and sums over the minimal of the permuted index and a related value, we'll interpret the minimal as `min(permuted_i, 2*i + 1)`.

We'll pick small `n` (say, â‰¤ 8) for computational feasibility, enumerate all permutations, calculate the sums, and report the minimal sum for each `n`. This will help approximate the `omnimath55_answer(n)`.

```python
import itertools

def enumerate_min_sum(n):
    min_sum = None
    min_perm = None
    for perm in itertools.permutations(range(n)):
        total = 0
        for i in range(n):
            total += min(perm[i], 2 * i + 1)
        print(f"Permutation: {perm}, sum: {total}")
        if min_sum is None or total < min_sum:
            min_sum = total
            min_perm = perm
    print(f"Minimum sum for n={n}: {min_sum} with permutation {min_perm}")
    return min_sum

# Test for small values of n
for n in range(1, 9):
    enumerate_min_sum(n)
```
