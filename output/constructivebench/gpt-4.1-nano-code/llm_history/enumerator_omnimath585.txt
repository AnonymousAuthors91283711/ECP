This problem involves enumerating specific hands from a deck of 52 cards, considering constraints on card types and point values. Our goal is to compute the ratio of the number of hands that meet certain high-level criteria: having four face cards (10, J, Q, K) and a point value of at least 13, over all hands with exactly four face cards.

Here's how we approach it:
- We select small sample values to limit computation and demonstrate the enumeration process.
- We'll explicitly enumerate all possible hands with the desired properties within reasonable bounds.
- The code filters and counts these hands, printing each qualifying hand as it is found.
- To simplify, we assume the small sample deck contains only four suits (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades) with known indices per card rank.
- For efficiency, we avoid generating all 52-card combinations directly; instead, we generate combinations of indices representing the cards within our sample.
- We compute and print the ratio of the count of qualifying hands over total 4-face-card hands.

```python
from itertools import combinations

# Define small sample deck: 4 suits, each with 13 cards
# Cards indexed from 0 to 51, suits grouped in blocks of 13
deck = list(range(52))
# Map each card to its rank (0-12)
def rank(c):
    return c % 13

# Generate all 4-card combinations
total_hands = 0
qualifying_hands = 0

# To keep enumeration manageable, we enumerate all combinations of 4 face cards (rank >= 10)
# For brevity, we consider only the face cards with ranks 10 (J), 11 (Q), 12 (K), 0 (A)
# But as per condition, face cards are those with rank >= 10, i.e., J, Q, K, A
# The problem’s condition: hand.filter (lambda c => c % 13 ≥ 10).card = 4 indicates all four face cards are J, Q, K, or possibly A if included
# The description mentions 10-13, but 13 is not a rank; likely 10, J(11),Q(12),K(13).
# Adjust accordingly: ranks >=10 for face cards.

face_ranks = list(range(10, 13+1))  # ranks 10,11,12,13, but 13 doesn't exist, so adjust to 10,11,12
# Actually, ranks are 0..12; ranks 10 (J),11(Q),12(K)? Let's assume J=10,Q=11,K=12. Ace=0.
face_ranks = [10, 11, 12]

# Create list of all face cards in the sample deck
face_cards = [c for c in deck if rank(c) in face_ranks]

# Enumerate all combinations of 4 face cards
for hand in combinations(face_cards, 4):
    total_hands += 1
    hand_set = set(hand)
    # Check if hand meets the condition: (hand.filter (λ c => c % 13 ≥ 10)).card = 4
    count_face_cards = sum(1 for c in hand if rank(c) in face_ranks)
    if count_face_cards == 4:
        # Check if pointValue >=13
        # pointValue: 4*Aces + 3*Kings + 2*Queens + 1*Jacks
        # Map rank to point value
        def point_value(c):
            r = rank(c)
            if r == 0:
                return 4
            elif r == 12:
                return 3
            elif r == 11:
                return 2
            elif r == 10:
                return 1
            else:
                return 0
        total_points = sum(point_value(c) for c in hand)
        if total_points >= 13:
            qualifying_hands += 1
            print(f"Qualifying hand: {hand}, Point value: {total_points}")

# Print the ratio as a float
print("Ratio:", qualifying_hands / total_hands if total_hands else 0)
```
