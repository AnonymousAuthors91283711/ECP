abbrev omnimath2809_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath2809 :
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ 
    ∃ (k : ℕ), 75 * n = k ∧ 
    783 * n = 10 * (k + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 * (n - 3))} 
    omnimath2809_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 20. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests the solution involves simplifying the given conditions, especially the equations involving \( 75n \) and \( 783n \). Since 75 and 783 are multiples of 15, dividing out common factors simplifies the equations, leaving an expression that clearly relates \( n \) and \( k \). The minimal \( n \) satisfying the conditions appears to be 20, based on the enumeration, which also makes sense given the constraints. 

The closed-form answer, matching the enumeration, is \( 20 \). 

Thus, the answer in Lean syntax:

<<<20>>>
