abbrev omnimath3299_answer : Prop := sorry
theorem omnimath3299 : omnimath3299_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Solution: x=-5, y=0
Solution: x=-4, y=-3
Solution: x=-4, y=3
Solution: x=-3, y=-4
Solution: x=-3, y=4
Solution: x=0, y=-5
Solution: x=0, y=5
Solution: x=3, y=-4
Solution: x=3, y=4
Solution: x=4, y=-3
Solution: x=4, y=3
Solution: x=5, y=0. Expected Answer Type: Prop
The solutions are pairs where either both are zero or symmetrically nonzero with constant shifts. From the pattern, x ∈ {-5, -4, -3, 0, 3, 4, 5} and y ∈ {-5, -4, -3, 0, 3, 4, 5} with specific pairs. Excluding pairs that are just negations, the essential solutions are (0, ±5), (±5, 0), (±4, ±3), and (±3, ±4). These can be summarized conditionally: the solutions where (x,y) satisfies that either |x|=|y|=5 or (|x| ∈ {3,4} and |y| ∈ {3,4}).

Solution: x=4, y=3
Solution: x=5, y=0. Expected Answer Type: Prop
The current proposed answer is attempting to define a proposition involving variables `x` and `y`, but these variables are not declared or introduced in the scope of the `Prop`. To make this compile, we need to explicitly introduce `x` and `y` as parameters or universally quantified variables in `omnimath3299_answer`.

Additionally, given the enumerated solutions, the pattern seems to be these specific points, all lying on coordinate axes or diagonals with certain absolute value conditions. The correction involves quantifying `x` and `y`, then defining the answer as a disjunction of the conditions matching these points.

The fixed version introduces `x` and `y` universally and constructs the disjunction accordingly:

<<<∀ x y, (x = 0 ∧ y = 5) ∨ (x = 0 ∧ y = -5) ∨ (x = 5 ∧ y = 0) ∨ (x = -5 ∧ y = 0) ∨ (|x|=3 ∧ |y|=4) ∨ (|x|=4 ∧ |y|=3)>>>

This captures all the enumerated solutions and provides a closed-form description that agrees with the pattern and solutions listed, avoiding the unbound identifier errors.
