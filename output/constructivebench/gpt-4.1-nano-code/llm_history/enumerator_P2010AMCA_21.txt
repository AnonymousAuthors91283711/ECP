This problem appears to involve a polynomial inequality and the existence of three distinct roots where the polynomial equals a linear function at those roots, but exceeds the linear function elsewhere. It resembles an extremal value problem associated with the polynomial's behavior relative to a linear function.

Given the structure, a key task is to understand the maximum value of the roots (x1, x2, x3) when the polynomial intersects the linear function at those roots. The parameters a, b, c influence the polynomial and the line. To analyze or conjecture the maximum root among x1, x2, x3, we can test particular small parameter values and roots to approximate the extremal. Since the program must be efficient and support enumeration, we'll choose a small set of parameter samples and enumerate candidate roots satisfying the polynomial equations.

**Approach:**

- Select small parameter values for `a`, `b`, `c`.
- For each, attempt to find roots `x` such that the polynomial equals the linear function.
- Use a root-finding method (brute-force over a range or a solver) to identify roots.
- For each set of roots, record the maximum root.

**Note:** As the problem looks algebraic and may involve complex roots, we'll restrict to real roots and small sample parameters.

Here's the program:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import brentq

# Polynomial function defined as P(x)
def P(x, a):
    return x**6 - 10*x**5 + 29*x**4 - 4*x**3 + a * x**2

# Linear function L(x)
def L(x, b, c):
    return b * x + c

# For given a, b, c, find roots x such that P(x) = L(x)
def find_roots(a, b, c, x_min=-2, x_max=3, num=500):
    xs = np.linspace(x_min, x_max, num)
    roots = []
    for i in range(num - 1):
        x1, x2 = xs[i], xs[i+1]
        if P(x1, a) - L(x1, b, c) * 1e-7 and P(x2, a) - L(x2, b, c) * 1e-7:
            continue
        if (P(x1, a) - L(x1, b, c)) * (P(x2, a) - L(x2, b, c)) <= 0:
            try:
                root = brentq(lambda x: P(x, a) - L(x, b, c), x1, x2)
                roots.append(root)
            except ValueError:
                continue
    return roots

# Example parameter samples
parameter_samples = [
    (0, 0, 0),
    (1, 1, -1),
    (2, -1, 0),
    (-1, 2, 1),
]

# Enumerate roots and output maxima
for a, b, c in parameter_samples:
    roots = find_roots(a, b, c)
    if roots:
        max_root = max(roots)
        print(f"Parameters: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}")
        for r in roots:
            print(f"Root x: {r:.4f}")
        print(f"Maximum root: {max_root:.4f}\n")
    else:
        print(f"Parameters: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}")
        print("No roots found in the sampled range.\n")
```
