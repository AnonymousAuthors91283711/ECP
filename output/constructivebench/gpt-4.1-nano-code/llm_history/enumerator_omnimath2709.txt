This problem appears to involve a specific algebraic expression involving the variable \( x \), with the given condition \( x = -3 \). The expression to evaluate is \( (x - 3)^2 \).

Since the problem provides \( x = -3 \), the value of the expression can be directly computed by substituting \( x \) with \(-3\). To explore possible answers, we can simulate small variations, but given the context, it's straightforward:

- Substituting \( x = -3 \), we get \( (-3 - 3)^2 = (-6)^2 = 36 \).

To ensure the correctness and provide a detailed enumeration approach, we can check for values close to \(-3\), but since the question explicitly states \( x = -3 \), the value is fixed.

```python
# The value of (x - 3)^2 when x = -3 is straightforward: (-3 - 3)^2 = (-6)^2 = 36
# To demonstrate enumeration, we can check nearby values, but the absolute value at x = -3 is definitive.

# Enumerate (x - 3)^2 for x in a small range around -3
for x_candidate in range(-10, 11):
    value = (x_candidate - 3)**2
    print(f"x = {x_candidate}, (x - 3)^2 = {value}")
    if x_candidate == -3:
        # Confirm the exact value at the given hx condition
        print(f"At x = -3 (given by hx), the value is {value}")
```

This code enumerates the value of \( (x - 3)^2 \) over a small integer range around \(-3\), confirming that at \( x = -3 \), the expression equals \( 36 \). It helps verify the behavior around the specified point contextually.
