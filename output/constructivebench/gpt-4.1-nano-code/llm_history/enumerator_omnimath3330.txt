Let's analyze the problem carefully.

We define `S` as the set of all "up-right" paths from (-400, -400) to (400, 400), where "up-right" means each step moves either one unit right or one unit up. The paths are discrete, only moving from one grid point to another with increasing x or y coordinate.

Set `T` filters `S` to those paths that never pass through points within the 20x20 square centered at (0,0), i.e., the points where |x| ≤ 10 and |y| ≤ 10.

The question asks for the ratio of the number of such "avoiding" paths (`T`) to the total number of paths (`S`).

**Key observations:**

- Total paths from (-400, -400) to (400, 400):

Number of steps right = 800, number of steps up = 800, total steps = 1600.

Number of paths = C(1600, 800).

- Paths avoiding the central 21×21 grid (from x,y in [-10,10]):

This is analogous to the principle of reflection or the inclusion-exclusion method.

- To count `|T|`, use the reflection principle to subtract paths passing through the forbidden zone.

- Since the grid and steps are large, we seek a ratio, which simplifies to counting the fraction of paths that do not pass through the forbidden zone.

- For small parameters, we can simulate or approximate:

(Considering the boundaries are large, the number of paths passing through the central zone is small compared to total paths, and the ratio approaches 1.) 

But to get an explicit ratio, the more straightforward is to consider the probability that a random "up-right" path from start to end avoids the "central" rectangle, which is roughly:

\[ \text{ratio} = 1 - \frac{\text{number of paths crossing the zone}}{\text{total number of paths}} \]

Using the reflection principle, the number of paths crossing the zone is roughly proportional to the number of paths passing through (0,0) or the boundary point of the zone.

However, since the grid is large, directly computing the probability is complicated. To estimate, we choose small sample parameters and simulate.

**Implementation idea:**

- For smaller starting and ending points, compute total paths and the number passing through the forbidden zone via combinatorics.

- Then, compute ratio; this can serve as an approximation for the large case.

Here's the code to enumerate small parameters and output their ratios.

```python
import math
from functools import lru_cache

# Function to compute binomial coefficient efficiently
def binom(n, k):
    return math.comb(n, k)

# Count total paths from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2)
def total_paths(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    dx = x2 - x1
    dy = y2 - y1
    if dx < 0 or dy < 0:
        return 0
    return binom(dx + dy, dx)

# Count paths crossing the forbidden zone
def crossing_paths(x1, y1, x2, y2, fx, fy, wx, wy):
    # Paths passing through (fx, fy)
    to_forbidden = total_paths(x1, y1, fx, fy)
    from_forbidden = total_paths(fx, fy, x2, y2)
    return to_forbidden * from_forbidden

# Main enumeration for small parameters
# Start at (-10, -10), end at (10, 10), forbidden zone in [-2,2], avoiding points with |x|≤1 and |y|≤1
start_x, start_y = -10, -10
end_x, end_y = 10, 10

total = total_paths(start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y)

# Count paths passing through the forbidden zone
# Integrate over all forbidden points within [-1,1] for avoiding central 3x3
forbidden_points = [(fx, fy) for fx in range(-1,2) for fy in range(-1,2)]
crossings = 0
for (fx, fy) in forbidden_points:
    crossings += crossing_paths(start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y, fx, fy, end_x, end_y)

avoiding = total - crossings
ratio = avoiding / total if total != 0 else 0

print(f"Sample parameters: start=(-10,-10), end=(10,10)")
print(f"Total paths: {total}")
print(f"Paths passing through forbidden zone: {crossings}")
print(f"Paths avoiding forbidden zone: {avoiding}")
print(f"Approximate ratio: {ratio:.4f}")
```
