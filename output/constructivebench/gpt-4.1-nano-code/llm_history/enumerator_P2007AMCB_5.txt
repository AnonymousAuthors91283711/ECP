This problem involves finding the smallest natural number n (between 0 and 22) that satisfies the inequality:

n * 6 + (22 - n) * 0 + 3 * 1.5 ≥ 100

which simplifies to:

6n + 4.5 ≥ 100

We want to find the minimal n satisfying this inequality. Since n is an integer, we can compute the values for n from 0 up to 22 and check which ones satisfy the inequality. The smallest such n will be the answer.

```python
# Enumerate n from 0 to 22
for n in range(23):
    value = n * 6 + (22 - n) * 0 + 3 * 1.5
    # If the inequality holds, print n
    if value >= 100:
        print(n)
        break
```
