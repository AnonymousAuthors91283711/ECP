theorem omnimath1336 :
    (∑' a : Set.Ici 1, ∑' b : Set.Ici a.1, ∑' c : Set.Ici b.1, 1 / (2 ^ a.1 * 3 ^ b.1 * 5 ^ c.1) = omnimath1336_answer) :=

. Enumerated answers: Sum over triples: 1/16
. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The sum is over all triples with a ≥ 1, b ≥ a, c ≥ b, summing 1/(2^a * 3^b * 5^c). Recognize the geometric series structure: the sum telescopes with constraints. The pattern indicates the sum converges to (1/16). 

Final answer: <<<1/16>>>
