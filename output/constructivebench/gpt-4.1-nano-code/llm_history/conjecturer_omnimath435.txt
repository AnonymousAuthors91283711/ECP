theorem omnimath435 : 
  ∃ (f : ℝ × ℝ → ℝ × ℝ), 
    (∀ (x y : ℝ), 0 < x → 0 < y → 
      f (x, y) = ((x + y) / 2, 2 * (1 / x + 1 / y)⁻¹)) ∧
    let (a, b) := iterate f 2017 (1, 10^8)
    abs (min a b - omnimath435_answer) < 1 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Minimum after iterations: 10000.000000000004
Geometric mean: 10000.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests the geometric mean remains constant at 10000 for the iterates. Hence, the answer is the geometric mean = 10000.
