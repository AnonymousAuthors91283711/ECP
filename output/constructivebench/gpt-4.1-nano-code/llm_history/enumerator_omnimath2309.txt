The problem involves combinatorics and probability, with parameters constrained to small values (x, y â‰¤ 5). The key variables involve binomial coefficients and their combinations, so we'll enumerate all (x, y) pairs satisfying constraints, compute the total number of paths, blocked paths, and then verify the fractional expression. We will print each result immediately as we find it, searching for an explicit formula or pattern.

```python
from math import comb

# Enumerate all (x, y) with x, y <= 5
for x in range(6):
    for y in range(6):
        total_paths = comb(10, 5)  # 252
        blocked_paths = comb(x + y, x) * comb(10 - x - y, 5 - x)
        result = (total_paths - blocked_paths) / 36
        print(f"x={x}, y={y}: total_paths={total_paths}, blocked_paths={blocked_paths}, result={result}")
```
