This problem asks to analyze a complex functional equation involving a function \(F:\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}\) with certain properties: covering all natural numbers, infinite preimages for positive values, and a recursive relation involving powers and compositions. To conjecture about its existence, letâ€™s consider small sample functions, particularly those that satisfy the covering and infiniteness conditions, then test whether the recursive equation could hold.

We will:
- Generate candidate functions \(F(n)\), perhaps simple ones like constant functions, identity, or linear functions.
- Check the recursive relation for small \(n\).
- Since the problem involves infinite sets and a quite complicated recursive condition, start with the simplest functions, and then observe if the recursive property can be satisfied or violated.

Here is the Python program:

```python
# Attempt to enumerate functions F: N -> N that could satisfy the given properties
# We'll test simple functions first (identity, constant, linear) for small n,
# to see if they satisfy the recursive relation for small values of n.

def test_function(F, max_n=10, max_power=3):
    # Check the recursive relation: for n >= 2,
    # F(F(n**163)) = F(F(n)) + F(F(361))
    for n in range(2, max_n+1):
        left = F(F(n**163))
        right = F(F(n)) + F(F(361))
        if left != right:
            return False
    return True

# Candidate functions:

# 1. Identity function
F_identity = lambda n: n
print("Identity function test:", test_function(F_identity))

# 2. Constant function
F_const = lambda n: 1
print("Constant function test:", test_function(F_const))

# 3. Linear function
F_linear = lambda n: n + 5
print("Linear function test:", test_function(F_linear))

# 4. Doubling function
F_double = lambda n: 2*n
print("Doubling function test:", test_function(F_double))
```

This code enumerates simple functions to check if the recursive relation can be satisfied by basic candidates. Based on results, more complex functions can be tested. The approach is to identify potential solutions that meet the properties through computational experiments for small \(n\).
