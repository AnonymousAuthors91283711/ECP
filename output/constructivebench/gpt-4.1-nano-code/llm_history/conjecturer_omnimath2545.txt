theorem omnimath2545 : 
  (∑ k in Finset.range 9, if k ≥ 4 then (choose 8 k : ℚ) * (1/2)^8 else 0) = omnimath2545_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: k=4: C(8,4)=70 * (1/2)^8 = 0.2734375
k=5: C(8,5)=56 * (1/2)^8 = 0.21875
k=6: C(8,6)=28 * (1/2)^8 = 0.109375
k=7: C(8,7)=8 * (1/2)^8 = 0.03125
k=8: C(8,8)=1 * (1/2)^8 = 0.00390625
Total sum from k=4 to 8: 0.63671875. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
<<<(↑(56 + 28 + 8 + 1) * (1/2)^8)>>>

The sum ∑_{k=4}^{8} C(8,k)*(1/2)^8 simplifies to (sum of coefficients) * (1/2)^8; coefficient sum = 56 + 28 + 8 + 1 = 93. To match the answer type ℚ, express as a rational number: 93 * 1/2^8.
