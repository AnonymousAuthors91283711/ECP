theorem omnimath3759 (n : ℕ) (A : Matrix (Fin n) (Fin n) ℕ) 
  (hA : ∀ i j, A i j = (i.val + 1) + (j.val + 1)) : 
  rank (A.map (Nat.cast : ℕ → ℚ)) = omnimath3759_answer n := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun n => if n = 0 then 0 else 2
Proposed Answer: fun n => if n = 1 then 1 else 2
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves a matrix A where each entry A i j = (i+1) + (j+1) (converted to rationals for rank calculation).

2. For n=0: The matrix is empty, so rank should be 0 (ground truth correctly handles this, proposed answer doesn't explicitly handle n=0 but would fall through to the else case giving 2, which is incorrect).

3. For n=1: The matrix is [2+2=4], which has rank 1 (proposed answer is correct here, ground truth gives 2 which is incorrect).

4. For n≥2: The matrix has rank 2 since rows are linear combinations of [1,1,...,1] and [1,2,...,n] (both answers correctly give 2).

The answers disagree on n=0 and n=1 cases. The proposed answer is correct for n=1 but wrong for n=0, while the ground truth is wrong for n=1 but correct for n=0.
