The problem involves computing the sum over all divisors of 2016: 
\[ \sum_{d | 2016} \frac{1}{n} \cdot \frac{d^2}{d^2 + 2016} \]
where \( n = \text{number of divisors of 2016} \).

To help conjecture the value, let's list all divisors of 2016, compute the sum, and analyze if there's a pattern or simplification. The total number of divisors is manageable, since 2016's prime factorization is \( 2^5 \times 3^2 \times 7 \), giving \( (5+1)(2+1)(1+1)=6 \times 3 \times 2=36 \) divisors. We enumerate all divisors directly, which is computationally feasible.

The code will:
- Calculate divisors of 2016.
- Compute the sum over these divisors.
- Output the sum as a rational number.

```python
from math import sqrt
from fractions import Fraction

# Prime factorization of 2016: 2^5 * 3^2 * 7
# Generate all divisors from prime factors
primes_factors = [(2, 5), (3, 2), (7, 1)]
divisors = []

def generate_divisors(factors, current=1):
    if not factors:
        divisors.append(current)
        return
    prime, exp = factors[0]
    for e in range(exp + 1):
        generate_divisors(factors[1:], current * (prime ** e))

generate_divisors(primes_factors)

n = len(divisors)

total_sum = Fraction(0, 1)
for d in divisors:
    total_sum += Fraction(1, n) * Fraction(d*d, d*d + 2016)

print("Divisors:", sorted(divisors))
print("Number of divisors:", n)
print("Sum:", float(total_sum))
print("Sum (exact):", total_sum)
```
