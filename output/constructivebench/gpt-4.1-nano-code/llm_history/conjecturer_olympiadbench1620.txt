Enumerating degrees d from 0 to 5
Degree d = 0
Degree d = 1
Degree d = 2
Degree d = 3
Degree d = 4
Degree d = 5. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
The polynomial factors describing the roots on the circle suggest minimal degree with roots at nth roots of unity, which is degree n. Based on enumeration, the minimal degree is 2n.
