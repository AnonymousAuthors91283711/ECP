Total solutions: 4. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the patterns, solutions are symmetric around zero with constraints p.1^2020 + (p.2 - 1)^2 = 1. For p.1 in {-1, 0, 1} and p.2 in {0, 2} satisfying the equation, the solutions are: (-1, 1): (-1)^2020 + 0 = 1, (0, 0): 0 + 1 = 1, (0, 2): 0 + 1 = 1, (1, 1): 1 + 0 = 1.

Final count: 4. 

Answer: <<<4>>>
