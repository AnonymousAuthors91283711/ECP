This problem seems to involve finding the number of real solutions \( x \) such that \( n = \sqrt{120 - \sqrt{x}} \) for some integer \( n \). 

Here's the reasoning:
- The equation: \( n = \sqrt{120 - \sqrt{x}} \)
- Square both sides: \( n^2 = 120 - \sqrt{x} \)
- Rearrange: \( \sqrt{x} = 120 - n^2 \)
- For \( x \geq 0 \), we need \( 120 - n^2 \geq 0 \Rightarrow n^2 \leq 120 \)

Since \( n \) is an integer, \( n \) ranges from \(-\lfloor \sqrt{120} \rfloor\) to \( \lfloor \sqrt{120} \rfloor \). But because \( \sqrt{x} \geq 0 \), and \( \sqrt{x} = 120 - n^2 \geq 0 \), the relevant \( n \) values are non-negative.

For each valid \( n \geq 0 \), the corresponding \( x \) is:

\[ x = (\sqrt{x})^2 = (120 - n^2)^2 \]

The values of \( x \) are thus:

\[ x = (120 - n^2)^2 \quad \text{for } n \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0} \text{ with } n^2 \leq 120 \]

Number of solutions equals the number of such \( n \).

We will enumerate \( n \) from 0 up to \( \lfloor \sqrt{120} \rfloor \), count solutions, and output that count.

```python
import math

# Calculate the maximum integer n such that n^2 <= 120
max_n = int(math.isqrt(120))

solutions = []

# For each n, compute x = (120 - n^2)^2
for n in range(max_n + 1):
    x = (120 - n ** 2) ** 2
    solutions.append(x)
    print(f"Solution for n={n}: x={x}")

# The total number of solutions
answer = len(solutions)
print(f"Total solutions count: {answer}")
```
