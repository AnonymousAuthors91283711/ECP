This problem seems to involve understanding a property of polynomials over ℤ related to enumerations of ℕ and summations over finite intervals. Since it appears abstract and involves an equivalence with a "set" of polynomials, a practical approach is to examine polynomials of small degree and small coefficients, enumerate candidate sequences (a : ℕ → ℤ), and check the summation condition for possible integers k.

Let's interpret the statement:
- For all functions a : ℕ → ℤ that are bijective (i.e., permutations of ℕ), there exists some i, j, k such that the sum of a(n) from n=i to j-1 equals P.eval(k);
- The statement holds iff P is in a particular set of polynomials (omnimath1554_answer).

Our goal is to generate candidates P, analyze whether the property holds, and identify the set component.

**Strategy:**
- Focus on simple polynomials: constants, linear, quadratic.
- Generate some sample sequences a: permutations of ℕ.
- For each polynomial, attempt to find i, j, k satisfying the conditions.
- Record polynomials satisfying the condition for all such permutations (though for simplicity, check for some sample permutations).

Here's a small enumerative code focusing on coefficients up to degree 2, constants, and small integer coefficients, and testing the property with various permutations.

```python
# Enumerate polynomials with coefficients in -2..2, degree up to 2
# For each polynomial, test with simple permutations of the natural numbers
# (identity and reverse) to see if the property holds
import itertools

# Generate candidate polynomials: P(x) = a0 + a1 x + a2 x^2
coeff_range = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]
candidate_polynomials = []

for a0 in coeff_range:
    for a1 in coeff_range:
        for a2 in coeff_range:
            candidate_polynomials.append((a0, a1, a2))

# Define simple permutations of ℕ: identity, reversal
permutations = [
    lambda n: n,
    lambda n: 9 - n,  # small reversed permutation
]

# Function to evaluate polynomial at k
def eval_poly(coeffs, x):
    a0, a1, a2 = coeffs
    return a0 + a1 * x + a2 * x * x

# Check the property for a given polynomial
for coeffs in candidate_polynomials:
    property_holds = True
    for a in permutations:
        # Try small i, j, k
        found = False
        for i in range(0, 5):
            for j in range(i, 5):
                sum_a = sum(a(n) for n in range(i, j))
                # Check for some k in -5..5
                for k in range(-5, 6):
                    val = eval_poly(coeffs, k)
                    if sum_a == val:
                        found = True
                        break
                if not found:
                    property_holds = False
                    break
            if not property_holds:
                break
        if not property_holds:
            break
    if property_holds:
        # If the property holds for these permutations, include polynomial
        print(f"Polynomial with coefficients {coeffs} satisfies the property.")
        # Add to the set of answers
        # (for demonstration, just print)
```
