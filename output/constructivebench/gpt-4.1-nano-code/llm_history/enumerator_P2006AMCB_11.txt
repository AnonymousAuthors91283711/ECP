This problem appears to involve ratios of cream quantities after some drinks are added, with initial amounts given for Joe and JoAnn. The goal is to find the value of their final cream ratios. To explore possible answers, I will enumerate values based on the parameters, focusing on exact fractions and their ratios, considering the algebraic expressions.

Since the problem involves initial amounts (both 12), added amounts (2), and ratios involving multiplication and division, I will try small rational approximations and compute the ratios for different possible interpretations. 

Given the definitions:
- Joe's final cream: `joeAdd` (which seems to be the addition amount, possibly influencing cream ratio)
- JoAnn's final cream: `joAnnAdd * (joAnnInitial / (joAnnInitial + joAnnAdd))`

Assuming the initial amounts and additives are fixed at 12 and 2 respectively, I'll compute the possible final ratios of cream as fractions. To be more general, I'll try a small range of additive values around 2, maybe 1 to 4, to explore possible ratios, and compute their ratios accordingly.

Here's a Python script to systematically enumerate plausible ratios, and output the ratio of Joe's final cream over JoAnn's final cream:

```python
# Enumerate possible additive values for Joe and JoAnn around the given parameters.
# Compute their final cream ratios based on the given expressions.

# Fixed parameters
joe_initial = 12
joann_initial = 12
joe_add_values = [1, 2, 3, 4]
joann_add_values = [1, 2, 3, 4]

for joe_add in joe_add_values:
    for joann_add in joann_add_values:
        joe_final_cream = joe_add  # As per definition
        # JoAnn's final cream
        joann_final_cream = joann_add * (joann_initial / (joann_initial + joann_add))
        ratio = joe_final_cream / joann_final_cream
        # Output the ratio as a simplified fraction
        numerator = joe_final_cream * (joann_initial + joann_add)
        denominator = joann_add * joann_initial
        # Simplify the fraction
        from math import gcd
        g = gcd(int(numerator), int(denominator))
        numerator_simplified = int(numerator) // g
        denominator_simplified = int(denominator) // g
        print(f"Joe add: {joe_add}, JoAnn add: {joann_add} => ratio: {numerator_simplified}/{denominator_simplified}")
```

This code enumerates small additive variations, computes the ratio of final cream amounts, and simplifies the fraction to assist in formulating a conjecture. Since the problem parameters are fixed, and the goal is to explore possible ratios, this enumeration method helps identify the pattern of ratios under different parameters.

```python
# Enumeration of ratios with small parameter variations for conjecture.
```
