Ground Truth Answer: 220
Proposed Answer: 40
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives a multiset of angles including one unknown x, with constraints:
   - Sum of angles must equal (n-2)*180 (polygon angle sum)
   - Each angle must be between 0 and 180*(n-2)/n

2. Current angles sum (without x): 30+50+60+70+90+100+120+160 = 680
   Total sum must be (n-2)*180

3. For n=7: sum would be 5*180=900 → x=900-680=220
   Check constraints:
   - 0 < x < 180*5/7 ≈ 128.57 → fails (220 > 128.57)
   
4. For n=8: sum would be 6*180=1080 → x=1080-680=400
   Check constraints:
   - 0 < x < 180*6/8=135 → fails (400 > 135)

5. For n=6: sum would be 4*180=720 → x=720-680=40
   Check constraints:
   - 0 < x < 180*4/6=120 → valid (0 < 40 < 120)

The proposed answer 40 works for n=6, while the ground truth 220 doesn't satisfy the constraints for any reasonable n. The problem likely expects n=6 as the only valid solution.
