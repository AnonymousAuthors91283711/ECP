Ground Truth Answer: fun a x => a * x
Proposed Answer: fun a : ℤ => fun n : ℤ => a * n
Let's analyze the two answers:

1. Ground Truth Answer: `fun a x => a * x` - This is a function that takes two integer arguments `a` and `x` and returns their product.

2. Proposed Answer: `fun a : ℤ => fun n : ℤ => a * n` - This is a curried function that first takes an integer `a`, then takes an integer `n`, and returns their product.

These are exactly equivalent in meaning, just written in different styles (uncurried vs curried form). Both represent linear functions of the form f(x) = a*x.
