The problem involves computing the product over integers from 2 to 6 of the expression ((n^3 - 1) / (n^3 + 1)). To assist in conjecturing the answer, I will enumerate the values of n from 2 to 6, compute the product step-by-step, printing each partial product as soon as it is computed.

This approach allows us to see intermediate results, leading to the conjecture of the closed form or final value.

```python
import fractions

# Range of n: 2 to 6
n_values = range(2, 7)

product = fractions.Fraction(1, 1)
print(f"Initial product: {product}")

for n in n_values:
    numerator = n ** 3 - 1
    denominator = n ** 3 + 1
    term = fractions.Fraction(numerator, denominator)
    
    product *= term
    print(f"n={n}: (({n}^3 - 1)/({n}^3 + 1)) = {term} => Product so far: {product}")

print(f"Final product: {product}")
```
