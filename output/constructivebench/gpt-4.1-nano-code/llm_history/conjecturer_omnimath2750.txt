y = 10, x = 10, expression = 16.0
y = 11, x = 8, expression = 16.0
y = 12, x = 6, expression = 16.0
y = 13, x = 4, expression = 16.0
y = 14, x = 2, expression = 16.0
y = 15, x = 0, expression = 16.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern shows that for each y from 0 to 15, x decreases by 2 starting from 30, and the sum always results in 16.0. The relation y + x/2 = 15 holds, so the expression (x/5 + 2y/3 + 2y/5 + x/3) simplifies to 16.0 for all solutions, which is constant. 

Hence, the answer is constant: 

<<<16.0>>>
