abbrev omnimath3545_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3545 :
  ∃! x : ℝ, ((-1) * (2) * (x) * (4) = 24) ↔ x = omnimath3545_answer :=
sorry
. Enumerated answers: x = -3. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The given equation is \(-1 \times 2 \times x \times 4 = 24\). Simplify to \(-8x = 24\), so \(x = -\frac{24}{8} = -3\). This matches the enumerated answer, and the unique solution is explicitly determined.
