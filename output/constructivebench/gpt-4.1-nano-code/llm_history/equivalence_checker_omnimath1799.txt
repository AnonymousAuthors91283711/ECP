Ground Truth Answer: 11/6
Proposed Answer: 5/6
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is calculating the expected number of matches between the first 5 dice rolls and the 6th dice roll when rolling 6 fair 6-sided dice.

2. For each of the first 5 dice, the probability it matches the 6th die is 1/6 (since the 6th die is fixed and each die is independent).

3. By linearity of expectation, the expected number of matches is the sum of these probabilities: 5 * (1/6) = 5/6.

4. The ground truth answer claims 11/6, which would be incorrect because:
   - It's larger than the maximum possible matches (which is 5)
   - It doesn't match the correct calculation via linearity of expectation

5. The proposed answer of 5/6 is correct based on:
   - Correct application of linearity of expectation
   - Matches intuitive understanding (each of 5 dice has 1/6 chance to match the 6th)

<<<False>>>

(The ground truth answer is incorrect, while the proposed answer is correct. Therefore, they are not equivalent, and we return False)
