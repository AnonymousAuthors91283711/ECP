The problem is to find the smallest positive integer s such that there exist integers a, b, c with a * b * c = 60 and a + b + c = s. We want to enumerate all triples (a, b, c) with a * b * c = 60, compute their sums, and find the minimum positive sum.

Approach:
- Generate all integer factorizations of 60 into three factors.
- For each, calculate their sum.
- Keep track of the smallest positive sum.

Since 60 factors into integers, we can iterate over divisors of 60, then for each divisor, find pairs of integers that multiply with the divisor to get 60, considering positive and negative factors.

This approach balances thoroughness with efficiency.

```python
def enumerate_factor_triples():
    # Gather divisors of 60 to generate factorizations
    divisors = []
    for i in range(1, abs(60)+1):
        if 60 % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            divisors.append(-i)

    seen_sums = set()
    min_sum = None

    for a in divisors:
        for b in divisors:
            # Compute c so that a*b*c=60
            if a * b != 0 and 60 % (a * b) == 0:
                c = 60 // (a * b)
                s = a + b + c
                # Check if a, b, c are integers (they always are here)
                # Record positive sums
                if s > 0:
                    print(s)
                    if min_sum is None or s < min_sum:
                        min_sum = s
    # After enumeration, print minimal positive sum
    if min_sum is not None:
        print(f"Minimum positive sum: {min_sum}")

enumerate_factor_triples()
```
