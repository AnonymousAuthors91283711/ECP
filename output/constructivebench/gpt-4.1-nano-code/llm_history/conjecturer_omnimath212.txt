The main error in the existing answer is the improper syntax used within the set comprehension. In Lean, to denote the elements of the set with specific properties, we need to use a subset notation with a predicate (property) or a set builder with a predicate, or explicitly define the set as a set of functions satisfying the property.

In the current proposal, the expression `{ λ f : ℝ → ℝ, ∀ x y : ℝ, ... } | f = λ _ : ℝ, 0 }` is invalid syntax because Lean does not support a set with a predicate separator `|` inside the braces in that way. Instead, the correct approach is to write either as a subset of functions satisfying the equation, or as a set of functions explicitly defined to fulfill the functional equation.

Given the solutions, the constant zero function `λ _ : ℝ, 0` is a particular solution satisfying the equation. To describe the set of solutions in a **closed form**, including only this constant solution, it's best to define the set as the set `{f : ℝ → ℝ | f x = 0 ∀ x}`.

Using Mathlib notation, the correct syntax would be:

```lean
{f : ℝ → ℝ | ∀ x : ℝ, f x = 0}
```

Alternatively, since it's one solution, you can describe the solution set explicitly as `{f : ℝ → ℝ | ∀ x, f x = 0}`.

Given the enumerated solutions include the constant solution `f(x) = 0` and the linear solution `f(x) = 0 * x + 0`, which is the same, the set consists exactly of the zero function.

**Final Corrected Answer:**

<<<{f : ℝ → ℝ | ∀ x : ℝ, f x = 0}>>>
