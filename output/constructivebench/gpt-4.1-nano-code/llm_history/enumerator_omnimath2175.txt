This problem involves finding a subset `s` of natural numbers such that for each `n` in `s`, two conditions hold: 
- `n` is positive
- iterating a certain function starting from 2022 at `n` yields a prime number, but starting from 2021 at `n` does not yield a prime.

The key steps are:
- Find candidate `n` values, likely small, because larger `n` may be infeasible.
- For each candidate, check the iteration condition.
- Sum the `n` values that satisfy the conditions, and output the total sum.

Since the problem asks for specific `s`, and the iteration involves subtracting the minimal factor repeatedly, a brute-force enumeration over small candidates (say, `n` = 1 to 20) ensures efficiency and correctness.

Let's implement an enumeration over small `n`, check the iteration conditions, and collect the sums. We will print each valid `n` as it is found, and finally compute their total sum as the answer.

```python
from math import gcd

# Function to find min factor of n (smallest prime divisor)
def min_factor(n):
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return i
    return n

# Function to perform the iteration: m -> m - minFac(m)
def iterate(n, start):
    m = start
    while m > 1:
        m = m - min_factor(m)
    return m

candidate_sum = 0
# Choose small sample range for n (e.g., 1 to 20)
for n in range(1, 21):
    # Check conditions
    iter_2022 = iterate(n, 2022)
    iter_2021 = iterate(n, 2021)
    # Conditions: iter(2022, n) prime, iter(2021, n) not prime
    def is_prime(x):
        if x < 2:
            return False
        for i in range(2, int(x**0.5)+1):
            if x % i == 0:
                return False
        return True
    if is_prime(iter_2022) and not is_prime(iter_2021):
        print(f"n = {n}")
        candidate_sum += n

print(f"Sum of all such n: {candidate_sum}")
```
