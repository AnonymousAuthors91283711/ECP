abbrev IMO2013SLN1_answer : ℕ → ℕ := sorry
theorem IMO2013SLN1 (f : ℕ → ℕ) :
  (∀ m n : ℕ, m^2 + f n ∣ m * f m + n) ↔ f = IMO2013SLN1_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Constant functions f(n)=c that hold for small test cases:

Linear functions f(n)=k*n + c that hold for small test cases:
f(n) = 1*n + 0
f(n)=n satisfies the divisibility condition for small m,n.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
<<<fun n : ℕ => n + 1>>>
