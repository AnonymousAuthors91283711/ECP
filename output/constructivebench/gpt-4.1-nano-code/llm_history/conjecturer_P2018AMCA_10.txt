The proposed answer `<<1>>` is invalid in Lean syntax because `<<` and `>>` are not valid tokens for defining a constant. Instead, the answer should be just a natural number, which in this context is 1, representing the number of solutions.

Given the problem, `S` is defined as the set of pairs `(x, y)` in ℝ×ℝ satisfying the equations:
- \( x + y = 1 \)
- \( x - y = 1 \)

Solving these simultaneously:
- Adding both: \( 2x = 2 \Rightarrow x = 1 \)
- Using \( x + y = 1 \Rightarrow 1 + y = 1 \Rightarrow y = 0 \)

Thus, there's exactly one solution: `(x, y) = (1, 0)`.

Therefore, the `P2018AMCA_10_answer` should be 1, and the syntax should be corrected to a simple natural number `1`.

**Final Fixed Answer:**

<<<1>>>

**Explanation:**  
This provides the count of solutions, which is exactly one, matching the enumeration `(1, 0)`. The syntax is valid in Lean, and the value correctly represents the number of solutions.
