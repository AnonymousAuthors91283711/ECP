The given theorem involves calculating the exact value of \( 2 \sqrt{1.5 + \sqrt{2}} - (1.5 + \sqrt{2}) \). To assist in conjecturing and possibly proving this, I will generate all potential simplified radical forms for the expression. Since it's a high school-level problem, the answer likely simplifies to a known radical or rational number.

The expression:
\[ 2 \sqrt{1.5 + \sqrt{2}} - (1.5 + \sqrt{2}) \]
can be examined by testing candidate algebraic forms where \( \sqrt{1.5 + \sqrt{2}} \) might equal \( \sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b} \) for some rational \( a, b \).

We will enumerate candidate pairs \( (a, b) \) with small integer or simple rational values, try to verify if:
\[ 1.5 + \sqrt{2} = (\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b})^2 \]
which implies:
\[ 1.5 + \sqrt{2} = a + b + 2\sqrt{ab} \]

Matching parts:
- Rational: \( a + b = 1.5 \)
- Irrational: \( 2 \sqrt{ab} = \sqrt{2} \Rightarrow 4ab = 2 \Rightarrow ab = 0.5 \)

Now, enumerate small \( a, b \) with rational values satisfying those.

We will:

- Loop over small rational \( a, b \)
- Check if \( a + b \approx 1.5 \) (within numerical tolerance)
- Check if \( ab \approx 0.5 \)
- If so, compute the simplified form of the entire expression.

```python
# Enumerate pairs (a, b) with small rational values to find if sqrt(1.5 + sqrt(2)) simplifies.
import math

# Define small rational candidates for a, b (for simplicity, rationals with denominator 1 or 2)
candidate_params = [
    (a, b)
    for a in [0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25]
    for b in [0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25]
    if abs(a + b - 1.5) < 1e-6 and abs(4 * a * b - 2) < 1e-6
]

for a, b in candidate_params:
    # sqrt(1.5 + sqrt(2)) ≈ sqrt( (√a + √b)^2 ) = √a + √b
    val_sqrt_expr = math.sqrt(a) + math.sqrt(b)
    # compute the entire expression
    expr = 2 * val_sqrt_expr - (1.5 + math.sqrt(2))
    print(f"For a={a}, b={b}: sqrt(1.5 + sqrt(2)) ≈ {val_sqrt_expr:.6f}, expression ≈ {expr:.6f}")
    # check if expression is close to zero, possibly indicating equality
    if abs(expr) < 1e-6:
        print(f"Found exact radical form with a={a}, b={b}: expression equals 0")
        # Since the expression is zero, answer is 0
        print("Answer: 0")
```
