abbrev P2022AIMEI_9_answer : ℕ × ℕ := sorry
theorem P2022AIMEI_9 :
  let total_arrangements : ℚ := 12! / (2^6)
  let even_arrangements : ℚ := 5 * (2^5 * 6!)
  let (m, n) := P2022AIMEI_9_answer
  IsCoprime m n ∧
  even_arrangements / total_arrangements = m / n := by sorry. Enumerated answers: m = 32
n = 2079. Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ
The pattern suggests the answer is simplified to a coprime pair. Given m=32 and n=2079, the greatest common divisor is 1, so the normalized pair is (32, 2079). In Lean, as a closed form without the specific enumerations, the mix of factorials and powers suggests a ratio that simplifies to these numbers. Based on the pattern and the enumeration:

<<<(32, 2079)>>>
