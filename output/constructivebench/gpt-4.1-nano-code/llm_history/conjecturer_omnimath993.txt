Linear function f(x)=0x: sum = 0
Linear function f(x)=1x: sum = 0
Linear function f(x)=-1x: sum = 0. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The function f(x)=x satisfies the functional equation with sum over integers from -2019 to 2019 being the sum of all n, which is zero because it’s symmetric around zero. The sum of all integers in this range is zero.
