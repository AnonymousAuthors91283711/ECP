Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The main issue is that in Lean, you cannot directly refer to a local binding like `areaABC` inside the definition. You either need to define `areaABC` at the top level or explicitly replace its usage with the value. Since the input involves specific given values, the simplest fix is to replace the undefined `areaABC` in the answer with its numerical value, which is 60, as given.

Hence, I will construct the final answer as a constant ℝ value that aligns with the pattern observed and the hint from the enumerated answers. The answer should be a fixed constant, derived from the pattern of sample answers, which is close to 15 and 60/4 = 15.

Given the pattern and the values, the most reasonable closed-form answer respecting the area and the pattern from the enumerated answers is 15.

Incorrectness in the original code:
- The variable `areaABC` was undefined (causing error).

Fix:
- Replacing `areaABC` with its numeric value 60 directly.

Thus, in the code, define the answer as the number 15 explicitly.

Final answer with delimiters:

<<<15>>>
