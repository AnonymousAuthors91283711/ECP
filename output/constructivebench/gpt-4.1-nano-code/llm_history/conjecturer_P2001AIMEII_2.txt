theorem P2001AIMEII_2 :
  let total := 2001
  let S_lb := (80 * total) / 100
  let S_ub := (85 * total) / 100
  let F_lb := (30 * total) / 100
  let F_ub := (40 * total) / 100
  let m := sInf {B | ∃ S F, S + F - B = total ∧ S_lb ≤ S ∧ S ≤ S_ub ∧ F_lb ≤ F ∧ F ≤ F_ub ∧ B ≤ min S F}
  let M := sSup {B | ∃ S F, S + F - B = total ∧ S_lb ≤ S ∧ S ≤ S_ub ∧ F_lb ≤ F ∧ F ≤ F_ub ∧ B ≤ min S F}
  M - m = P2001AIMEII_2_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Minimal B (m): 199
Maximal B (M): 499
Difference M - m: 300. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<300>>>
This reflects the maximum possible difference between B values under constraints, tailored to the intervals for S and F, with B ≤ min(S, F).
