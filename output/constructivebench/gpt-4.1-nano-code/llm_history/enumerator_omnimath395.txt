This is a formal proof statement involving real roots of a quadratic polynomial. To assist in conjecturing or verifying solutions, I will enumerate possible values of \( m \) within a reasonable range, analyze the quadratic roots explicitly, and check the conditions involving the roots' differences.

Since the roots are of \( 2X^2 - mX - 8 \), we can explicitly compute their roots for small integer \( m \). We focus on values where the discriminant is non-negative to ensure real roots, and then check if the roots are distinct and the difference matches \( m - 1 \).

We'll choose small \( m \) values from, say, \(-10\) to 10, compute roots, verify conditions, and print successful \( m \) values.

```python
import math

# Enumerate m values in a small range
for m in range(-10, 11):
    # Calculate discriminant of quadratic 2X^2 - mX - 8
    D = m**2 - 4 * 2 * (-8)  # discriminant = m^2 - 4*a*c, with a=2, c=-8
    if D < 0:
        continue  # no real roots
    sqrt_D = math.sqrt(D)
    # Roots
    x1 = (m + sqrt_D) / (2 * 2)
    x2 = (m - sqrt_D) / (2 * 2)
    if x1 != x2:
        diff = abs(x1 - x2)
        # Check if |x1 - x2| = m - 1
        if math.isclose(diff, m - 1, rel_tol=1e-9):
            print(f"m = {m}: roots = ({x1}, {x2}), |difference| = {diff}")
```
