Ground Truth Answer: 343/8
Proposed Answer: (7/2) * (7/2) * (7/2)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. First, calculate Ea:
Ea = (1+2+3+4+5+6)/6 = 21/6 = 7/2

2. Then calculate Eb:
Eb = Ea * (1+2+3+4+5+6)/6 = (7/2) * (21/6) = (7/2)*(7/2) = 49/4

3. Finally calculate Ec:
Ec = Eb * (1+2+3+4+5+6)/6 = (49/4)*(21/6) = (49/4)*(7/2) = 343/8

The ground truth answer is 343/8, which matches our calculation.

The proposed answer is (7/2)*(7/2)*(7/2) = (7/2)³ = 343/8.

Both answers evaluate to the same value (343/8), just expressed differently.
