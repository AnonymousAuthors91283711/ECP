abbrev omnimath3414_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath3414 : 
  ¬ ∃ (k : ℕ), (23 - omnimath3414_answer) = 3 * k ∧ omnimath3414_answer < 23 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 9
Proposed Answer: 20
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find a natural number (omnimath3414_answer) such that:
   - (23 - omnimath3414_answer) is divisible by 3 (i.e., equals 3*k for some k)
   - omnimath3414_answer < 23
   - The theorem states that such a k does NOT exist (the ¬ at the beginning)

2. Ground Truth Answer is 9:
   - 23 - 9 = 14, which is not divisible by 3 (14/3 ≈ 4.666...)
   - This satisfies the theorem's condition that no such k exists

3. Proposed Answer is 20:
   - 23 - 20 = 3, which is divisible by 3 (3 = 3*1)
   - This would actually be a counterexample to the theorem since it satisfies both conditions
   - Therefore, this answer contradicts what the theorem is trying to prove

The proposed answer (20) is incorrect because it provides a counterexample to the theorem, while the ground truth answer (9) correctly supports the theorem's statement.
