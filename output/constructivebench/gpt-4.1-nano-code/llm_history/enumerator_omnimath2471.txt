The problem defines a set representing final boards of a Tic-Tac-Toe game with specific conditions, and asks to determine its size, labeled `omnimath2471_answer`. To assist, we will enumerate all valid final boards with small code, then count the total. 

Key points:
- Each cell is `none` or `some player`, with 3 players.
- The board is "final": all cells filled, with exactly one winner (winning condition).
- The winning condition includes complete rows, columns, or diagonals.
- Only one player can win, and the final board reflects that.

Because the number of boards is manageable, we'll generate all 3^9 boards, filter those satisfying the conditions, and output the count.

Here's the approach:
- Generate all possible boards.
- Check for validity (`valid_final_board`).
- Count and print the total.

```python
# This program enumerates all possible 3x3 boards with 3 players (0,1,2) and empty cells (None),
# then filters to those that are valid final boards with exactly one winner and all cells filled.
# It counts these and outputs the total number.

from itertools import product

def is_winning_board(board, player):
    # Check rows, columns, diagonals for winning line
    lines = [
        # Rows
        [(i, j) for j in range(3)] for i in range(3)
    ] + [
        # Columns
        [(i, j) for i in range(3)] for j in range(3)
    ] + [
        # Diagonals
        [(i, i) for i in range(3)],
        [(i, 2 - i) for i in range(3)]
    ]
    return any(all(board[i][j] == player for (i, j) in line) for line in lines)

def valid_final_board(board):
    # All cells must be filled
    if any(None in row for row in board):
        return False
    # Count winners
    winners = [player for player in range(3) if is_winning_board(board, player)]
    if len(winners) != 1:
        return False
    winner = winners[0]
    # Ensure only one winner and the winner is not None
    return True

count = 0
for flat in product([None,0,1,2], repeat=9):
    board = [list(flat[i*3:(i+1)*3]) for i in range(3)]
    if valid_final_board(board):
        print(f"Valid final board:\n{board}")
        count += 1

print(f"Total valid final boards: {count}")
print(f"Answer: {count}")
```
