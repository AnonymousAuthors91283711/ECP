theorem omnimath3486 : 
  omnimath3486_answer ∉ {y : ℕ | ∃ (n : ℕ), 1 ≤ n ∧ n ≤ 400 ∧ y = 3 * n + 1} := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 1. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The enumeration hints that answers outside the set {3n+1 | 1 ≤ n ≤ 400} are needed. Since 3n+1 covers all numbers congruent to 1 mod 3 in that range, numbers not in this set must be outside the scope. A simple choice is 1 (since 1 = 3*0 + 1) is in the set, thus pick a number beyond 400, such as 1201, which is certainly not of the form 3n+1 for 1 ≤ n ≤ 400.
