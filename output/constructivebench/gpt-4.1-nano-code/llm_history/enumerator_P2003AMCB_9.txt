This problem describes a linear function \(f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) with the form \(f(x) = m x + b\), given the conditions:

- There exist real numbers \(m, b\) such that \(f(x) = m x + b\).
- The difference \(f(6) - f(2) = 12\).
- We are asked to compute \(f(12) - f(2)\).

Given \(f(x) = m x + b\), then:

\[
f(6) - f(2) = (6m + b) - (2m + b) = 4m
\]

Since this equals 12:

\[
4m = 12 \Rightarrow m = 3
\]

Now, \(f(12) - f(2) = (12m + b) - (2m + b) = 10m = 10 \times 3 = 30\).

So the answer is 30.

The program's purpose is to verify this derivation by enumerating possible answers. Since the function is linear with known difference in values, the only possible value of \(f(12) - f(2)\) consistent with the conditions is 30.

```python
# Program to find possible values of f(12) - f(2) for a linear f satisfying the given condition

# The key derived fact: f(x) = m*x + b with f(6) - f(2) = 12
# implies 4*m = 12, hence m = 3
# Then f(12) - f(2) = 10 * m = 30

answers = []

# Since m is uniquely determined (m=3), the only answer is 30
answers.append(30)

# Stream answers as they are found
for ans in answers:
    print(ans)
```
