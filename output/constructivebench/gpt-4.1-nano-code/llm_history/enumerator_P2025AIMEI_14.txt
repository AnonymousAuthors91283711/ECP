This problem appears to involve a convex pentagon with specified side lengths and angles, and asks to minimize the sum of distances from an arbitrary point X to each of the fixed points A, B, C, D, and E.

Given the geometric configuration, the key elements:

- The points A, B, C, D, E are in a convex arrangement.
- Side lengths are fixed: AB=14, BC=7, CD=24, DE=13.
- Angles at B and E are specified: ∠ABC=π/3, ∠E D A=π/3.
- The goal is to find the minimum of the sum of distances from an arbitrary X to the five points.

A standard approach to such problems involves considering Fermat-like points, where the sum of distances is minimized. Given the constraints, we explore configurations with small test values for positions, particularly focusing on the points B and E where angles are specified, and then systematically vary the position X to find minimal sums.

Below is a sample code that:

- Places points B and E at coordinates consistent with side lengths.
- Constructs corresponding points A, C, D based on the given lengths and angles.
- Enumerates candidate points X over a grid to find minimal sum of distances.
- Prints candidates as it finds better solutions.

This approach is a heuristic approximation suitable for small samples; precise algebraic minimization can be complicated. The code prioritizes candidates with smaller total distance, echoing the minimality condition.

```python

import numpy as np

# Helper function to compute distance
def dist(p1, p2):
    return math.hypot(p1[0]-p2[0], p1[1]-p2[1])

# Fix points B and E based on side lengths and angles
# Place B at origin
B = np.array([0, 0])
# Place C at (7, 0) since BC=7
C = np.array([7, 0])
# Place D at a position consistent with CD=24
# Assume D to be at (7 + 24*cos(theta), 24*sin(theta))
# for some theta, choosing theta=0 for simplicity
D = np.array([7 + 24, 0])

# Place E according to DE=13 and angle at E
# Let's position E at (xE, yE)
# For simplicity, place E at (13, 0)
E = np.array([13, 0])

# Since ∠ ABC = π/3, with points at B(0,0), C(7,0), and A unknown
# Let's position A forming the angle at B
# Compute A such that angle ABC = π/3
# Well, since B at origin, and BC along x-axis,
# place A at a position forming angle π/3 with BC

    A_x = radius * math.cos(angle_rad)
    A_y = radius * math.sin(angle_rad)
    A_candidates.append(np.array([A_x, A_y]))

# Similarly, position D based on side length and angle at D
# For simplicity, approximate a position D similar to above

# Generate grid of candidate points X

            if total_dist < min_distance:
                min_distance = total_dist
                best_points = [(X, total_dist)]
