Given the equation m² = (n³ - 1989)/n, for n > 0, this implies n divides (n³ - 1989). Simplify to n² - 1989/n; for the RHS to be integer, n must divide 1989. Factor 1989: 1989 = 3² * 13 * 17. The positive divisors are 1, 3, 13, 17, 39, 51, 221, 663, 1989. For n > 0, check divisors where (n³ - 1989)/n is integer and m². Only n = 13 yields m² = (13³ - 1989)/13 = 2197/13 = 169, and m = ±13. Final answer, the unique n: 13.
