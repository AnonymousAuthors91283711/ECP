The problem asks us to find the number of solutions (m, n) in positive integers such that m^2 * n = 20^20, i.e., solutions are positive divisors of 20^20 in that form. To do this, first note:

- 20 = 2^2 * 5.
- 20^20 = (2^2 * 5)^20 = 2^{40} * 5^{20}.

The condition m^2 * n = 20^20 means n = 20^20 / m^2.

For m, n to be positive integers:
- m must be a divisor of 20^20.
- m^2 divides 20^20.

Since:

- 20^20 = 2^{40} * 5^{20},
- m = 2^a * 5^b, with a, b ≥ 0,
- m^2 = 2^{2a} * 5^{2b}.

To ensure m^2 divides 20^{20}:
- 2^{2a} ≤ 2^{40} ⇒ 2a ≤ 40 ⇒ a ≤ 20,
- 5^{2b} ≤ 5^{20} ⇒ 2b ≤ 20 ⇒ b ≤ 10.

Because a, b ≥ 0:
- a ranges from 0 to 20,
- b ranges from 0 to 10.

Number of possible m's:
- (a, b) pairs = (21) * (11) = 231.

Each corresponds to a unique m, and n = 20^{20} / m^2 is an integer (since m^2 divides 20^{20}).

So, total solutions = 231.

Here's a Python program to generate and verify solutions:

```python
# Enumerate all m = 2^a * 5^b with constraints
solutions = []
for a in range(21):  # a from 0 to 20
    for b in range(11):  # b from 0 to 10
        m = (2 ** a) * (5 ** b)
        divisor_count = 1  # to verify correctness, optional
        total_divisors_20 = (40 + 1) * (20 + 1)  # total divisors of 2^40 * 5^20
        total_divisors_20 = (40 + 1) * (20 + 1)  # (41 * 21) = 861
        # For this problem, just count solutions
        solutions.append((m, 20 ** 20 // (m ** 2)))
        print((a, b, m, solutions[-1][1]))
print("Total solutions:", len(solutions))
# Confirm total solutions match calculated count
assert len(solutions) == 231
```
