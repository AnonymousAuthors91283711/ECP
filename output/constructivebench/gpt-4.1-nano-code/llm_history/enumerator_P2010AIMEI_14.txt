The problem involves finding the greatest natural number \( n \) such that the sum of certain floor expressions involving \( n \) does not exceed 300. Specifically, the sum:

\[
\sum_{k=0}^{99} \left\lfloor \log_{10}(k+1) + \frac{\log_{10} n}{1} \right\rfloor
\]

must be at most 300. Our goal is to find the largest \( n \) satisfying this.

Key observations:
- For each \( k \), define \( a_k(n) = \lfloor \log_{10}(k+1) + \log_{10} n \rfloor \).
- Since \( \log_{10}(k+1) \) is fixed, \( a_k(n) \) depends on \( \log_{10} n \).
- As \( n \) increases, \( a_k(n) \) generally increases.
- For small \( n \), the sum is small; for larger \( n \), the sum approaches or exceeds 300.

This suggests a search over \( n \) values to find the maximum \( n \) such that the sum is ≤300.

Implementation plan:
- Choose a reasonable search range for \( n \). Starting from 1 upwards, or use binary search to find the maximum \( n \).
- For each \( n \), compute the sum; if sum ≤ 300, record \( n \) and try larger \( n \); otherwise, try smaller \( n \).

Here's a Python program that performs this search efficiently using binary search:

```python
import math

def sum_floor_log(n):
    total = 0
    for k in range(1, 101):
        # log10(k)
        log_k = math.log10(k)
        # log10(n)
        log_n = math.log10(n)
        total += math.floor(log_k + log_n)
    return total

# Binary search for the maximum n satisfying the sum ≤ 300
low, high = 1, 10**6  # upper bound can be increased if needed
max_n = 0

while low <= high:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    total = sum_floor_log(mid)
    if total <= 300:
        max_n = mid  # record current n
        low = mid + 1
    else:
        high = mid - 1

print("Maximum n:", max_n)
```

This code finds the largest \( n \) such that the sum of the floors does not exceed 300, streaming candidates as it searches.
