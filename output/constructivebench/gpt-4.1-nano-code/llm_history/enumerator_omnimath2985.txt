This problem asks us to find the number of integers \( n \) such that:

- \( n \) is odd,
- \( \frac{17}{4} < n < \frac{35}{2} \).

Since the bounds are fractions, convert to decimal approximate values:

- \( 17/4 = 4.25 \),
- \( 35/2 = 17.5 \).

We are looking for odd integers \( n \) where:

\[
4.25 < n < 17.5
\]

The integers satisfying this are

\[
n \in \{5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17\}
\]

Total count is 7.

To simulate enumeration in Python:

```python
# Enumerate odd integers between the two bounds and count them
answers = []
for n in range(5, 18, 2):  # start at 5, step by 2 (odd numbers), up to 17 inclusive
    if 4.25 < n < 17.5:
        answers.append(n)
        print(n)

print("Number of such integers:", len(answers))
```
