theorem omnimath1113 :
  let dice := Fin 20
  let rolls := Fin 5 → dice
  let count20s (d : rolls) := (univ.filter (fun i => d i = 19)).card
  let total := (univ.filter (fun d : rolls => 3 ≤ count20s d)).card
  let success := (univ.filter (fun d : rolls => count20s d = 5)).card
  (success : ℚ) / (total : ℚ) = omnimath1113_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Sequences with exactly 5 '19's: 1
Sequences with at least 3 '19's: 3706
Conditional probability (all five are '19' given at least 3 are '19'): 1/3706 = 0.0002698327037236913. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The probability of all five dice showing '19' given at least three are '19' is \(\frac{1}{3706}\). Thus, the answer is <<<1/3706>>>.
