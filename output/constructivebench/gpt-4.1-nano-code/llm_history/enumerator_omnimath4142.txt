The problem appears to involve characterizing functions \(f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) satisfying a certain functional equation. Since the code is in Lean, and asks for enumeration of possible solutions, a key approach is to test candidate functions within some parameterized family, checking whether they satisfy the given equation.

Given the nature of functional equations, common solutions include linear functions, constant functions, or sometimes polynomial functions. Because the problem involves multiplicative arguments and quadratic terms (\(x^2\)), it's reasonable to test simple functions like \(f(x) = kx\), \(f(x) = c\), or \(f(x) = x^n\) for small n.

Below is a Python script that:
- Defines candidate functions \(f\), with parameters,
- Checks whether they satisfy the functional equation for a set of sample (x, y),
- Outputs candidates that satisfy the equation.

This helps to conjecture or identify solutions.

```python
# Enumerate candidate functions f: R -> R
# Test linear functions f(x) = a*x + b
# and constant functions f(x) = c
# over sampled points (x, y)

import math

def check_f(f, xs, ys):
    for x in xs:
        for y in ys:
            lhs = abs(x) * f(y) + y * f(x)
            rhs = f(x * y) + f(x ** 2) + f(f(y))
            # Compare with some tolerance due to floating point
            if not math.isclose(lhs, rhs, rel_tol=1e-9, abs_tol=1e-9):
                return False
    return True

# Sample points to test
sample_xs = [-1.0, 0.0, 1.0]
sample_ys = [-1.0, 0.0, 1.0]

# Enumerate linear functions f(x) = a*x + b
for a in [-2.0, -1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 2.0]:
    for b in [-1.0, 0.0, 1.0]:
        def f_linear(x, a=a, b=b):
            return a * x + b
        if check_f(f_linear, sample_xs, sample_ys):
            print(f"Linear solution: f(x) = {a}*x + {b}")

# Enumerate constant functions f(x)=c
for c in [-2.0, -1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 2.0]:
    def f_const(x, c=c):
        return c
    if check_f(f_const, sample_xs, sample_ys):
        print(f"Constant solution: f(x) = {c}")

# Optionally, test power functions f(x) = x^n for small n
for n in [2, 3]:
    def f_power(x, n=n):
        return x ** n
    if check_f(f_power, sample_xs, sample_ys):
        print(f"Power solution: f(x) = x^{n}")
