abbrev omnimath3387_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath3387 :
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | n > 0 ∧ 
    ∃ (v : ℕ), v > 0 ∧ 
      (∑ k in Finset.range n, (v - k) * (1/60)) = 2/3 ∧ 
      v - (n - 1) > 0 ∧ 
      v - (n - 1) < v} 
  omnimath3387_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n=1, v=40
n=5, v=10. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<5>>>
The pattern suggests the minimal n with valid v = 10 and v=10 for n=5, giving the answer 5.
