The problem involves the infinite sum over triples (a, b, c) where each variable ranges from its lower bound upward (sets: Ici 1, i.e., from 1 to ∞). Each term is of the form \( \frac{1}{2^{a} 3^{b} 5^{c}} \).

Recognizing this as a triple sum over independent geometric series:
\[
\sum_{a=1}^\infty \sum_{b=1}^\infty \sum_{c=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^a 3^b 5^c}
\]
which factors as:
\[
\left(\sum_{a=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^a}\right) \times \left(\sum_{b=1}^\infty \frac{1}{3^b}\right) \times \left(\sum_{c=1}^\infty \frac{1}{5^c}\right)
\]

Each is a geometric series with ratio less than 1:
- For \(a\), ratio \(r_a = 1/2\)
- For \(b\), ratio \(r_b = 1/3\)
- For \(c\), ratio \(r_c = 1/5\)

Sum of geometric series from 1 to ∞:
\[
\sum_{k=1}^\infty r^k = \frac{r}{1 - r}
\]

Calculations:
\[
\sum_{a=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^a} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = 1
\]
\[
\sum_{b=1}^\infty \frac{1}{3^b} = \frac{\frac{1}{3}}{1 - \frac{1}{3}} = \frac{\frac{1}{3}}{\frac{2}{3}} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\sum_{c=1}^\infty \frac{1}{5^c} = \frac{\frac{1}{5}}{1 - \frac{1}{5}} = \frac{\frac{1}{5}}{\frac{4}{5}} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Total sum:
\[
1 \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{8}
\]

The Python program will compute these sums directly for verification. It will print the exact value as a rational number.

```python
# The sum over a in [1, ∞): sum_{a=1}^∞ (1/2^a) = 1
# The sum over b in [1, ∞): sum_{b=1}^∞ (1/3^b) = 1/2
# The sum over c in [1, ∞): sum_{c=1}^∞ (1/5^c) = 1/4
# Total sum = 1 * (1/2) * (1/4) = 1/8

from fractions import Fraction

# Direct calculation using geometric series formulas
sum_a = Fraction(1, 2)  # sum_{a=1}^∞ (1/2^a)
sum_b = Fraction(1, 3) / (1 - Fraction(1, 3))  # sum_{b=1}^∞ (1/3^b)
sum_c = Fraction(1, 5) / (1 - Fraction(1, 5))  # sum_{c=1}^∞ (1/5^c)

total_sum = sum_a * sum_b * sum_c

print(f"Sum over triples: {total_sum}")  # Expect 1/8
```
