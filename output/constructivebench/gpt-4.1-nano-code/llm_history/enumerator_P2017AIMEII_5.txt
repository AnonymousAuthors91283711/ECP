The problem involves determining the maximum possible sum `s` from the set of all pairwise sums of four numbers `a, b, c, d`, given that their pairwise sums match a specific set containing known values and two unknowns `x, y`. 

The key points:
- The set of pairwise sums is fixed as `{189, 320, 287, 234, x, y}`.
- We need to find the greatest `s` such that `s = x' + y'` for some `x', y'` where the pairwise sums exactly match this set.

Approach:
- Recognize that the maximum sum `s` is likely the sum of the two largest numbers in the set.
- Since pairwise sums are symmetric, the largest sum is either `x` or `y`.
- To find the maximum, consider all pairings that could produce the largest sum and check possible arrangements.

We'll implement a brute-force enumeration over potential assignments of the known sums and attempt to determine the unknowns systematically. To keep the output within token limits, only the core enumeration logic will be included.

```python
# Enumerate all possible assignments of sums to identify the maximum sum
possible_sums = [189, 234, 287, 320]
# The set contains these four known sums plus x and y, both unknowns
# We consider all pairs of the known sums to assign as x and y
max_sum = 0
for i in range(4):
    for j in range(i+1, 4):
        # Assign known sums to x and y
        sum_x, sum_y = possible_sums[i], possible_sums[j]
        # The remaining sums
        remaining = [possible_sums[k] for k in range(4) if k not in (i, j)]
        # Check if remaining are consistent with other pair sums
        candidate_sums = remaining
        candidate_sums.extend([sum_x, sum_y])
        # Sorting to find the largest
        candidate_sums_sorted = sorted(candidate_sums)
        current_max = max(candidate_sums_sorted)
        if current_max > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_max
# Output the maximum pair sum found
print("Maximum possible sum of a pair:", max_sum)
```
