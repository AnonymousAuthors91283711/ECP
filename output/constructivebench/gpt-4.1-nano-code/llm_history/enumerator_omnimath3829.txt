This problem asks us to find all integers \( x \) (specifically positive ones, since \( x > 0 \)) such that for all \( n \ge 1 \), \( x \) is coprime to \( a(n) = 2^n + 3^n + 6^n - 1 \).

We need to explore the set of \( a(n) \), check their common factors, and determine the positive integers coprime to all \( a(n) \). The key is to identify the gcd of the entire sequence \( a(n) \), to find the universal divisors that could restrict \( x \).

The code will:
- Evaluate \( a(n) \) for small \( n \).
- Compute gcds of these terms.
- Deduce which divisors are common to all \( a(n) \).
- Conclude the set of possible \( x \).

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

# Define the sequence a(n) = 2^n + 3^n + 6^n - 1 for small n
def a(n):
    return 2**n + 3**n + 6**n - 1

# Compute the gcd of a list of numbers
def gcd_list(lst):
    return reduce(gcd, lst)

# Generate a list of sequence values for n=1 to 10
values = [a(n) for n in range(1, 11)]
# Compute their overall gcd
overall_gcd = gcd_list(values)

print(f"Computed values of a(n) for n=1..10: {values}")
print(f"GCD of these values: {overall_gcd}")

# All x coprime to a(n) for all n must be coprime to the gcd of all a(n)
# So x > 0 and gcd(x, overall_gcd) = 1
# Therefore, possible x are positive integers not sharing common prime factors with overall_gcd

# Prime factors of overall_gcd (for small divisors)
# For efficiency, only analyze divisors of overall_gcd
def prime_factors(n):
    i = 2
    factors = set()
    while i * i <= n:
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.add(i)
            n //= i
        i += 1
    if n > 1:
        factors.add(n)
    return factors

factors = prime_factors(overall_gcd)
print(f"Prime factors of the gcd: {sorted(factors)}")

# The set of all positive integers coprime to overall_gcd are those not divisible by any of these factors
# For demonstration, list some small candidates
candidates = []
for x in range(1, 50):
    if all(x % p != 0 for p in factors):
        print(f"x = {x} is coprime to all a(n) for n=1..10")
        candidates.append(x)
```
