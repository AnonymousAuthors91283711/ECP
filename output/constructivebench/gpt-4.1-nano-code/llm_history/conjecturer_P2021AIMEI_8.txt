  P2021AIMEI_8_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Candidate c = 1.618033988749895, total solution multiplicity = 4
Candidate c = -0.6180339887498949, total solution multiplicity = 0. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The polynomial \(x^4 - 2c x^2 + (c+1) = 0\) factors as quadratic in \(y = x^2\). For exactly 12 solutions counting multiplicity, the quadratic must have 4 solutions with multiplicity summing to 12, which suggests all roots are real and with multiplicities summing to 12, implying 4 distinct roots each with multiplicity 3, matching the candidate \(c\).

Since \(c \approx 1.618\) aligns with golden ratio properties where the quadratic factors produce the desired root multiplicities, the total number of such roots is 12 (i.e., 4 roots each with multiplicity 3).

Final answer:
<<<4>>>
