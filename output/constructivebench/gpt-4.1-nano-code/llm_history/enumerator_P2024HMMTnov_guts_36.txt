This problem involves a complex expression with factorials and a double summation, and aims to approximate a value E such that the difference from the given expression is within 0.0000001. To approach this, I will implement a Python script that computes the summation efficiently using precomputed factorials, then evaluates the entire expression. Since the problem constraints favor exact calculation over approximation, I will focus on the exact integer factorial calculations and the summation over reasonable ranges.

Given the problem details, I will:
- Precompute factorials for integers up to 60 (since the max index in summation is around 40+18=58).
- Compute the inner sum for i,j from 0 to 40.
- Multiply by the factorials product and normalize by 100!.
- Output the computed value, so we can observe the approximate answer.

This approach narrows down the possibilities or helps conjecture the true value.

```python
import math

# Precompute factorials up to 60 for efficiency
max_factorial = 60
factorials = [math.factorial(k) for k in range(max_factorial + 1)]

# Function to retrieve precomputed factorial
def fact(n):
    return factorials[n]

# Compute the double sum
sum_value = 0
for i in range(41):
    for j in range(41):
        numerator = fact(i + j + 18)
        denominator = fact(i) * fact(j) * fact(18)
        sum_value += numerator / denominator

# Compute numerator and denominator
numerator = fact(20) * fact(40) * fact(40)
denominator = fact(100)

# Final approximation
E = numerator / denominator * sum_value

print(f"Approximate value of E: {E}")

# Since the problem asks for an immediate answer, print the approximation
# and leave room for further analysis if needed.
```

The task involves verifying if the provided code accurately computes a specific mathematical expression related to factorials and sums, aligning with the problem statement. The original code is designed to compute an approximation of the expression, but the user notes it outputs an empty result, indicating potential issues. 

**Judgment:**  
- The code correctly precomputes factorials and performs the nested sum.
- It calculates the main expression involving factorials.
- However, the code does not print the computed value `E`, and the user mentions "Error: Program outputs empty result," suggesting the code may be incomplete or misaligned with the problem's streaming and reporting requirements.

**Acceptance or Rejection:**  
Since the code only prints the approximation after processing and does not output answers immediately during iteration, and given the user's note about no output, the original code should be rejected for not fulfilling the immediate streaming output criterion.

**Corrected Program:**

The corrected program will:
- Print the approximate value of `E` immediately after computation.
- Ensure it can run standalone.
- Match the problem's scope.
- Keep the output under 400 tokens.

```python
import math

# Precompute factorials up to 60 for efficiency
max_factorial = 60
factorials = [math.factorial(k) for k in range(max_factorial + 1)]

def fact(n):
    return factorials[n]

# Compute the double sum
sum_value = 0
for i in range(41):
    for j in range(41):
        numerator = fact(i + j + 18)
        denominator = fact(i) * fact(j) * fact(18)
        sum_value += numerator / denominator
        # Optional: stream intermediate results or minimal print for progress
        # For brevity, only print final answer after loop
print(f"Approximate value of E: { (fact(20) * fact(40) * fact(40)) / fact(100) * sum_value }")
```

**Note:**  
- This version calculates and prints `E` immediately after summing.
- It adheres to the optimization, output, and simplicity requirements.
- It avoids unnecessary complexity and ensures correctness of the value.

**Final verdict:** **Rejected** (original code does not print the result, hence output is empty).  
**Corrected code is provided above.**
[refine_program]
The problem involves evaluating a complex sum expression involving factorials with high precision and correctness. 

Analyzing the program, the main issues are:
- It computes the sum correctly, but only prints a final approximation of an expression that involves factorials, missing the exact value E or the relation to the provided formula.
- The main goal appears to be approximating the expression involving factorials and summations, then comparing it to a variable E satisfying the theorem statement, with a very tight tolerance.

Since the theorem states that there exists an E such that the absolute difference is less than 1e-7, and the code computes the sum, it should compare the computed value with the factorial expressions involving 20, 40, 100, etc. 

To align with the theorem, the code should:
- Compute the sum as intended.
- Compute the target value: (factorial 20 * factorial 40 * factorial 40) / factorial 100 * sum_value
- Output that value as the answer.

The program is incomplete, as it only prints a debug string, and doesn't print the computed approximation or seek an E satisfying the conditions.

**Acceptance judgment:**  
The original code, as is, produces no relevant outputâ€”it's an incomplete implementation of the required calculation. It doesn't satisfy the problem requirement of outputting the answer or approximations streamingly, and it is not usable as-is.

Therefore, **Rejected**.

# Precompute factorials up to 60 for efficiency
max_factorial = 60
factorials = [math.factorial(k) for k in range(max_factorial + 1)]

    for j in range(41):
        numerator = fact(i + j + 18)
        denominator = fact(i) * fact(j) * fact(18)
        sum_value += numerator / denominator

# Compute the approximate value of E per the formula
