The problem involves iterating the function \(f(x) = x^2 - 2\) starting from 24, applying it 18 times, then reducing modulo 89. We want to find the value of this iteration: specifically, the result of \(f^{(18)}(24) \bmod 89\).

Since it's a math problem of iterative functions and modular arithmetic, a practical approach is to implement this iteration explicitly in Python, tracking the value at each step, and outputting the final result.

Here's the Python code that calculates this step-by-step, printing the intermediate value after 18 iterations, specifically focusing on the modular reductions:

```python
# Define the initial value and the number of iterations
x = 24
iterations = 18
modulus = 89

# Iterate the function f(x) = x^2 - 2
for i in range(iterations):
    x = (x**2 - 2) % modulus
    print(f"Iteration {i+1}: {x}")

# Final value after 18 iterations
print(f"Final value: {x}")
```

This code will compute the iterative process step-by-step, providing a stream of answers that can help in conjecturing the final value modulo 89 after 18 iterations.
