(x : ℝ)
(hx : Real.rpow 2 x = 3)
: Real.rpow 4 (3*x + 2) = omnimath1977_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 27.019550008653876
. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Based on the pattern, the answer should be expressed as a specific constant derived from the given relation, involving the exponents and iterated powers. Observing the enumerated approximation near 27.02, the exact simplified value is 3^3 = 27. 

In Lean, for the exact value: 
- Given 2^x = 3, 
- then 4^{3x + 2} = (2^2)^{3x + 2} = 2^{2(3x + 2)} = 2^{6x + 4} = (2^x)^6 * 2^4 = 3^6 * 16.

Therefore, 
- The answer is 3^6 * 16.

Final expression: <<<3^6 * 16>>>
