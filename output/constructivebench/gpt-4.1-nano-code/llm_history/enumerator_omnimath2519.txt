This problem involves solving a system of linear equations with digit constraints on variables a, b, c, d (each between 0 and 9). The goal is to find all quadruples (a, b, c, d) satisfying the equations and then determine the four-digit number formed by these digits.

Key steps:
- Iterate over all possible digit combinations within 0-9.
- For each, check the three constraints.
- When a candidate satisfies all constraints, print the corresponding number.

No hardcoded solution is provided; instead, the code performs enumeration to find valid quadruples.

```python
# Enumerate all 4-digit combinations within 0..9
for a in range(10):
    for b in range(10):
        for c in range(10):
            for d in range(10):
                # Check the three equations
                if 6*a + 9*b + 3*c + d == 88 \
                   and a - b + c - d == -6 \
                   and a - 9*b + 3*c - d == -46:
                    number = 1000*a + 100*b + 10*c + d
                    print(number)
```
