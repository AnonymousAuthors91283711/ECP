The problem involves a quadratic polynomial \( P(x) \) satisfying the property \( P(x) = P(0) + P(1) \times x + P(2) \times x^2 \) for all \( x \), with the specific condition \( P(-1) = 1 \). To find \( P(3) \), we need to determine the coefficients of \( P \).

Since \( P(x) \) has the form \( a + b x + c x^2 \), and the condition holds for all \( x \), equate:

\[ a + b x + c x^2 = P(0) + P(1) \times x + P(2) \times x^2 \]

which suggests \( a = P(0) \), and the coefficients satisfy:

- \( b = P(1) \)
- \( c = P(2) \)

From the conditions, evaluate at specific points to find \( a, b, c \):

- \( P(-1) = a - b + c = 1 \)
- \( P(0) = a \)
- \( P(1) = a + b + c \)
- \( P(2) = a + 2b + 4c \)

Given the polynomial matches the linear combination with these coefficients for all \( x \), the only degree of freedom comes from the constraints involving \( P(-1) \), \( P(0) \), \( P(1) \), and \( P(2) \). Since the problem states \( P(x) = P(0) + P(1) x + P(2) x^2 \) for all \( x \), it suggests \( P \) is a quadratic polynomial with these coefficients as \( a = P(0), b = P(1), c = P(2) \).

From the given condition \( P(-1) = 1 \), substitute:

\[ a - b + c = 1 \]

We also know that for all \( x \),

\[ P(x) = P(0) + P(1) \times x + P(2) \times x^2 \]

which is the polynomial \( a + b x + c x^2 \), so the coefficients are fixed: \( a, b, c \).

Now, try parameterizing \( P(0), P(1), P(2) \):

- Let \( P(0) = A \), \( P(1) = B \), \( P(2) = C \).

Given the relation:

\[ P(x) = A + B x + C x^2 \]
\[ P(-1) = A - B + C = 1 \]

We need \( P(3) = A + 3 B + 9 C \).

Since there's no further constraint involving \( P(0), P(1), P(2) \) directly (except for the given condition involving \( P(-1) \)), and the problem allows any polynomial \( P \) satisfying the property and the given condition, we can vary \( A, B, C \) satisfying the linear relation derived from the constraintsâ€”in particular, \( A - B + C = 1 \).

To find all possible \( P(3) \), iterate over plausible \( A, B, C \) satisfying this relation, say within small ranges.

Here's the code:

```python
# Program to enumerate possible P(3) values given the constraints
# P(x) = P(0) + P(1)*x + P(2)*x^2, with P(-1) = 1

# We model P(0)=A, P(1)=B, P(2)=C
# constraint: A - B + C = 1

# Enumerate A, B, C over small ranges
for A in range(-10, 11):
    for B in range(-10, 11):
        for C in range(-10, 11):
            if A - B + C == 1:
                P3 = A + 3*B + 9*C
                print(f'P(3) = {P3} with A={A}, B={B}, C={C}')
```
