The problem seems to involve analyzing the maximum integer less than a certain real expression, which depends on the parameter \( N \). Since \( N = 100^2 \times \sqrt{2} \), then \( N = 10,000 \times \sqrt{2} \). The key is to identify the greatest integer less than \(\frac{N}{100}\), i.e., \(\lfloor \frac{N}{100} \rfloor\).

Given \( N = 10,000 \times \sqrt{2} \),
\[
\frac{N}{100} = \frac{10,000 \times \sqrt{2}}{100} = 100 \times \sqrt{2}.
\]
Since \(\sqrt{2} \approx 1.4142135623\),
\[
100 \times \sqrt{2} \approx 141.42135623.
\]
The greatest integer less than this value is \(141\).

The program will verify the decimal and find the maximum integer less than \( 100 \times \sqrt{2} \). It can simply approximate and confirm that.

```python
from math import sqrt, floor

# Given parameters
sqrt_2 = sqrt(2)
N = 10000 * sqrt_2
value = N / 100

# Enumerate integers less than the value to find the maximum
max_int = None
for k in range(int(floor(value)) + 2):  # check a bit more to ensure
    if k < value:
        max_int = k
        print(k)  # stream the partial results

print("Estimated maximum integer less than N/100:", max_int)
```
