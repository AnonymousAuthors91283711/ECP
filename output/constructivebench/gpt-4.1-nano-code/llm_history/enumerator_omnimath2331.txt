The problem involves an equality involving rational expressions of natural numbers n and b, with constraints n ≥ 2 and b ≥ 2, and aims to find answers that satisfy the equation, specifically hinting that n=10 is special. The goal is to explore possible solutions for n and b to conjecture the answer, especially confirming whether the solution n=10 holds and exploring other candidates.

We will systematically enumerate small b values for a fixed n, checking the equality. Since the problem suggests a specific answer when n=10, we'll focus on n=10 and small b's to verify and find possible solutions. The code will examine b from 2 upward, compute both sides of the rational expression, and print candidate solutions when they satisfy the equality exactly (preferably as rationals, but floating points for approximation if needed).

```python
# Explore candidates for n = 10 and b ≥ 2
import math
from fractions import Fraction

def check_solution(n, b):
    lhs = (Fraction(n, n + b) * Fraction(b, n + b - 1))
    # For demonstration, suppose the "answer" is the numerator of the lhs as an integer
    # or just print lhs as a rational for analysis
    return lhs

# Set parameters
n_value = 10
max_b = 20  # limit for enumeration to keep output small

for b in range(2, max_b + 1):
    result = check_solution(n_value, b)
    # If the expression simplifies to an integer or rational with specific form, print
    print(f"n={n_value}, b={b} => {result}")
    if result.denominator == 1:
        print(f"=> Exact rational: {result} (integer)")
    elif abs(result - result.numerator / result.denominator) < 1e-10:
        print(f"=> Approximate value: {float(result)}")
```
