Ground Truth Answer: {(-1, 1)}
Proposed Answer: { (x, y) | x = -1 ∧ y = 1 }
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer "{ (x, y) | x = -1 ∧ y = 1 }" is exactly equivalent to the ground truth answer "{(-1, 1)}". Both expressions describe the same single point in ℝ × ℝ where x = -1 and y = 1. The first notation is a singleton set containing the tuple (-1, 1), while the second is a set builder notation that defines the same single point by specifying the conditions x = -1 and y = 1. The two representations are mathematically identical.
