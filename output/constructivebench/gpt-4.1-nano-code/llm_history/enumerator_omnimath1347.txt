This problem involves evaluating the sum of a sequence from i=0 to 13 of the terms (2*i + 3) / [i^2 * (i+1)^2]. We will numerically compute the partial sum for each i, including the term at i=0 (which might cause division by zero), so we handle the case i=0 separately. Since i=0 leads to division by zero in the denominator, we need to examine whether the sum should start from i=1 or account for that case.

Given the sum's structure, at i=0, the denominator is 0, which is undefined, so it's likely the sum is intended from i=1 to 13. We will verify this by computing the terms explicitly.

Our code will:
- Sum from i=1 to 13.
- Compute each term precisely.
- Print each term as it is computed.
- Return the sum as an exact Fraction.

Since the problem wants to match the sum to a rational number, we'll keep exact rational calculations.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Sum from i=1 to 13
sum_result = Fraction(0, 1)

for i in range(1, 14):
    numerator = 2 * i + 3
    denominator = i**2 * (i + 1)**2
    term = Fraction(numerator, denominator)
    print(f"i={i}, term={term}")
    sum_result += term

print(f"Total sum: {sum_result}")
# Assign answer to variable for the theorem statement if needed
omnimath1347_answer = sum_result
```
