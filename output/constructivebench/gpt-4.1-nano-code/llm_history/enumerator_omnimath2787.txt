[write_program]
This problem appears to involve verifying or analyzing the sum \( \frac{1}{9} + \frac{1}{18} \). The goal is to find the exact value of this sum and confirm the relationship in the theorem.

To assist in verifying and enumerating possible answers, I will write a Python program that computes the sum of the fractions explicitly, simplifies it, and outputs the result immediately. This helps in conjecturing the exact answer.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Compute the sum of the given fractions
sum_frac = Fraction(1, 9) + Fraction(1, 18)

# Output the sum as an exact fraction
print(f"{sum_frac.numerator}/{sum_frac.denominator}")
```
