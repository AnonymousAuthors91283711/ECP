Ground Truth Answer: 105
Proposed Answer: 2000000000000000000014
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer.

The problem asks for the smallest natural number n > 20 that satisfies:
1. Its digits in base 20 form a palindrome
2. Its digits in base 14 form a palindrome

The ground truth answer is 105, which:
- In base 20: 105 = 5*20 + 5 → [5,5] (palindrome)
- In base 14: 105 = 7*14 + 7 → [7,7] (palindrome)

The proposed answer is 2000000000000000000014:
- This is an extremely large number (2 followed by 18 zeros and 14)
- While it might satisfy the palindrome conditions in both bases, it's clearly not the smallest such number
- The ground truth answer 105 is much smaller and satisfies the conditions

The proposed answer fails to meet the "IsLeast" requirement of the problem, which asks for the smallest such number.
