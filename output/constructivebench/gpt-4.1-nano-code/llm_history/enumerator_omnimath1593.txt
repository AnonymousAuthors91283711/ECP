The problem appears to be a formal statement involving functions over finite sets, including sums of a sequence and some conditions. Essentially, we're given a sequence `a` indexed by `Fin 2019` with the constraint that each `a i < 2^2018`. We then define functions `b` and `c` over `Fin 2018` with relations involving `a` and some logical OR. Our goal is to determine the total number of such pairs `(b, c)` matching the conditions.

A good approach is:
- Pick a small value for the large parameters (like 2 and 2018), because enumerating over all possibilities is infeasible.
- For the sequence `a`, the constraints are that each element is less than `2^2018`.
- For manageable computation and illustration, set `n = 2` (random small number), and `size = 3` to generate small sequences quickly.
- For each `a`, enumerate all possible sequences that satisfy the constraints, then count the `(b, c)` pairs that satisfy their relations.

Here's a Python code that:
- Uses small parameters.
- Enumerates all sequences `a` with constraints.
- Counts pairs `(b, c)` satisfying the relations.
- Prints each candidate count to help conjecture the total.

```python
# Enumerate small sequences 'a' with constraints, then compute number of (b, c) pairs

from itertools import product

# Parameters:
max_i = 2  # small index for 'a' sequence length
limit = 4  # upper limit for a_i, to keep enumeration small

# Generate all sequences 'a' with a_i < 2^2018 (approximated as limit)
a_sequences = list(product(range(limit), repeat=max_i))
total_count = 0

for a in a_sequences:
    a = list(a)
    # For each sequence 'a', count valid pairs (b, c)
    count_b_c = 0
    # b and c are functions on Fin 2018, but we approximate with small size
    size_b_c = 2  # small size for illustration
    # b and c are mappings from index to ℕ with no explicit constraints except for relations
    # Since relations involve i+1, ensure indexing within bounds
    for b_vals in product(range(2), repeat=size_b_c):
        for c_vals in product(range(2), repeat=size_b_c):
            valid = True
            for i in range(size_b_c - 1):
                # Relation: b(i+1) = a_i + a_(i+1), but a_(i+1) doesn't exist if i+1 >= len(a)
                # For illustration, ignore out of bounds
                if i < len(a) - 1:
                    expected_b_next = a[i] + a[i+1]
                    if b_vals[i+1] != expected_b_next:
                        valid = False
                        break
                    # Relation for c: c(i+1) = a_i OR a_(i+1)
                    if c_vals[i+1] != (a[i] or a[i+1]):
                        valid = False
                        break
            if valid:
                count_b_c += 1
    print(f"Sequences a: {a}, valid (b,c): {count_b_c}")
    total_count += count_b_c
print(f"Total count of pairs (b,c): {total_count}")
```

This script:
- Limits enumeration to very small sizes.
- Enumerates all sequences `a` with elements less than 4 as an approximation.
- Checks relations for `b` and `c`.
- Streams each candidate count to support conjecture.

This approach helps approximate the total number of valid `(b, c)` pairs given constraints—useful for insight and proof strategies.
