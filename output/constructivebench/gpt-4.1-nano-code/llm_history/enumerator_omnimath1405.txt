The problem defines a predicate `isLoose` for natural numbers `n`: `n` has exactly 6 divisors, and the divisors satisfy a certain increasing property. It then asks to sum all such `n` below 100 and find the total sum.

To do this, we can enumerate numbers `n` from 0 to 99, check if they satisfy `isLoose`, and sum those that do. We do not compute or hardcode the answer; instead, we perform the enumeration at runtime and accumulate the sum, printing each such `n` immediately.

Since `n=0` has infinitely many divisors, and 1 has only 1 divisor, the only candidates will be integers `n ≥ 2`. But the code's divisor count should be checked in the code; the divisor counting is straightforward with a simple function.

Here's the implementation:

```python
# The code will iterate over numbers from 0 to 99,
# check the divisor count and the increasing property,
# and sum those satisfying the isLoose predicate.
# It will print each qualifying 'n' immediately, and in the end,
# output the sum.

import math

def divisors(n):
    divs = set()
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divs.add(i)
            divs.add(n // i)
    return sorted(divs)

total_sum = 0
for n in range(100):
    if n == 0:
        continue  # skip 0 as it doesn't have a well-defined number of divisors
    divs = divisors(n)
    if len(divs) == 6:
        # Check the increasing property:
        # For each pair (a, b), with a < b, ensure b ≥ 2 * a
        valid = True
        for i in range(len(divs)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(divs)):
                a, b = divs[i], divs[j]
                if a < b and b < 2 * a:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if not valid:
                break
        if valid:
            print(n)
            total_sum += n

print("Sum of all such n:", total_sum)
```

This code enumerates all `n < 100`, checks the `isLoose` condition, prints each `n` satisfying it immediately, and at the end, prints the total sum. This approach streamlines finding the answer without hardcoding or precomputations and respects execution constraints.
