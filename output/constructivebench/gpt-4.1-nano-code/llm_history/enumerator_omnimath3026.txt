[write_program]
The problem asks to compute the difference between the maximum and minimum of a fixed list of real numbers: [0.023, 0.302, 0.203, 0.320, 0.032]. To support conjecture, we'll write a Python script that outputs the maximum and minimum values and their difference. Since the list is fixed and small, enumerating all step-by-step calculations is trivial.

Here's a straightforward Python program that:
- Evaluates the maximum and minimum,
- Prints each value immediately,
- Calculates and prints their difference.

```python
# List of given real numbers
numbers = [0.023, 0.302, 0.203, 0.320, 0.032]

# Find maximum
max_value = max(numbers)
print(f"Maximum value: {max_value}")

# Find minimum
min_value = min(numbers)
print(f"Minimum value: {min_value}")

# Calculate the difference
difference = max_value - min_value
print(f"Difference (max - min): {difference}")
```
