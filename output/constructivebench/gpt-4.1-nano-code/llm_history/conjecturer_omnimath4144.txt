omnimath4144_answer = 1998. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The key error stems from defining `omnimath4144_answer` as a function `(a : ℕ → ℕ) → ℕ` instead of a plain `ℕ`. The theorem states an equality `a 1998 = omnimath4144_answer`, where `a 1998` is a number, but the definition of `omnimath4144_answer` is incorrectly given as a function. 

From the enumerated answer, the logic suggests that the solution at `n=1998` is `1998`, because the problem indicates a specific decomposition into powers: `2 + 2*2 + 4*498 = 1998`. The value of `a 1998` matches `1998` directly by the pattern described.

Thus, the simplest correct fix is to define `omnimath4144_answer` as a constant `1998` of type `ℕ`. This aligns with the expected type needed for the theorem and matches the enumerated conclusion.
