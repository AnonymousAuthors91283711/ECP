The problem appears to involve a combinatorial setup: Given parameters, an arrangement of functions \(a_i\), various constraints, and a maximum product, and the goal is to analyze the 2-adic valuation of this product. To assist in conjecture and proof, I will enumerate candidate sequences \(a_i\) satisfying the sum constraint, with small parameters for efficiency. For this example, I will choose small \(n\), say \(n=3\), and generate all sequences with positive integers summing to 2021 to find the maximum product and its 2-adic valuation. The code will print each candidate and its product immediately, and finally compute the maximum found and output its 2-adic valuation.

```python
import itertools
from math import prod

# Parameters
n = 3
target_sum = 2021

max_product = 0
max_product_sequence = None

# Generate all compositions of 2021 into 3 positive integers
for a in itertools.product(range(1, target_sum), repeat=n):
    if sum(a) == target_sum:
        product_a = prod(a)
        print(f"Sequence: {a}, Product: {product_a}")
        if product_a > max_product:
            max_product = product_a
            max_product_sequence = a

# Compute 2-adic valuation
def v2(x):
    count = 0
    while x % 2 == 0 and x > 0:
        x //= 2
        count += 1
    return count

if max_product_sequence:
    print(f"Max product sequence: {max_product_sequence}")
    print(f"Maximum product: {max_product}")
    print(f"2-adic valuation of max product: {v2(max_product)}")
```
