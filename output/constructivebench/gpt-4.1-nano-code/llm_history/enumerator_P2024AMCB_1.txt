The problem appears to be about solving an equation involving natural numbers, specifically looking for a value of n that satisfies the equation n - 1013 + 1 = 1010. The goal is to find that n and fill in the answer, then prove the equivalence.

Let's analyze the equation:
n - 1013 + 1 = 1010
=> n - 1012 = 1010
=> n = 1010 + 1012 = 2022

Thus, the value of n fulfilling the condition is 2022. To match the specifications, I'll write a small enumerator that confirms this solution and outputs n.

```python
# Python enumerator to find the value of n satisfying the equation
# n - 1013 + 1 = 1010
# n = 1010 + (1013 - 1) = 1010 + 1012 = 2022

for k in range(0, 2000):  # limit range for efficiency
    n_candidate = 1010 + k  # n = 1010 + k
    if n_candidate - 1013 + 1 == 1010:
        print(n_candidate)
        # Since equation is linear, only one solution is necessary
        break
```

This script will print the value `2022`, aligning with the analysis, and aligns with the requirements.
