theorem omnimath1991 : 
  let total_break_sequences := 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1  -- 7! ways to break 7 times
  let desired_sequences := 1  -- only one way to get all pieces equal
  (desired_sequences : ℚ) / total_break_sequences = omnimath1991_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Total break sequences (7!): 5040
Desired sequences (all pieces equal in one way): 1
Answer (ratio): 1/5040. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
<<<1/5040>>>
