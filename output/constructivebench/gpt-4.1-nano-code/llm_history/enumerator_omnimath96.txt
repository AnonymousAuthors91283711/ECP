The provided problem appears to be a formalization in a proof assistant language (likely Lean), asking for the set of functions \(f : \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}\) satisfying a certain functional equation involving quadratic expressions and sums/differences. The question is implicitly to find all such functions.

In a competition or exploration setting, to assist in conjecturing solutions, we can systematically test specific forms of functions—particularly polynomial functions like constant, linear, quadratic functions—and narrow down possibilities.

Since the core functional equation involves quadratic forms, I will generate candidate functions \(f(n) = c n + d\) and verify if they satisfy the equation for small integers \(a, b, c\). To avoid an exhaustive search over infinite domains, I'll test over small ranges, for example for \(a, b, c \in \{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2\}\).

This approach captures potential linear solutions. If needed, we could also test quadratic forms or constant functions.

The plan:
- Fix small sample parameters.
- Generate candidate linear functions \(f(n) = c n + d\) with small integer coefficients.
- Verify whether these candidate functions satisfy the equation for all sampled triples.
- Collect solutions and print them as candidate functions.

Let's implement this:

```python
# Enumerate possible linear functions f(n) = c * n + d with small coefficients
# and check whether they satisfy the functional equation for small integer triples.

# Define a verification function
def verify(f, triples):
    for a, b, c in triples:
        lhs = 2 * f(a**2 + b**2 + c**2) - 2 * f(a*b + b*c + c*a)
        rhs = (f(a - b)**2 + f(b - c)**2 + f(c - a)**2)
        if lhs != rhs:
            return False
    return True

# Sample small triples for testing
triples = [(a, b, c) for a in range(-2, 3) for b in range(-2, 3) for c in range(-2, 3)]

solutions = []

# Search over small integer coefficients c, d for candidate linear functions
for c_coef in range(-3, 4):
    for d_coef in range(-3, 4):
        def f(n, c=c_coef, d=d_coef):
            return c * n + d
        if verify(f, triples):
            # Record the candidate function
            solutions.append((c_coef, d_coef))
            print(f"f(n) = {c_coef}*n + {d_coef}")

# Output all solutions found
# Candidate functions are linear solutions fitting tested triples
```
