This problem involves finding the least natural number `b > 1` such that the factorial of 11 (which is 39916800) can be expressed as `k * b^2` with `b` not dividing `k`. Additionally, for all `m < 2`, the factorial should not be expressed as `k * b^{m+1}` with `b` not dividing `k`, effectively restricting the factorization behaviors for smaller exponents.

Key points:
- `f = 11! = 39916800`
- `b > 1`
- `f = k * b^2`, with `b` not dividing `k`.
- Since `b` is the candidate, and `b^2` divides `f`, then `b` must be a divisor of `f`.
- For the minimal such `b`, we search among divisors of `f`.

Let's enumerate all divisors of `f`, check those greater than 1, and test the conditions to find the least such `b`.

```python
def divisors(n):
    divs = []
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5)+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divs.append(i)
            if i != n // i:
                divs.append(n // i)
    divs.append(n)  # n divides itself
    return sorted(divs)

f = 39916800  # 11!

candidates = []

for b in divisors(f):
    if f % (b * b) == 0:
        k = f // (b * b)
        # Check if b does not divide k
        if k % b != 0:
            candidates.append(b)
            print(b)  # output candidate immediately

# Among candidates, select the least
answer = min(candidates) if candidates else None
print("Least b:", answer)
```
