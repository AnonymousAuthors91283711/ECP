The problem appears to involve finding the greatest value \( z \) such that there exist real numbers \( x' \), \( y' \) satisfying both

\[ \sin x' \cos y' + \sin y' \cos x' = z \]

and

\[ \sin x' \cos y' - \sin y' \cos x' = 1. \]

Given the symmetry of the expressions, observe that

\[ \sin x' \cos y' + \sin y' \cos x' = \sin(x' + y') \]
and

\[ \sin x' \cos y' - \sin y' \cos x' = \sin(x' - y'). \]

The equations simplify to:

\[
\begin{cases}
z = \sin(x' + y'), \\
1 = \sin(x' - y').
\end{cases}
\]

Since \( \sin(x' - y') = 1 \), we know \( x' - y' = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi \) for integers \( k \). For simplicity, take \( x' - y' = \frac{\pi}{2} \). Then:

\[
x' = y' + \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

Now, \( x' + y' = (y' + \frac{\pi}{2}) + y' = 2y' + \frac{\pi}{2} \), so

\[
z = \sin(2 y' + \frac{\pi}{2}) = \cos(2 y').
\]

Since \( y' \) is arbitrary, \( z = \cos(2 y') \), which takes all values in \([-1, 1]\) as \( y' \) varies.

Therefore, the set of all such \( z \) is exactly \([-1, 1]\).

The greatest \( z \) in this set is \( 1 \).

```python
# Enumerate z values by sampling y' over a small range to illustrate the maximum.
import math

# Since z = cos(2 y'), for y' in [0, pi/2], z in [-1, 1].
# We will enumerate several points to demonstrate this.

values = set()
for k in range(0, 11):  # 11 points from y' = 0 to pi/2
    y_prime = (math.pi / 20) * k
    z = math.cos(2 * y_prime)
    print(z)
    values.add(z)

# Output the maximum value found
print("Maximum z:", max(values))
```
