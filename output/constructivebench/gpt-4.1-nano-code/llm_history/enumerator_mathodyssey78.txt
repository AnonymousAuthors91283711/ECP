This problem defines a recursive function `a` on natural numbers with specific initial conditions and recursive rules, and asks to find `a 2024`. The rules resemble the process of counting the number of 1's in the binary representation of `n` (i.e., the binary weight). The function doubles the value for even `n`, and adds one for odd `n` (mirroring binary digit shifts).

Let's analyze the recurrence:
- `a(0) = 0`
- `a(1) = 1`
- For even `n`, `a(2n) = a(n)`
- For odd `n`, `a(2n + 1) = a(n) + 1`

This matches the criteria for the number of 1's in the binary representation, known as the "popcount" or Hamming weight.

The value `a 2024` can be computed by counting set bits in 2024's binary form. Since the problem asks for enumeration, we'll implement the function's recursive structure to verify this.

```python
# Function to recursively compute a(n) based on the given rules
def a(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return a(n // 2)
    else:
        return a(n // 2) + 1

# Determine the answer for 2024 by counting its binary 1's
answer = a(2024)
print(answer)
```
