The problem involves finding the value of \( f(5,5) \) given that the function \( f \) can be expressed as a quadratic form in \( x \) and \( y \), with the structure \( f(x,y) = axy + bx + cy + d \). Given four specific values of the function at different points, we need to determine the corresponding coefficients \( a, b, c, d \).

We will do the following:
- Use the four given points to solve for \( a, b, c, d \).
- Plug in \( x=5, y=5 \) to find \( f(5,5) \).

I will set up the equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
f(3, 3) = 9a + 3b + 3c + d = \frac{1}{9} \\
f(3, 4) = 12a + 3b + 4c + d = \frac{1}{12} \\
f(4, 3) = 12a + 4b + 3c + d = \frac{1}{12} \\
f(4, 4) = 16a + 4b + 4c + d = \frac{1}{16}
\end{cases}
\]

Solve these equations for \( a, b, c, d \), then compute \( f(5, 5) = 25a + 5b + 5c + d \). To be efficient, we'll perform symbolic elimination directly.

```python
import numpy as np

# Coefficient matrix for the four equations
A = np.array([
    [9, 3, 3, 1],
    [12, 3, 4, 1],
    [12, 4, 3, 1],
    [16, 4, 4, 1]
])

# Constants vector
b_vec = np.array([1/9, 1/12, 1/12, 1/16])

# Solve for [a, b, c, d]
coeffs = np.linalg.solve(A, b_vec)
a, b, c, d = coeffs

# Compute f(5, 5)
f_5_5 = a * 25 + b * 5 + c * 5 + d
print("Computed coefficients:")
print(f"a = {a}")
print(f"b = {b}")
print(f"c = {c}")
print(f"d = {d}")
print(f"f(5,5) = {f_5_5}")
```
