The problem seems to involve finding all functions \(f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) satisfying the functional equation:

\[
\forall x,y \in \mathbb{R}, \quad (x + y^2) \cdot f ( y \cdot f x ) = x y \cdot f ( y^2 + f x ).
\]

We want to propose possible solutions by enumerating candidate functions or values. Since the problem is high-school level, a common approach to such functional equations is to check simple functions such as constant functions, linear functions, zero functions, or other typical candidates like \(f(x) = 0\), \(f(x) = x\), or \(f(x) = c\). 

Given the constraints, to assist in conjecturing and proving, we'll:

- Test simple functions: constant and linear.
- For constant functions, analyze \(f(x) = c\).
- For linear functions, analyze \(f(x) = a x + b\).
- For candidate constants or parameters, print each candidate when checked.

The code will systematically check these forms and print the candidate solutions promptly.

```python
# Enumeration of candidate solutions: constants and simple linear functions
def main():
    # Test constant functions f(x) = c
    for c in [-10, -1, 0, 1, 10]:
        def f_const(x, c=c):
            return c
        # Check the functional equation with constants
        # For simplicity, test at some sample points (x,y)
        valid = True
        for x in [-1, 0, 1]:
            for y in [-1, 0, 1]:
                lhs = (x + y**2) * f_const(y * f_const(x))
                rhs = x * y * f_const(y**2 + f_const(x))
                if abs(lhs - rhs) > 1e-9:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if not valid:
                break
        if valid:
            print(f"Constant solution f(x) = {c}")
            # Abbreviate and store in answer set
    # Test linear functions f(x) = a x + b
    for a in [-1, 0, 1]:
        for b in [-2, 0, 2]:
            def f_linear(x, a=a, b=b):
                return a * x + b
            # Check the equation approximately for some sample points
            valid = True
            for x in [-1, 0, 1]:
                for y in [-1, 0, 1]:
                    lhs = (x + y**2) * f_linear(y * f_linear(x))
                    rhs = x * y * f_linear(y**2 + f_linear(x))
                    if abs(lhs - rhs) > 1e-6:
                        valid = False
                        break
                if not valid:
                    break
            if valid:
                print(f"Linear solution f(x) = {a}x + {b}")
