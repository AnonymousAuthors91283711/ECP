The problem appears to involve solving for a real number \( r \) based on the system of equations involving cube roots. The key equations, interpreted from the symbolic expressions, are:

\[
\sqrt{3} \times r = 3^{1/3}
\]
\[
3^{1/3} \times r = 3^{1/6}
\]

We want to find \( r \) satisfying these, and then the third variable is expressed via \( r \). Let's analyze the equations:

From the first:
\[
r = \frac{3^{1/3}}{\sqrt{3}}
\]

Note that:
\[
\sqrt{3} = 3^{1/2}
\]
so:
\[
r = \frac{3^{1/3}}{3^{1/2}} = 3^{1/3 - 1/2} = 3^{(2/6 - 3/6)} = 3^{-1/6}
\]

Check the second:
\[
3^{1/3} \times r = 3^{1/6}
\]
which, substituting \( r = 3^{-1/6} \):
\[
3^{1/3} \times 3^{-1/6} = 3^{1/6}
\]
simplifies to:
\[
3^{1/3 - 1/6} = 3^{2/6 - 1/6} = 3^{1/6}
\]
which matches perfectly.

Thus, \( r = 3^{-1/6} \).

The third variable in the theorem is expressed as:
\[
(3^{1/6}) \times r = P2014AMCA_7_answer
\]
substitute \( r \):

\[
3^{1/6} \times 3^{-1/6} = 3^{1/6 - 1/6} = 3^0 = 1
\]

Hence, the answer is 1.

We can write a small enumeration code that confirms this reasoning discretely and outputs the answer:

```python
# Enumerate candidates for r based on the derived relation
import math

# Known exponents
base = 3
exp1 = 1/3
exp2 = 1/6
sqrt3 = math.sqrt(3)

# Calculate r according to derived expression
r = base ** (-1/6)

# Verify the equations
assert abs(sqrt3 * r - base ** (1/3)) < 1e-9
assert abs(base ** (1/3) * r - base ** (1/6)) < 1e-9

# Compute the final answer
answer = base ** (1/6) * r
print(answer)  # Should print 1.0
```
