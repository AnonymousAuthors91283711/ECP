This problem involves solving the Diophantine equation: \(13 \times \text{pencilCost} + 3 \times \text{eraserCost} = 100\), with the condition that \(\text{pencilCost} > \text{eraserCost}\). We aim to find all non-negative integer solutions for \(\text{pencilCost}\) and \(\text{eraserCost}\), then identify their sums, possibly the maximum or specific solutions depending on the question context.

To efficiently find solutions, we iterate over small values of eraserCost, compute the corresponding pencilCost, verify the equation, ensure the inequality holds, and print all solutions as we go.

```python
# Enumerate possible eraserCost values
max_eraser_cost = 50  # upper bound based on equation constraints
for eraser_cost in range(max_eraser_cost + 1):
    # Compute the potential pencilCost from the equation: 13*pencilCost + 3*eraserCost = 100
    numerator = 100 - 3 * eraser_cost
    if numerator % 13 == 0:
        pencil_cost = numerator // 13
        # Ensure non-negative and the inequality pencilCost > eraserCost
        if pencil_cost >= 0 and pencil_cost > eraser_cost:
            total = pencil_cost + eraser_cost
            print(f"pencilCost: {pencil_cost}, eraserCost: {eraser_cost}, sum: {total}")
```
