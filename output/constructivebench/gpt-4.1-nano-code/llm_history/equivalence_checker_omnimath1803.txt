Ground Truth Answer: fun x => Int.floor x
Proposed Answer: fun x => if x ≤ 0 then -x else x
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem describes a functional equation with several conditions:
1. A subadditive/superadditive-like condition (f x + f y + 1 ≥ f (x+y) ≥ f x + f y)
2. A condition on the interval [0,1) where f(0) is maximal
3. Specific values at x=-1 and x=1

The ground truth answer is the floor function, while the proposed answer is the absolute value function (with a different expression).

Key differences:
1. The floor function satisfies all given conditions:
   - It's subadditive (floor(x+y) ≥ floor(x)+floor(y) when x,y ≥ 0, and similar for negatives)
   - On [0,1), floor(0)=0 is indeed maximal
   - floor(-1)=-1 and floor(1)=1

2. The absolute value function fails several conditions:
   - It doesn't satisfy the additive inequalities (e.g., x=1, y=-1 gives contradictions)
   - f(0)=0 is not maximal on [0,1) (f(0.5)=0.5 > 0)
   - While it does satisfy f(-1)=1≠-1 and f(1)=1

The proposed answer is fundamentally different from the correct answer and fails multiple conditions.
