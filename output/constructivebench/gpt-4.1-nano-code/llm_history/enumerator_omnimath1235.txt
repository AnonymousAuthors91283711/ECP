The problem involves evaluating the product \( \tan(\frac{\pi}{7}) \times \tan(\frac{2\pi}{7}) \times \tan(\frac{3\pi}{7}) \). Exact algebraic or trigonometric identities suggest the product equals 1, as these angles are related to the seventh roots of unity.

To assist in conjecturing, I'll write a Python program that numerically computes these tangent values, multiplies them, and checks whether the product is close to 1, generating exact and approximate results for different sample points, especially since the angles are fixed but irrational in decimal form. This will help to verify the claimed product.

The code will:
- Calculate the tangent of the specified angles.
- Compute their product.
- Print each result immediately.
- Use rational approximations for better insights over floating points.

```python
import math

# Define the angles in radians
angles = [math.pi/7, 2*math.pi/7, 3*math.pi/7]

# Compute tangent values
tans = [math.tan(a) for a in angles]

# Compute the product
product = math.prod(tans)

# Output individual tangent values
for i, t in enumerate(tans, start=1):
    print(f'tan(pi/{7}*{i}): {t}')

# Output the product of the three tangents
print(f'Product: {product}')

# For exact conjecture, check proximity to 1
if abs(product - 1) < 1e-10:
    print("The product is approximately 1, consistent with known identities.")
else:
    print("The product appears different from 1, suggest further algebraic analysis.")
```
