The problem involves maximizing \(s = x + y\) subject to the constraints \(y = x^2\) and \(y - x = 3 - y\). Simplifying, \(y = x^2\) and \(2y = x + 3 \Rightarrow y = \frac{x + 3}{2}\). Equate \(x^2 = \frac{x + 3}{2}\), leading to \(2x^2 = x + 3 \Rightarrow 2x^2 - x - 3 = 0\). The roots are \(x = \frac{1}{4}\) and \(x= -\frac{3}{2}\). Corresponding \(s = x + y\), substituting, yields maximum at \(x= \frac{1}{4}\), \(y= \frac{7}{8}\), so \(s=\frac{1}{4} + \frac{7}{8} = \frac{9}{8}\).

Final answer:

. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Based on the problem description and the enumerated solutions, the critical points correspond to the roots \(x=1.5\) and \(x=-1\). Calculating \(s = x + y\) at these points yields the maximum \(s=3.75\) at \(x=1.5\), which aligns with the enumerated answer \(s=3.75\). The algebraic derivation indicates the roots are \(x= \frac{1}{4}\) and \(-\frac{3}{2}\), but the enumerated particular solutions suggest the relevant \(x\) for maximum \(s\) is 1.5, matching the solution with \(x=1.5\). The key is to pick the correct root for the maximization.

In Lean, to express the maximum \(s\), given the roots, and ensuring correctness, the closed-form answer that encapsulates the maximum is:
- \(x=1.5\),
- \(y= y = x^2 = 2.25\),
- \(s= x + y = 3.75\).

Since the roots correspond to the quadratic \(2x^2 - x - 3=0\) with roots \(x=1.5\) and \(-1\), and the maximum occurs at \(x=1.5\), the answer can be written as:

<<<(3/4) + (9/4)>>>

This simplifies to 3.75 in decimal, matching the solution pattern, and is a closed-form rational expression.

**Final answer:**

<<<(3/4) + (9/4)>>>
