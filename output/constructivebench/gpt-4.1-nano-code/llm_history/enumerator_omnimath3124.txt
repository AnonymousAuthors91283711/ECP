The problem states that for all real numbers s, 4 * s = 28 if and only if s equals some value. To find possible candidates for this answer, we need to consider the solution of the equation 4 * s = 28. Since it's a simple linear equation, s = 28 / 4 = 7. The task is to write a Python program that enumerates candidate answers to verify or analyze this result, prioritizing exact solutions.

Here's the plan:
- Compute the candidate answer(s) for s.
- If we want to demonstrate verification over a range, enumerate values around the candidate.
- For efficiency, just directly compute the candidate answer.
- Print the candidate answer immediately.

```python
# Enumerate candidate answers for the equation 4s = 28.
# Since it's linear, directly solve for s.
candidate_s = 28 / 4
print(candidate_s)
```
