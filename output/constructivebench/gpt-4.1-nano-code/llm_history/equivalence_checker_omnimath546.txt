Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {m : ℤ | m = 3 ∨ m = -3}
<<<None>>>
Since the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's intentionally left incomplete in the Lean proof assistant), we cannot verify whether the proposed answer {m : ℤ | m = 3 ∨ m = -3} is equivalent to the ground truth. The problem asks to find all integer solutions to k² = m² + 6m + 28, but without knowing the intended solution, we cannot confirm equivalence. The proposed answer suggests only 3 and -3 as solutions, but we'd need to verify this by solving the equation to be certain.
