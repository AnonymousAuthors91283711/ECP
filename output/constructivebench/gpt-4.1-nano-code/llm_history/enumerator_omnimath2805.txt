The problem seems to be a simple arithmetic expression intended to compute a specific answer, likely involving basic operations. The theorem states an expression and aims to confirm its value, but both the answer and theorem are marked as `sorry`. To assist in conjecturing or verifying the correct answer, I'll write a Python program that enumerates possible calculations of the given expression, prioritizing exact integer or fractional results before approximations.

Since the expression is `((20 - 16) * (12 + 8) / 4)`, this simplifies to `(4 * 20) / 4 = 80 / 4 = 20`, but we will derive this by enumeration instead of assuming.

```python
# Enumerate possible calculations of the expression ((20 - 16) * (12 + 8)) / 4
# Prioritize exact integer results, then approximations if needed

results = set()

# Possible values for parts of the expression (simulate variations if needed)
subtractions = [20 - 16]
additions = [12 + 8]

# Generate all combinations
for sub in subtractions:
    for add in additions:
        numerator = sub * add
        # Check if denominator divides numerator exactly
        if numerator % 4 == 0:
            answer = numerator // 4
            print(f"Exact integer answer: {answer}")
            results.add(answer)
        else:
            # If not exact, provide float approximation
            answer = numerator / 4
            print(f"Approximate answer: {answer}")
            results.add(answer)

# The expression's value should be 20, as per manual calculation
```

This program enumerates the calculation steps, outputs exact results when possible, and provides approximations otherwise, assisting in confirming the answer for the theorem.
