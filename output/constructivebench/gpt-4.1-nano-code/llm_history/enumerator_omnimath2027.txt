This problem involves a polynomial function \( p(x) = x^2 - x + 1 \) and the condition that applying \( p \) four times yields \( p^{(4)}(\alpha) = \alpha \). We need to compute the product:

\[
(p(\alpha) - 1) \times p(\alpha) \times p(p(\alpha)) \times p^{(4)}(\alpha)
\]

given that \( p^{(4)}(\alpha) = \alpha \). The core of the problem is to find possible values of \( p(\alpha) \) and \( p(p(\alpha)) \) under this cyclicity condition.

Since \( p \) is quadratic, the iteration might produce a cycle of small length. We will:

- Pick simple candidate values for \( \alpha \) that satisfy the cycle condition.
- For each, compute the four terms.
- Multiply them to find possible answers.
- Use symbolic computation to find potential solutions.

Note that the key is to analyze \( p \) iteratively, find \( p^{(4)}(\alpha) = \alpha \), and evaluate the product for those values.

```python
# The code attempts to find all alpha satisfying p^{(4)}(alpha) = alpha.
# Then, for each, computes the product (p(alpha) - 1)*p(alpha)*p(p(alpha))*alpha.
# Since p is quadratic, look for cycles of length dividing 4, starting from fixed points and cycles of length 2 or 4.

# Find fixed points: solutions to p(alpha) = alpha
fixed_pts = sp.solve(p(x) - x, x)

# Find 2-cycles: p(p(alpha)) = alpha for alpha not fixed points
# For cycles of length 4, check p^{(4)}(alpha) = alpha

# gather solutions
answers = []

# Check fixed points
for alpha in fixed_pts:
    p_alpha = p(alpha)

        print(f"Fixed point alpha={alpha}, product={product}")
        answers.append(sp.N(product))

# Check 2-cycle solutions: p(p(alpha)) = alpha, alpha not fixed points
# For each candidate, verify p^{(4)}(alpha) = alpha
# Because p is quadratic, possible cycles of length 2 can be tested numerically

        print(f"2-cycle approx alpha={alpha}, product={product}")
        answers.append(sp.N(product))

# Check for cycles of length 4 by sampling:
# For simplicity, test some initial values and see if they lead to a 4-cycle
# (more systematic approach can be used, but for illustration, sample points)
