theorem olympiadbench3033 (S M distance : ℝ) (hS : S = 15) (hM : M = 10) (hd : distance = 100) :
  ∃ t : ℝ, S * t + M * t = distance ∧ S * t = olympiadbench3033_answer S M distance := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun S M distance => S * distance / (S + M)
Proposed Answer: fun S M distance => (S + M) * (distance / (S + M))
Let's analyze the proposed answer and the ground truth answer:

1. Ground truth: `S * distance / (S + M)`
2. Proposed: `(S + M) * (distance / (S + M))`

Simplifying the proposed answer:
`(S + M) * (distance / (S + M)) = distance` (the (S + M) terms cancel out)

This is clearly different from the ground truth answer `S * distance / (S + M)`.

The proposed answer simplifies to just `distance`, which is incorrect as it doesn't involve S and M in the way required by the problem (which asks for S*t where t is the time solution).
