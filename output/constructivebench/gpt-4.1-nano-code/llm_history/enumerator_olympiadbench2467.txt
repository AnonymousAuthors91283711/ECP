This problem involves solving a system of equations with exponential terms. It asks for the unique solution `(ab.1, ab.2)` satisfying the given equations. To approximate this, I'll search for solutions of `ab.2` within a reasonable range, then find corresponding `ab.1`. For efficiency and clarity, I'll:

- Fix small values for the exponent parameter `ab.2` in a search.
- For each candidate `ab.2`, compute `ab.1` from the first equation.
- Check if the second equation is satisfied within a tolerance.
- Print exact or near-exact solutions immediately.

This approach prioritizes approximate solutions and handles the exponential forms directly.

```python
import math

# Define the equations
def eq1(b2):
    return 2.75 / (3.00 ** b2)

def eq2(b2):
    return 3.75 / (6.00 ** b2)

# Search over a range of positive b2 values
for b2_int in range(0, 20):
    b2 = b2_int * 0.1  # Smaller steps for finer approximation
    a1 = eq1(b2)
    # Check if the second equation is satisfied approximately
    lhs = a1 * (6.00 ** b2)
    tol = 1e-6
    if abs(lhs - 3.75) < tol and a1 > 0:
        print((a1, b2))
```

The problem involves finding parameters (a, b) such that:
- \( a \times 3^{b} = 2.75 \)
- \( a \times 6^{b} = 3.75 \)
- \( a > 0 \), \( b > 0 \)

From the equations, the code attempts to solve for \( a \) given \( b \), then check whether both equations are simultaneously satisfied within a tolerance.

**Judgment:**
1. The code iterates over a limited range (0 to 1.9 in steps of 0.1), which might be coarse and misses the solution.
2. The solution for a given \( b \) is \( a = 2.75 / 3^{b} \). Plugging into the second equation: check if \( a \times 6^{b} \approx 3.75 \).
3. Both equations imply:
   \[
   \frac{2.75}{3^{b}} \times 6^{b} \approx 3.75
   \]
   which simplifies to:
   \[
   2.75 \times \left( \frac{6}{3} \right)^b = 3.75
   \]
   \[
   2.75 \times 2^{b} = 3.75
   \]
   \[
   2^{b} = \frac{3.75}{2.75} \approx 1.363636
   \]
   \[
   b \approx \log_2 1.363636 \approx 0.45
   \]

Calculating \( a \):
\[
a = \frac{2.75}{3^{b}} \approx \frac{2.75}{3^{0.45}} \approx \frac{2.75}{3^{0.45}}
\]

Let's estimate:
\[
3^{0.45} \approx e^{0.45 \ln 3 } \approx e^{0.45 \times 1.0986} \approx e^{0.494} \approx 1.64
\]

Then,
\[
a \approx 2.75 / 1.64 \approx 1.677
\]

Evaluating the second equation:
\[
a \times 6^{b} \approx 1.677 \times

The problem appears to involve solving a system of equations involving exponents, likely to find unique positive real numbers satisfying those equations. Since the provided "program" is empty and only produces an error, no answers are being output. 

Given the problem's nature, the ideal approach is to find an approximate numerical solution using logarithms, as the system involves terms like `ab.1 * (constant) ^ ab.2`. Since only enumeration is requested, a small grid search over plausible ranges for `ab.2` (exponents) and calculating corresponding `ab.1` values is reasonable.

**Judgment:** The original program is empty and produces no output, which is not acceptable given the requirements. It should examine candidate solutions, output partial answers as it finds them, and determine the unique solution.

**Acceptance:** <<<False>>>

```python

# Define the ranges and steps for the exponents
# Since exponents like ab.2 are positive, choose a reasonable interval
# For a high-school level problem, let's assume exponents about around 0 to 2
exponent_start = 0.0
exponent_end = 3.0
step = 0.01

found_answers = []

for b2 in [i * step for i in range(int(exponent_start/step), int(exponent_end/step) + 1)]:
    # From the first equation: ab.1 * 3^b2 = 2.75 => ab.1 = 2.75 / 3^b2
    a1 = 2.75 / (3.0 ** b2)
    if a1 <= 0:
        continue
    # Check the second equation: a1 * 6^b2 â‰ˆ 3.75
    lhs = a1 * (6.0 ** b2)
    # Allow a small tolerance for floating point approximation
    if abs(lhs - 3.75) < 0.001:
        print(f"b2: {b2:.2f}")
        print(f"a1: {a1:.4f}")
        print(f"Equation check: {a1 * (6.0 ** b2):.4f}")
        # Confirm that a1 > 0 and b2 > 0
