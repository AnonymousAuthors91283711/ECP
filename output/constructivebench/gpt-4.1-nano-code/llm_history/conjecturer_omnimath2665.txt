abbrev omnimath2665_answer : ℤ := sorry
theorem omnimath2665 :
  ((-1)^3 + (-1)^2 + (-1) = omnimath2665_answer) :=
sorry
. Enumerated answers: (-1)^3 = -1
(-1)^2 = 1
(-1) = -1
Sum = -1. Expected Answer Type: ℤ
The sum of the four terms is (-1)^3 + (-1)^2 + (-1), which simplifies to -1 + 1 - 1 = -1.
Final answer: <<<-1>>>
