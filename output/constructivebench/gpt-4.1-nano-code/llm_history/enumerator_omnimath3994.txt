Let's analyze the problem and interpret what it's asking:

- We're working with a 5x5 matrix with entries either 0 or 1.
- Entries 1 must correspond to odd numbers (up to 25).
- Entries 0 must correspond to even numbers (up to 25).
- The value `s` is defined as the maximum sum over certain 3x3 blocks within the matrix.
- These blocks are specified as submatrices with rows p.1 to p.1+2 and columns p.2 to p.2+2 where p ranges over pairs in Fin 3 (indices 0..2). 
- Our goal is to find the greatest such sum `s`.

To maximize the sum of entries in these 3x3 blocks, we want to maximize the number of 1s (odd entries) inside these blocks.

Key observations:
- Since entries are either 0 or 1, the maximum sum in each 3x3 block is 9 (all entries are 1).
- The total `s` is the maximum of such sums over all 3x3 blocks within the 5x5 matrix.

The question reduces to: Can we fill the matrix with 1s to cover as many 3x3 blocks as possible? The process:

- The 3x3 blocks are centered at positions where p.1 and p.2 range from 0..2.
- The maximum number of 3x3 blocks within a 5x5 matrix is 4, each overlapping partially but potentially fully filled with 1s.

The maximum total sum `s` would be when all 3x3 blocks are filled with 1s: each sum being 9. But because of overlaps, the maximum aggregate sum per block is 9, and overlaps don't affect the sum of individual blocks—they just determine how many blocks are fully filled.

Let's verify the maximum sum for each block (which is 9), and calculate the maximum possible `s`.

To that end, our code will:
- Generate all possible 5x5 matrices with entries in {0,1}.
- For each, compute all 3x3 block sums.
- Stream each maximum considered, to find the overall maximum.

Given the size of the matrix (5x5) and the limited entries (0/1), enumerating all 2^{25} matrices is huge (around 33 million). To stay within token limits, we will instead generate a strategically constructed example—that is, a matrix filled with 1s allows all blocks to be entirely 9. 

Hence, the maximum sum per block is 9, which all are fully filled with 1s.

Let's proceed with a sample code that sets up such a matrix, computes the max sum per block, and demonstrates the maximum `s`.

```python
# The goal is to find the maximum sum `s` over all 3x3 blocks in a 5x5 binary matrix,
# where each entry is either 0 or 1, with the goal of maximizing the sum in each block.
# Since entries are binary, the maximum per 3x3 block is 9 (all ones).
# Construct a 5x5 matrix filled with ones and verify the maximum sum.

import itertools

def generate_matrix():
    # Fill matrix with ones
    return [[1 for _ in range(5)] for _ in range(5)]

def block_sums(matrix):
    sums = []
    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(3):
            total = 0
            for di in range(3):
                for dj in range(3):
                    total += matrix[i+di][j+dj]
            sums.append(total)
            print(f"3x3 block at ({i},{j}) sum: {total}")
    return max(sums)

matrix = generate_matrix()
max_sum = block_sums(matrix)
print(f"Maximum 3x3 block sum: {max_sum}")
# This will output the maximum possible sum, which should be 9, for an all-ones matrix.
```
