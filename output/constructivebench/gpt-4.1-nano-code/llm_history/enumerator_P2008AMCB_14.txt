The problem appears to be about algebraic manipulation involving logarithms, possibly relating to the given equations: \( \log (a^2) > 0 \) and \( 2 \pi \log (a^2) = \log (b^4) \).

Given the constraints and the goal to find the ratio \( \frac{\log b}{\log a} \), let's analyze the equations:

1. \( \log (a^2) > 0 \implies 2 \log a > 0 \implies \log a > 0 \implies a > 1 \).

2. \( 2 \pi \log (a^2) = \log (b^4) \implies 2 \pi \cdot 2 \log a = 4 \log b \implies 4 \pi \log a = 4 \log b \implies \pi \log a = \log b \).

Therefore, \( \log b = \pi \log a \), or equivalently, \( \frac{\log b}{\log a} = \pi \).

Our goal is to write code to confirm and produce all possible such ratios over integer parameters or small test values, although the algebraic derivation implies the ratio is always \( \pi \).

Here's a code snippet to verify and generate such ratios for sample values of \( a \) and \( b \).

```python
import math

# Define parameter ranges for testing
# We'll test a few a > 1 and corresponding b to verify the relation

results = set()
for a_int in range(2, 10):  # a > 1
    a = float(a_int)
    log_a = math.log(a)
    # Since log_b = pi * log_a, compute b accordingly
    log_b = math.pi * log_a
    b = math.exp(log_b)

    # Verify assumptions
    if log_a > 0 and b > 0:
        ratio = log_b / log_a
        print(f"a = {a:.2f}, b = {b:.2f}, ratio = {ratio:.4f}")
        results.add(ratio)

# Since algebra indicates ratio should always be pi
print(f"Observed ratios: {results}")
```
