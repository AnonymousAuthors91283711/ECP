  (36 * (digits 10).invFun [8,6,4,2,0]) % 1000 = P2010AIMEII_1_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Greatest candidate: -1
Digits:. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests the greatest number divisible by 36, composed of even digits (0,2,4,6,8), with distinct digits, and with specific factors involving digits [8,6,4,2,0]. Since the candidate is the inverse function value multiplied by 36, and the maximum such number with all conditions, it indicates the largest arrangement of these digits: 86420. 

Final answer: <<<86420>>>
