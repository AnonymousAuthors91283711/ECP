Approximate denominator (product of cosines): 0.9218950889266139
Approximate ratio: 5.65685424949238. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests the ratio converges to 4 times the sum of cosines: specifically, summing sine components related to π/18 angles simplifies into known exact forms involving square roots of 2 and 3, ultimately leading to 4√2. 

Thus, the exact ratio is 4 * √2.

The error arises because `real.sqrt` is not a recognized identifier in mathlib. Instead, the function to compute square roots in mathlib's `real` namespace is `real.sqrt`. To fix this, replace `real.sqrt` with `Real.sqrt`. 

Given the approximation and the ratio calculation, the value is close to `4 * sqrt 2`, which suggests the exact simplified answer is \(\boxed{4 \sqrt{2}}\).

Thus, the corrected answer in Lean should be:

The error indicates that the abbreviation `omnimath3340_answer` is declared as a noncomputable `abbrev` of type `ℝ`, but the assigned value `fun n : ℝ => 4 * Real.sqrt 2` is a function from `ℝ` to `ℝ`, which is a mismatch. Based on the problem, the answer is a closed-form real number, specifically approximately 4 times √2, which numerically equals about 5.656854..., consistent with the enumerated ratio.

The correct assignment should be a fixed real value (a number), not a function. The pattern in the incomplete answer suggests the conjectured closed form is a constant, not a function in `n`. Therefore, the answer should be simply a real number, not a function.

The typical pattern in Lean for defining such answers is to set the abbreviation directly to the constant. The exact value, as the approximate ratio, is `4 * Real.sqrt 2`.

Final corrected answer:
<<<4 * Real.sqrt 2>>>
