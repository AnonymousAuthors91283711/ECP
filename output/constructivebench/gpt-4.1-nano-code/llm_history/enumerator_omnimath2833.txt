The given problem involves a relationship between x and y: (x – y) / (x + y) = 5, with certain denominators not equal to zero. The goal is to find an expression or answer related to this setup, possibly involving functions of x and y.

To assist in conjecturing and verifying the answer, I will enumerate solutions satisfying the condition (x – y) / (x + y) = 5, while ensuring denominators are non-zero. I'll generate candidate pairs (x, y) that satisfy the equation and check their relation with the given denominators.

Since the problem appears to relate x and y via a linear ratio, I’ll choose small parametrizations, for example, setting y as a free parameter and solving for x, then check the additional denominators.

The code will:
- Fix a range of parameter values for y.
- Compute corresponding x.
- Check the conditions.
- Stream solutions that satisfy all constraints.

```python
# Enumerate pairs (x, y) where (x - y)/(x + y) = 5
# For arbitrary parameter y, x = y * (5 + 1) / (1 - 5) = y * 6 / (-4) = -1.5 * y

# We choose small y values to generate potential solutions
for y_int in range(-10, 11):
    y = y_int
    # Compute x based on the given ratio
    # (x - y) / (x + y) = 5 => x - y = 5(x + y) => x - y = 5x + 5y
    # => x - 5x = y + 5y => -4x = 6y => x = -1.5 y
    x = -1.5 * y

    # Check denominators
    if (x + y) != 0 and (3 * x - 2 * y) != 0:
        print(f"x = {x}, y = {y}")

        # Additional conjecture: evaluate an expression or answer related to these values
        # For demonstration, perhaps we conjecture that some function of x, y rather than hard-coded,
        # but since the problem asks to match the structure, just output these pairs.
```
