The problem appears to involve counting the number of problems (out of a total `problems`) that are solved by student 9, given some constraints on how many problems each student solves and how many students solve each problem. The constraints are:

- There are 10 students in total.
- For students numbered 0 to 8 (since `s < 9`), each solves exactly 4 out of the `problems`.
- For each problem `p`, exactly 7 students out of 10 solve it (i.e., `card (filter (fun s => solved s p) (range students)) = 7`).

The goal is to find how many problems student 9 solves, i.e., `card (filter (fun p => solved 9 p) (range problems))`, which is currently unknown (`omnimath1153_answer`).

A key combinatorial insight:

- Each of the first 9 students solves 4 problems, total of `9 * 4 = 36` "student-problem" solves.
- The total "student-problem" solves over all students and problems is `problems * 7` (since each problem is solved by 7 students), thus total solves = `problems * 7`.
- These total solves are partitioned into contributions from students 0..8 and student 9.

Let `x =` number of problems student 9 solves. Then:

Total solves across all students:
```
Total solves = 36 + x
```

But at the same time:
```
Total solves = problems * 7
```

So:
```
36 + x = problems * 7
```
and
```
x = problems * 7 - 36
```

Since the number of problems student 9 solves cannot be negative or exceed total problems:
- `x >= 0` implies `problems * 7 >= 36`
- `x <= problems` (since student 9 cannot solve more problems than total)

Given the constraints:
- `problems` must be at least `ceil(36/7) = 6` (because `7*5=35 <36`, need at least 6)
- At most, `x = problems` which implies `problems * 7 - 36 <= problems`
- Rearranged: `problems * 7 - problems <= 36` => `problems * (7 - 1) <=36` => `6 * problems <= 36` => `problems <= 6`

Thus, the only `problems` satisfying all is `problems=6`, giving:

`x = 6*7 - 36 = 42 -36 = 6`.

Hence, the student's solution count is `6`.

Since the total problems `problems=6`, and student 9 solves `6` problems, this matches the total counts.

I will write a Python enumeration to confirm these calculations explicitly and possibly explore other small values that satisfy the constraints.

```python
# Enumerate small problem counts and compute student 9's solutions
for problems in range(6, 30):
    total_solves = problems * 7
    # Student 0..8 total solves: 9 * 4 = 36
    # Student 9 solves: x = total_solves - 36
    x = total_solves - 36
    if 0 <= x <= problems:
        print(f"Problems: {problems}, Student 9 solves: {x}")
```
This code will list feasible numbers of problems and corresponding solutions for student 9, based on the constraints.
