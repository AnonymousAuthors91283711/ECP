The problem asks to sum over all permutations π of Fin 10, counting the number of triples (i, j, k) where their indices satisfy i.1 < j.1 < k.1 and the images under π satisfy π j < π k < π i. The goal is to find the total sum.

This is combinatorial: 
- There are C(10, 3) ways to choose (i, j, k) with increasing indices.
- For each such triple, we count the number of permutations where the images are in a particular order, i.e., decreasing order of π j, π k, π i.

Since permutations of 3 elements are 6, in the scenario with fixed indices, exactly 2 permutations correspond to the order π j < π k < π i, because out of all 6 permutations of the three images, exactly 2 satisfy this strict order.

Therefore, for each triple of indices, 2 permutations satisfy the condition.

Number of index triples with increasing indices: C(10,3) = 120.

Total sum = number of permutations (here, 10! permutations total), multiplied by the factor for each triple. But the sum is over permutations, and for each permutation, we count the number of triples satisfying the image condition.

However, since the sum sums over all permutations and, for each permutation, we count the number of triples satisfying the order, it simplifies to:

- Total permutations: 10! = 3,628,800
- For each permutation, number of triples with the specified order: 2
- Sum over all permutations: Number of permutations * number of triples satisfying the order for each permutation, i.e., 10! * 2.

But be cautious: The sum is over all permutations π, and for each π, count how many triples (i,j,k) satisfy the conditions with that particular π.

Thus, total sum = number of permutations (π) * number of triples satisfying the condition per π. Since for each π, the number of such triples depends on π's order, but because of symmetry, the total sum is:

- Sum over all π of the count of triples with the order π j < π k < π i.

Because permutations permute the images uniformly, and the conditions depend on the relative orderings, the total sum can be found by:

Number of permutations: 10!  
Number of possible triples of indices: C(10,3) =120  
Number of permutations of each triple's images: 6  
Number of permutations where the images are in the decreasing order π j < π k < π i: 1 (since only one out of six permutations gives one unique order).

In the total sum, each permutation is counted once, and for each, exactly 1 of the 6 orders of the images satisfies π j < π k < π i. 

Therefore, total sum = 10! * (number of triples) * (probability that random images for a triple are in the decreasing order) = 10! * C(10,3) * (1/6). 

Calculations:
- 10! = 3,628,800
- C(10,3) = 120
- Probability: 1/6

Total sum = 3,628,800 * 120 / 6 = 3,628,800 * 20 = 72,576,000

Now, as per the code, generate the enumeration.

```python
from math import comb, factorial

# Number of permutations of 10 elements
total_permutations = factorial(10)

# Number of index triples with increasing order
triples = comb(10, 3)

# For each triplet, exactly 1 out of 6 permutations of their images satisfies the strict order
# total sum over all permutations and all triples
answer = total_permutations * triples // 6

print(answer)
```
