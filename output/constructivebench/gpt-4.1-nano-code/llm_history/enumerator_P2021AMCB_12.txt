This problem involves analyzing a finite set S of natural numbers with known maximum and minimum, along with conditions on averages of various subsets. To assist in conjecturing the answer, the approach is to:

- Fix small sample parameters for the set size and the min/max.
- Generate possible sets S satisfying the constraints.
- Compute the sum and average to find the answer.
- Stream answers as they are found, prioritizing exact rational results.
- For efficiency, only generate candidate sets once parameters are fixed.

Note: The problem is theoretical, and a brute-force enumeration of all possible sets can be inefficient. Limiting to small ranges based on the constraints makes the enumeration manageable.

```python
from itertools import combinations

# Parameters: small range around expected min/max values
# To find candidate sets S, with size between 3 to 10 (small for enumeration)
# The constraints:
# maxS - minS = 72
# minS, maxS in S
# The averages of various subsets are fixed

minS_candidate = 0
maxS_candidate = 72  # Since maxS - minS = 72, and both are in S
set_size_range = range(3, 10)  # small sizes for enumeration
answer_found = False

for size in set_size_range:
    # Generate candidate sets with min and max fixed:
    for minS in range(minS_candidate, maxS_candidate - 71):
        maxS = minS + 72
        if maxS > 100:  # limit upper bound to keep search finite
            continue
        inside_range = range(minS, maxS + 1)
        # Ensure set size matches
        for subset in combinations(inside_range, size):
            S = set(subset)
            # Check if minS and maxS in S
            if minS not in S or maxS not in S:
                continue

# Note: The code only prints candidates when constraints are met.
