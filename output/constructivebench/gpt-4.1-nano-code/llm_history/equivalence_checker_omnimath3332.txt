<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is numerically equivalent to the ground truth answer, as it provides the exact decimal values of each term in the ground truth answer:
- 5^56 = 1387778780781445675529539585113525390625
- 31^28 = 572964121067545096123347421337293637543041
- 17^35 = 11633549665058175578832094238737833478284593
- 10^51 = 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

The order matches exactly, and the values are correct computations of each power.
