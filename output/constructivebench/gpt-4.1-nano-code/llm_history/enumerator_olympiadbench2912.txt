This problem asks for the number of natural numbers \( n \) between 1 and 24 inclusive, such that there are no integers \( a, b \) with \( n = a^2 - b^2 \). 

Recall, \( a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) \). The problem reduces to counting how many \( n \) in this range cannot be expressed as a product of two integers differing in parity, i.e., cannot be written as \( (a-b)(a+b) \). Since \( a \) and \( b \) are integers, \( a+b \) and \( a-b \) are both integers, with the same parity, hence their product's parity considerations determine representability.

- Even numbers are always representable because \( n = 2k \), divisible by 2, and typically can be factored suitably.
- The only numbers not representable as \( a^2 - b^2 \) are odd numbers that are not the difference of squares, particularly those congruent to 2 mod 4.

A key fact: A number \( n \) can be written as a difference of two squares iff \( n \neq 2 \) and \( n \not\equiv 2 \pmod 4 \). Within 1..24:

- Numbers \( n \equiv 2 \pmod 4 \): 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22 are NOT expressible as a difference of two squares.
- All other numbers in 1..24 are.

Counting those:

```python
# Count how many numbers in 1..24 cannot be expressed as a^2 - b^2
# These are exactly numbers where n â‰¡ 2 (mod 4): 2,6,10,14,18,22

non_expressible_numbers = [n for n in range(1, 25) if n % 4 == 2]
print(len(non_expressible_numbers))
```

This code enumerates candidates and counts those satisfying the condition.

```python
# Enumerate all n from 1 to 24 and identify those not a difference of squares
non_expressible_numbers = [n for n in range(1, 25) if n % 4 == 2]
for n in non_expressible_numbers:
    print(n)
print("Total:", len(non_expressible_numbers))
```
