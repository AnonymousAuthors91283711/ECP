abbrev omnimath3137_answer : â„• := sorry
theorem omnimath3137 : 
  (5 * (5 - 1)) + (4 * (4 - 1)) = omnimath3137_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 32
Proposed Answer: (5 * (5 - 1)) + (4 * (4 - 1))
Let's evaluate both expressions:

Ground Truth Answer: 32

Proposed Answer: (5 * (5 - 1)) + (4 * (4 - 1))
= (5 * 4) + (4 * 3)
= 20 + 12
= 32

The proposed answer is an expression that evaluates to 32, which matches the ground truth answer. While they are presented in different forms (one as a final number, the other as an expression), they are mathematically equivalent.
