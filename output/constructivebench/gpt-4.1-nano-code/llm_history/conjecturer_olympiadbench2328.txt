. Enumerated answers: d = -1.50 satisfies ratio condition: 0.25. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
Given the geometric sequence with initial value 10 and ratio 1/2, and the arithmetic sequence starting at 10 with difference d, the ratio (geometric_seq 6 / geometric_seq 4) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4, independent of d. The condition simplifies to 1/4 = arithmetic_seq 6 / arithmetic_seq 4, thus d satisfies `arithmetic_seq 6 / arithmetic_seq 4 = 1/4`. Since `arithmetic_seq 4 = 10 + 4d` and `arithmetic_seq 6 = 10 + 6d`, the ratio:

(10 + 6d)/(10 + 4d) = 1/4
=> 4(10 + 6d) = 10 + 4d
=> 40 + 24d = 10 + 4d
=> 30 + 20d = 0
=> 20d = -30
=> d = -3/2

Final answer: <<< {d | d = -3/2} >>>
