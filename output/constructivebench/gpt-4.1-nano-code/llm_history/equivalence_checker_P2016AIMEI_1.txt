Ground Truth Answer: 336
Proposed Answer: 4032
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves two infinite geometric series:
   - S₁ = ∑ aⁿ = 1/(1-a) (since |a|<1)
   - S₂ = ∑ (-a)ⁿ = 1/(1+a) (since |a|<1)

2. The given condition is S₁ * S₂ = 2016
   - (1/(1-a)) * (1/(1+a)) = 1/(1-a²) = 2016
   - Therefore, 1-a² = 1/2016 → a² = 2015/2016

3. We need to find S₁ + S₂:
   - 1/(1-a) + 1/(1+a) = (1+a + 1-a)/(1-a²) = 2/(1-a²) = 2*2016 = 4032

The ground truth answer is 336, but the correct calculation shows it should be 4032. The proposed answer matches our derivation.

<<<False>>>

Note: The ground truth answer appears to be incorrect based on the mathematical derivation, while the proposed answer is correct. Therefore, they are not equivalent.
