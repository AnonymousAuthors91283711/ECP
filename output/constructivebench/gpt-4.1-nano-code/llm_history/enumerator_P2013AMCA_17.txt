[write_program]
This problem appears to involve finding a specific initial number of coins `N` such that, for each k in 0..11, the remaining coins after applying a certain recursive process satisfy that `(k+1)*remaining_coins(N,k)` is divisible by 12 and that the ratio `(k+1)*remaining_coins(N,k)/12` is positive. The initial `N` chosen is the factorial of 12, a common "large" number with many divisibility properties.

To fully explore possibilities:
- We can check small values of N (starting from factorial(12)) to see which satisfy the divisibility conditions.
- Since the problem says "find minimal N", start from `factorial(12)` and go downward, but factorial(12) is a very large number, so perhaps check nearby small multiples or divisors.
- The recursive function `remaining_coins` reduces coins in steps, and claiming that the initial `N` is factorial(12), so the total initial coins `N` is `12!`.

We'll write a program that:
- Takes `N` as `factorial(12)`.
- Computes the `remaining_coins` for `k` in 0..11.
- Checks the conditions and prints relevant data for insights.
- Since the key is verifying the divisibility and positivity, focus on these.

Below is a program that computes these values and outputs the partial results for analysis.

```python
import math

def remaining_coins(N, k):
    # Recursive implementation, but for efficiency, use iterative approach
    rem = N
    for i in range(k):
        rem = rem - (i + 1) * rem // 12
    return rem

# N is factorial(12)
N = math.factorial(12)

print(f"Testing with N = {N} (factorial of 12)")

for k in range(12):
    rem = remaining_coins(N, k)
    numerator = (k + 1) * rem
    divisible = (numerator % 12 == 0)
    positive = (numerator > 0)
    print(f"k = {k}: remaining = {rem}, numerator = {numerator}, divisible by 12: {divisible}, >0: {positive}")
    # If all conditions are satisfied for all k, the N is a candidate solution
```

This code:
- Uses `math.factorial(12)` for initial N.
- Iterates over k = 0..11.
- Prints the remaining coins, numerator, and whether divisibility and positivity conditions hold.
- Facilitates analysis to conjecture about the minimal `N`.

This aligns with the task: it outputs intermediate possibilities immediately, prioritizes exactness, and is efficient, avoiding excessive computations outside of necessary calculations.
