The problem involves finding all polynomials \( P \in \mathbb{Z}[x] \) that satisfy a specific digit sum and evaluation condition for all sufficiently large \( n \geq 2016 \). It roughly states that for large \( n \), the polynomial evaluated at \( n \) must be positive, and the sum of the decimal digits of that evaluation must equal the value of the polynomial at the sum of the digits of \( n \).

To explore solutions, I focus on simple polynomial candidates, especially linear and constant polynomials, because the conditions suggest a certain regularity. 

- Constant polynomials generally satisfy the relations trivially if the constant matches the digit sum condition.
- Linear polynomials \( P(x) = a x + b \) might also satisfy the relation under some constraints, especially when the relation between the sum of digits and polynomial evaluations is linear.

The program enumerates all constant and linear polynomials with small integer coefficients and checks if the given property holds for a sample of large \( n \), say from 2016 to 2025, to infer possible solutions without full proof but to gather evidence.

```python
# Enumerate constant and linear polynomials with small coefficients
# Check the condition for n in [2016..2025]
# Print candidates that satisfy the condition for all tested n
def digit_sum(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

def eval_poly(p, x):
    return p[0] * x + p[1]

# Set a small range for coefficients
coeff_range = range(-10, 11)

solutions = []

for a in coeff_range:
    for b in coeff_range:
        P = (a, b)  # Polynomial coefficients: a*x + b
        satisfies = True
        for n in range(2016, 2026):
            val = eval_poly(P, n)
            if val <= 0:
                satisfies = False
                break
            s = digit_sum(val)
            s_n = digit_sum(n)
            s_eval = eval_poly(P, s_n)
            if s != s_eval:
                satisfies = False
                break
        if satisfies:
            print(f"Possible polynomial: P(x) = {a}x + {b}")
            solutions.append(P)

# For this sample enumeration, solutions are printed as found.
```
