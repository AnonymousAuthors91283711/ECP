This problem appears to involve a simple algebraic expression involving fractions and multiplication. To assist in conjecturing and verifying the answer, I'll write a Python script that evaluates the expression step-by-step, markets the result immediately, and ensures all possibilities are explored.

Since the expression is straightforward (`2 * (1/3) * 3 * (1/2)`), the simplest approach is to directly compute it and output the result.

Here's a Python program that evaluates the expression, streaming the partial results:

```python
# Streaming evaluation of the algebraic expression
# Expression: 2 * (1/3) * 3 * (1/2)

# Step 1: Compute 2 * (1/3)
part1 = 2 * (1/3)
print(f"2 * (1/3) = {part1}")

# Step 2: Multiply result by 3
part2 = part1 * 3
print(f"{part1} * 3 = {part2}")

# Step 3: Multiply by (1/2)
result = part2 * (1/2)
print(f"{part2} * (1/2) = {result}")

# Final answer
print(f"The value of the expression is {result}")
```

This will output each step immediately, helping to verify the actual value. The expected value simplifies to 1, but the script handles it step-by-step.
