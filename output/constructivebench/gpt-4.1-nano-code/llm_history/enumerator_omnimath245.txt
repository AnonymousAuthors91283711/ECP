This problem appears to involve finding all functions \(f: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}\) satisfying a given functional equation involving integers, with the goal of identifying the set of such functions. The functional equation is:

\[
x \neq 0 \Rightarrow x \cdot f(2f(y) - x) + y^2 \cdot f(2x - f(y)) = \frac{f(x)^2}{x} + f(yf(y))
\]

Given the complexity, a typical approach is to test specific integer inputs systematically, looking for patterns and potential solutions, especially for simple or linear functions, by enumerating possible small integer values.

The code below will only test a small, manageable subset of functions (like constant functions, linear functions with small coefficients, or simple transformations), check whether they satisfy the equation for a set of sample inputs, and output the ones that satisfy all tests. It will not attempt to solve symbolically but will instead *enumerate possibilities* in a brute-force but efficient way, printing candidates immediately when they satisfy the tested conditions.

Note: Due to the problem's symmetry and the nature of equations involving polynomials, solutions might include constant functions, linear functions, or specific simple transformations.

```python
# Enumerate candidate functions f: Z -> Z:
# We'll test constant functions and linear functions as simple cases.
# For constant functions f(x) = c
# For linear functions f(x) = a*x + b
# We'll test small integer coefficients over a small sample of inputs.

def test_constant(c):
    # For constant c, verify the equation for a few sample inputs
    test_values = [(1,1), (2,-1), (-1,2), (0,1)]  # include x=0 to test the domain, but note equation only for x â‰  0
    for x, y in test_values:
        if x == 0:
            continue
        lhs = x * c + y**2 * c
        rhs = (c**2)//x + c  # f(yf(y)) with y=f(y)=c
        if lhs != rhs:
            return False
    return True

def test_linear(a, b):
    # For linear f(x)=a*x + b, test same sample inputs
    def f(x): return a*x + b
    test_values = [(1,1), (2,-1), (-1,2)]
    for x, y in test_values:
        if x == 0:
            continue
        fx = f(x)
        fy = f(y)
        fyfy = f(fy)
        try:
            lhs = x * f(2*fy - x) + y**2 * f(2*x - fy)
            rhs = (fx**2)//x + fyfy
        except ZeroDivisionError:
            continue
        if lhs != rhs:
            return False
    return True

# Enumerate simple constant functions
for c in range(-3, 4):
    if test_constant(c):
        print(f"Constant function: f(x) = {c}")

# Enumerate linear functions with small coefficients
for a in range(-2, 3):
    for b in range(-2, 3):
        if test_linear(a, b):
            print(f"Linear function: f(x) = {a}*x + {b}")
