The problem appears to involve finding the maximum value of \( a + b \) under the constraint that for all \( x \in [-1, 1] \), the quadratic \( 2b x^2 + a x + 1 - b \geq 0 \). The theorem setup suggests optimization with an inequality constraint on quadratic forms.

To assist in conjecturing the maximum sum \( a + b \), we can analyze the boundary conditions where the quadratic touches zero (discriminant zero) at the endpoints \( x = -1 \) and \( x= 1 \), ensuring the quadratic remains nonnegative in the interval, often a key insight in such problems. By testing those boundary points and possible candidate pairs numerically, we can enumerate plausible solutions for \( (a, b) \) and hence for \( s = a + b \).

Here's an implementation that:
- Fixes small sample parameter values for \( b \), then solves for \( a \) at the boundary points.
- Checks the non-negativity constraint across the interval.
- Tracks the maximum value of \( a + b \).

This enumeration approach should help in conjecturing the extremal answer.

```python
import numpy as np

# Small range of b values to explore
b_values = np.linspace(-2, 2, 50)  # sample from -2 to 2

max_sum = -np.inf
max_candidates = []

for b in b_values:
    # For quadratic 2b x^2 + a x + (1 - b) >= 0 for all x in [-1,1]
    # At boundary points, quadratic should be >= 0, and possibly touch zero (discriminant zero)
    # We'll consider the quadratic at x = -1 and x = 1
    
    # Conditions at x=-1:
    # 2b (1) + a (-1) + (1 - b) >= 0
    # 2b - a + 1 - b >= 0 => (b + 1) - a >= 0 => a <= b + 1
    # At x=1:
    # 2b (1) + a (1) + (1 - b) >= 0
    # 2b + a + 1 - b >= 0 => (b + 1) + a >= 0 => a >= - (b + 1)
    
    # So for the quadratic to be >= 0 at endpoints (and possibly in interior),
    # a must satisfy:
    # - (b + 1) <= a <= b + 1
    
    # Check quadratic at x = Â±1 with these a bounds
    a_lower_bound = - (b + 1)
    a_upper_bound = b + 1
    
    # To maximize a + b, choose a at the upper bound within constraints
    a = a_upper_bound
    
    # Now verify the quadratic is >= 0 over the entire interval
    # The minimal value occurs at vertex or endpoints, but since quadratic opens upward (2b x^2, with 2b), depends on b
    # For b > 0, parabola opens upward, minimal at vertex; for b < 0, parabola opens downward, minimum at endpoints
    
    # Check vertex at x = -a/(4*2b) if 2b != 0
    if abs(2 * b) > 1e-8:
        vertex_x = -a / (4 * b)
        # Check if vertex_x in [-1, 1]
        if -1 <= vertex_x <= 1:
            val_at_vertex = 2 * b * vertex_x ** 2 + a * vertex_x + 1 - b
            if val_at_vertex < -1e-8:
                continue  # not valid
    else:
        # b==0 case
        # quadratic reduces to a x + 1 >= 0
        # minimal at endpoints
        if (2 * b * (-1) ** 2 + a * (-1) + 1 - b) < -1e-8:
            continue
        if (2 * b * 1 **2 + a * 1 + 1 - b) < -1e-8:
            continue
    
    s = a + b
    print(f"a: {a:.3f}, b: {b:.3f}, a+b: {s:.3f}")
    if s > max_sum:
        max_sum = s
        max_candidates = [(a, b, s)]
    elif abs(s - max_sum) < 1e-6:
        max_candidates.append((a, b, s))

# Output the maximum found sum
print("Possible maximum sum a + b values:")
for a, b, s in max_candidates:
    print(f"a: {a:.3f}, b: {b:.3f}, a+b: {s:.3f}")
