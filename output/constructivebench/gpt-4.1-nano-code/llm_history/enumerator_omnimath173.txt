This problem involves analyzing a given polynomial with integer coefficients and factoring over complex numbers, aiming to find all integer values of `k` for which the polynomial has roots with certain multiplicative propertiesâ€”in particular, having some pair multiply to -32. To assist in conjecture, we will brute-force parameter `k` over a reasonable range, factor the polynomial over the complexes, and check if any pairwise product among roots equals -32.

We choose small bounds for `k` (say, from -50 to 50) since the problem appears to involve polynomial roots with manageable sizes. For each candidate `k`, we construct the polynomial, factor it to find roots (numerically approximated), then check pairs for the specified product condition.

Here is the Python code:

```python
import numpy as np

# Range of k to test
k_min, k_max = -50, 50
# Polynomial coefficients: p(x) = 4x^3 - 18x^2 + kx + 200x - 1984
# Combined: 4x^4 - 18x^3 + (k + 200)x - 1984
# Polynomial degree 4: coefficients from highest degree to constant
def get_coeffs(k):
    return [4, -18, 0, k+200, -1984]

candidate_k_values = []

for k in range(k_min, k_max + 1):
    coeffs = get_coeffs(k)
    roots = np.roots(coeffs)
    # Check pairs for product -32
    found = False
    for i in range(len(roots)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(roots)):
            prod = roots[i]*roots[j]
            if np.isclose(prod, -32, atol=1e-6):
                # Found a pair with product close to -32
                print(f"k={k}: roots={roots}")
                candidate_k_values.append(k)
                found = True
                break
        if found:
            break

print("Possible k values where roots have pair multiply to -32:", candidate_k_values)
# Since the exact roots can be complicated, we approximate numerically
# Final answer (just for conjecture purposes)
if candidate_k_values:
    answer = min(candidate_k_values)
    print("Suggested k:", answer)
else:
    print("No candidate k found in range.")
```
