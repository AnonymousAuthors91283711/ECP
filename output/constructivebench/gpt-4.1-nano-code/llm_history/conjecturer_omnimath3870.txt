The pattern suggests a minimal subset where difference of squares divisible by 2004 for some a, b in S. Since 2004 factors as 4*501 and the problem pertains to differences a² - b², a key observation is that it is always divisible by 4 if a ≠ b mod 2, and divisibility by 501 (a prime factorization component) when certain parity conditions are met. The minimal n satisfying the property is when n = 1003, which overlays with the enumerated answers.

. Enumerated Answers: 1003. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The current definition `abbrev omnimath3870_answer : ℕ := sorry` is supposed to be a fixed natural number, not a function. The attempted function `fun n : ℕ => 1003` has a type mismatch: it yields a function type `(n : ℕ) → ℕ` rather than a simple `ℕ`. Since the problem is to find the *least* such `n`, and the enumerated answer is `1003`, the correct approach is to directly assign that number as the value of `omnimath3870_answer`. 

Thus, the fix is to replace the function with the fixed number `1003`. 

**Final answer:**

<<<1003>>>
