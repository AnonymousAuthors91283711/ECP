. Enumerated answers: 109. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Since p = q-1, q = r-1, r = s-1, with p + s = 109, then q + r = p + 2. Substituting p from p + s = 109 gives p + (p + 2) = 109, resulting in 2p + 2 = 109, so 2p = 107. Therefore, p = 53. Then, q = p + 1 = 54, r = q = 54, and q + r = 54 + 54 = 108. Final answer is 108.
