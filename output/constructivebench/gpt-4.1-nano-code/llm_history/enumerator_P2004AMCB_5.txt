The problem asks us to find a natural number \( d \) such that:
1. \( \frac{10 \times d}{7} - 60 = d \),
2. The digits of this number sum to 5.

The second part suggests that \( d \) is a natural number with a small digit sum. The first part simplifies to an algebraic equation, which can be turned into:

\[
\frac{10d}{7} - 60 = d \implies \frac{10d}{7} - d = 60
\]

Multiply both sides by 7:

\[
10d - 7d = 420 \implies 3d = 420 \implies d = 140
\]

This solution \( d = 140 \) should satisfy the equation:

\[
\frac{10 \times 140}{7} - 60 = 140
\]

Check:

\[
\frac{1400}{7} = 200
\]

\[
200 - 60 = 140
\]

which matches.

Now verify the digit sum:

\[
1 + 4 + 0 = 5
\]

which satisfies the digit sum condition.

Thus, the answer is 140.

```python
# Enumerate candidate numbers and verify conditions
for d in range(1, 300):
    if (10 * d) / 7 - 60 == d:
        print(d)
        # Check digit sum
        if sum(map(int, str(d))) == 5:
            print(f"Answer: {d}")
            break
```
