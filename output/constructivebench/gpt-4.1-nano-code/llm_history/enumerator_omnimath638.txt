The problem involves summing the sequence where each term is (k+1)^(25âˆ’k) for k from 0 to 24, and then defining a theorem equating this sum to some answer. The exact sum appears complex to compute directly by hand, so I will write a Python program to enumerate possible exact sums for small ranges or look for patterns. Since the sum involves exponents with decreasing powers, the dominant terms are those with small k. We'll generate all the summation terms for k in 0..24, then sum exact integers, aiming to find the total sum. This provides guidance for the proof.

```python
# Enumerate the terms for k in 0..24: (k+1)^(25 - k)
# Sum these exact integers to find the total sum
# We prioritize exact calculations here.

def main():
    total_sum = 0
    # Generate terms for k from 0 to 24
    for k in range(25):
        base = k + 1
        exponent = 25 - k
        term = base ** exponent
        print(f"k={k}: ({base})^{exponent} = {term}")
        total_sum += term
    print(f"Total sum for k=0..24: {total_sum}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
