The problem asks to determine the cardinality (number of solutions) for the set of triples \((x, y, n)\) with natural numbers such that \(x > 0\), \(y > 0\), \(n > 1\), and \(x^n - y^n = 2^{100}\).

Since \(x^n - y^n = 2^{100}\), and \(x, y, n > 1\), we can analyze the possible values by considering small cases for \(n\).

Key observations:
- For \(n\) large, \(x^n - y^n\) grows rapidly; thus, solutions are unlikely for large \(n\) because \(2^{100}\) is fixed.
- The difference \(x^n - y^n\) being a power of 2 suggests that \(x\) and \(y\) might be close, especially for small \(n\).

To efficiently explore solutions:
- Fix small \(n\) values starting from 2 upward.
- For each \(n\), try to find \(x, y\) such that \(x^n - y^n = 2^{100}\).
- Since \(x\) and \(y\) are positive, and \(x^n - y^n = 2^{100}\), we can rewrite as \(x^n = y^n + 2^{100}\).

Let's explore small \(n\), stopping when solutions become impossible due to size constraints.

```python
# Enumerate solutions for n from 2 to a reasonable upper bound
# considering growth of x^n and y^n and the fixed difference 2^100
import math

TARGET_DIFF = 2**100
solutions = []

for n in range(2, 20):  # upper bound arbitrary, real solution likely for small n
    # x^n = y^n + 2^100
    # For y >= 1, compute y^n, then check if y^n + 2^100 is a perfect n-th power
    max_y = int((TARGET_DIFF + 1) ** (1/n)) + 1  # guess upper limit for y
    for y in range(1, max_y):
        val = y**n + TARGET_DIFF
        x = int(round(val ** (1/n)))
        # Due to rounding, verify if x^n == val
        if x > 0 and x**n == val:
            solutions.append((x, y, n))
            print(f"Solution: x={x}, y={y}, n={n}")

# Output the total number of solutions found
print(f"Total solutions: {len(solutions)}")
```
