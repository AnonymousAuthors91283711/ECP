Ground Truth Answer: fun _ => 1/12
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => ↑n / 80
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum value of the sum ∑(x_j^4 - x_j^5) under constraints that all x_j are non-negative and sum to 1.

2. The ground truth answer suggests the maximum is always 1/12, regardless of n.

3. The proposed answer suggests the maximum is n/80, which grows linearly with n.

Key observations:
- For n=1, the ground truth gives 1/12 ≈ 0.083 while proposed gives 1/80 = 0.0125
- For n=2, ground truth remains 0.083 while proposed gives 0.025
- The values are clearly different and have different behavior with respect to n

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
1. The maximum doesn't grow with n - it's achieved when we concentrate all weight on one variable
2. The correct maximum is indeed 1/12 (achieved when one x_j=2/3 and others are 0)
