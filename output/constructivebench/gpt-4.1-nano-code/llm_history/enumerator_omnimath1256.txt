This problem asks us to find the least natural number n between 1000 and 2000 such that for every k in {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, n % k = 1. In other words, n leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by each number from 2 to 8.

Key observations:
- If n % k = 1 for all k in {2,...,8}, then n - 1 is divisible by all these k.
- Therefore, n - 1 is divisible by the least common multiple (LCM) of {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}.

Calculating the LCM:
- lcm(2,3,4,5,6,7,8)
- 2 and 4: max power of 2 is 8
- 3: prime 3
- 5: prime 5
- 6 = 2×3, already covered
- 7: prime 7
- 8 = 2^3, already included in 8

Thus, LCM = 2^3 × 3 × 5 × 7 = 8 × 3 × 5 × 7 = 8 × 3 × 35 = 8 × 105 = 840.

Since n - 1 is divisible by 840:
n = 840 * m + 1 for some integer m.

Find m such that:
1000 < n < 2000
=> 1000 < 840 * m + 1 < 2000
=> 999 < 840 * m < 1999
=> (999/840) < m < (1999/840)
=> 1.189... < m < 2.38...

Possible m values: m = 2 only.

Check m = 2:
n = 840 * 2 + 1 = 1681.

Is 1681 between 1000 and 2000? Yes. No other m within range.

Answer: n = 1681.

```python
# Program to confirm the minimal number n satisfying the conditions
# n = 840 * m + 1, with m = 2 based on the calculation above.

# Enumerate candidate m values in the range
MIN_M = 2
MAX_M = 3  # just to confirm only m=2 fits in range

for m in range(MIN_M, MAX_M):
    n = 840 * m + 1
    if 1000 < n < 2000:
        print(n)  # should print 1681
```
