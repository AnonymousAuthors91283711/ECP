The problem appears to specify a function \(f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) with certain properties:
- Monotonicity in the first argument,
- Symmetry \(f x y = f y x\),
- A specific zero-product condition involving differences,
- Shift property \(f(x + a, y + a) = f x y + a\).

This resembles a functional equation with symmetry, monotonicity, and shift-invariance, common in the study of functions like the identity plus constants or affine functions.

To enumerate potential solutions, I will:
- Fix small sample values for \(x, y, z, a\) (e.g., 0, 1, -1) to test candidate functions,
- Use the properties to hint at the form of \(f\),
- Output candidate functions that satisfy the constraints, considering linear forms and their variants.

Given the constraints, typical solutions might be affine functions like \(f x y = x + y\), \(x - y\), etc.

Here's a Python program that:
- Defines candidate functions,
- Checks the properties,
- Prints functions satisfying all conditions.

This approach streams the possible answers, focusing on simple, heuristic forms.

```python
# Enumerate simple candidate functions inspired by the properties:
# Monotonicity, symmetry, shift property, and the zero-product condition.
# Candidate forms considered:
# 1. f(x, y) = x + y
# 2. f(x, y) = min(x, y)
# 3. f(x, y) = max(x, y)
# 4. f(x, y) = x (constant in y), etc.

def check_properties(f):
    # Test symmetry
    for x in [0, 1, -1]:
        for y in [0, 1, -1]:
            if f(x, y) != f(y, x):
                return False
    # Test the zero-product condition for some triples
    test_values = [(0,1,2), (1, -1, 0), (2, 2, 1)]
    for x, y, z in test_values:
        lhs = (f(x, y) - f(y, z)) * (f(y, z) - f(z, x)) * (f(z, x) - f(x, y))
        if lhs != 0:
            return False
    # Test shift property
    for x, y, a in [(0, 1, 1), (1, -1, 2), (0.5, 1.5, 0.5)]:
        if f(x + a, y + a) != f(x, y) + a:
            return False
    # Test monotonicity in first argument
    # For fixed y, check if increasing x increases f
    for y in [0, 1, -1]:
        if not all(f(x1, y) <= f(x2, y) for x1, x2 in zip([0,1,-1], [1,2,0])):
            return False
    return True

# Candidate 1: f(x, y) = x + y
def f1(x, y):
    return x + y

# Candidate 2: f(x, y) = max(x, y)
def f2(x, y):
    return max(x, y)

# Candidate 3: f(x, y) = min(x, y)
def f3(x, y):
    return min(x, y)

# Candidate 4: constant in y, linear in x: f(x, y) = x + c, test c=0
def f4(x, y):
    return x

# Check and print candidate solutions
for idx, f in enumerate([f1, f2, f3, f4], start=1):
    if check_properties(f):
        print(f"Candidate {idx} matches all properties.")
        # Print the function definition
        if f is f1:
            print("f(x, y) = x + y")
        elif f is f2:
            print("f(x, y) = max(x, y)")
        elif f is f3:
            print("f(x, y) = min(x, y)")
        elif f is f4:
            print("f(x, y) = x")
```
This code streams potential functions and verifies whether they satisfy the properties, assisting in conjecturing solutions.
