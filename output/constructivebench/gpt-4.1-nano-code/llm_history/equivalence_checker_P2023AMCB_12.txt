Ground Truth Answer: 5 * Real.sqrt 2
Proposed Answer: 7.071
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer "7.071" is a decimal approximation of the ground truth answer "5 * Real.sqrt 2" (since √2 ≈ 1.4142 and 5*1.4142 ≈ 7.071). While numerically equivalent, the proposed answer lacks the exact symbolic form requested in mathematical proofs. The answers are equivalent in value but not in form.
