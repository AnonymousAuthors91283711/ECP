The problem appears to involve analyzing a set of integers \( k \) within the interval \([1, 4]\), and comparing two sums involving absolute differences with nested conditions. The goal is to find the greatest \( k \) that satisfies the inequality:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{4} \left( |i - k| + |i - n| \right) \leq \sum_{i=1}^{4} \left( |i - n| + |i - k| \right)
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{4} (|i - k| + |i - n|) \leq \sum_{i=1}^{4} (|i - n| + |i - k|)
\]

Since addition is commutative, the sums appear symmetric, but we need to check for specific \( n \) within \( [1, 4] \). The sums essentially are equal for all indices, so the inequality reduces to an equality condition for relevant \( k \).

Given the symmetry, the key question is: for each \( n \in \{1, 2, 3, 4\} \), what are the possible \( k \)â€™s? Also, because the sums are symmetric, the set of \( k \) satisfying the inequality will be all within \( [1, 4] \).

**Approach:**
- Evaluate for each \( n \).
- For each \( n \), check all \( k \in \{1, 2, 3, 4\} \) whether the inequality holds.
- Return the maximum \( k \) per \( n \).

Let's write the code now.

```python
# Enumerate all n, k in [1, 4] and evaluate the sums
def evaluate_inequality(n, k):
    total_left = sum(abs(i - k) + abs(i - n) for i in range(1, 5))
    total_right = sum(abs(i - n) + abs(i - k) for i in range(1, 5))
    return total_left <= total_right

# For each n in [1,4], find the maximum k satisfying the condition
for n in range(1, 5):
    candidates = []
    for k in range(1, 5):
        if evaluate_inequality(n, k):
            print(f"n={n}, k={k} satisfies the inequality.")
            candidates.append(k)
    if candidates:
        max_k = max(candidates)
        print(f"For n={n}, max k satisfying the inequality is {max_k}.")
    else:
        print(f"For n={n}, no k in [1,4] satisfies the inequality.")
```
