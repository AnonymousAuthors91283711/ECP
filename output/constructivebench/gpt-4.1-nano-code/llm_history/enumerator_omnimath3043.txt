This problem involves solving the equation \(4 + x = 14 - x\). To find all possible solutions (which should be a single solution in this case), I'll write a Python program that enumerates candidate values for \(x\) and checks the given equation. The program will verify the equality for each candidate and print solutions immediately upon discovery.

```python
# Enumerate possible integer solutions for the equation 4 + x = 14 - x
# Since the equation is linear, solutions are straightforward, but we do enumeration for demonstration.
# We pick a small range for possible x values to keep the search efficient.

for x in range(-20, 21):
    if 4 + x == 14 - x:
        print(f"x = {x}")
```
