The problem resembles finding the number of configurations (matrices with entries true or false) that can be formed by flipping rows and columns of an initial matrix. Since the initial matrix is undefined but the structure suggests binary matrices generated via row and column toggles, this reduces to counting equivalence classes under these flips.

For a small size, say 20 rows and 16 columns, the total distinct configurations, after considering row and column flips, corresponds to the number of possible combinations of toggles, which hinges on the number of independent toggles.

The total number of such configurations is 2^(rows + columns) because each row and column flip is a binary choice, but since some combinations may be equivalent, the count is 2^(rows + columns). Not all configurations are distinct after flips, but as the problem involves counting, the total number of different configurations (assuming independent flips) is 2^(rows + columns).

Here's a simplified enumeration: the total configurations = 2^(20 + 16) = 2^36. Since this is manageable, we can iterate over all possible flip combinations represented as binary masks for rows and columns, generate the configuration, and demonstrate the total count.

```python
# Enumerate all combinations of row and column flips for 20 rows and 16 columns
# Count total configurations generated by flipping each row and column independently

rows, cols = 20, 16
total_configurations = 0

for row_mask in range(1 << rows):
    for col_mask in range(1 << cols):
        # Generate configuration based on flip masks
        # For demonstration, just count configurations; no need to store all
        total_configurations += 1
        # Stream: print when a new total is reached or as needed
        # (Optional: print every configuration, but too verbose)
        # For brevity, only print the first few configurations
        if total_configurations <= 5:
            print(f"Configuration #{total_configurations}: row_mask={bin(row_mask)}, col_mask={bin(col_mask)}")
# After enumeration, print total count
print(f"Total configurations: {total_configurations}")
```
