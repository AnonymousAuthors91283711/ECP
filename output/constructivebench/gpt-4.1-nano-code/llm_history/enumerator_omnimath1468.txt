This problem appears to involve a probability scenario with two players, Daniel and Scott, where their probabilities of winning points are given as p = 3/5 and q = 2/5. The equation involves the expression p^2 / (1 - 2*p*q). Our goal is to find the value of this expression for the given probabilities.

We will write a Python script that:
- Defines p and q.
- Calculates the expression p^2 / (1 - 2*p*q).
- Prints the result immediately upon calculation.

Since the probabilities are specified explicitly and the expression is straightforward, the enumeration (just computing for the given values) suffices. To assist conjecture or verification, we can include small variations around the probabilities.

```python
# Enumerate probability variations around the given points for conjecture
p_values = [3/5, 0.6, 0.55, 0.65]
q_values = [2/5, 0.4, 0.45, 0.35]

for p in p_values:
    for q in q_values:
        denominator = 1 - 2 * p * q
        if abs(denominator) < 1e-8:
            # Avoid division by zero or very small denominators
            continue
        answer = p**2 / denominator
        print(f"p={p:.2f}, q={q:.2f} => expression={answer}")
```
