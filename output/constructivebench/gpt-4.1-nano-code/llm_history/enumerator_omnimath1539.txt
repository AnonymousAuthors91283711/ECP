The problem involves analyzing the sum of digits of \(2^n - 1\) in base 4, and checking if that sum equals 2023. To assist in conjecturing the answer, we'll programmatically compute the digit sums for small values of \(n\), record when the sum reaches 2023, and compare.

Given the large sum (2023), direct computation for large \(n\) might be needed, but for efficiency, I will limit \(n\) to a reasonable range (say up to 1000). We will also print each candidate sum as soon as it's computed, and identify if the sum reaches 2023.

```python
# Enumerate n, compute s = sum of base-4 digits of 2^n - 1,
# and check if s equals 2023.
# We'll limit n to 1..1000 for practicality.

def digit_sum_base4(x):
    total = 0
    while x > 0:
        total += x % 4
        x //=4
    return total

target_sum = 2023
limit = 1000
found_n = None

for n in range(1, limit + 1):
    value = 2 ** n - 1
    s = digit_sum_base4(value)
    print(f"n={n}, 2^n -1 = {value}, base-4 digit sum = {s}")
    if s == target_sum:
        print(f"Found n={n} with sum={s}")
        found_n = n
        break

if found_n is not None:
    print(f"n={found_n} yields the sum {target_sum}")
else:
    print(f"No n up to {limit} yields the sum {target_sum}")
```
