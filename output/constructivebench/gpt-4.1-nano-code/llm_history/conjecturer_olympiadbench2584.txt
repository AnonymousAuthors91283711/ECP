theorem olympiadbench2584 (x : ℝ) (hx1 : 2*x > 0) (hx2 : 2*x ≠ 1) (hx3 : 3*x > 0) (hx4 : 3*x ≠ 1) :
    Real.logb (2*x) (48 * (3)^(1/3)) = Real.logb (3*x) (162 * (2)^(1/3)) ↔ x = olympiadbench2584_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: x = 2.40 makes logs approximately equal: 2.701 ≈ 2.694
x = 2.50 makes logs approximately equal: 2.633 ≈ 2.640. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The logs are equal when the ratio of their arguments raised to respective powers matches the base ratio. Using the approximate values, the solution is near x = 5/2, satisfying the equality in the logarithmic expressions, given the approximate equality of logs at x=2.5. Thus, the exact x satisfying this condition is x = 5/2.

<<<(5/2)>>>
