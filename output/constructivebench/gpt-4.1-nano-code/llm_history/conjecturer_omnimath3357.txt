Solution: x=5, y=0. Expected Answer Type: Prop
Given the solutions, x ranges over integers from -5 to 5, and y over integers from -5 to 5, with the exception of (x,y) = (5,0). The pattern suggests all integers in that interval are solutions except (5,0). Thus, the proposition that covers all solutions is: "x ∈ [-5,5], y ∈ [-5,5], and (x,y) ≠ (5,0)."

<<< ∀ x y : ℤ, (-5 ≤ x ∧ x ≤ 5 ∧ -5 ≤ y ∧ y ≤ 5 ∧ (x, y) ≠ (5, 0)) >>>
