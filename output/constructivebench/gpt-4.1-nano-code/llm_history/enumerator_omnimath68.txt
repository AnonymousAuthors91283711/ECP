This problem appears to be about a specific constant associated with polynomials of degree n over integers, and their evaluations at integers a and b. The goal is to find a value `c` such that for all such polynomials, the minimal possible value of the ratio |f(a) - f(b)| / |a - b| is exactly that `c`. The theorem states that `c` is the supremum of this ratio, and that the supremum is attained precisely when `c = omnimath68_answer n`.

Given this, our interest is in whether this constant is related to leading coefficient bounds, polynomial degree, or the oscillation properties of integer-coefficient polynomials. 

### Approach:
- For small degree n, enumerate certain polynomials of that degree with integer coefficients, evaluate their ratios at pairs of integers, and record the minimal ratios.
- Record the supremum for each degree.
- Focus on small n (like 1, 2, 3, 4) to keep computations feasible.
- We will generate example polynomials, evaluate at pairs of integers within small bounds.
- Output candidate ratios as they are found, prioritizing exact ratios, then approximate.

Let's implement this:

```python
import itertools
import math

def enumerate_polynomials(degree, coeff_bound):
    # Generate integer coefficient polynomials of degree 'degree' with coefficients in [-coeff_bound, coeff_bound]
    return itertools.product(range(-coeff_bound, coeff_bound+1), repeat=degree+1)

def evaluate_poly(coeffs, x):
    # Evaluate polynomial at x
    return sum(c * x**i for i, c in enumerate(coeffs))

def find_min_ratio_for_degree(degree, coeff_bound=3, x_range=5):
    min_ratios = []
    polynomials = enumerate_polynomials(degree, coeff_bound)
    for coeffs in polynomials:
        # skip constant zero polynomial
        if all(c == 0 for c in coeffs):
            continue
        for a in range(-x_range, x_range+1):
            for b in range(-x_range, x_range+1):
                if a == b:
                    continue
                f_a = evaluate_poly(coeffs, a)
                f_b = evaluate_poly(coeffs, b)
                delta_x = a - b
                delta_f = f_a - f_b
                ratio = abs(delta_f) / abs(delta_x)
                # For exact ratios, print immediately
                print(f"Degree {degree}, Coeffs {coeffs}, a={a}, b={b}, ratio={ratio:.4f}")
                min_ratios.append(ratio)
    if min_ratios:
        c_sup = max(min_ratios)
        print(f"Estimated supremum ratio for degree {degree}: {c_sup:.4f}")
        return c_sup
    else:
        return 0

# Run for small degrees
for n in range(1, 5):
    c_estimate = find_min_ratio_for_degree(n)

# Conjecture: for degree 1, ratio ~1 (linear functions), for degree 2 or more, possibly increases.
```

**Note:** This code enumerates small integer polynomials of degree up to 3, evaluates their ratios at small integer points, and prints the ratios as found, helping to conjecture the exact supremum constants `c` for each degree.
