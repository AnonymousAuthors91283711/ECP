Total solutions: 8. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The consistent pattern suggests the solutions are given by pairs where x ranges over a certain set, with y values determined by the quadratic condition. The solution count is 8 across the set. Removing duplicates, the total solutions are 8. The value of 8 matches the total number of solutions, so the answer is 8.

<<<8>>>
