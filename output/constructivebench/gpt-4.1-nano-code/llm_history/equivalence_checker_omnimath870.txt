abbrev omnimath870_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath870 : 
  let total_outcomes := 6^4
  let favorable_outcomes := 4^4 - 3^4 - (5^4 - 4^4)
  favorable_outcomes / total_outcomes = omnimath870_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 175 / 1296
Proposed Answer: (5 / 18 : ℚ)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is calculating a probability where:
   - Total outcomes = 6^4 = 1296
   - Favorable outcomes = 4^4 - 3^4 - (5^4 - 4^4) = 256 - 81 - (625 - 256) = 256 - 81 - 369 = -194 (which seems incorrect)

2. The ground truth answer is 175/1296 ≈ 0.1350

3. The proposed answer is 5/18 ≈ 0.2778

The proposed answer (5/18) is significantly different from the ground truth (175/1296). The calculation of favorable outcomes seems incorrect in the problem statement, but regardless, the two given answers are not equivalent.
