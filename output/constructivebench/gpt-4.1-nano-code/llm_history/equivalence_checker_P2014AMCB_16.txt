Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: fun k : ℝ => 14 * k
Since the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's not provided), we cannot definitively compare it with the proposed answer of "fun k : ℝ => 14 * k". However, based on the problem statement and the given conditions, we can analyze whether the proposed answer makes sense.

Given:
1. P(0) = k
2. P(1) = 2k
3. P(-1) = 3k

We can model P as a quadratic polynomial (since we have three conditions): P(x) = ax² + bx + c

From P(0) = k: c = k
From P(1) = 2k: a + b + k = 2k ⇒ a + b = k
From P(-1) = 3k: a - b + k = 3k ⇒ a - b = 2k

Solving these:
a + b = k
a - b = 2k
Adding: 2a = 3k ⇒ a = 1.5k
Subtracting: 2b = -k ⇒ b = -0.5k

Thus P(x) = 1.5k x² - 0.5k x + k

Now compute P(2) + P(-2):
P(2) = 1.5k*4 - 0.5k*2 + k = 6k - k + k = 6k
P(-2) = 1.5k*4 - 0.5k*(-2) + k = 6k + k + k = 8k
P(2) + P(-2) = 6k + 8k = 14k

The proposed answer matches this calculation.
