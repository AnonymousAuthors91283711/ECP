The problem asks for the smallest number \( n \geq 100000 \) that is divisible by 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15, and then to find how much larger this number is than 100000 divided by 10. 

To approach this, we recognize that the smallest such number is the least common multiple (LCM) of these divisors, starting from 100000. The number we're seeking is \( 100000 + k \times 10 \), where \( k \) makes this number divisible by all the divisors. The minimal such number corresponds to the LCM of the divisors, shifted appropriately.

Let's compute the LCM of the numbers first, then adjust to find the minimal \( n \geq 100000 \) matching these divisibility conditions.

```python
from math import gcd

# Function to compute LCM of two numbers
def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

divisors = [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]

# Compute overall LCM
lcm_value = 1
for d in divisors:
    lcm_value = lcm(lcm_value, d)

# Determine the minimal n >= 100000 of form 100000 + k * 10 that is divisible by lcm_value
base = 100000
increment = 10
# Find the smallest k where base + k * 10 >= 100000 and divisible by lcm_value
k = (( (base + increment - 1) // increment) * increment - base) // increment
candidate = base + k * increment

# Adjust candidate to be divisible by lcm_value
remainder = (candidate - base) % lcm_value
if remainder != 0:
    candidate += (lcm_value - remainder)

# Compute the answer as the multiple k such that candidate = 100000 + k*10
answer = (candidate - 100000) // 10

print(answer)  # minimal k satisfying the condition
```
