The main issue is that the current answer includes a descriptive sentence rather than a proper formal expression in Lean. To represent the solution set set-theoretically, I should directly encode the set of solutions, which should be the singleton {6}, since 6 is the only real solution that satisfies the original equation after checking for extraneous roots.

The algebraic steps are:
- Start with the equation, isolate √(x - 2).
- Square both sides to obtain a quadratic.
- Find the roots of the quadratic: x = 6 and x = 10.
- Verify that only x=6 satisfies the original equation (by substituting back).
- Hence, the solution set is {6}.

In Lean, this set can be written as `{6}` specifically, or as `set.single 6`.

Given the enumeration in the problem, and to keep the answer formal, the proper answer expression is:

<<<{r | r = 6}>>

which defines the singleton set containing 6. Alternatively, `set.singleton 6` can be used, but `{r | r = 6}` is clearer and aligns with mathematical notation.

___

**Final answer:**

<<<{r | r = 6}>>>

**Explanation:** The set notation `{r | r = 6}` explicitly constructs the set containing only the element 6, solving the problem in a formal and type-correct way suitable for Lean.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The problem is to identify the set of real numbers \( r \) satisfying \( 2 + \sqrt{r - 2} = r - 2 \).

First, I analyze the equation:

\[
2 + \sqrt{r - 2} = r - 2
\]

Rearranged:

\[
\sqrt{r - 2} = r - 4
\]

Since the square root is non-negative, the right side must also be ≥ 0:

\[
r - 4 \ge 0 \implies r \ge 4
\]

Now, squaring both sides:

\[
r - 2 = (r - 4)^2
\]
\[
r - 2 = r^2 - 8r + 16
\]

Bring all to one side:

\[
0 = r^2 - 8r + 16 - r + 2 = r^2 - 9r + 18
\]

Quadratic:

\[
r^2 - 9r + 18 = 0
\]

Discriminant:

\[
81 - 4*1*18 = 81 - 72 = 9
\]

Solutions:

\[
r = \frac{9 \pm \sqrt{9}}{2} = \frac{9 \pm 3}{2}
\]

Thus:

\[
r = \frac{9 + 3}{2} = 6, \quad r = \frac{9 - 3}{2} = 3
\]

Recall the domain restriction \( r \ge 4 \), so only \( r = 6 \) satisfies the initial equation.

**In Lean, the set of solutions is therefore singleton containing 6.** The most straightforward set notation is `{r | r = 6}`.

---

**Final answer:**

<<<{r | r = 6}>>>

This set is the singleton set containing 6, matching the solution to the given equation with the domain restriction.
