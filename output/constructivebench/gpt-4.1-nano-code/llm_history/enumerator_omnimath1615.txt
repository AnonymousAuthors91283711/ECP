[write_program]
This problem appears to involve summing over roots of unity with specific properties and deducing an exact expression or value. The core challenge is to find the sum over k of 1/(1 + z^k + z^{2k}), where z^23 = 1 and z is not real (z.im â‰  0). The key ideas are:

- z is a primitive 23rd root of unity (since z^23 = 1 and z is nonreal).
- The sum involves roots of unity raised to powers k = 0, 1, ..., 22.
- We seek an elegant expression for the sum.

To help analyze this, I will write a Python program that:

- Enumerates roots of unity z on the complex unit circle for small sample values.
- For each root z, computes the sum over k of 1/(1 + z^k + z^{2k}).
- Checks if any symmetry or pattern emerges.
- Uses small sample values (e.g., N=7 or N=23) for roots of unity.

The program efficiently explores this sum over roots of unity with small N to generate conjecture-like outputs.

```python
import cmath
import math

# Function to generate Nth roots of unity
def roots_of_unity(N):
    return [cmath.exp(2j * math.pi * k / N) for k in range(N)]

# Function to compute the sum for a given root z
def sum_over_k(z, N):
    total = 0
    for k in range(N):
        denominator = 1 + z**k + z**(2 * k)
        # Avoid division by zero or very small denominators
        if abs(denominator) > 1e-12:
            total += 1 / denominator
        else:
            total += float('inf')  # Indicate a problematic case
    return total

# Explore roots of unity for small N=7 for simplicity
N = 7
roots = roots_of_unity(N)
results = []

for z in roots:
    s = sum_over_k(z, N)
    print(f"z = {z:.3f} + {z.imag:.3f}i, sum = {s}")
    results.append((z, s))
```
