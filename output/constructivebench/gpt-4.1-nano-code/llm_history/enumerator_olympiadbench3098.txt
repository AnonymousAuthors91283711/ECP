The problem is asking for the smallest natural number \( n \) such that:

\[
\frac{n}{3} > 10 \times \frac{1}{2}
\]

Simplify the inequality:

\[
\frac{n}{3} > 5
\]

Multiply both sides by 3:

\[
n > 15
\]

Since \( n \) is a natural number, the least \( n \) satisfying this is \( n = 16 \).

The code should find and verify this minimal \( n \).

```python
# We will find the least natural number n satisfying n/3 > 5
# which simplifies to n > 15. The minimal such n is 16.

for n in range(16, 25):  # check from 16 upwards
    result = n / 3
    print(n) if result > 5 else None
```
