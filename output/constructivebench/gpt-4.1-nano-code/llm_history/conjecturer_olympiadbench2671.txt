  IsLeast {b : ℕ | 1 < b ∧ Nat.Prime (1 * b + 6) ∧ ∃ k, k^2 = 9 * b + 7} olympiadbench2671_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 53. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests b = 53, and for this b, 1 * b + 6 = 59 which is prime, and the equation k^2 = 9b + 7 yields k^2 = 481. Since 481 = 13^2 + 12^2, the minimal such prime b satisfying the conditions is 53. 

Final answer: <<<53>>>
