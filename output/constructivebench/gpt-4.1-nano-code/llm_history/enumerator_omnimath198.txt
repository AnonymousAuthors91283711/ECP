The problem involves analyzing the function \( S \) defined as \( S(a,b,c,d,e) = (a+b)(b+c)(c+d)(d+e)(e+a) \) under the constraints:

- Each variable \( a, b, c, d, e \geq -1 \),
- The sum \( a + b + c + d + e = 5 \).

We are asked to find the possible range of \( S \) over all such variables (since the theorem involves \( S \)'s range) and to explore the extremal values. I will discretize the search space with small sample values for each variable, considering the bounds \(-1 \leq a,b,c,d,e \leq 4\) (since the sum is 5, and all are at least -1, the maximum for each when others are at minimum is roughly around 4).

The approach:

- Use a nested loop over plausible small integer values for each variable within \(-1\) to 4.
- For each combination, check the sum constraint.
- Compute \( S \) and record the minimum and maximum observed values.
- Print each \( S \) value immediately to stream the results.
- At the end, output the minimum and maximum found.

The code is written to be efficient within these bounds, avoiding unnecessary calculations.

```python
# Enumerate small integer candidates for variables a,b,c,d,e
min_val, max_val = -1, 4
min_s, max_s = None, None
extrema_values = []

for a in range(min_val, max_val + 1):
    for b in range(min_val, max_val + 1):
        for c in range(min_val, max_val + 1):
            for d in range(min_val, max_val + 1):
                for e in range(min_val, max_val + 1):
                    if a + b + c + d + e == 5:
                        S = (a + b) * (b + c) * (c + d) * (d + e) * (e + a)
                        print(S)
                        if min_s is None or S < min_s:
                            min_s = S
                        if max_s is None or S > max_s:
                            max_s = S
# After enumeration, print the extremal values
print(f"Minimum S: {min_s}")
print(f"Maximum S: {max_s}")
```
