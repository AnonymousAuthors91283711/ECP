The problem involves finding integers x, y, z, t > 0 satisfying the equation 

\[ 20^x + 14^{2y} = (x + 2y + z)^{z t} \]

and then modeling the solutions as a set in Lean. Since the exponents grow rapidly, a practical approach is to enumerate small values for x, y, z, t, and check if the equality holds exactly. We prioritize finding exact solutions, and since the structure involves exponential growth, using small ranges will efficiently list candidate solutions.

The program will:
- Choose small ranges for x, y, z, t.
- For each tuple, compute both sides.
- Check for exact equality.
- Print solutions as they're found.

This approach does not require input arguments and can be run directly. It limits the enumeration to keep output under 400 tokens.

```python
# Enumerate small ranges for x, y, z, t to find solutions
solutions = []

for x in range(1, 10):  # small x
    for y in range(1, 10):  # small y
        left = 20 ** x + 14 ** (2 * y)
        for z in range(1, 10):  # small z
            for t in range(1, 10):  # small t
                base = x + 2 * y + z
                right = base ** (z * t)
                if left == right:
                    print(f"Solution: x={x}, y={y}, z={z}, t={t}")
```
