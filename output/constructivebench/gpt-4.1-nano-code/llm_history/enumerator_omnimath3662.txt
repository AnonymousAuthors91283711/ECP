Let's analyze the problem carefully. We are given a function \(f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}\) satisfying:

\[
\forall x, y > 0, \quad f(x) + y \cdot f(f(x)) \leq x \cdot (1 + f(y))
\]

Our goal: Enumerate solutions \(f\) to this inequality for positive integers \(x, y\).

Given the problem structure, a good starting point is to consider simple candidate functions, such as constant functions or linear functions, and test whether they satisfy the inequality for small values. Since the solution involves an inequality constraining \(f\), and to find all such functions, we can enumerate small functions and see which satisfy the constraints.

Because the problem is at a high school level, we will focus on simple functions: constant functions and functions with small values.

We will:
- Fix small sample parameters for \(x, y\)
- Enumerate possible functions \(f \in \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}\) with small values for \(f(1), f(2), ..., f(5)\)
- Check the inequality for small \(x, y\)
- Print candidate functions that satisfy all tested inequalities

In the code, I'll restrict \(f(n)\) for \(n \leq 5\) to small values (from 0 to 10), and check the inequality for all small \(x, y\) (say 1 to 3).

This exploration will help in conjecturing candidate solutions.

```python
# Enumerate small functions f: {1,2,3,4,5} â†’ [0..10]
# Check the inequality for small x,y in {1,2,3}
# Print functions that satisfy all constraints

import itertools

max_value = 10
inputs = [1, 2, 3]
domain = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Generate all possible functions for the domain with values in 0..max_value
for values in itertools.product(range(max_value + 1), repeat=len(domain)):
    f = dict(zip(domain, values))
    # Check the inequality for all x, y
    valid = True
    for x in inputs:
        for y in inputs:
            if x > 0 and y > 0:
                f_x = f.get(x, max_value)  # Extend f to other x if needed
                f_y = f.get(y, max_value)
                f_fx = f.get(f_x, max_value)
                # Check inequality:
                left = f_x + y * f_fx
                right = x * (1 + f_y)
                if left > right:
                    valid = False
                    break
        if not valid:
            break
    if valid:
        # Print the candidate function
        print(f"Candidate f: {f}")
```
