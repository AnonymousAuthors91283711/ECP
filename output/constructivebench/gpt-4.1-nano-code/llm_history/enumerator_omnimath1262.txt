This code appears to be a formal statement in Lean, aiming to characterize the set of all real numbers \(a\) for which there exists a unique real number \(x\) satisfying a certain inequality involving a quadratic expression. The task is to emulate the enumeration and exploration of potential answers to assist in conjecture and proof.

The inequality in question is:
\[
|x^2 + 2 a x + 3 a| \leq 2
\]
which simplifies to analyzing the quadratic expression within the absolute value.

To explore the possible \(a\), we observe that for each fixed \(a\), there may be zero, one, or multiple solutions \(x\). We aim to identify all \(a\) for which exactly one \(x\) satisfies the inequality.

Since the problem is high-school level and involves quadratic inequalities, we can approach it by fixing sample \(a\) values in a small range, simplified, and checking if a unique solution exists for \(x\).

We will:
- Choose small sample \(a\) values.
- For each, check the solutions \(x\) of \( |x^2 + 2 a x + 3 a| = 2 \).
- For each \(a\), determine whether there is exactly one \(x\) solution satisfying the inequality.
- Collect all such \(a\) values.

Here's the code to enumerate such \(a\) candidates:

```python
import math

# Range of a to test; small sample covering key behavior
a_values = [i * 0.5 for i in range(-10, 11)]  # a from -5 to 5 in 0.5 steps
answers = []

for a in a_values:
    # The inequality |x^2 + 2a x + 3a| ≤ 2
    # The boundary occurs at |expression| = 2
    # So, solve x^2 + 2a x + (3a ± 2) = 0 for equality
    solutions = set()

    for b in [3 * a + 2, 3 * a - 2]:
        discriminant = (2 * a) ** 2 - 4 * 1 * b
        if discriminant < 0:
            continue  # no real solutions
        sqrt_d = math.sqrt(discriminant)
        x1 = (-2 * a + sqrt_d) / 2
        x2 = (-2 * a - sqrt_d) / 2
        solutions.update([x1, x2])

    # Count how many solutions satisfy the inequality (boundary points)
    count = 0
    for x in solutions:
        val = x ** 2 + 2 * a * x + 3 * a
        if abs(val) <= 2 + 1e-9:
            count += 1

    # Now check if there is exactly one such x
    if count == 1:
        answers.append(a)
        print(f"a = {a:.2f}, solutions: {solutions}")

print("Possible 'a' values with exactly one solution x:", answers)
```
