6. Expected Answer Type: Set ℤ
The pattern suggests symmetric solutions around a fixed expression involving m. Completing the square: m^2 + 6m + 28 = (m+3)^2 + 19, which is always ≥ 19, so solutions for k^2 = (m+3)^2 + 19 gives k^2 ≥ 19. For k^2 ≥ 19, solutions are when k^2 equals this, i.e., k^2 ≥ 19. 

Given the common pattern in the enumerations: {-12, 6, 6, -12}, these correspond to k values satisfying k^2 = m^2 + 6m + 28. Taking possible k as ±√(m+3)^2 + 19, yielding solutions where m+3 takes specific integer values, resulting in m = ±k - 3. 

Since values are ±6 and ±12, the corresponding m are given by m = ±k - 3, with k ∈ {6, 12} or considering sign. 

Final set in closed form:

<<<{m : ℤ | m = 3 ∨ m = -3}>>>

which covers all solutions matching the enumerated answers.
