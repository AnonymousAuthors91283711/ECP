  ∃ n : ℕ, n^2 = omnimath3422_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 16384. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
This pattern suggests the \( n^2 \) values follow the form \( k^{2k+1} \). For \( k=4 \), \( 4^{2*4+1} = 4^9 = 262144 \); for \( k=3 \), \( 3^7=2187 \); for \( k=5 \), \( 5^{11} = 48828125 \). Given the enumerated answer 16384 which is \( 2^{14} \), matching \( 2^{2*7} \), the clearest pattern is the answer being a perfect square of the form \( 2^{2k} \). Since the answer in the enumeration is 16384 \( = 2^{14} \), the square root is \( 2^7 \). Therefore, the final answer should be \( 2^7 \).
