abbrev omnimath3565_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath3565 (x : ℕ) :
    x ∈ omnimath3565_answer ↔ 2^x * (4 - x) = 2 * x + 4 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Solution: x = 0
Solution: x = 1
Solution: x = 2. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The equation is 2^x * (4 - x) = 2x + 4; testing x = 0,1,2 shows solutions. For x ≥ 3, the LHS grows faster than RHS, so no more solutions. The solutions are x in {0, 1, 2}.
