abbrev olympiadbench2510_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem olympiadbench2510 :
  let p (x : ℕ) := logb 100 (1 + 1 / x)
  let S := Finset.Icc 81 99
  ∑ x in S, p x = 2 * p olympiadbench2510_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 9
Proposed Answer: 81
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves summing logarithmic terms from x=81 to x=99 of the form logb 100 (1 + 1/x).

2. The ground truth answer is 9, meaning the equation holds when olympiadbench2510_answer = 9.

3. The proposed answer is 81, which is actually the starting point of the summation range (Finset.Icc 81 99).

4. The key observation is that the sum of these logarithmic terms telescopes to logb 100 (100/81), which equals logb 100 (100) - logb 100 (81) = 1 - logb 100 (81). 

5. The right side is 2 * logb 100 (1 + 1/9) = 2 * logb 100 (10/9) = logb 100 (100/81).

6. Therefore, the correct answer should make both sides equal, which happens when olympiadbench2510_answer = 9, not 81.

The proposed answer (81) is incorrect as it's just the starting point of the summation, not the solution to the equation.
