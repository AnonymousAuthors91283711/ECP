  omnimath775_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 1. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests N = a * (2a - 1), with constraints on divisibility for k in 1..10, and minimal N satisfying these. The minimal N occurs when a=1, giving N=1*(2*1-1)=1, but since the set requires N > 1, next consider a=2: N=2*(3)=6. Check divisibility conditions for N=6: divides all k∈1..10, as 6 divides (6*5)/2=15 (divisible by 3, 5), which suffices for minimal N > 1.

Thus, the least N that satisfies conditions is 6.

Answer: <<<6>>>
