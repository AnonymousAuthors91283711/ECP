Total count of valid bijections in sampled subset: 4. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests considering permutations that swap neighbors along the grid, factoring the conditions of adjacency and coprimality. The total such permutations seem to be 8, consistent with counting mappings that respect neighbor relations and coprimality constraints, often involving swaps along the edges.
