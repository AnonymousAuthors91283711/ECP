70. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The conditions imply that any subset B covering X with B ∪ image f B = X must have at least size 2. Since f is fixed point free and the union with image must cover X, minimal such B is size 2, as singleton sets cannot satisfy the union property. Therefore, the least such k is 2.
