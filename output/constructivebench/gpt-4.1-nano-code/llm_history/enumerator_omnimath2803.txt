This problem appears to be a math theorem statement involving real numbers `a` and `b`, with the condition `a = (2/3)*b` and `b ≠ 0`. The goal is to find the value of `(9*a + 8*b)/(6*a)` given these constraints.

The code suggests that `a = (2/3)*b`. Using this:

- Substitute `a` into the expression:
  \[
  \frac{9a + 8b}{6a}
  \]
- Replace `a` with `(2/3)b`:
  \[
  \frac{9 \times \frac{2}{3}b + 8b}{6 \times \frac{2}{3}b}
  \]
- Simplify numerator:
  \[
  9 \times \frac{2}{3}b = 9 \times \frac{2b}{3} = 3 \times 2b = 6b
  \]
  So numerator:
  \[
  6b + 8b = 14b
  \]
- Denominator:
  \[
  6 \times \frac{2}{3}b = 4b
  \]
- Final expression:
  \[
  \frac{14b}{4b} = \frac{14}{4} = \frac{7}{2}
  \]
  
Since `b ≠ 0`, the `b` cancels out, and the expression simplifies to `7/2`. 

Here's the Python program to verify this algebraically:

```python
# Verify the simplified value of the expression given the relation a = (2/3)*b
def compute_expression():
    # Let b be any nonzero real number; choose b=1 for simplicity
    b = 1
    a = (2/3) * b
    numerator = 9 * a + 8 * b
    denominator = 6 * a
    result = numerator / denominator
    print(result)

compute_expression()
```

This program computes the value of the expression with `b=1`, confirming the simplified answer `7/2`.
