theorem omnimath3401 (p : ℝ) (h : 0 ≤ p ∧ p ≤ 100) : 
  {q | q = 100 - p ∧ 0 ≤ q ∧ q ≤ 100} = {omnimath3401_answer p} := by sorry. Enumerated answers: p = 0, q = 100
p = 10, q = 90
p = 20, q = 80
p = 30, q = 70
p = 40, q = 60
p = 50, q = 50
p = 60, q = 40
p = 70, q = 30
p = 80, q = 20
p = 90, q = 10
p = 100, q = 0
. Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
The pattern clearly shows that q = 100 - p for each pair, matching the given examples. Thus, the answer is a simple function subtracting p from 100. 

<<<fun p => 100 - p>>>
