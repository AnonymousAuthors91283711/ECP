This problem appears to involve analyzing a function \(f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}\) with certain properties, particularly a scaling relation, a piecewise definition involving absolute value, and an equality at a specific point \(x=2001\). The goal is to determine the least \(x > 0\) satisfying these conditions or, more generally, to understand the structure of such \(f\), especially relating to the value at \(x=2001\).

Given the scale invariance condition \(f(3x) = 3f(x)\) and the piecewise form \(f(x)= 1 - |x-2|\) for \(x \in [1,3]\), we can attempt to:

- First consider the function on \([1,3]\).
- Then extend via the scaling relation \(f(3x) = 3f(x)\), which suggests a self-similar function pattern, possibly piecewise linear and scaled at powers of 3.
- Determine \(f(2001)\) by repeated application of the scaling relation, observing the pattern of how \(2001\) relates to the base interval \([1,3]\), and then locate candidate values.

Let's implement an approach that:

- Checks the base piecewise definition on \([1,3]\).
- Uses the scaling property to extend \(f\) to higher or lower ranges as needed.
- Finds the minimal positive \(x\) where the conditions hold, especially when \(x=2001\).

Because the problem involves infinity or large scales, and the primary value \(2001\) is large, we can iteratively relate \(2001\) to a value within \([1,3]\) by applying inverse scaling \(x \mapsto x/3^k\) and check if the related point satisfies the piecewise definition.

Here's the program to explore this:

```python
# Enumerate scaled values to understand how f behaves at 2001
# using the relation f(3x) = 3f(x), and the known f on [1,3]

def f_base(x):
    # Piecewise definition for x in [1,3]
    if 1 <= x <= 3:
        return 1 - abs(x - 2)
    else:
        return None

def get_f_at(x):
    # Use scaling relation to reduce x into [1,3]
    factor = 1
    while x > 3:
        x /= 3
        factor *= 3
    while x < 1:
        x *= 3
        factor /= 3
    # Now x should be in [1,3]
    val = f_base(x)
    if val is None:
        return None
    # f(x) scales such that f(3x)=3f(x), so original f(x) = f(x) * factor?
    # No, the relation is f(3x)=3f(x), so f(x)=f(x/3)*3 if x>3, and similarly downward.
    # Since we scaled x, we need to consider the scaling properly:
    # For inverse: f(x) = (1/3)^k * f(x * 3^k) when scaling down or up k times.
    # But the relation is f(3x)=3f(x), which implies:
    # f(x) = (1/3)^k * f(x * 3^k) for k such that x * 3^k in [1,3].
    # So, once scaled to [1,3], the original f(x) = (1/3)^k * f_scaled_x
    # But since at scaled x, f_scaled_x = f_base(x), which is defined.
    # Therefore, f(x) = (1/3)^k * f_base(x*3^k)
    # But in our implementation, we invert the scaling:
    # Let's store the number of scalings used and compute accordingly.
    return (1/3)**k * f_base(x * 3**k)

# Revise get_f_at to handle the combining of scales
def get_f_at(x):
    k = 0
    orig_x = x
    # Scale x to [1,3]
    while x > 3:
        x /= 3
        k += 1
    while x < 1:
        x *= 3
        k -= 1
    val = f_base(x)
    return (1/3) ** k * val

# Now compute f(2001)
x_target = 2001
f_value = get_f_at(x_target)

# Since the problem asks for the least positive x where the conditions hold,
# and the scaling relation must be satisfied, examine whether the minimal such x
# can be obtained from the inverse problem starting from x=2001.

# Additionally, check the possible minimal x considering the scaling property
# and the piecewise function on [1,3].

print(f"f({x_target}) â‰ˆ {f_value}")

# For conjecture, as the minimal x satisfying conditions involves the inverse scaling,
# the minimal positive solution is obtained by applying the inverse scaling to x=2001
# until it falls into [1,3], then evaluating the corresponding value.

# The core of the reasoning is complex; here, the answer is approximately:
print(f"The value at x=2001 is approximately: {f_value}")
```
