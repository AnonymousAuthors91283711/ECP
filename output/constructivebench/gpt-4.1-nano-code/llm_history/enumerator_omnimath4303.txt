The given problem appears to be a logical equivalence involving integers and a specific cubic equation. The statement asserts the non-existence of integers k, n such that \(k^3 = 3n^2 + 3n + 7\). To explore this, we will search for integer solutions, and determine whether solutions exist or not, by enumerating small integer values. We will do this efficiently by scanning a reasonable range around zero, since large values typically grow quickly and are less likely to satisfy the equation for small \(n, k\).

The approach:
- Enumerate small integers for n and k (e.g., from -20 to 20).
- Check whether \(k^3 = 3n^2 + 3n + 7\).
- For each solution found, print it immediately.
- After enumeration, decide whether solutions exist (if none, the statement is true).
- Print relevant findings to help confirm the original statement.

This helps in formulating a proof or conjecture about the non-existence of solutions.

```python
# Enumerate small values of n and k to check the cubic equation.
# We assume the range -20 to 20 for both variables for efficiency.
found_solutions = []

for n in range(-20, 21):
    for k in range(-20, 21):
        lhs = k ** 3
        rhs = 3 * n ** 2 + 3 * n + 7
        if lhs == rhs:
            print(f"Solution found: n={n}, k={k}")
            found_solutions.append((n, k))

if not found_solutions:
    print("No solutions found in the range. The statement likely holds universally.")
else:
    print(f"Solutions found: {found_solutions}")
```
