The problem involves calculating the relative difference in dollars between Etienne and Diana, given conversion rates and amounts. We need to determine the answer by explicitly enumerating potential answers for the ratio difference, and then choosing the value consistent with the calculations.

To facilitate this, I will compute the exact dollar amounts for Etienne, compare with Diana's, and then output the difference in a streaming manner.

```python
# Calculate Diana's dollars
diana_dollars = 500

# Convert Etienne's euros to dollars
euro_to_dollar = 1.3
etienne_euros = 400
etienne_dollars = etienne_euros * euro_to_dollar

# Compute the relative difference in dollars
difference = etienne_dollars - diana_dollars
relative_difference_ratio = 100 * difference / diana_dollars

# Output the ratio directly
print(relative_difference_ratio)
```
