Found candidate: b = -2.9999999999999893, c = -2.1316282072803006e-14
Found candidate: b = -2.9999999999999845, c = -6.572520305780927e-14
Candidates for (b, c):
b = -3.0, c = 0.0
b = -2.9999999999999845, c = -6.572520305780927e-14
b = -3.0, c = 0.0
b = -2.9999999999999893, c = -2.1316282072803006e-14
b = -2.9999999999999845, c = -6.572520305780927e-14. Expected Answer Type: ℝ × ℝ
Based on the pattern, the value of b approaches -3 and c approaches 0 as the candidates suggested, indicating the exact solution is at the limit. So, the explicit answer is given by the precise values: b = -3, c = 0.

<<<(-3, 0)>>>
