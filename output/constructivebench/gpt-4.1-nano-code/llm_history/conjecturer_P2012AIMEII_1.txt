Total solutions: 34. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern indicates solutions where m and n satisfy 20m + 12n = 2012 with positive integers. Factoring out 4, we get 5m + 3n = 503. The solutions correspond to the sequence where n = 1 + 5k, m = (503 - 3n)/5. For n in positive integers, valid when n ≡ 1 mod 5 and 503 - 3n divisible by 5. The number of solutions is the count of such n between 1 and 166, consistent with the enumeration. Total solutions = ⌊(503 - 3 * 1)/5⌋ = 33 + 1 = 34.

Thus, the answer sum over all solutions is 34. 

Final answer: 
<<<34>>>
