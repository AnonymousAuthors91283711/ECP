  (digits 10 P2012AMCB_14_answer.1).sum = P2012AMCB_14_answer.2 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n = 225, sum of digits = 9. Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ
The minimal n satisfying the conditions involves setting n so that 2·n·2·(2·n + 50) ≥ 1000, which leads to n ≥ 225. The sum of digits of n = 225 is 9. Therefore, the answer in closed form:

<<<(225, 9)>>>
