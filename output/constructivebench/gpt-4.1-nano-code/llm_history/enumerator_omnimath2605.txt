The problem involves an equation with square roots:  
\[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{x} + \sqrt{x - 2}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{x + 2} + \sqrt{x}} = \frac{1}{4} \]
for \( x \geq 2 \). To explore solutions, we'll test a small range of \( x \) values starting from 2 upwards, incrementing by small steps. We will evaluate both sides of the equation and look for matches or approximate solutions.

Since the question asks for potential solutions and is framed in a way that suggests conjecturing, we'll enumerate values efficiently and output candidate \( x \) where the equation approximately holds.

Here's the code:

```python
import math

# Set the range and step for x; starting from 2, up to 20 for demonstration
start_x = 2
end_x = 20
step = 0.01  # fine granularity

print("Enumerating values of x to find solutions to the equation:")
x = start_x
while x <= end_x:
    # Calculate the left side of the equation
    denom1 = math.sqrt(x) + math.sqrt(x - 2) if x > 2 else float('inf')
    denom2 = math.sqrt(x + 2) + math.sqrt(x)
    if denom1 == 0 or denom2 == 0:
        x += step
        continue
    left = 1 / denom1 + 1 / denom2
    # Check if close to 1/4
    if abs(left - 0.25) < 0.01:
        print(f"x = {x:.2f} gives roughly left = {left:.4f}")
    x += step
```
