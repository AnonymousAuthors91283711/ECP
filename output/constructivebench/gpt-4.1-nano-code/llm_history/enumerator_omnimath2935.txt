This problem involves finding the least natural number \( n \) such that \(\frac{1}{2} < \frac{n}{9}\). To determine \( n \), rearrange the inequality:

\[
\frac{1}{2} < \frac{n}{9} \implies n > \frac{9}{2} = 4.5
\]

Since \( n \) is a natural number, the smallest \( n \) satisfying this is 5.

Here's a Python program to verify this by enumerating candidate values:

```python
# Find the least n such that 1/2 < n/9
threshold = 0.5
denominator = 9
result = None

# Since n > 4.5, we start checking from 1 upwards (though we know from math it's 5)
for n in range(1, 20):
    if n / denominator > threshold:
        result = n
        print(n)
        break

# Also verify that n=4 does not satisfy the inequality
assert 4 / 9 <= 0.5, "n=4 should not satisfy the inequality"
assert result == 5, "The least n should be 5"
```

This program enumerates integers starting from 1, finds the first satisfying number, and confirms the answer. It also verifies that 4 does not satisfy the inequality, matching the mathematical reasoning.
