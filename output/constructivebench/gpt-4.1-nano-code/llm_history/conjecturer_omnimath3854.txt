. Expected Answer Type: Prop
The solutions are symmetric around zero with pairs involving ±5, ±4, ±3, and 0, forming coordinate pairs with a fixed sum magnitude or zero. The pattern suggests solutions where |x| + |y| = 5, with some zeros. Therefore, the Prop is that (x, y) satisfy |x| + |y| = 5.

<<<∀ x y : ℤ, (|x| + |y| = 5) → (x = -5 ∧ y = 0) ∨ (x = -4 ∧ y = -3) ∨ (x = -4 ∧ y = 3) ∨ (x = -3 ∧ y = -4) ∨ (x = -3 ∧ y = 4) ∨ (x = 0 ∧ y = -5) ∨ (x = 0 ∧ y = 5) ∨ (x = 3 ∧ y = -4) ∨ (x = 3 ∧ y = 4) ∨ (x = 4 ∧ y = -3) ∨ (x = 4 ∧ y = 3) ∨ (x = 5 ∧ y = 0)>>>

This describes exactly the set of solutions satisfying the given enumerated pairs.
