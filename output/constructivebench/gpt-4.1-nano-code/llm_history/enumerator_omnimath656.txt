This problem asks us to analyze the function \(f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty x^{2n}\), which is a geometric series with ratio \(x^2\). The sum converges when \(|x| < 1\), and in that case,

\[
f(x) = \frac{1}{1 - x^2}.
\]

We need to find the cardinality of the set of solutions to \(f(x) = x\), i.e., the solutions to:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - x^2} = x,
\]

or equivalently,

\[
x(1 - x^2) = 1,
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
x - x^3 = 1,
\]
\[
x^3 - x + 1 = 0.
\]

We're asked to find the cardinality of the solution set for the function over all real numbers. Since \(f(x) = \frac{1}{1 - x^2}\) only makes sense for \(|x|<1\), solutions must be in \((-1,1)\).

Let's analyze the cubic \(x^3 - x + 1 = 0\).

**Key points:**

- Continuous function \(g(x) = x^3 - x + 1\).
- Derivative \(g'(x) = 3x^2 - 1\).
- \(g'(x)=0 \Rightarrow x=\pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\).

Evaluate \(g\) at critical points:

- \(g(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}) = (\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}})^3 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} + 1\).
  - \((\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}})^3 = \frac{1}{3\sqrt{3}}\).
  - \(g(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}) = \frac{1}{3\sqrt{3}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} + 1 = \frac{1}{3\sqrt{3}} - \frac{3}{3\sqrt{3}} + 1 = -\frac{2}{3\sqrt{3}} + 1 \approx 0.693\).

- \(g(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}) = -\frac{1}{3\sqrt{3}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} + 1 = \frac{2}{3\sqrt{3}} + 1 \approx 1.231\).

Since \(g(x)\) is cubic, continuous, and the values at critical points are positive, and \(g(-\infty) \to -\infty\), \(g(\infty) \to \infty\), the cubic crosses zero exactly once in the real line, and the nature of the roots shows there's only one real root.

Now, check if the root is within the interval \((-1,1)\):

- At \(x=-1\): \(g(-1) = -1 + 1 + 1=1>0\).
- At \(x=0\): \(g(0)=1>0\).
- At \(x=1\): \(g(1)=1 - 1 + 1=1>0\).

Since \(g(x)\) is negative somewhere less than \(-1\) (e.g., at \(-2\) it's \(-8+2+1=-5<0\)), the only real root is the one we found inside \((-1,1)\). But checking intermediate points:

- \(g(-0.5) = -0.125 + 0.5 + 1=1.375>0\),
- At \(x=-2\): \(g(-2) = -8 + 2 + 1=-5<0\).

Thus, the real root is between \(-2\) and \(-1\), which is outside \((-1,1)\). Therefore, no solution to \(f(x)=x\) exists within the domain of the series sum (\(|x|<1\)). But the equation itself has one real root (outside the domain), which we must check.

Further, the only solution to the cubic is approximately:

\[
x \approx -1.3247
\]
which is outside \((-1,1)\).

**Conclusion:**

Within the interval \((-1,1)\), the solutions to \(f(x)=x\) do not exist. So the set of solutions inside the domain for the sum is empty, leading to a set with zero elements.

But considering the entire real line, there is exactly 1 real solution, outside the domain. Given the problem's context, likely the count of solutions constrained to where the sum converges is 0.

# Filter solutions within (-1,1)
solutions_in_domain = [sol for sol in solutions if -1 < float(sol) < 1]

# Output the count
