This problem involves identifying the maximum possible number of roots \( n \) for which a certain polynomial can be factored in a specified form, where roots \( x_i \) lie strictly between 0 and 1, are distinct, and the polynomial has degree 2022 with leading coefficient 1.

Key observations:
- The polynomial is expressed as a product involving roots \( x_i \) and multiplicity for root at 1.
- Roots \( x_i \) are in \( (0, 1) \), and all roots are distinct.
- The degree is fixed at 2022.
- The polynomial is monic (leading coefficient 1).

To find the maximum \( n \):
- The roots \( x_i \) can be chosen in \( (0,1) \), distinct, and the total number of roots \( n \) can vary.
- The polynomial defines a factorization involving roots \( x_i \) and the root at 1 raised to the power \( 2022 - n \).

Constraints:
- The roots \( x_i \) must be within \( (0, 1) \).
- When \( n \) approaches 2022, the remaining roots at 1 approach zero, potentially limiting \( n \).

Because the roots are in \( (0,1) \):
- The maximum number of roots less than 1 and greater than 0 is potentially 2022, if all the roots \( x_i \) are distinct and in \( (0, 1) \).

Thus, the maximal \( n \) is likely 2022, with all roots \( x_i \) in \( (0, 1) \).

**Enumerated reasoning:**
- For each \( n \) from 1 up to 2022, we can pick roots \( x_i \) in \( (0, 1) \),
- A natural candidate is to distribute roots evenly (e.g., at \( \frac{1}{n+1}, \frac{2}{n+1}, \dots, \frac{n}{n+1} \)),
- When \( n = 2022 \), roots at \( \frac{k}{2023} \), for \( k=1,2,...,2022 \).

We will enumerate these configurations for \( n=2022 \).

Here's a program that explicitly iterates over possible \( n \), selects roots \( x_i \) evenly spaced in \( (0, 1) \), and outputs a candidate factorization structure for maximum \( n \). It explicitly prints the number of roots and the roots chosen. For efficiency, only for the maximal \( n=2022 \), as it demonstrates the upper bound.

```python
# Enumerate roots from 1 to 2022, evenly spaced in (0,1)
# For max n (2022), roots are at k/2023 for k=1..2022
# No other roots are at 1 in this candidate, thus degree is n=2022

max_n = 2022
roots = [k / (max_n + 1) for k in range(1, max_n + 1)]
print(f"Number of roots n = {max_n}")
print("Roots x_i in (0,1):")
for x in roots:
    print(f"x = {x}")
print("Factorization candidate:")
print(f"(X - C({roots[0]})) * (X - C({roots[1]})) * ... * (X - C({roots[-1]}))")
```
