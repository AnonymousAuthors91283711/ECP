theorem omnimath1799 :
  let Ω := Fin 6 → Fin 6 -- All possible dice roll sequences
  let X (d : Ω) := card {i : Fin 5 | d i = d 5} -- Number of first 5 dice matching the 6th
  -- Expectation over uniform distribution
  (∑ d : Ω in univ, X d) / (6^6 : ℚ) = omnimath1799_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 0.8333333333333334. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
<<<5/6>>>

The expected value is the probability each of the first five dice matches the sixth, averaged over all sequences, which is 5/6.
