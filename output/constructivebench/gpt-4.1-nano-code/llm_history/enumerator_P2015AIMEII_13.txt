The problem involves summing sine values over a range and counting how many of these sums are negative for various lengths. To assist in conjecturing the answer, I will write a Python script that computes the sum of sin(k+1) for k from 0 up to a certain limit, and counts how many are negative. Since sine oscillates, we need to examine enough terms to find the pattern or the threshold where the count of negative sums reaches 100. We'll test increasing values, track counts, and print the specific point where the count hits 100, which will help in conjecture.

```python
import math

# Define the maximum number of terms to check
max_terms = 2000  # Adjust as needed for sufficient coverage
threshold = 100

# Store partial sums of sin(k+1)
a = 0.0
# Store how many sums are negative for each length
neg_counts = []

for n in range(max_terms + 1):
    if n > 0:
        a += math.sin(n)
    # Count how many of the previous sums are negative
    count_neg = sum(1 for k in range(n) if sum(math.sin(i+1) for i in range(k+1)) < 0)
    neg_counts.append(count_neg)
    # If count reaches threshold, print and stop
    if count_neg == threshold:
        print(f"At n={n}, count of negative partial sums={count_neg}")
        break
```
