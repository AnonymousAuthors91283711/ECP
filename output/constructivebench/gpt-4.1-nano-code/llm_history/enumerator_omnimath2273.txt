This problem appears to be modeling a probability related to a deck of cards. Specifically, it involves counting pairs of some kind of labels, where cards are grouped into certain counts, and calculating the ratio of "same label" pairs to total pairs, which resembles the probability that two randomly drawn cards share the same label.

To enumerate possible answers, I'll:
- Generate all possible label counts based on the given counts (4 for first 12 labels, 2 for the 13th).
- Use these counts to compute the number of pairs with the same label.
- Sum these counts and divide by the total pairs to produce a probability.
- To keep the computation efficient, only generate this specific scenario directly, rather than exploring multiple variations.

Here is a Python program that enumerates the probability based on this model, streaming answers as it computes:

```python
# Enumerate the probability of drawing two cards with the same label
# based on specified counts in the deck.
# Map labels to counts: 12 labels with 4 each, 1 label with 2.
label_counts = [4]*12 + [2]
total_cards = sum(label_counts)
total_pairs = total_cards * (total_cards - 1) // 2

# Compute the number of same-label pairs
same_label_pairs = 0
for count in label_counts:
    same_label_pairs += count * (count - 1) // 2

# Calculate probability as a floating-point, then output exact fraction
from fractions import Fraction
prob = Fraction(same_label_pairs, total_pairs)

# Print the answer immediately
print(prob)
```
