This problem appears to involve analyzing the set of pairs `(c, d)` with integer coordinates, subject to certain conditions, and counting the number of such pairs. Specifically, the set consists of those pairs `(c, d)` where:

- `c ≠ 0` and `d ≠ 0`
- There exists an integer `x` such that `c * x = d` and `d * x = c`

From these conditions, we are asked to find the cardinality of this set.

Let's analyze the conditions:

1. `c * x = d`
2. `d * x = c`

From the first: `d = c * x`

Substitute into the second: `d * x = c` becomes `(c * x) * x = c` → `c * x^2 = c`

If `c ≠ 0`, then dividing both sides by `c`: `x^2 = 1` → `x = ±1`

- If `x = 1`, then `d = c * 1 = c`
- If `x = -1`, then `d = c * (-1) = -c`

So, for any non-zero integer `c`, the pair `(c, d)` satisfies the conditions if:

- `d = c`, or
- `d = -c`

Given that, the set consists of pairs `(c, c)` and `(c, -c)` with `c ≠ 0`.

Counting such pairs:

- For each integer `c` ≠ 0, there are two pairs: `(c, c)` and `(c, -c)`.
- Since `c` ranges over all non-zero integers, the total set is countably infinite with two elements per integer.

Therefore, the set's cardinality is countably infinite. In Lean, the `ncard` of this set would be ℵ₀ (countably infinite).

As the answer requested is a natural number, and we only can approximate or express the cardinality, perhaps the code outputs the cardinality as `∞` or some representation.

Here's an implementation that enumerates over small `c` and `d` pairs matching the conditions, and counts the total, demonstrating the infinite nature by enumerating a fixed number of terms.

```python
# Enumerate pairs (c, d) with c, d != 0 where d = c or d = -c
# and c over a small range to demonstrate the pattern, e.g., c in [-10, 10]

limit = 10
answers = set()

for c in range(-limit, limit + 1):
    if c == 0:
        continue
    for d in [c, -c]:
        answers.add((c, d))
        print(f"Pair: ({c}, {d})")  # Literal pairs matching the condition

# Since the pattern is infinite, cc is infinite, but here we demonstrate finite enumeration
# The total count in this range is 2 * (limit)
print(f"Total pairs in sample range: {2 * limit}")
print("Cardinality is countably infinite (ℵ₀).")
```
