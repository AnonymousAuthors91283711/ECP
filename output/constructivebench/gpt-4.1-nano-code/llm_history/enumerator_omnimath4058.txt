This problem involves exploring sequences \( n: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \) with constraints \( n(k) \geq 1 \), and examining the product of certain powers of sequence elements involving modular indexing. The key expression is:

\[
\prod_{i=0}^{2021} \left[ n(i+1)^{2020} + n( (i+2) \bmod 2022 + 1)^{2019} \right]
\]

which simplifies for potential analysis.

To investigate possible answers (particularly the product), a practical approach is to consider small constant sequences to generate potential products. Given the large exponents, to keep computations manageable, we test small uniform values for \( n(k) \).

```python
# Approximate searches for the product expression with small constant sequences
# n(k) = c for all k, with c from 1 to 3 to limit computation
# For each c, compute the product and output the result

import math

# Parameters
sequence_length = 2022
c_values = [1, 2, 3]
answers = set()

for c in c_values:
    total_product = 1
    # Since all n(k) = c, each term = c^{2020} + c^{2019}
    term = c**2020 + c**2019
    # Total product
    total_product = term ** sequence_length
    print(f"Constant sequence n(k) = {c}")
    print(f"Term: {term}")
    print(f"Product: {total_product}\n")
    answers.add(total_product)

# Also consider the case when n(k) = 1 for all k (minimal sequence)
# to examine the smallest possible product
minimal_term = 1**2020 + 1**2019
minimal_product = minimal_term ** sequence_length
print("Constant sequence n(k) = 1")
print(f"Term: {minimal_term}")
print(f"Product: {minimal_product}\n")
answers.add(minimal_product)

# For further exploration, if needed, consider small non-constant sequences.
# But here, we limit to constant sequences for simplicity and efficiency.
