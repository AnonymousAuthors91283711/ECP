The problem involves deducing the value of \( x \) such that the sequence of logs is an arithmetic sequence. Given the sequence:  
\[ \left[\log_{12}(162), \ \log_{12}(x), \ \log_{12}(y), \ \log_{12}(z), \ \log_{12}(1250)\right] \]  
and that these form an arithmetic sequence, we can derive the relation between \( x \) and the other knowns by exploiting the property of arithmetic sequences: the difference between consecutive terms is constant.

Since the logs are in an arithmetic sequence,  
\[ \log_{12}(x) = \frac{\log_{12}(162) + \log_{12}(y)}{2} \]
and similarly, the entire sequence satisfies:  
\[ \log_{12}(1250) - \log_{12}(z) = \log_{12}(z) - \log_{12}(y) = \log_{12}(y) - \log_{12}(x) = \log_{12}(x) - \log_{12}(162) \]

From the extreme terms, the common difference \( d \) can be identified as  
\[ d = \frac{\log_{12}(1250) - \log_{12}(162)}{4} \]

Using this, we can explicitly compute the missing term \( \log_{12}(x) \) as  
\[ \log_{12}(x) = \log_{12}(162) + d \]

Next, to get \( x \), invert the logarithm:  
\[ x = 12^{\log_{12}(x)} \]

Let's implement this calculation in Python:

```python
import math

# Known values
log_12_162 = math.log(162, 12)
log_12_1250 = math.log(1250, 12)

# Number of differences (sequence length - 1)
n_diff = 4

# Calculate the common difference
diff = (log_12_1250 - log_12_162) / n_diff

# Calculate log_12(x)
log_12_x = log_12_162 + diff

# Compute x
x = 12 ** log_12_x

print(f"X that makes sequence an arithmetic sequence: {x}")
```

This code computes the value of \( x \) precisely based on the logarithmic relationships.  
To ensure coverage, you can similarly verify that \( y \) and \( z \) follow the sequence if needed.
