The given code snippet is a Lean theorem with placeholders and an import statement for Mathlib. To assist in conjecturing and proving the answer, we can write a Python script that computes the expression `(2018 - 18 + 20) / 2`, and outputs the exact (rational) result. Since it's straightforward, we do not need extensive enumeration. We just output the computed answer immediately.

Also, to match the style, we will print the exact value, which is a rational number in decimal form. The value of `(2018 - 18 + 20) / 2` is `(2018 - 18 + 20) / 2 = (2018 + 2) / 2 = 2040 / 2 = 1020`.

Here's the code:
```python
# Compute the value of the expression and print the answer to assist in proof
value = (2018 - 18 + 20) / 2
print(f"omnimath2969_answer : ‚Ñù := {value}")
```
