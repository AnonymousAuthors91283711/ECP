theorem olympiadbench2313 (a b : ℤ) :
    (∀ x, (fun x => x^2 - x + 2) ((fun x => a * x + b) x) = 9 * x^2 - 3 * x + 2) ↔ (a, b) ∈ olympiadbench2313_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: (3, 0)
(-3, 1). Expected Answer Type: Set (ℤ × ℤ)
The given equations imply solutions for the linear transformation \(a x + b\) such that the quadratic identity holds for all x. Comparing coefficients, \(a x + b\) must produce a quadratic of form \(9 x^2 - 3 x + 2\) under substitution. This restricts \((a, b)\) to satisfy specific conditions. Based on the pattern and enumeration, the pair \((a, b)\) are \((3,0)\) and \((-3, 1)\). The set of all such solutions is therefore precisely those pairs.
