This problem appears to be about finding the value of a function `f` at `2^100` under certain recursive conditions: starting with `f(1) = 1` and the relation `f(2*n) = n * f(n)` for all `n`. The code suggests we need to determine `f(2^100)`.

Let's analyze the recurrence: 

- `f(2*n) = n * f(n)`
- `f(1) = 1`

From this, we can try to compute small values to identify a pattern:

- `f(1) = 1`
- `f(2) = 1 * f(1) = 1`
- `f(4) = 2 * f(2) = 2 * 1 = 2`
- `f(8) = 4 * f(4) = 4 * 2 = 8`
- `f(16) = 8 * f(8) = 8 * 8 = 64`
- `f(32) = 16 * f(16) = 16 * 64 = 1024`

Looking at these:

| n   | f(n)             |
|-----|------------------|
| 1   | 1                |
| 2   | 1                |
| 4   | 2                |
| 8   | 8                |
| 16  | 64               |
| 32  | 1024             |

Notice the pattern at powers of 2:

- `f(2^1) = 1`
- `f(2^2) = 2^(2-1) = 2^1 = 2`
- `f(2^3) = 2^{3-1} = 2^2 = 4` (but we got `8` above, so let's check again)

It seems calculations may be inconsistent; better to formalize the relation:

- When `n` is a power of two, say `n = 2^k`, then:

`f(2^k) = (2^{k-1}) * f(2^{k-1})`

Further, because `f(1) = 1`, we can write:

- `f(2^k) = (2^{k-1}) * f(2^{k-1})`

Recursively:

- `f(2^k) = (2^{k-1}) * (2^{k-2}) * f(2^{k-2})`

And so on:

- `f(2^k) = (2^{k-1}) * (2^{k-2}) * ... * (2^0) * f(2^0)`

As `f(1) = 1`, and `2^0=1`, starting from the base:

- `f(2^k) = Π_{i=0}^{k-1} 2^{i} * f(1)`

- `f(2^k) = Π_{i=0}^{k-1} 2^{i} = 2^{Σ_{i=0}^{k-1} i} = 2^{(k-1)k/2}`

Thus, for `n=2^k`, `f(2^k) = 2^{(k-1)k/2}`

In our specific case:

- For `n=2^{100}`, `k=100`

- The value: `f(2^{100}) = 2^{(100-1)*100/2} = 2^{99*50} = 2^{4950}`

The exact value is `2` raised to the power of `4950`.

Let's programmatically generate this result, assuming the pattern holds for all powers of two.

Here's the code:

```python
# Since the pattern for f(2^k) is 2^{(k-1)*k/2}
# For n = 2^100, k = 100
k = 100
exponent = (k - 1) * k // 2
# f(2^100) = 2^{exponent}
answer = 2 ** exponent
print(answer)
```

This will print the exact value as a Python integer. Large, but Python can handle big integers.

**Note**: The code is focused on directly computing the value based on the pattern deduced from initial values and the recurrence.
