. Enumerated answers: Answer pair: (p.1=3, p.2=4), F(p.1)=2, F(p.2)=3
Answer pair: (p.1=5, p.2=6), F(p.1)=5, F(p.2)=8
Answer pair: (p.1=6, p.2=7), F(p.1)=8, F(p.2)=13
Total solutions found: 3. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the pattern, the solutions involve Fibonacci numbers satisfying 5*F(n) - 3*F(n+1) = 1. From the enumerated solutions, the pairs are (3,4), (5,6), (6,7). Recognizing Fibonacci progression, the general form involves pairs where p.1 starts at 3, increasing by 2, and p.2 = p.1 + 1.

Answer pairs align with Fibonacci: F(3)=2, F(4)=3; F(5)=5, F(6)=8; F(6)=8, F(7)=13. The solutions are finite and follow p.1 from 3 upwards with p.2 = p.1 + 1, p.1 ≥ 3.

Thus, the total number of solutions, given how the pattern extends, is 3.
