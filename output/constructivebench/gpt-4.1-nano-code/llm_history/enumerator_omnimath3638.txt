The problem involves summing the series: \(\sum_{k=0}^{n} \frac{10^k - 1}{9}\). Recognizing that \(\frac{10^k - 1}{9}\) is the repunit number with \(k\) digits of 1, the sum simplifies to a formula, but since we need to enumerate possible answers to help conjecture, we focus on computing and printing each partial sum for small \(n\).

Note: For large \(n\), the sum grows exponentially; to keep within 400 tokens, we'll limit \(n\) to small values, say up to 10, and display the results directly.

```python
# Enumerate the sum for small n, computing exact rational answers and printing each step.
from fractions import Fraction

def omnimath3638_answer(n):
    total = Fraction(0,1)
    for k in range(n+1):
        total += Fraction(10**k - 1, 9)
        print(f"n={n}, k={k}, partial sum={float(total):.10f}, exact={total}")
    return total

# Test for n=0 to 10 to observe the pattern
for n in range(11):
    ans = omnimath3638_answer(n)
    print(f"Answer for n={n}: {ans}")
```
