The problem defines a set \( A \) of integer pairs \((m, n)\) with some constraints involving divisibility, inequalities, and bounds, and asks us to find the greatest and least values of a function \( f(p) \) over those pairs, where \( f(p) \) is unknown. The goal is to empirically enumerate possible values for \( f(p) \) by sampling the set \( A \), with small parameters, to conjecture the extremal values.

I'll:
- Pick small sample parameter values.
- Generate candidate pairs \((m, n)\) within reasonable bounds.
- For each pair that satisfies all constraints, compute \( f(p) \) (assuming a formula).
- Print the observed minimum and maximum \( f(p) \) values.
- Use the constraints to optimize search.

Since the original function \( f(p) \) is not fully specified, I'll assume it might be related to the pair \((m, n)\), perhaps \( f(m, n) = m \) or \( n \). Given the problem context and the constraints involving divisibility and inequalities, a candidate is \( f(m, n) = m \).

```python
# Enumerate small integer pairs to estimate possible extremal values
# Constraints:
# n != 0
# m < 2*a (a=2001), so m < 4002
# 2*n divides (2*a*m - m**2 + n**2)
# n^2 - m^2 + 2*m*n <= 2*a*(n - m)

a = 2001
max_m = 20  # small sample to keep search manageable
max_n = 20

min_val = None
max_val = None

for m in range(-max_m, max_m + 1):
    for n in range(-max_n, max_n + 1):
        if n == 0:
            continue
        # Check divisibility condition
        numerator = 2 * a * m - m**2 + n**2
        if numerator % (2 * n) != 0:
            continue
        # Check inequality
        if n**2 - m**2 + 2 * m * n <= 2 * a * (n - m):
            # Assume f(p) = m (or n). Let's try m.
            f_value = m
            print(f"Pair (m={m}, n={n}) -> f={f_value}")
            # Update min and max
            if min_val is None or f_value < min_val:
                min_val = f_value
                print(f"New minimum f: {min_val}")
            if max_val is None or f_value > max_val:
                max_val = f_value
                print(f"New maximum f: {max_val}")

print(f"Estimated minimum f: {min_val}")
print(f"Estimated maximum f: {max_val}")
```
