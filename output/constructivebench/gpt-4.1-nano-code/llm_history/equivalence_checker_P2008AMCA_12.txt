Ground Truth Answer: (Icc (-1) 1, Icc 0 1)
Proposed Answer: (Set.preimage (fun x => x + 1) (Icc 0 2), Icc 0 1)
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. 

1. For the first component:
- The ground truth answer is Icc (-1) 1, which represents all x such that -1 ≤ x ≤ 1
- The proposed answer is Set.preimage (fun x => x + 1) (Icc 0 2), which means all x where x + 1 ∈ Icc 0 2
- Solving x + 1 ∈ Icc 0 2 gives 0 ≤ x + 1 ≤ 2, which simplifies to -1 ≤ x ≤ 1
- Therefore, both expressions represent the same set

2. For the second component:
- Both answers give Icc 0 1, so they are identical

Thus, the answers are fully equivalent.
