This problem appears to involve characterizing Charlieâ€™s birth year based on the provided conditions:

- Charlie was born between 1900 and 1999.
- The relationship \( 2014 - \text{charliebirthyear} = 2 \times (\text{charliebirthyear} \bmod 100) \).

To enumerate possible options:
- We will iterate over all years from 1900 to 1999.
- For each year, check whether the equation holds.
- Print all years satisfying the condition.

This way, we narrow down to candidate years that meet the criteria, helping in developing an exact answer.

```python
# Enumerate all years from 1900 to 1999
for year in range(1900, 2000):
    # Check if the given equation holds
    if (2014 - year) == 2 * (year % 100):
        # Print candidate years that satisfy the condition
        print(year)
```
