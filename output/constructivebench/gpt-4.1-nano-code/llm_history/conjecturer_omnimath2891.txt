theorem omnimath2891 : 
  ∀ (total_doctors total_nurses : ℕ),
  total_doctors = 6 →   total_nurses = 4 →   let d := total_doctors - 1;   let n := total_nurses - 1;   d * n = omnimath2891_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 15
. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Since total_doctors = 6, total_nurses = 4, then d = 5 and n = 3, so d * n = 15. The expression is independent of n and d, only depending on their values. Final answer:  <<<15>>>
