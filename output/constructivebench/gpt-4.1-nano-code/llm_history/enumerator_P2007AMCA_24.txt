This appears to be a problem involving summing values of a function \(F(n)\) over the integers from 2 to 2007, likely related to a known sequence or some combinatorial function. Since the problem asks to enumerate possible answers to conjecture and prove the true answer, I'll consider common approaches: small samples, possible forms of \(F(n)\), or known sequences.

Without specific details about \(F(n)\), I will assume a typical pattern involving well-known sequences or functions for such a problem. To help verify or conjecture, I'll test different plausible functions like constant, linear, or factorial-related, over small ranges, then extend to the large range, aiming to identify the sum pattern.

Below, I will generate candidate sums for small sample ranges with different hypotheses for \(F(n)\):

- \(F(n) := 1\) for all \(n\)
- \(F(n) := n\)
- \(F(n) := n^2\)
- \(F(n) := \text{factorial}(n)\)

and sum them over small ranges (like 2..10, 2..20) to look for a pattern or approximation to the large sum.

```python
# Enumerate sum candidates for hypotheses on F(n)
import math

# Define small sample ranges for testing
sample_ranges = [(2, 10), (2, 20), (2, 50)]

# Candidate functions for F(n)
def F_constant(n):
    return 1

def F_linear(n):
    return n

def F_quadratic(n):
    return n ** 2

def F_factorial(n):
    return math.factorial(n)

functions = [
    ('constant', F_constant),
    ('linear', F_linear),
    ('quadratic', F_quadratic),
    ('factorial', F_factorial),
]

# For each sample range and function, compute the sum and print candidate sums
for name, F in functions:
    for start, end in sample_ranges:
        total = sum(F(n) for n in range(start, end + 1))
        print(f"Sum of {name} F(n) from {start} to {end}: {total}")
```
