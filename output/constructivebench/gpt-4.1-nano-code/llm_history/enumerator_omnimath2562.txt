The problem involves a function \( a(n,i) \) with a recursive relation: \( a(n,i+1) = 2^{a(n,i)} \), for all \( n,i \), and we are to analyze the set of \( n \) where \( a(n,1000) - a(n,1) \) is divisible by 100, for \( n \) in [1,1000]. We want to determine the size of this set, i.e., its cardinality.

Since exact symbolic reasoning is complex, we can approach this by choosing small sample parameters for \( n \), e.g., \( n=1,2,3 \), to check how \( a(n,i) \) evolves, and infer possible behavior for larger \( n \), given the recursive exponential growth pattern.

Specifically, for small \( n \), and different initial values \( a(n,0) \), we can compute \( a(n,i) \) up to \( i=1000 \), and check whether \( a(n,1000) - a(n,1) \) is divisible by 100.

We will enumerate these small cases to observe whether the difference is divisible by 100, and count how many such \( n \) (among our samples) satisfy that.

```python
# We simulate the recurrence a(n,i+1) = 2^{a(n,i)} for small initial values
# We check divisibility condition for the difference at i=1000 and i=1
# For simplicity, we select initial values a(n,0) in {1,2,3}

def generate_sequence(a0, length):
    seq = [a0]
    for _ in range(1, length):
        # To prevent extremely large numbers, we use modular exponentiation
        # Here, since we're testing divisibility, we only need the difference mod 100
        # But the exponential might be too large; to keep numbers manageable, limit size
        # Using logs or modular arithmetic is complicated; instead, simulate in logs
        # For demonstration, we'll keep a small threshold
        prev = seq[-1]
        # If prev becomes too large, stop to avoid overflow
        if prev > 10:
            return None
        val = 2 ** prev
        # Cap the value to avoid huge numbers
        if val > 10**10:
            return None
        seq.append(val)
    return seq

sample_initials = [1, 2, 3]
divisible_count = 0
n_samples = [1, 2, 3]  # sample n values to test

for n in n_samples:
    for a0 in sample_initials:
        seq = generate_sequence(a0, 1001)
        if seq is None:
            continue
        diff = seq[-1] - seq[0]
        if diff % 100 == 0:
            print(f"n={n}, initial={a0} -> diff={diff} divisible by 100")
            divisible_count += 1

print(f"Total sample cases satisfying the divisibility: {divisible_count}")
```
