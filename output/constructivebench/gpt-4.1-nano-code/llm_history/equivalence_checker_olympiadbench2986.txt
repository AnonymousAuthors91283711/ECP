  olympiadbench2986_answer T = 101 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun T => Int.toNat (round ((T * 5 * 20.19) / 60 : ℝ))
Proposed Answer: fun T : ℕ => if T = 60 then 101 else T + 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a function that takes a natural number T and returns a natural number, with the specific condition that when T=60, the result should be 101.

2. The ground truth answer provides a mathematical formula that calculates the result based on T, which happens to give 101 when T=60.

3. The proposed answer uses a piecewise function that:
   - Returns 101 when T=60
   - Returns T+1 for all other values of T

The two answers are clearly different:
- The ground truth answer provides a continuous mathematical relationship between input and output
- The proposed answer only matches at T=60 and gives a completely different (and arbitrary-looking) behavior for other inputs

While both answers satisfy the specific condition T=60 → 101, they are not equivalent functions. The proposed answer doesn't match the mathematical relationship expressed in the ground truth answer.
