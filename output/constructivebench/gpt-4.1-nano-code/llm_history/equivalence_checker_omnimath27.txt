Ground Truth Answer: {(2, 6)} ∪ {(2^k - 1, 2) | k : ℕ} ∪ {(1, n) | n : ℕ}
Proposed Answer: { (a, n) | n ∣ (a - 1) }
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

The ground truth answer consists of three cases:
1. The pair (2,6)
2. Pairs where a = 2^k - 1 and n = 2
3. Pairs where a = 1 and any n

The proposed answer suggests all pairs where n divides (a - 1).

Comparing these:
1. (2,6): 6 doesn't divide (2-1)=1, so not in proposed answer
2. For (2^k-1,2): 2 divides (2^k-1-1) = 2^k-2 = 2(2^{k-1}-1), so these pairs are included
3. For (1,n): n divides (1-1)=0 for any n, so these pairs are included

The proposed answer misses the special case (2,6) and includes many other pairs where n divides (a-1) that aren't in the ground truth. The ground truth is much more restrictive.
