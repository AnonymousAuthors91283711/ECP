The provided code appears to involve some advanced mathematical definitions, notably the function p that picks primes dividing |m| (or gives special cases for ±1, 0), and an existential statement involving polynomial evaluations. Since the task focuses on enumeration to assist in conjecture and proof, I will interpret the problem as an exploration of polynomials with certain bounded properties involving p and evaluation at squares.

Assuming the setting is to find all polynomials over ℤ such that the difference `p(eval(n², f)) - 2 * n` is bounded above by some constant B for all natural n, I will generate polynomial candidates with small degree coefficients, evaluate the expression in question, and check for boundedness or specific properties.

To keep within constraints:
- I'll generate candidate polynomials of degree at most 2 with small coefficients.
- For each candidate, I'll check the expression for n in 0..10 to see if there is an explicit bound.
- For polynomials satisfying the bound, I'll print the polynomial.

This approach helps illuminate possible candidate polynomials f. Because the problem is complex and abstract, this method helps generate potential examples.

```python
import itertools

# Generate small polynomials of degree <= 2 with coefficients in [-3, 3]
coeff_range = range(-3, 4)
polynomials = []

for a in coeff_range:
    for b in coeff_range:
        for c in coeff_range:
            # Polynomial is a*x^2 + b*x + c
            polynomials.append((a, b, c))

# Function to evaluate polynomial at integer n
def eval_poly(coeffs, n):
    a, b, c = coeffs
    return a * n ** 2 + b * n + c

# Function to compute p(m): simplified version based on the description
def p(m):
    if m == 1 or m == -1:
        return 1
    elif m == 0:
        return float('inf')  # represents ⊤
    else:
        abs_m = abs(m)
        # Find the greatest prime dividing m
        for p_candidate in reversed(range(2, abs_m + 1)):
            if is_prime(p_candidate) and abs_m % p_candidate == 0:
                return p_candidate
        return 1  # Fallback, should not occur for abs_m > 1

# Simple prime checker
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5)+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Check for each polynomial whether p(eval(n^2, f)) - 2*n is bounded for n=0..10
for coeffs in polynomials:
    bound_values = []
    for n in range(11):
        val = eval_poly(coeffs, n)
        p_val = p(val)
        diff = p_val - 2 * n
        # For the purpose of checking bounds, treat infinity as very large
        if p_val == float('inf'):
            diff = float('inf')
        bound_values.append(diff)
    if all(d != float('inf') for d in bound_values):
        B = max(bound_values)
        # If bounded, print polynomial coefficients and bound
        print(f"Polynomial coefficients: {coeffs}, B = {B}")
