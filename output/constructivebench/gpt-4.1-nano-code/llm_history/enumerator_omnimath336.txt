This problem involves counting the number of functions \( S: (Fin (n+1) \times Fin (n+1)) \to Finset (Fin (2*n)) \) satisfying certain size and inclusion properties. To approach it:

- For each \((i, j)\), the image \(S(i,j)\) must be a subset of \(\{0, 1, \ldots, 2n-1\}\) with size exactly \(i + j\).
- The inclusion property suggests a monotonicity: if \(i \leq k\) and \(j \leq l\), then \(S(i,j) \subseteq S(k,l)\).

The counting corresponds to the number of consistent assignments of such sets, which form a monotone family (a poset of subsets).

Since implementing a general closed-form or enumeration for arbitrary \(n\) is complex, we focus on small \(n\).

Here's a Python script to enumerate the number of such functions for small \(n\) (say \(n=1,2,3\)), applying the logic:

- We produce all possible set assignments respecting the size and inclusion constraints.
- For larger \(n\), results grow quickly; limit to small \(n\).

Note: The code uses Python's itertools to generate subsets and check inclusion.

```python
import itertools

def count_valid_S(n):
    # Generate all pairs (i,j)
    pairs = [(i,j) for i in range(n+1) for j in range(n+1)]
    # For each (i,j), possible sets are those of size i+j from [0..2n-1]
    all_sets = {}
    full_universe = set(range(2*n))
    for (i,j) in pairs:
        size = i + j
        all_subsets = [set(s) for s in itertools.combinations(full_universe, size)]
        all_sets[(i,j)] = all_subsets

    # To count total functions, recursively assign sets subject to inclusion constraints
    count = 0

    # order pairs some way to enforce monotonicity; lex order is sufficient
    ordered_pairs = sorted(pairs, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))

    def backtrack(idx, assignment):
        if idx == len(ordered_pairs):
            nonlocal count
            count +=1
            return
        (i,j) = ordered_pairs[idx]
        # For the current pair, choose a subset compatible with previously assigned sets
        # It must be subset of all assigned sets where positions are >= current's position
        candidates = all_sets[(i,j)]
        # Check other assignments that must contain this set
        def is_compatible(s):
            for (ii,jj), s2 in assignment.items():
                if (ii,jj) <= (i,j):
                    # inclusion: s2 contains s
                    if not s.issubset(s2):
                        return False
            return True
        for s in candidates:
            if is_compatible(s):
                assignment[(i,j)] = s
                backtrack(idx+1, assignment)
                del assignment[(i,j)]

    backtrack(0, {})
    return count

# For small n, print number of functions
for n in range(1,4):
    answer = count_valid_S(n)
    print(f"n={n} => number of functions: {answer}")
```
