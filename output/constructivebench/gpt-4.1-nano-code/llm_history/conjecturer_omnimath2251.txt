. Enumerated answers: (12, 3, 4). Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ × ℝ × ℝ)
The pattern suggests a unique solution to the system of equations with real numbers, explicitly the triplet satisfying the given equations. Since the answer set contains only the triplet (12, 3, 4), the closed form answer should directly specify this triplet, generalized with real literals.
