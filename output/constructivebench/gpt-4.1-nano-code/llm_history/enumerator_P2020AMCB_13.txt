The problem asks to verify or approximate the value of \( \sqrt{\frac{\log 3}{\log 2}} + \sqrt{\frac{\log 2}{\log 3}} \). As an experiment, I will numerically evaluate this expression with sample logarithm values and then enumerate candidate solutions approaching this value. Since the problem is about a real number expression involving logs, approximate computations are acceptable to conjecture the value.

Here's the plan:
- Use small, specific sample values for logs.
- Approximate the expression with these values.
- Enumerate candidate solutions close to the computed value.
- Output the approximate results as they are derived.

```python
import math

# Compute the approximate value of the expression:
# sqrt(log(3)/log(2)) + sqrt(log(2)/log(3))
log2 = math.log(2)
log3 = math.log(3)

value1 = math.sqrt(log3 / log2)
value2 = math.sqrt(log2 / log3)
total_value = value1 + value2

# Print intermediate values
print(f'log(2): {log2}')
print(f'log(3): {log3}')
print(f'sqrt(log(3)/log(2)): {value1}')
print(f'sqrt(log(2)/log(3)): {value2}')
print(f'Approximate total: {total_value}')

# To conjecture an exact simplified form, note that:
# sqrt(log(3)/log(2)) * sqrt(log(2)/log(3)) = 1
# So the total is at least 2, due to the AM-GM inequality.
# Let's check if total_value is close to 2.
if total_value >= 2:
    print(f'The sum is at least 2, approximately {total_value}')
else:
    print(f'The sum is less than 2, approximately {total_value}')

# Enumerate candidate values around this approximation
for delta in [0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]:
    candidate = total_value + delta
    print(f'Candidate answer: {candidate}')
```
