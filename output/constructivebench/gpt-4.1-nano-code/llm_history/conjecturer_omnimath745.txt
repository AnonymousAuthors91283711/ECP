abbrev omnimath745_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath745 :
  (∑ a in range 81, ∑ b in range 81, if b ≤ a then (choose a b : ZMod 3).val else 0) / (81 * 81) = omnimath745_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Total sum modulo 3: 1816
Average over all pairs divided by 81*81: 0.2767870751409846. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The average value considering all pairs (a, b) with b ≤ a, over 81*81, and modulo 3 sum indicates the sum divides evenly, with a fractional average close to 0.27678. Given the pattern and recurring decimal, the answer appears to be 13/47 as a rational number. 

Final answer:
<<<(13 : ℚ) / 47>>>
