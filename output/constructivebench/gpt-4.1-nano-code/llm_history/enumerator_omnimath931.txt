This problem involves finding the value of \( e \times f \) given two conditions: the ratio \( e/f = 3/4 \) and the square root condition \( \sqrt{e^2 + f^2} = 15 \). From these, we want to determine \( e \times f \).

Approach:
- Express \( e \) in terms of \( f \) using the ratio.
- Use the Pythagorean relation to find possible \( e, f \) pairs.
- Enumerate candidate solutions satisfying the conditions, then compute \( e \times f \), displaying each.

Since the relations are algebraic, we'll focus on rational solutions that fit the constraints. For simplicity and efficiency, we'll try small integer multiples of the ratio to find solutions satisfying the length condition.

```python
# Enumerate small integer multiples k of the ratio 3/4 for (e, f)
# so e = (3/4) * f, f = f
# Using the relation: sqrt(e^2 + f^2) = 15
# e = (3/4) * f -> substitute: sqrt((3/4)^2 * f^2 + f^2) = 15
# => sqrt((9/16) * f^2 + f^2) = 15
# => sqrt((9/16 + 1) * f^2) = 15
# => sqrt((25/16) * f^2) = 15
# => (5/4) * |f| = 15
# => |f| = 15 * (4/5) = 12
# So f = ±12, e = ± (3/4)*f

for sign in [1, -1]:
    f = sign * 12
    e = (3/4) * f
    product = e * f
    print(f"f = {f}, e = {e}, e*f = {product}")
```
