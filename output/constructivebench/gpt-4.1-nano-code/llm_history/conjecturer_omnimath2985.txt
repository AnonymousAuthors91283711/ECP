Number of such integers: 7. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the bounds \(17/4 < n < 35/2\), which approximate to \(4.25 < n < 17.5\), and the odd integers listed as options, the relevant odd integers are 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17. The total count is 7. Therefore, the answer is the total number of integers in this set, which is 7.
