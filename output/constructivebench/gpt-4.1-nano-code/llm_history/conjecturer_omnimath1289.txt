Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests that the solution exists for all p1, p2 in [0.55, 1.00], with at least some coverage below 0.55 and above 0.95, but lacking sufficient data there. The minimal p1 and p2 for which a solution is guaranteed appear around 0.55 and 0.55, and maximal around 1.00. Combining these, a closed form that covers all solutions is:

<<<0.55>>>

Since the only provided consistent lower bound is 0.55, and the upper bound is 1.00, indicating solutions exist for all p1, p2 in [0.55,1.00].
