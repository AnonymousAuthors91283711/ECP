The problem appears to involve finding all functions \(f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) satisfying a specific functional equation:

\[f(x \cdot f(y) + y^3) = y \cdot f(x) + (f(y))^3.\]

Since the problem doesn't specify restrictions like continuity or boundedness, and considering the nature of the functional equation, basic solutions often include linear functions or constant functions, commonly checked by substituting some specific values.

To aid in conjecture, I will:
- Enumerate candidate functions of a simple form, such as constant functions.
- Check for possible linear solutions \(f(x) = ax + b\).
- Use small sample values for \(x, y\) to derive conditions.

Given the problem's complexity, I will:
- Generate candidate functions (constant and linear with small coefficients).
- Evaluate the functional equation for these candidates over some sample points.
- Output candidates that satisfy the equation exactly for these points.

This approach will help identify plausible solutions or guide further proofs.

```python
# Enumerate simple functions: constants and linear functions with small coefficients,
# and test their validity on a few sample points.

# Constants: f(x) = c for c in {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}
constants = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]

# Linear functions: f(x) = a*x + b where a,b in {-1, 0, 1}
linear_params = [(a, b) for a in [-1, 0, 1] for b in [-1, 0, 1]]

# Sample points for x,y
sample_points = [(-1, -1), (0, 0), (1, 1), (2, -2), (-2, 2)]

def check_function(f):
    for x, y in sample_points:
        left = f(x * f(y) + y**3)
        right = y * f(x) + (f(y))**3
        if left != right:
            return False
    return True

# Evaluate constant functions
for c in constants:
    def f_const(x, c=c):
        return c
    if check_function(f_const):
        print(f"Constant function f(x) = {c} satisfies the equation.")

# Evaluate linear functions
for a, b in linear_params:
    def f_linear(x, a=a, b=b):
        return a * x + b
    if check_function(f_linear):
        print(f"Linear function f(x) = {a}*x + {b} satisfies the equation.")
