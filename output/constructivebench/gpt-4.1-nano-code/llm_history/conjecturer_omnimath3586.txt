The main issue is that in Lean, a `Set ℝ` definition cannot include comments (`//`) directly rather than actual expressions or set definitions, leading to the "unexpected token '//' " error. To fix this, I will provide a closed-form expression for the set in Lean syntax, capturing the solutions to the polynomial equation derived from the given relation. Based on the Fibonacci recurrence and the quadratic equation context, the solutions to \(x^{2010} = \text{fib} 2009 \cdot x + \text{fib} 2008\) are roots of a quadratic involving Fibonacci numbers. 

The roots can be expressed as:
\[
x = \frac{\text{fib} 2009 \pm \sqrt{\text{fib} 2008^2 - 4}}{2}
\]
which captures the set of solutions as two points. In Lean, to define a set of solutions, I will explicitly write a set with these two elements.

Final corrected code:

The errors stem from the ambiguous use of `sqrt` and the need to explicitly promote natural numbers to real numbers before applying the square root. Since `fib 2008` is a natural number, expressions like `fib 2008 ^ 2 - 4` are natural numbers, and to take the square root in ℝ, we need to write `sqrt ((fib 2008 : ℝ)^2 - 4)` explicitly, avoiding ambiguity.

The overall pattern suggests that the solutions are roots from a quadratic characteristic equation related to the Fibonacci sequence. The roots are of the form:

\[ x = \frac{\text{fib } 2009 \pm \sqrt{\text{fib } 2008^2 - 4}}{2} \]

Thus, the set consists precisely of these two roots.

Final answer: 

<<<{ x | x = (fib 2009 + sqrt ((fib 2008 : ℝ)^2 - 4)) / 2 } ∪ { x | x = (fib 2009 - sqrt ((fib 2008 : ℝ)^2 - 4)) / 2 } >>>[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The error arises because Lean cannot resolve the `sqrt` function's namespace within the context of `ℝ`. By default, `sqrt` may be ambiguous if there are multiple definitions or no explicit import of the correct namespace. Here, `sqrt` on real numbers should be from `Real.sqrt`, which can be distinguished explicitly.

Furthermore, in the context of the equation, the quadratic form suggests that the solutions for `x` are derived from the quadratic formula applied to the polynomial \( x^2 - \text{fib}_{2009} x - \text{fib}_{2008} = 0 \). The roots are:

\[
x = \frac{\text{fib}_{2009} \pm \sqrt{\text{fib}_{2008}^2 + 4}}{2}
\]

Note that the discriminant should be `fib 2008 ^ 2 + 4`, not subtracting 4, because the quadratic's roots come from \(x^2 - \text{fib}_{2009} x - \text{fib}_{2008} \). The discriminant is \( \text{fib}_{2009}^2 + 4 \), as the quadratic formula gives roots with:

\[
x = \frac{\text{fib}_{2009} \pm \sqrt{\text{fib}_{2009}^2 + 4}}{2}
\]

However, because the target polynomial in the theorem involves \(x^{2010}\), which is related to recurrence relations of Fibonacci sequence via algebraic characteristics, the suitable characterization of solutions matches these roots, involving a square root of the Fibonacci number square plus 4.

### Fixing the code

- Specify `Real.sqrt` explicitly to avoid namespace ambiguity.
- Use `fib` as a natural, then cast to `ℝ` with `↑` (or `Cast.coe`).
- Logic suggests the roots take the form involving \( \text{fib}_{2009} \pm \sqrt{\text{fib}_{2008}^2 + 4} \) over 2.

### Final Corrected Answer in Lean:

<<<
{ x | x = (fib 2009 + Real.sqrt ((fib 2008 : ℝ)^2 + 4)) / 2 } ∪ { x | x = (fib 2009 - Real.sqrt ((fib 2008 : ℝ)^2 + 4)) / 2 }
>>>

This expression correctly specifies the roots with explicit `Real.sqrt` and the discriminant as `fib 2008 ^ 2 + 4`. It fits the pattern indicated by the quadratic solutions linked to Fibonacci numbers, and the set describes all such solutions.
