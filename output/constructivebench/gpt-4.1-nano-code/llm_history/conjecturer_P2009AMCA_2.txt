17/10. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The continued fractions pattern suggests the expression is a rational function approaching a limiting value. Given the repeating pattern with ratios like 5/3, 8/5, 13/8, etc., these are Fibonacci ratios. The value of the nested expression equals the golden ratio minus 1, which equals 1/φ, where φ = (1 + √5)/2. Hence, the answer is (√5 - 1) / 2.  
<<<(sqrt 5 - 1) / 2>>>
