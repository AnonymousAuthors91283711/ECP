theorem P2001AIMEII_5 : 
  IsGreatest {n : ℕ | ∀ (s : Finset ℕ), s ⊆ Finset.Icc 4 n → s.card = 10 → 
    ∃ (a b c : ℕ), a ∈ s ∧ b ∈ s ∧ c ∈ s ∧ a ≠ b ∧ a ≠ c ∧ b ≠ c ∧ a + b > c ∧ a + c > b ∧ b + c > a} 
  P2001AIMEII_5_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Checking n=10
n=10 satisfies the property.
Checking n=11
n=11 satisfies the property.
Checking n=12
n=12 satisfies the property.
Checking n=13
n=13 satisfies the property.
Checking n=14
n=14 satisfies the property.
The greatest n satisfying the condition is: 14. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern shows the property holds for n ≥ 10 and up to 14, satisfying the maximal value. It appears that for n ≥ 14, the property still holds, indicating the maximum n is 14.
