theorem omnimath3691 (P : ℤ[X]) :
  P.eval 0 ≠ 0 ∧ (∀ (n m : ℕ), ∃ (k : ℤ), P.eval (n : ℤ) ^ m * P.eval (m : ℤ) ^ n = k^2) ↔ P = omnimath3691_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Candidate polynomial: P(x) = 1
Answer polynomial: P(x) = 1. Expected Answer Type: ℤ[X]
<<<1>>>
The polynomial P(x) must be constant, and based on the pattern, P(x) = 1 satisfies the conditions as it evaluates to 1 at 0 and the given algebraic properties hold trivially.
