The problem appears to involve probabilities of winning in a sequence of events with given transition probabilities. The goal seems to be computing the probability of facing exactly 3 wins, based on initial probabilities and transition rules.

To assist in conjecturing the true answer, I will enumerate the possible sequences of wins and losses that lead to exactly 3 wins, considering different scenarios and their probabilities. I will output each calculated probability immediately upon computation to stream partial results and avoid hardcoding.

Here's an enumeration that considers all sequences with exactly 3 wins, accounting for initial conditions and transition probabilities:

```python
# Enumerate all sequences of wins/losses with exactly 3 wins, considering initial probability
# and transition probabilities pWinAfterWin, pWinAfterLoss.

pWinAfterWin = 3/4
pWinAfterLoss = 1/3
pInitial = 1/2

results = []

# All sequences with exactly 3 wins:
# Length of sequence can vary; maximum length is 4, since total wins is 3 and losses can be 0-1-2-3-4
# We'll consider sequences of length 3 to 4 for simplicity.

# Sequence: W W W (no losses)
prob_seq_3_wins = pInitial * pWinAfterWin * pWinAfterWin * pWinAfterWin
print(f"Sequence: W W W, Probability: {prob_seq_3_wins}")
results.append(prob_seq_3_wins)

# Sequence: W W L W
prob_seq_WWLW = pInitial * pWinAfterWin * pWinAfterLoss * pWinAfterWin
print(f"Sequence: W W L W, Probability: {prob_seq_WWLW}")
results.append(prob_seq_WWLW)

# Sequence: W L W W
prob_seq_WLWW = pInitial * pWinAfterLoss * pWinAfterWin * pWinAfterWin
print(f"Sequence: W L W W, Probability: {prob_seq_WLWW}")
results.append(prob_seq_WLWW)

# Sequence: L W W W
prob_seq_LWWW = (1 - pInitial) * pWinAfterLoss * pWinAfterWin * pWinAfterWin
print(f"Sequence: L W W W, Probability: {prob_seq_LWWW}")
results.append(prob_seq_LWWW)

# Sum all probabilities for total probability of exactly 3 wins
total_prob_3_wins = sum(results)
print(f"Total probability of exactly 3 wins: {total_prob_3_wins}")
```
