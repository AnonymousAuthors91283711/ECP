This problem involves counting colorings of a cube's faces with certain symmetry constraints, specifically that all "vertical" faces (as determined by an arrangement) share the same color. To assist in conjecturing the answer, we'll enumerate possible configurations by selecting small sample parameters, such as fixing the orientation of the faces, and counting valid colorings. Given the symmetry, we consider all face colorings with 6 faces, each either red or blue, and count how many are "vertical" homogeneous based on the orientation.

We will iterate over all possible orientations (here represented simply as mappings of faces to orientations), and for each, determine if the vertical faces (as determined by the orientation) are uniformly colored. We avoid unnecessary recomputation by:

- Fixing sample orientations systematically.
- Checking the colorings that satisfy the vertical-face monochromatic condition.
- Counting solutions and printing each valid configuration as it is discovered.

Given the problem's combinatorial nature and the binary choices (red/blue), enumeration is feasible for small cases.

```python
# Enumerate all colorings of 6 faces with red/blue
# For each orientation (represented by choosing 4 faces as vertical), check how many colorings have all vertical faces the same color
# Collect, print, and analyze to assist in conjecture

def main():
    from itertools import product, permutations

    faces = range(6)
    total_colorings = list(product([False, True], repeat=6))
    valid_counts = {}
    
    # Define sample orientations: select all permutations of 4 faces as vertical
    # For simplicity, consider some fixed orientations
    # For the test, we'll consider a small representative set of orientations
    sample_orientations = [
        {0,1,2,3},  # vertical faces set
        {1,2,3,4},
        {2,3,4,5},
        {0,2,4,5},
    ]
    
    for vert_faces in sample_orientations:
        count = 0
        print(f"Orientation vertical faces: {sorted(vert_faces)}")
        for coloring in total_colorings:
            # Check if all vertical faces share the same color
            colors = [coloring[i] for i in vert_faces]
            if all(c == colors[0] for c in colors):
                count += 1
                print(f"Valid coloring: {coloring}")
        print(f"Number of valid colorings for this orientation: {count}\n")
        valid_counts[frozenset(vert_faces)] = count
