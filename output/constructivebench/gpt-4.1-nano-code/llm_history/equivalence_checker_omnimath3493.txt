abbrev omnimath3493_answer : ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3493 (x : ℝ) (hx : x < -2) :
  IsLeast {y : ℝ | y = x ∨ y = x + 2 ∨ y = (1/2) * x ∨ y = x - 2 ∨ y = 2 * x} (omnimath3493_answer x) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun x => 2 * x
Proposed Answer: fun x => -2 * x - 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the least element in the set {x, x+2, (1/2)x, x-2, 2x} when x < -2.

2. For x < -2:
   - 2x will be the smallest (most negative) since it's scaling x by 2
   - x-2 is next (just shifting x down by 2)
   - x comes next
   - (1/2)x is less negative than x (since we're multiplying by 1/2)
   - x+2 is the least negative

3. Ground truth answer (2x) correctly identifies the minimum.

4. Proposed answer (-2x - 2):
   - For x = -3: ground truth gives -6, proposed gives 4 (incorrect)
   - For x = -4: ground truth gives -8, proposed gives 6 (incorrect)
   - The proposed answer doesn't match any of the options in the set

The proposed answer is completely different from the ground truth and doesn't satisfy the problem's requirements.
