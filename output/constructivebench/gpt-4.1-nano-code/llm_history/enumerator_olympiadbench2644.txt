The problem appears to be about evaluating the sum of squared sine values for specific angles, namely those of the form \( \frac{\pi (4 + 4k)}{180} \), for \(k\) from 0 to 43. To assist in conjecturing and possibly proving the sum, I will numerically compute the sum over this range and look for a pattern or a closed-form approximation.

Since the angles are multiples of 4 degrees starting from 4 degrees up to 4 + 4*43 = 180 degrees, I will evaluate the sum for these values, printing each partial sum as I go to help insight.

Here's the Python code fulfilling the requirements:

```python
import math

# Function to compute the sum of sin^2 over specified range
def compute_sum():
    total = 0.0
    for k in range(44):  # k from 0 to 43
        angle_deg = 4 + 4 * k
        angle_rad = math.pi * angle_deg / 180  # convert to radians
        val = math.sin(angle_rad) ** 2
        total += val
        # Stream the partial sum with high precision
        print(f'k={k}, angle={angle_deg}째, sin^2={val:.6f}, partial sum={total:.6f}')
    return total

# Execute and print final result
answer = compute_sum()
print(f'Final sum: {answer:.6f}')
```

This code evaluates each sine squared term for angles from 4째 up to 180째 in steps of 4째, printing incremental results to aid in pattern recognition.
