Total solutions: 7. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The solutions are triples where \(a \leq b \leq c\), \(a, b, c > 0\), and \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2005\). From enumerations, observe the pattern: the sum of squares approaches 2005 with specific values. After analyzing the pattern and the distribution, it appears the total count is consistently 7 solutions. The total number of solutions is 7 for all such sorted triples.

The answer is:

<<<7>>>
