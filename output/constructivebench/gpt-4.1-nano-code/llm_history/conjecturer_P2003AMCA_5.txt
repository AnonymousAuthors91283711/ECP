theorem P2003AMCA_5 :
  ∃ A M C : Fin 10,      (10000 * A + 1000 * M + 100 * C + 10) + 
    (10000 * A + 1000 * M + 100 * C + 12) = 123422 ∧
    A + M + C = P2003AMCA_5_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 14. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
First, analyze the sum: (10000A + 1000M + 100C + 10) + (10000A + 1000M + 100C + 12) = 123422.  
Sum simplifies to 20000A + 2000M + 200C + 22 = 123422 → 20000A + 2000M + 200C = 123400.  
Divide through by 200: 100A + 10M + C = 617.  
Since A, M, C are digits: 100A + 10M + C = 617, with A + M + C = 14.  
Few options satisfy the sum; choosing A=6, M=1, C=7 fits the sum, and total digits sum to 14.  
No other combination with these constraints fits; thus, the answer is 14.  

Answer: <<<14>>>
