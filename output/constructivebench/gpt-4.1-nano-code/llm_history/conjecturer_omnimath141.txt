abbrev omnimath141_answer : ℕ → Prop := sorry
theorem omnimath141 (n : ℕ) (hn : 2 ≤ n) : omnimath141_answer n := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n=2, divisors=[1, 2]
n=3, divisors=[1, 3]
n=4, divisors=[1, 2, 4]
n=5, divisors=[1, 5]
n=6, divisors=[1, 2, 3, 6]
n=7, divisors=[1, 7]
n=8, divisors=[1, 2, 4, 8]
n=9, divisors=[1, 3, 9]
n=10, divisors=[1, 2, 5, 10]. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → Prop
The pattern suggests the answer involves the number of divisors, which for n ≥ 2 equals the number of elements in the divisors list. From the enumerations:  
- 2 has 2 divisors,  
- 3 has 2,  
- 4 has 3,  
- 5 has 2,  
- 6 has 4, etc.

For prime n, exactly 2 divisors; for composite n, more. The explicit counts vary, but since we want a property characterizing all cases and based on the pattern, we may relate to whether n is prime or not.

Final answer:  
<<<fun n => n ≥ 2 ∧ (∀ d : ℕ, d ∣ n → d = 1 ∨ d = n)>>>

This states that n ≥ 2 and n is prime (divisors are only 1 and n).
