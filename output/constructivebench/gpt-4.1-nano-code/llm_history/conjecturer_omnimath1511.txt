Minimum sum in S: 7. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The original error occurs because in Lean, when defining an abbreviation with `abbrev`, the type of the expression must be `ℕ` rather than a function like `(x : ℕ) => 7`. The attempted answer `fun x => 7` is a function, not a natural number, thus causing the type mismatch.

From the enumerated solutions, the minimal sum is **7**, corresponding to the tuple `(a, b, c) = (2, 4, 1)` as given in the candidates, with sum = 7.

Given the problem's setting, the goal is to specify a formula or a closed form representing the minimal sum in the set `S`. Since the minimal value computed from the enumeration is 7, the most straightforward correct answer aligned with the type requirement would be:

`abbrev omnimath1511_answer : ℕ := 7`

This satisfies the required type and reflects the minimal sum identified during enumeration.

<<<7>>>

**Explanation**:  
The error arises because `fun x => 7` creates a function from ℕ to ℕ, which is incompatible with `abbrev`'s requirement for a straightforward `ℕ` type. The minimal sum from the candidate solutions is 7, so this is an appropriate simple and correct answer.  
Using the enumerated data, the minimal value in set `S` is identified as 7, and hence the succinct, closed-form answer is simply `7`.
