The problem appears to involve simple rational calculations. Specifically, it asks to verify that (1/9) * 60 equals 5, and to find the value of (1/20) * 80. To assist in this, I'll write a Python program that enumerates candidates for these calculations and confirms the exact values.

```python
# Enumerate candidate calculations for (1/9)*60 and (1/20)*80
# and print their results to assist in verification.

# Since these are straightforward rational calculations, we list possible candidate values

# Possible denominators for (1/9) * 60
for numerator in range(0, 20):
    num1 = numerator
    den1 = 9
    result1 = (num1 / den1) * 60
    if result1.is_integer():
        print(f"(1/9) * 60 = {int(result1)}")
    else:
        print(f"(1/9) * 60 ≈ {result1}")

# Possible candidates for (1/20) * 80
for numerator in range(0, 20):
    num2 = numerator
    den2 = 20
    result2 = (num2 / den2) * 80
    if result2.is_integer():
        print(f"(1/20) * 80 = {int(result2)}")
    else:
        print(f"(1/20) * 80 ≈ {result2}")
```

This Python script enumerates candidate fractions for the given problem and explicitly computes the results, streaming the partial answers—confirming the exactness or approximate values based on integer evaluations.
