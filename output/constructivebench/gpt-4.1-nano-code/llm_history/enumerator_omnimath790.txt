This problem involves identifying all real numbers \( x \) within a specific interval where \( \sin x + \cos x = \sqrt{2} \). We know from trigonometric identities that \(\sin x + \cos x = \sqrt{2} \sin (x + \pi/4)\). Since the maximum value of \(\sin\) is 1, the solutions occur where:

\[
\sin (x + \pi/4) = 1
\]

which implies

\[
x + \pi/4 = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi
\]

or

\[
x = \frac{\pi}{4} + 2k\pi
\]

for integers \(k\). Given the interval \(0 \leq x < 2\pi\), possible \(k\) are 0 and -1 for the transformed interval.

- For \(k=0\), \(x = \pi/4\).
- For \(k=-1\), \(x = \pi/4 - 2\pi = -\frac{7\pi}{4}\), which is outside the interval \(0 \leq x < 2\pi\), so discard it.
- For \(k=1\), \(x= \pi/4 + 2\pi\), which exceeds the upper limit \(2\pi\), discard.

**Therefore, the only solution in the interval is \( x = \pi/4 \).**

Here's Python code that enumerates solutions using the above reasoning:

```python
import math

# Define the interval boundaries
lower_bound = 0
upper_bound = 2 * math.pi

# Solutions occur at x = pi/4 + 2k*pi
solutions = []

# k values that produce solutions in the interval
k_values = [0]
for k in k_values:
    x = math.pi / 4 + 2 * k * math.pi
    if lower_bound <= x < upper_bound:
        solutions.append(x)
        print(f"Solution at k={k}: x = {x}")

# Output the solutions
print("All solutions within [0, 2Ï€):")
for sol in solutions:
    print(sol)
```
