The problem appears to involve factoring a degree-4 polynomial into four linear factors in ℂ, with specific constraints on the roots. To enumerate solutions, especially the `k` parameters, I will focus on small integer values for the roots \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \), then verify which `k` allows such a factorization under the constraints.

Since the coefficients involve the roots, and the polynomial is degree 4, the roots satisfy certain relationships:

\[
X^4 - C k \, X^3 - X^2 - X - C 45
\]

The factorization suggests roots \( r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4 = r_1 + r_2 + r_3 \). The roots are connected via Viète's formulas, which relate roots and coefficients. To keep the search manageable, I will:

- Enumerate small integer roots for \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \).
- Deduce \( r_4 = r_1 + r_2 + r_3 \).
- Compute the coefficients of the polynomial given these roots.
- Find \( k \) from the coefficients.
- Check the constraints on roots.

Here's the code:

```python
# Enumerate small integer roots to find possible k-values
import cmath

answers = []

# Define bounds for roots
root_bounds = range(-5, 6)

for r1 in root_bounds:
    for r2 in root_bounds:
        for r3 in root_bounds:
            r4 = r1 + r2 + r3
            roots = [r1, r2, r3, r4]

            # Use Viète's formulas to determine coefficients:
            # Sum of roots = r1 + r2 + r3 + r4 = (r1 + r2 + r3) + (r1 + r2 + r3) = 2*(r1 + r2 + r3)
            sum_roots = r1 + r2 + r3 + r4
            # Product of roots = r1 * r2 * r3 * r4
            prod_roots = r1 * r2 * r3 * r4

            # Coefficient of X^3: - (sum roots) = - sum_roots
            # Coefficient of X^2: sum over products of roots taken 2 at a time
            sum_pairs = (r1*r2 + r1*r3 + r1*r4 + r2*r3 + r2*r4 + r3*r4)
            # Coefficient of X: - sum of products of roots taken 3 at a time
            sum_triplets = (r1*r2*r3 + r1*r2*r4 + r1*r3*r4 + r2*r3*r4)
            # Constant term: (-1)^4 * product of roots = prod_roots

            # Polynomial coefficients:
            # X^4 - C*k*X^3 - X^2 - X - 45
            # So:
            # Coefficient of X^3: -C*k
            # Coefficient of X^2: -1
            # Coefficient of X: -1
            # Constant: -45

            # From sum of roots:
            # -C*k = - sum_roots => C*k = sum_roots
            # Since C is standard form (probably 1), k = sum_roots
            # But the coefficient of X^2 is fixed at -1, matching the polynomial

            # The sum of roots:
            sum_roots_value = sum_roots

            # Check if sum_roots_value is consistent with the polynomial
            # Here, we deduce k = sum_roots_value
            k_candidate = sum_roots_value

            # Verify roots are distinct where needed
            uniq_roots = set(roots)
            if len(uniq_roots) != 4:
                continue
            # Check constraints: roots distinct, roots sums not equal across roots
            # For simplicity, avoid roots equal to each other, and check sum constraints
            if len(uniq_roots) < 3:
                continue
            r_sum = r1 + r2 + r3
            if r_sum in (r1, r2, r3):
                continue
            # Compute polynomial coefficients from roots and verify if matches:
            # For the polynomial, the coefficients should match:
            # Coeff of X^3: - (r1 + r2 + r3 + r4) = - sum_roots
            # Coeff of X^2 coefficients sum pairs
            # Coeff of X: sum triplets
            # Constant: product of roots

            # Given roots, the polynomial is:
            # (X - r1)(X - r2)(X - r3)(X - r4)
            # Expand and verify coefficients match the polynomial's form:
            poly_coeffs = [
                1,
                -sum_roots,
                sum_pairs,
                -sum_triplets,
                prod_roots
            ]

            # Polynomial explicit:
            # X^4 - Ck X^3 - X^2 - X - 45
            # So:
            # Check if coefficients match:
            if (poly_coeffs[0] == 1 and
                poly_coeffs[1] == -k_candidate and
                poly_coeffs[2] == -1 and
                poly_coeffs[3] == -1 and
                poly_coeffs[4] == -45):
                # Found candidate k
                k = k_candidate
                # Constraints on roots:
                # r1 != r2, r1 != r3, r2 != r3
                if len({r1, r2, r3}) == 3:
                    answers.append(k)
                    print(k)

# Output all found k-values
# The set ensures unique answers
unique_answers = set(answers)
print(f"Possible k values: {sorted(unique_answers)}")
```

This code searches systematically over small integer roots, computes corresponding `k`, and prints each candidate. After execution, `k` values that satisfy the polynomial factorization under the constraints will be printed immediately, assisting in the conjecture or proof.
