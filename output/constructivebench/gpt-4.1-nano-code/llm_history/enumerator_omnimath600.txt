The problem involves comparing sums involving a sequence y and a parameter α, with the goal of understanding the minimal or specific values of α for which a certain inequality holds or fails. To assist in conjecturing the true value of `omnimath600_answer`, we'll numerically explore candidate α values, including both approximate and exact values, by trying small rational or real samples and checking the inequalities for small n and simple sequences y.

We'll fix small n (like 1 or 2), choose simple monotonic sequences y (like linear y, y(k) = k), and then check the inequality for different α to see when it satisfies the condition or violates it. By gradually varying α, we can bracket the critical value.

Here's a simple Python program to enumerate candidate α values, test the inequalities with small n and sequences, and stream answers relative to the bounds observed.

```python
import math

# Parameters for exploration
max_n = 2  # small sample for quick checks
candidate_alphas = [i/10 for i in range(1, 101)]  # 0.1 to 10 in steps of 0.1

# Define the sequence y(k) = k (strictly increasing, y(0)=0)
def y(k):
    return k

# Helper to compute sums for given alpha and check inequalities
def check_inequality(alpha):
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        sum_num = 0
        sum_den = 0
        for k in range(n):
            numerator = (k+1)**(3/2)
            denom_part = y(k+1)**2 - y(k)**2
            if denom_part <= 0:
                continue
            denominator = math.sqrt(denom_part)
            sum_num += numerator / denominator

            sum_den += ((k+1)**2 + 3*(k+1) + 3) / y(k+1)
        lhs = alpha * sum_num
        rhs = sum_den
        if lhs >= rhs:
            print(f"α = {alpha}: Inequality holds for n={n}")
        else:
            print(f"α = {alpha}: Inequality fails for n={n}")

# Bracket the critical alpha by observing where the inequality switches
for alpha in candidate_alphas:
    check_inequality(alpha)
```

This code tests multiple α values, small n, and simple y to aid conjecture. The streaming output reveals bounds where the inequality switches, helping identify the true critical α without hardcoding specific answers.
