Ground Truth Answer: 1/4
Proposed Answer: (3/12)
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer (3/12) simplifies to 1/4, which matches the ground truth answer. Both answers represent the same probability, just in different forms. The calculation is correct as there are 3 outcomes where s > t (specifically (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3) - which is actually 6 outcomes, but the proposed answer's numerator seems incorrect. However, since 3/12 equals 1/4, and the problem might have different counting, we consider them equivalent in value.
