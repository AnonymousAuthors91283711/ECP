100. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests the maximum size of such a family, considering the constraints, is that they must be pairwise differ in at least two positions among 6, with 10 options each. The largest such family corresponds to choosing a single constant pattern for each of the 10 options for each of the 6 positions, forming a maximum of 10 families.
