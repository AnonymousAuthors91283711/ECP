Ground Truth Answer: 32
Proposed Answer: 66 - 23 - (57 - 2 * 23)
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem gives:
   - blue = 57
   - yellow = 75
   - total_pairs = 66
   - blue_blue_pairs = 23

2. The ground truth answer is 32 (yellow-yellow pairs)

3. The proposed answer is: 66 - 23 - (57 - 2 * 23)

Let's evaluate the proposed answer:
- mixed_pairs = blue - 2 * blue_blue_pairs = 57 - 2*23 = 11
- yellow_yellow_pairs = total_pairs - blue_blue_pairs - mixed_pairs = 66 - 23 - 11 = 32

The proposed answer exactly matches the calculation that leads to the ground truth answer of 32. The expression 66 - 23 - (57 - 2*23) simplifies to 66 - 23 - 11 = 32.
