The pattern indicates permutations of (1, 2, 3). The condition is symmetric in a, b, c; thus the set contains exactly these ordered triples in any permutation. To describe this set directly, we consider the set of all permutations of (1, 2, 3).

The main issue in your proposed Lean expression is the misuse of the `.map` method on a set literal, which results in an unexpected token ',' because Lean expects a '↦' or '=>'. Also, the set `{a, b, c} = {1, 2, 3}` describes the unordered set, but the solution set should include all permutations of these three elements.

To fix this, I will explicitly list all permutations of (1, 2, 3), which are the six solutions, and define the set as a union of singleton sets containing each permutation. This approach avoids the syntax error and correctly captures all solutions.

Final answer:

<<<{
  (1, 2, 3),
  (1, 3, 2),
  (2, 1, 3),
  (2, 3, 1),
  (3, 1, 2),
  (3, 2, 1)
}>>>

This set explicitly enumerates all solutions, matches the enumerated answers provided, and corrected syntax errors associated with set construction and mapping.
