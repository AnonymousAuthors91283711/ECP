This problem seems to be about summing the greatest common divisors (GCD) of each integer n from 1 to 91 with 91. The sum involves checking gcd(n, 91), where 91 = 7 * 13. Since 7 and 13 are coprime primes, the divisors of 91 are 1, 7, 13, and 91. For each n, gcd(n, 91) can only be one of these divisors depending on whether n is divisible by 7, 13, both, or neither.

To enumerate the possible gcd values and compute their sums accordingly, I will:

- Enumerate all n from 1 to 91.
- For each n, compute gcd(n, 91).
- Sum the gcd values.

This will provide the total sum of all gcds for n in 1..91.

```python
# Enumerate n from 1 to 91
total_sum = 0
for n in range(1, 92):
    from math import gcd
    total_sum += gcd(n, 91)
    print(f"n={n}, gcd={gcd(n, 91)}")  # print partial results immediately
# Finally, print the total sum
print("Sum of gcd(n, 91) for n=1..91:", total_sum)
```
