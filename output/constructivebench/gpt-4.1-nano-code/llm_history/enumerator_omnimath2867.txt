The problem involves a recurrence relation:

s(n+4) = s(n+3) + s(n+2) + s(n+1) + s(n)

with initial values:
s(0)=1, s(1)=4, s(2)=2, s(3)=3.

We need to compute s(8) using these definitions. Since the relation is recursive, the straightforward way to get s(8) is to compute each value step-by-step from the initial conditions.

Let's enumerate the sequence:

- s(4) = s(3) + s(2) + s(1) + s(0) = 3 + 2 + 4 + 1 = 10
- s(5) = s(4) + s(3) + s(2) + s(1) = 10 + 3 + 2 + 4 = 19
- s(6) = s(5) + s(4) + s(3) + s(2) = 19 + 10 + 3 + 2 = 34
- s(7) = s(6) + s(5) + s(4) + s(3) = 34 + 19 + 10 + 3 = 66
- s(8) = s(7) + s(6) + s(5) + s(4) = 66 + 34 + 19 + 10 = 129

No complex approximation needed; exact values suffice. Let's implement this process in code.

```python
# Enumerate the sequence step-by-step based on the given recurrence
s = [1, 4, 2, 3]

for n in range(4, 9):
    next_value = s[n-1] + s[n-2] + s[n-3] + s[n-4]
    s.append(next_value)
    print(f"s({n}) = {next_value}")

# The answer for s(8)
print(f"s(8) = {s[8]}")
```
