The problem involves finding the least natural number \(b\) satisfying the given condition:

\[
\frac{3 + \binom{b}{2}}{\binom{6 + b}{2}} = \frac{1}{5}
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
5 \times (3 + \binom{b}{2}) = \binom{6 + b}{2}
\]

We want to find the smallest \(b > 0\) that satisfies this, by checking candidate values in ascending order and testing the equality.

```python
from math import comb

# Enumerate small b values starting from 1 upwards
for b in range(1, 100):  # 100 is arbitrary upper limit for search
    total = 6 + b
    same_color = 3 + comb(b, 2)
    denominator = comb(total, 2)
    # Check if the ratio matches 1/5 exactly
    if same_color * 5 == denominator:
        print(b)
        break  # Found the minimal b satisfying the condition
```
