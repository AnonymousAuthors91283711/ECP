Ground Truth Answer: 12
Proposed Answer: 4
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

The problem is counting the number of injective paths (where no two points are the same except the start/end at (0,0)) on a 4×4 grid that:
1. Start and end at (0,0)
2. Move only to adjacent cells (up/down/left/right) between steps
3. Visit every non-(0,0) point exactly once

This is essentially counting Hamiltonian cycles on a 4×4 grid starting and ending at (0,0), with specific movement constraints.

The ground truth answer is 12, which is correct for this type of problem (it counts all possible such cycles on a 4×4 grid).

The proposed answer is 4, which is incorrect. This might be counting only the most obvious symmetric paths but misses others.
