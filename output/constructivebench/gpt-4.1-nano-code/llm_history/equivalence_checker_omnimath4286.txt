Ground Truth Answer: {(0, 0), (2, 1), (-2, 1)}
Proposed Answer: { (x, y) | (x = 0 ∧ y = 0) ∨ (x^2 = 4 ∧ y = 1) }
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. The proposed answer states that the solutions are either (x=0 and y=0) or (x²=4 and y=1). This exactly corresponds to the ground truth solutions:
1. (0, 0) when x=0 and y=0
2. (2, 1) when x²=4 (x=2) and y=1
3. (-2, 1) when x²=4 (x=-2) and y=1
The proposed answer captures all cases in the ground truth answer, just expressed in a slightly different but mathematically equivalent form.
