abbrev omnimath1286_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath1286 : 
  ∃ (p q r s : ℕ), p.Prime ∧ q.Prime ∧ r.Prime ∧ s.Prime ∧ 27000001 = p * q * r * s ∧ p + q + r + s = omnimath1286_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: p=7, q=43, r=271, s=331, sum=652
p=7, q=271, r=43, s=331, sum=652
p=7, q=331, r=43, s=271, sum=652
. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<652>>>
This sum is the only invariant resulting from all prime arrangements shown in enumeration, and the problem asks for the sum directly.
