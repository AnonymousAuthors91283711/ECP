This problem asks for the sum of the sequence (5 * i) for i from 1 to 9. By definition, the sum is: 5 * (1 + 2 + ... + 9). Since the sum of the first n natural numbers is n(n+1)/2, we can compute 1+2+...+9 = 9*10/2=45, and then multiply by 5.

The code will explicitly enumerate the sum for i in 1..9, print each partial sum, and provide the total at the end, matching the output format and efficiency requirements.

```python
# Enumerate the sum of 5 * i for i in 1 to 9
sum_total = 0
for i in range(1, 10):
    current_value = 5 * i
    sum_total += current_value
    print(f"Adding 5*{i} = {current_value}, partial sum: {sum_total}")
print(f"The total sum from i=1 to 9 is: {sum_total}")
```
