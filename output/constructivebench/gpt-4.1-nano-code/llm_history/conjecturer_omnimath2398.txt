theorem omnimath2398 :
  let solutions : Finset ℤ := {100 * 6 + 10 * 6 + 3, 100 * 6 + 10 * 2 + 9, 100 * (-6) + 10 * (-18) + 21}
  ∑ s in solutions, s = omnimath2398_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 663
629

533. Expected Answer Type: ℤ
Let's analyze the given solutions: 663, 629, -759, and 533. They involve combinations of hundreds, tens, and units digits, suggesting a pattern based on digit sums or polynomial expressions.

Most solutions seem related to the digits or a formula involving 100, 10, and constant additions. Noticing 100*6 + 10*6 + 3 = 663, similarly 100*6 + 10*2 + 9 = 629, and 100*(-6) + 10*(-18) + 21 = -759, while 100*5 + 10*3 + 3 (not in solutions) would produce 533.

The sum of solutions is 663 + 629 - 759 + 533 = 1066. The sum suggests the total answer aggregates these components.

Given the pattern, the sum simplifies to the consolidated expression: 5 * 100 + 3 * 10 + 3 = 533, which is a standard combination in the options, but the summation directly matches the total sum 1066 divided by some factor. However, from the concrete sums, and recognizing the pattern, the total sum seems to be 1066. 

Thus, final answer: 1066.
