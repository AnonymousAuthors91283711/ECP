Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (-1)^(ceil (n / 2 : ℚ) - 1) * 2 * ceil (n / 2 : ℚ)
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => if n = 1 then 2 else if n % 2 = 0 then -4 else -4
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves calculating the determinant of a special matrix where each entry counts solutions to a Diophantine equation.

2. The ground truth answer shows:
   - A sign pattern alternating based on ceil(n/2)
   - A magnitude of 2*ceil(n/2)
   - This would produce: 2 for n=1, -4 for n=2, -4 for n=3, 8 for n=4, 8 for n=5, etc.

3. The proposed answer:
   - Gives 2 for n=1 (correct)
   - Gives -4 for all even n (incorrect - should alternate in magnitude)
   - Gives -4 for all odd n > 1 (incorrect - should alternate in magnitude)

The proposed answer is wrong for n ≥ 2 because:
- It doesn't account for the growing magnitude (2,4,6,...)
- It doesn't properly alternate the signs for even/odd cases
- It's constant (-4) for all n > 1, which contradicts the ground truth
