The problem involves five integers a, b, c, d, e, all distinct, with their transformed products satisfying \((6 - a)(6 - b)(6 - c)(6 - d)(6 - e) = 45\). To find their sum, we'll systematically enumerate possible integer triplets and verify the condition, then find the sum.

The key observations:
- 45 factors into small integers: \(45 = 3^2 \times 5\)
- Since \((6 - a)\) etc. are integers, and the product is positive, all factors are positive or an even number of negative factors.
- Factors likely to be small integers given the constraints.

Approach:
- Enumerate possible combinations of factors of 45 for the five integers, allowing negative values.
- For each factorization, derive candidate \((6 - a)\) etc.
- Solve for a single set of values, check distinctness, and compute \(a + b + c + d + e\).

Below is the Python code implementing this enumeration efficiently.

```python
# Enumerate possible factorizations of 45 into five integers (allow negatives)
from itertools import product

# All factors of 45 (both positive and negative)
possible_factors = [i for i in range(1, 46)] + [-i for i in range(1, 46)]

# Store answers
answers = set()

# Generate all 5-tuples of factors whose product is 45
for combo in product(possible_factors, repeat=5):
    product_val = 1
    for num in combo:
        product_val *= num
    if product_val == 45:
        # For each combination, derive a, b, c, d, e
        a_vals = [6 - combo[0]]
        b_vals = [6 - combo[1]]
        c_vals = [6 - combo[2]]
        d_vals = [6 - combo[3]]
        e_vals = [6 - combo[4]]
        candidate_set = [a_vals[0], b_vals[0], c_vals[0], d_vals[0], e_vals[0]]
        # Check for distinctness
        if len(set(candidate_set)) == 5:
            total = sum(candidate_set)
            print(total)
            answers.add(total)

# Output the (possibly minimal or maximal) answer
print("Possible sums:", sorted(answers))
```

This script enumerates all solutions, printing their sums as they are found. The final print shows all candidate sums. Since the problem asks to find the answer \(a + b + c + d + e\), this approach helps conjecture the range and specific value of the sum without hardcoding earlier.
