The problem defines a property "EssentiallyIncreasing" for functions on real numbers and seeks the least `k` such that there exists a family of functions satisfying certain conditions over a finite index set. It involves combinatorial and analysis reasoning, but since we're asked to implement code for enumeration and conjecture without complex proof, we'll focus on small sample values, simple function patterns, and candidate enumeration.

Given the constraints:
- To find the minimal `k` (number of functions/families).
- For `x : Fin 2022 → ℝ` and `f : Fin k → (ℝ → ℝ)` satisfying the sum condition with `x`.
- Each `f i` must be "essentially increasing."
- The sum over `i` `f i (x n)` equals `x n` for all `n`.

Since the primary goal is to explore minimal `k`, starting with small values like 1 or 2 makes sense. For simplicity, we'll sample with small parameters and define a set of candidate functions, iterate through possible configurations, and print those satisfying the conditions.

```python
# This script estimates the minimal number of essentially increasing functions needed.
# It attempts small values of k and simple function candidates to see if conditions hold.
# It reports solutions immediately upon finding valid configurations.

def is_essentially_increasing(f_values):
    # Checks if the function values satisfy the EssentiallyIncreasing property.
    for s_idx, s in enumerate(f_values):
        for t_idx, t in enumerate(f_values):
            if s_idx <= t_idx:
                if not (s <= t):
                    return False
    return True

    # Generate candidate functions: simple linear functions with small slopes.
    # For testing, consider functions f_i(x) = a_i * x + b_i with small integer coefficients.
    candidates = []
    for a in range(-1, 2):  # slopes: -1, 0, 1
        for b in range(0, 2):  # intercepts 0 or 1
            f = lambda x, a=a, b=b: a * x + b

    # For each i, pick a candidate function from this list

        for f in funcs:
            total += f(x[n])
        # Allow small floating error

    return True
