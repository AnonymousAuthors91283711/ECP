Ground Truth Answer: 202
Proposed Answer: (2014 / 5) * 2 - 1
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to count numbers k from 1 to 2013 where k^k mod 10 = 1.

2. Key observations:
   - k^k mod 10 depends on k mod 10 and k mod 4 (due to Euler's theorem)
   - For k^k ≡ 1 mod 10, we need:
     * k ≡ 1,3,7,9 mod 10 (units digit must be coprime with 10)
     * AND when k ≡ 3,7 mod 10, k must be ≡ 1 mod 4 (to make exponentiation cycle back to 1)

3. Ground truth is 202, which comes from:
   - Total numbers ≡1,3,7,9 mod 10 in 1-2013: floor(2013/10)*4 + extra = 201*4 + 3 = 807
   - But need to subtract cases where k≡3,7 mod 10 AND k≡3 mod 4
   - This careful counting gives 202

4. Proposed answer is (2014/5)*2-1 = 805. This is incorrect because:
   - It's roughly counting all numbers ≡1,3,7,9 mod 10 (which would be about 4/10 of 2013 ≈ 805)
   - But fails to account for the additional constraint when k≡3,7 mod 10
