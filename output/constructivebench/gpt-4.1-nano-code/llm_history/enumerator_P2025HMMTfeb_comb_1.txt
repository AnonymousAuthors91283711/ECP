This problem involves enumerating permutations of 7 elements (indices 0 to 6) to satisfy specific inequalities involving their images under a permutation `f`. For each permutation `f`, we check the inequalities:

- For all `i` in 0..5, ensure `(f i + 1)*(f (i+1) + 1) ≤ 20`
- For `i=6`, ensure `(f 6 + 1)*(f 0 + 1) ≤ 20`

We need to count how many permutations satisfy these conditions (`Finset.card` of the set). To explore this, we'll explicitly generate permutations of the set {0,..,6}, check the conditions, and tally or print satisfying ones. We’ll also print the total number of solutions.

Here's the code:

```python
from itertools import permutations

# Generate permutations of 0..6
indices = range(7)
count = 0

# For demonstration, store solutions if desired (not required, but useful for verification)
solutions = []

for perm in permutations(indices):
    # Check inequalities
    valid = True
    for i in range(6):
        if (perm[i] + 1)*(perm[i+1] + 1) > 20:
            valid = False
            break
    if valid:
        # Check the wrap-around condition for i=6
        if (perm[6] + 1)*(perm[0] + 1) > 20:
            continue
        # If all conditions are satisfied
        count += 1
        solutions.append(perm)
        # Print solutions directly
        print(f"Permutation: {perm}")
print(f"Total satisfying permutations: {count}")
```

This code enumerates all permutations, tests the inequalities, streams solutions as found, and finally reports the total count. This helps in formulating a conjecture about the total number of permutations obeying the constraints.
