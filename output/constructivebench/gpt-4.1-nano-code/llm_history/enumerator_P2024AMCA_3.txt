The problem asks for the least natural number k such that there exists a multiset s of integers between 10 (inclusive) and 100 (exclusive) with sum exactly 2024. To analyze, we need to generate candidate multisets, sum their elements, and find the minimum sum achieving the condition.

Since the task involves finding the minimal sum that can be exactly 2024, and the elements are between 10 and 99, we should check combinations of such integers whose sum is 2024. To simplify computation:

- Determine the minimal number of elements needed (by dividing 2024 by 99).
- Generate candidate multisets with varying sizes.
- Check sums efficiently by iterating over possible multisets.

Here's a Python program to do this enumeration, printing each candidate sum exactly matching 2024 until we find the minimal that satisfies the condition. We limit the size of multisets for efficiency and stop upon finding the minimum.

```python
from itertools import combinations_with_replacement

# Range of numbers to choose from
numbers = list(range(10, 100))

# Since elements are at least 10, the max number of elements to reach 2024 is ceil(2024/10)=203
# To limit runtime, set a maximum size for candidate multisets
max_size = 50

# Track the minimal sum found (should be 2024, but in case of approximation)
found_sums = set()

for size in range(1, max_size + 1):
    # Generate multisets with replacement since elements can repeat
    for s in combinations_with_replacement(numbers, size):
        total = sum(s)
        if total == 2024:
            # Count number of elements in s
            length = len(s)
            print(f"Multiset size: {length}, sum: {total}")
            # We only need to find the minimal sum, so once found, can break
            # but here, to be complete, continue to find all
            found_sums.add(total)

# After enumeration, the minimum achievable sum matching the criteria
if 2024 in found_sums:
    print("Found a multiset summing to 2024.")
else:
    print("No such multiset found within size limit.")
```
