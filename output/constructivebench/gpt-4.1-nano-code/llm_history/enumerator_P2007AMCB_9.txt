This problem involves a function \(f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) satisfying a functional equation \(f(3x - 1) = x^2 + x + 1\). The goal is to find \(f(5)\). Given the information, we can substitute specific \(x\) values to find \(f\) at points, especially at \(x\) where \(3x-1\) equals the point of interest. Since the problem asks for a concrete answer for \(f(5)\), we try to find an \(x\) such that \(3x -1=5\), i.e., \(x=2\).

We will check \(f(5)\) via the equation:

\[f(5) = f(3 \times 2 - 1) = 2^2 + 2 + 1=4+2+1=7\]

Thus, \(f(5)=7\). To verify, we will construct the code that computes this for the given \(x\).

```python
# The key point: for x where 3x-1=5, i.e. x=2
x = 2
# From the functional equation: f(3x-1) = x^2 + x + 1
f_5 = 2**2 + 2 + 1  # which yields 7
print(f"f(5) = {f_5}")
```
