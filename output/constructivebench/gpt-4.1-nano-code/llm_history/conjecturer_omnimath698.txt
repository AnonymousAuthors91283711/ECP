The main error stems from trying to assign a value to `k` in the definition of `omnimath698_answer`, where `k` is a parameter of the theorem, not a fixed value. To fix this, I should define `omnimath698_answer` as a fixed real number that fits the context suggested by the relations and constraints.

From the pattern in the relations:
- All angles are positive and their sum is \( 2\pi \).
- The tangent relations involve coefficients 3, 4, 5, and 6 respectively, with the same parameter \(k\).
- The ratios seem to suggest symmetrical or proportional relationships leading to a specific constant value.

Given the symmetries and ratios, and the fact that the relations involve \(1 + 1 / \cos\theta\), an educated guess, consistent with a common parametrization, is that:
- \(k = 1\).

This choice simplifies the relations:
- \(\tan w = \frac{1 + 1 / \cos w}{3}\),
- and similarly for \(x, y, z\),
which satisfies the pattern and suggests a natural solution with minimal constants.

Thus, the correct way to define `omnimath698_answer` in Lean is as a fixed real number `1`.

Final answer:
<<<1>>>
