This problem asks us to analyze whether for every positive integer \( n \), there exists some \( k \) such that for all \( m \geq k \), the digit 5 appears in the decimal expansion of \( n \times 5^m \). We need to produce an enumerator program that can help infer the answer.

Key observations:
- The expression \( n \times 5^m \) involves multiplying by powers of 5.
- Multiplying by 5 shifts the decimal representation and can introduce or eliminate certain digits depending on \( n \).
- For \( n \) coprime with 10, for large enough \( m \), \( n \times 5^m \) will have certain predictable patterns.
- To illustrate, we will pick small \( n \) values and enumerate some \( m \), find the decimal representations, and check for digit 5.

The code will:
- Fix some small \( n \) (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
- For each \( n \), iterate \( m \) from 1 up to some small limit (say 20).
- Compute \( n \times 5^m \).
- Check if the decimal representation contains '5'.
- Print the results immediately.

This helps us gather evidence about whether the hypothesis that for all \( n \), eventually, a '5' digit appears in \( n \times 5^m \).

```python
# Enumerate small n and m, check for digit '5' in n * 5^m
def main():
    max_m = 20
    ns = [1, 2, 3]
    for n in ns:
        for m in range(1, max_m + 1):
            val = n * (5 ** m)
            s = str(val)
            if '5' in s:
                print(f"n={n}, m={m}, {n}*5^{m}={val}, digits={s} (contains 5)")
            else:
                print(f"n={n}, m={m}, {n}*5^{m}={val}, digits={s} (no 5)")
main()
```
