The problem involves summing over certain binomial coefficient products for small ranges, which suggests enumerating small combinations explicitly. Since the problem is from a math contest, trying to verify all values of a, b within the ranges and summing the results is manageable.

We will:
- Enumerate all small values of a in 0..6,
- For each a, enumerate b in 0..(7 - a) - 1,
- Compute and sum the binomial coefficients `C(6, a) * C(6, b) * C(6, a + b)` for each pair,
- Print each term as we go for transparency.

This will help us verify the overall sum mod 1000, without hard-coding the answer.

```python
from math import comb

total = 0
for a in range(7):
    for b in range(7 - a):
        val = comb(6, a) * comb(6, b) * comb(6, a + b)
        print(f"a={a}, b={b}, term={val}")
        total += val
print(f"Total sum: {total}")
print(f"Sum mod 1000: {total % 1000}")
```
