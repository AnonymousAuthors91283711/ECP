The problem asks to find the value of \( x \) satisfying the equation \(\linebreak (10)^x \times (10)^5 = (100)^4 \). We proceed by algebraic reasoning:

\((10)^x \times (10)^5 = (10)^{x+5}\).  
\((100)^4 = (10^2)^4 = 10^{2 \times 4} = 10^8\).

Set equal: \(10^{x+5} = 10^8\).  
Since the base 10 is positive and not 1, equate exponents:

\[x + 5 = 8 \Rightarrow x = 3\].

Let's implement a Python enumeration for validation:

```python
# Enumerate possible x values around the identified solution to verify equality
solutions = []
for x_int in range(0, 10):  # Check integer values from 0 to 9
    lhs = 10 ** x_int * 10 ** 5
    rhs = 10 ** 8
    if abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-12:  # Numerical tolerance
        print(f"x = {x_int} satisfies equation: {lhs} = {rhs}")
        solutions.append(x_int)
# Since the solution is exact at x=3, the output confirms that
```

This approach finds \( x=3 \) as the unique solution.

```python
# Full code to derive and verify the solution
solutions = []
for x_int in range(0, 10):
    lhs = 10 ** x_int * 10 ** 5
    rhs = 10 ** 8
    if abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-12:
        print(f"x = {x_int} satisfies equation: {lhs} = {rhs}")
        solutions.append(x_int)
# Output: x=3
```

Thus, the answer to the theorem:

```python
import math

# Since the solution is x=3:
abbrev omnimath2817_answer : ℝ := 3

theorem omnimath2817 (x : ℝ) : (10 : ℝ)^x * (10 : ℝ)^5 = (100 : ℝ)^4 ↔ x = omnimath2817_answer := by
  -- algebraic solution confirms x=3 as the unique solution
  sorry -- placeholder noting the algebraic derivation
```
