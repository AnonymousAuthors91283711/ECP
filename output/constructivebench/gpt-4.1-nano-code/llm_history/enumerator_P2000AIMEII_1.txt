This problem requires finding natural numbers \(m\) and \(n\) that are coprime, positive, and satisfy the equation:

\[
\frac{m}{n} = \frac{2}{5} + \frac{8}{25}
\]

First, combine the fractions on the right:

\[
\frac{2}{5} + \frac{8}{25} = \frac{10}{25} + \frac{8}{25} = \frac{18}{25}
\]

So, the problem simplifies to:

\[
\frac{m}{n} = \frac{18}{25}
\]

Since \(m, n\) are coprime and their ratio equals \(\frac{18}{25}\), the only possibility is:

\[
m = 18, \quad n = 25
\]

as they are already coprime and positive. Then,

\[
m + n = 43
\]

We'll verify this and print the result directly.

```python
# Enumerate m, n with m/n = 18/25, coprime, m>0, n>0
# Since the ratio is fixed, the coprime pair is (18, 25)

m = 18
n = 25
answer = m + n
print(answer)
```
