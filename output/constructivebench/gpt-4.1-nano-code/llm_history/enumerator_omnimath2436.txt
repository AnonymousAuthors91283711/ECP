To solve this problem, we need to find the minimal value of a certain sum over points forming a unit square, with the variables constrained such that the bottom-left corner \( (x, y) \) has positive coordinates (since \( h: 0 < 1 \) is a placeholder for positivity). The sum is composed of four terms, each related to the vertices of the square:

\[
s = \sum_{i=1}^{4} \big( p_i^2 + 2 p_i + q_i^2 + 4 q_i \big)
\]

where \( p_i \) and \( q_i \) are coordinates of the vertices, defined in terms of \( x \) and \( y \). The vertices are:

- \( p_1 = (x, y) \)
- \( p_2 = (x+1, y) \)
- \( p_3 = (x+1, y+1) \)
- \( p_4 = (x, y+1) \)

The sum simplifies to expressions in \( x \) and \( y \). To find the minimal sum, evaluate it over small fixed ranges of \( x \) and \( y \). Since the problem looks continuous, but we're told to enumerate, we pick small integer ranges where the minimum might occur.

Here's a Python program that numerically searches over small \( x, y \) values to find the minimal sum, prints all candidate sums, and ultimately outputs the minimal one.

```python
# Enumerate over small integers for x and y to approximate the minimum sum
# Since the problem is continuous, we choose small bounds and step size
# to find candidates for the least sum.

min_sum = None
min_x_y = None

# We look at x and y in a small range, e.g., 0 to 5
for x in range(0, 6):
    for y in range(0, 6):
        # Define vertices
        p1 = (x, y)
        p2 = (x + 1, y)
        p3 = (x + 1, y + 1)
        p4 = (x, y + 1)
        # Compute sum
        s = (
            p1[0]**2 + 2 * p1[0] + p1[1]**2 + 4 * p1[1]
            + p2[0]**2 + 2 * p2[0] + p2[1]**2 + 4 * p2[1]
            + p3[0]**2 + 2 * p3[0] + p3[1]**2 + 4 * p3[1]
            + p4[0]**2 + 2 * p4[0] + p4[1]**2 + 4 * p4[1]
        )
        # Print candidates immediately
        print(f"x={x}, y={y} => sum={s}")
        if (min_sum is None) or (s < min_sum):
            min_sum = s
            min_x_y = (x, y)

print(f"Minimum sum found: {min_sum} at x={min_x_y[0]}, y={min_x_y[1]}")

# This approach provides a set of candidates; the true minimum in the continuous case
# might be at a real number, but this discretization gives a good estimate.
