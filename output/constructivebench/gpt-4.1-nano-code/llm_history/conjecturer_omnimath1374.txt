. Enumerated answers: Computed coefficients: a=-1.9999999999999976, b=-14.0, c=13.999999999999975, d=24.00000000000001
f(1) = 22.999999999999986. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests the polynomial f(x) resembles a quadratic with a correction term for the degree 4. Based on pattern matching coefficients and evaluations, the answer likely simplifies to f(1) = 24.
