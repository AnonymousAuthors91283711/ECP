    (∀ x y, f (x + g y) = x * f y - y * f x + g x) ↔

Ground Truth Answer: fun t => 
    (fun x => t * (x - t) / (t + 1), 
     fun x => t * (x - t))
Proposed Answer: fun t : ℝ => if t = -1 then (fun x => -2 * x, fun x => x - 2) else (fun x => t * x - t^2, fun x => (t + 1) * x + t^2)
Let's analyze the proposed answer against the ground truth:

1. For t ≠ -1:
- Ground truth f(x) = t*(x-t)/(t+1) = (t*x - t²)/(t+1)
- Proposed f(x) = t*x - t² → This is different (missing division by (t+1))
- Ground truth g(x) = t*(x-t) = t*x - t²
- Proposed g(x) = (t+1)*x + t² → This is different (both coefficient and sign)

2. For t = -1:
- The ground truth is undefined at t = -1 (division by zero)
- The proposed answer provides a special case, but it's not clear if this satisfies the original equation

The proposed solution differs significantly from the ground truth in both cases (t=-1 and t≠-1), and doesn't appear to satisfy the original functional equation.
