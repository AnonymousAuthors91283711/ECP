The problem seeks the minimal n such that 123456789 * 10^n equals k*(2^26*5^4) with gcd(k,10)=1. Since gcd(k,10)=1 implies k is coprime with 2 and 5, k must absorb all factors of 123456789 not in 10^n. 123456789 = 3^2*3607*3803, which contains no factors of 2 or 5; thus, n must compensate for the factors in 123456789 to ensure divisibility, leading to the minimal n = 0 to satisfy the relation directly.

The main issue is that your current proposed answer is written as a natural language explanation rather than a Lean expression. Additionally, the placeholder "sorry" in your definition needs to be replaced with an explicit Lean expression of type ℕ. 

Given the problem: find the minimal n such that 123456789 * 10^n = k * (2^26 * 5^4) with gcd(k,10)=1. Since gcd(k,10)=1, k is coprime with 2 and 5, meaning k has no factors of 2 or 5. The factors of 10^n are powers of 2 and 5, so to make the product divisible by 10^n, 123456789 must absorb all factors of 2 and 5 in the right side, or, more precisely, 123456789 must be divisible by 2^26 * 5^4 for some minimal n.

Analyzing prime factors:

- 123456789 factors as 3^2 * 3607 * 3803, which contains no factors of 2 or 5.

- To equalize both sides, 10^n = 2^n * 5^n must divide the RHS such that 123456789 * 10^n is divisible by 2^{26} * 5^4. Because 123456789 has no factors of 2 or 5, these must come entirely from 10^n, implying n ≥ 26 to supply the 2's and n ≥ 4 to supply the 5's.

- The minimal n satisfying these is n = max(26, 4) = 26.

- Since 123456789 shares no factors of 2 or 5, for k to be coprime with 10, we need:

     123456789 * 10^n = k * 2^{26} * 5^{4}

equality, which holds with the minimal n=26, and for k:

  k = (123456789) * 10^n / (2^{26} * 5^{4})

Given the above, the minimal n is 26.

Therefore, the answer in Lean should be:

<<<26>>>

This is a closed-form minimal integer consistent with the problem constraints and the analysis. 

Note: The answer is fully explicit and has been derived logically based on factorization considerations.
