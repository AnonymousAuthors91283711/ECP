This problem involves finding the set of real numbers x for which x equals the sum of the alternating series ∑_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n+1} x^n. Recognizing this series, it is a geometric series with alternating signs, which converges when |x| < 1 and can be summed explicitly to a closed-form expression.

The series ∑_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n+1} x^n equals x / (1 + x) (for |x| < 1). Therefore, the set of solutions is all real x satisfying x = x / (1 + x), under |x| < 1.

We can analyze this algebraically:

x = x / (1 + x)  
=> x(1 + x) = x  
=> x + x^2 = x  
=> x^2 = 0  
=> x = 0

So the only candidate is x=0, and since the series converges at x=0 (the sum is zero), the solution set is {0}.

Now, to explore potential other solutions outside |x|<1, note that the sum is valid only within radius of convergence, so the only solutions satisfy x=0.

However, to verify if the series might be sum-able outside its radius, or could have other solutions at boundary points, we can check the boundary points x=1 and x=-1:

At x=1: series sum ∑_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n+1} * 1^n = 1 -1 +1 -1 + ... accumulator converges to 1/2 (alternating series test). But the sum x / (1 + x) at x=1 is 1/2, matching. But the algebraic equation is x= x / (1 + x), which at x=1: 1=1/2? No. So, algebraically not matching.

At x=-1: series sum ∑_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n+1} * (-1)^n = ∑_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n+1} * (-1)^n, which simplifies to ∑_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{2n + 1} = ∑_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{odd} = sum of -1's: diverges.

Thus, outside the convergence radius, the series diverges, and the set reduces to {0}.

Finally, the set of solutions is {0}.

Below is a Python script that demonstrates enumeration ideas for the solutions around the key point, confirming that only x=0 works in the domain of convergence.

```python
# Enumeration of candidate solutions for the sum series
# Series: sum_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n+1} x^n
# Closed form: x / (1 + x), valid for |x| < 1
# The equation: x = x / (1 + x) => x^2 = 0 => x=0

# To verify, check candidate values of x within a small interval
candidates = [-0.99, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 0.99]
for x in candidates:
    # Check the sum if |x|<1
    if abs(x) < 1:
        sum_series = x / (1 + x)
        # verify if x equals sum
        if abs(x - sum_series) < 1e-8:
            print(f"x = {x} satisfies the sum: {sum_series}")
        else:
            print(f"x = {x} does not satisfy the sum: {sum_series}")
    else:
        print(f"x = {x} outside radius of convergence, ignored.")
```
