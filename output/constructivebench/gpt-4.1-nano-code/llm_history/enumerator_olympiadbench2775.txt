This problem involves analyzing a recursive function `A` that depends on whether `(n+1)` is a perfect square. To understand the behavior, especially for specific inputs like `K = 9 * T` with `T = 7`, we first need to generate values of `A n` for small `n`, paying special attention to whether `(n+1)` is a perfect square.

Given the constraints, I will:

- Generate values of `A n` for a small range covering `K = 63`.
- Determine when `(n+1)` is a perfect square.
- Stream the answers directly as I compute (e.g., values of `A` at each `n`), helping to conjecture the value of `A K`.

```python
import math

def is_perfect_square(x):
    r = int(math.isqrt(x))
    return r * r == x

# Function to compute A(n) with memoization for efficiency
memo = {0: 0, 1: 2}
def A(n):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    if is_perfect_square(n + 1):
        val = int(math.isqrt(n + 1))
    else:
        val = A(n - 1) + 1
    memo[n] = val
    print(f"A({n}) = {val}")
    return val

# Generate values up to K=63
K = 9 * 7  # T=7
for n in range(K + 1):
    A(n)
```
