theorem P2000AIMEII_4 :
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ 
    Finset.card (Finset.filter (fun d => d ∣ n ∧ Odd d) (Finset.range (n + 1))) = 6 ∧ 
    Finset.card (Finset.filter (fun d => d ∣ n ∧ Even d) (Finset.range (n + 1))) = 12} 
  P2000AIMEII_4_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 180. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The provided enumeration hints that the number is a multiple of both 6 and 12 components, suggesting 180 fits total divisor counts in the given filtering. Based on the pattern, the answer consolidates divisor counts with these properties. Conjecture matches enumeration pattern: 180.
