Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: (1/2) * ((1 + sqrt 2)^2004 + (1 - sqrt 2)^2004)
<<<None>>>

Since the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's intentionally left undefined in Lean), we cannot verify the equivalence of the proposed answer. The proposed answer appears to be a closed-form solution to the recurrence relation, but without knowing the intended ground truth, we cannot confirm whether they match. The recurrence relation does suggest a solution involving powers of (1±√2), but we lack the necessary information to make a definitive comparison.
