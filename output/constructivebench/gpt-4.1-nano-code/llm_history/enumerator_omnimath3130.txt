The problem involves solving the equation:

\[ (1000w + 100x + 10y + z) + (100x + 10y + z) + (10y + z) + z = 2014 \]

with the constraints:
- \( 1 \leq w \leq 9 \),
- \( 0 \leq x, y, z \leq 9 \).

Let's analyze the sum:

\[
(1000w + 100x + 10y + z) + (100x + 10y + z) + (10y + z) + z
\]

which simplifies to:

\[
1000w + (100x + 100x) + (10y + 10y + 10y) + (z + z + z + z)
\]
\[
= 1000w + 200x + 30y + 4z
\]

We want all integer solutions within the digit bounds where:

\[
1000w + 200x + 30y + 4z = 2014
\]

and:

\[
w \in [1..9], \quad x, y, z \in [0..9]
\]

Our approach:
- Iterate over all possible \(w\),
- and for each \(w\), iterate over all \(x, y, z\),
- check if the sum equals 2014,
- if so, print the sum \(w + x + y + z\).

We will compute only the relevant options and sum their digits accordingly.

```python
# Enumerate all possible values of w, x, y, z within constraints
# and find solutions to the sum equation.

for w in range(1, 10):  # w from 1 to 9
    for x in range(0, 10):
        for y in range(0, 10):
            for z in range(0, 10):
                total = 1000*w + 200*x + 30*y + 4*z
                if total == 2014:
                    answer = w + x + y + z
                    print(answer)
```

This code prints all possible sums \(w + x + y + z\) for solutions satisfying the equation.
