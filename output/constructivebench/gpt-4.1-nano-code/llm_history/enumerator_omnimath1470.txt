This problem involves number theory concepts: divisors, the totient function (Ï†), and summations over divisors. The key steps are:

- Compute \( n \) as the product of the first 10 primes.
- For each divisor \( x \) of \( n \), sum over divisors \( y \) of \( n/x \), multiplying \( \phi(x) \) and \( y \).
- Sum all these contributions, then divide by \( n \).

Given the structure, an efficient approach is:

1. Generate all divisors of \( n \).
2. For each divisor \( x \), find divisors of \( n/x \).
3. Sum \( \phi(x) \times y \) over these.
4. Sum across all \( x \), then divide by \( n \).

We avoid computing directly all divisor pairs naively by recognizing that the divisors of \( n \), with \( n \) as the product of the first 10 primes, can be systematically generated. Since the primes are small, enumerating all divisor combinations is feasible.

We implement this with minimal tokens, stream results when available, and keep calculations exact.

```python
from math import gcd
from itertools import product

# List of first 10 primes
primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]

# Compute n as product of these primes
n = 1
exps = []
for p in primes:
    n *= p

# Generate all divisors of n
# Since n is square-free with prime exponents 1, divisors correspond to subsets of prime factors
divisors = [1]
prime_factors = [(p, 1) for p in primes]
# For each divisor, generate divisors by subset multiplication
def generate_divisors(primes):
    divisors = [1]
    for p in primes:
        temp = []
        for d in divisors:
            temp.append(d)
            temp.append(d * p)
        divisors = temp
    return list(set(divisors))
div_list = generate_divisors(primes)

# Precompute phi for all divisors
phi_cache = {}
def phi(x):
    if x in phi_cache:
        return phi_cache[x]
    result = x
    for p in primes:
        if p * p > x:
            break
        if x % p == 0:
            while x % p == 0:
                x //= p
            result -= result // p
    if x > 1:
        result -= result // x
    phi_cache[x] = result
    return result

total_sum = 0
for x in div_list:
    phi_x = phi(x)
    n_over_x = n // x
    # Generate divisors of n/x
    y_divs = [d for d in div_list if n_over_x % d == 0]
    for y in y_divs:
        total_sum += phi_x * y
        print(f"Divisor x: {x}, y: {y}, phi(x): {phi_x}, product: {phi_x * y}")
result = total_sum // n
print(f"Total sum divided by n: {result}")
```

This code efficiently enumerates all divisor pairs, computes \(\phi(x)\), sums the products, and divides by \( n \). It prints intermediate divisor pairs for transparency. This approach is suitable for a high-school difficulty problem reduced to divisor enumeration and totient calculations.
