Ground Truth Answer: 401
Proposed Answer: (2 * 2009 - 3)!! / (2 * 2009)!! * 10
Let me analyze this carefully.

1. The problem involves calculating a sum of ratios of double factorials, then extracting properties of its denominator when expressed in reduced form.

2. The ground truth answer is 401, which appears to be the final simplified result of the computation.

3. The proposed answer is an expression involving double factorials, but:
   - It's not simplified to a numeric value
   - It's not clear how this expression relates to the denominator properties (a and b) in the problem statement
   - The expression appears to be just one term from the sum (for i=2009) rather than the complete sum

4. The proposed answer doesn't match the form or value of the ground truth answer, and doesn't address the core computation required by the problem.
