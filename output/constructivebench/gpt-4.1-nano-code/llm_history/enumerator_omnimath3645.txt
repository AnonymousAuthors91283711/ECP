This problem involves a sequence {x(n)} with initial conditions and a recurrence relation involving the least common multiple (lcm). Our goal is to analyze the sequence behavior, specifically the gcd of two large terms. Since the code is in Lean and uses `GCDMonoid.lcm`, and the sequence's recurrence involves both addition and lcm, we should compute small terms to look for patterns, especially focusing on gcd and lcm.

Here's a plan:
- Generate the first few terms explicitly.
- Check for patterns in gcd and lcm.
- Use small values for n, observe the behavior, and attempt to infer the gcd or lcm for large n.

The code will:
- Initialize the sequence with the given values.
- Compute subsequent terms up to a small n (say 10).
- Output the sequence, gcdivs, and lcm for these terms.

This aids in conjecturing the behavior of the sequence.

```python
from math import gcd
from math import lcm

# Initial values
x1 = 19
x2 = 95

# List to store sequence values
sequence = [x1, x2]

# Generate next terms using the recurrence
for n in range(2, 10):
    prev = sequence[-1]
    prev_prev = sequence[-2]
    next_val = lcm(prev, prev_prev) + prev
    sequence.append(next_val)
    print(f"n={n+1}: x({n+1}) = {next_val} (gcd={gcd(prev, prev_prev)}, lcm={lcm(prev, prev_prev)})")

# Output the sequence for analysis
print("Sequence up to n=10:", sequence)
```
