The problem appears to involve a simple arithmetic calculation: evaluate \(4 \times (18 - 2)\). The code defines a constant answer, but it's marked as `sorry`. To assist, we'll write a Python script that enumerates possible answers; in this case, it involves directly computing the expression and printing the result.

Since the calculation is straightforward, the only task is to compute and print \(4 \times (18 - 2) = 4 \times 16 = 64\).

```python
# Enumerate all candidate answers for the expression 4 * (18 - 2)
# In this simple case, just compute the value and print it.
result = 4 * (18 - 2)
print(result)
```
