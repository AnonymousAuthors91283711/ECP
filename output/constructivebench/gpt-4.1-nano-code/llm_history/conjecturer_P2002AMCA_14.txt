abbrev P2002AMCA_14_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2002AMCA_14 : 
  let f := fun (n : ℕ) => logb 2002 (n^2)
  let N := f 11 + f 13 + f 14
  N = P2002AMCA_14_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 2.0
. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Based on the pattern and the given enumeration, the sum involves logs of perfect squares over various bases, which simplifies to sums of logs: log_b(n^2) = 2 log_b(n). Hence, N = 2 (log_b 11 + log_b 13 + log_b 14). Since the base is 2002 and logs add under multiplication, the sum simplifies to 2*log_b(11*13*14). Calculating 11 * 13 * 14 = 2002, so total = 2 * log_b 2002 = 2.0.
