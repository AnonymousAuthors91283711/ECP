The problem appears to be an advanced mathematics challenge inspired by an Olympiad problem, involving functions, iteration, and potential constraints. Since the exact problem statement is partial and contains placeholders, I will assume it involves exploring functions from the positive integers to itself, satisfying a recursive-like condition with iterates, possibly aiming to identify functions that satisfy a given functional equation.

Given the task, I'll write a Python enumerator to generate candidate functions or values based on small parameter samplings to assist in conjecture, focusing on the fixed points or simple solutions. The code will systematically explore small functions, verify the key properties, and print potential solutions as soon as found.

This approach assumes the problem involves searching for functions or values satisfying some recursive relation under positivity constraints, and we explore small candidates.

```python
# Enumerate small functions from ℕ → ℕ with positive values, inspecting potential solutions
def enumerate_functions(max_value=10, max_domain=5):
    # Generate all functions from a small domain to ℕ with values up to max_value
    from itertools import product
    domain = range(1, max_domain + 1)
    for values in product(range(1, max_value + 1), repeat=max_domain):
        f = dict(zip(domain, values))
        yield f

def check_condition(f, a, b):
    # Placeholder for the condition: (f^[f a](a+1)) = (a+1)*f b
    # Since the actual functional equation is complex, we test simplified forms
    # Approximate or simulate the iteration
    def iterate_fn(n, times):
        result = n
        for _ in range(times):
            result = f.get(result, 0) # default to 0 if not defined
        return result

    try:
        iter_count = f[a]
        left = iterate_fn(a+1, iter_count)
        right = (a+1) * f[b]
        return left == right
    except KeyError:
        return False

# Main enumeration loop
for f in enumerate_functions():
    # Check the property on small sample values
    for a in range(1, 4):
        for b in range(1, 4):
            if check_condition(f, a, b):
                print(f"Candidate function: {f}")
                break
    # Early break for demonstration
```

This code systematically searches small functions, checks the functional relation approximately, and prints out potential functions that satisfy the relation on small inputs. Adjust the `enumerate_functions` parameters and the `check_condition` depending on the exact problem constraints once clarified.
