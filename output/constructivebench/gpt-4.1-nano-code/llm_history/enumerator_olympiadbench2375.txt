The problem involves solving the equation \(3^{x-1} \times 9^{\frac{3}{2x^2}} = 27\) over real numbers. To assist in conjecturing the solution set, we will evaluate candidate values for \(x\), especially small and notable points, checking if they satisfy the equation. We will also attempt simplified forms and approximate solutions to identify potential solutions.

```python
import math

# Function to evaluate the left side of the equation
def evaluate(x):
    try:
        lhs = 3**(x - 1) * 9**(3 / (2 * x**2))
        return lhs
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        return None

# Candidate values for x, including small and notable points
candidates = [-2, -1, -0.5, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3]

# Threshold for considering approximate equality
threshold = 1e-6

for x in candidates:
    val = evaluate(x)
    if val is not None:
        print(f"x = {x}, evaluates to {val}")
        # Check if approximately equal to 27
        if abs(val - 27) < threshold:
            print(f"Approximate solution found at x = {x}: {val} â‰ˆ 27")
```
