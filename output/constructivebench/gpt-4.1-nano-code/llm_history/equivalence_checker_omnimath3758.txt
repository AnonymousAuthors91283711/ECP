Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: { f : ℝ → ℝ | ∀ x, f x = x }
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer states that the only functions satisfying both functional equations (f(x+1) = f(x)+1 and f(x²) = f(x)² for all real x) are the identity functions f(x) = x. This is indeed correct:

1. The first condition f(x+1) = f(x)+1 implies that f is linear when restricted to integers, with slope 1.
2. The second condition f(x²) = f(x)² implies that f is quadratic, but combined with the first condition, the only solution is the identity function.
3. One can verify that f(x) = x satisfies both conditions.
4. Any other function would fail to satisfy at least one of the conditions.

Therefore, the proposed answer correctly characterizes the solution set.
