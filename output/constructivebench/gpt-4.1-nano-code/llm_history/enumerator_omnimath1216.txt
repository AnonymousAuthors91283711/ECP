This problem asks us to find the number of integers n between 1 and 1000 inclusive such that the least common multiple (lcm) of n and 9 is a perfect square. We want to analyze all such n to deduce the total count.

Key observations:
- GCDMonoid.lcm(n, 9) is the least common multiple of n and 9.
- The prime factorization of 9 is 3^2.
- The lcm(n, 9) will be determined by the exponents of prime factors in n, especially for prime 3.

Let's analyze the lcm(primes) behavior:
- For prime 3:
  - If n's 3-exponent is e:
    - lcm(n, 9) has 3-exponent max(e, 2).
- For primes other than 3:
  - Their exponents do not affect whether the lcm is a perfect square unless they appear in n.

Since 9's prime factorization is 3^2:
- lcm(n, 9) will be a perfect square if and only if:
  - For prime 3: the exponent of 3 in the lcm (which is max(e, 2)) is even.
  - For other primes: as their exponents don't influence 9's factorization, their exponents in n can be any.

Focus on prime 3:
- Max(e, 2) must be even.
- Since 2 is even, max(e, 2):
  - If e >= 2:
    - max(e, 2) = e
    - For the lcm to be a perfect square: e must be even.
  - If e < 2:
    - max(e, 2) = 2
    - 2 is already even, so always OK.
    - So e ∈ {0,1}:
      - e=0: lcm's 3-exponent = 2
      - e=1: lcm's 3-exponent = 2
- When e >= 2:
  - e must be even to make the max(e, 2) even.

Therefore:
- For prime 3:
  - e ∈ {0,1} or e ≥ 2 and e even.

Simplify:
- For e=0 or 1: lcm exponent of 3 is 2, which is even, perfect square.
- For e ≥ 2:
  - e must be even; e can be 2,4,6,..., up to the maximum exponent in n.

Since n ≤ 1000, we consider:
- The prime exponents:
  - For 3: e from 0 up to the maximum exponent of 3 in 1000.
  - For other primes: any exponents, since they don't affect the perfect square condition.

Maximum exponent of 3 in n ≤ 1000:
- 3^6 = 729, 3^7=2187 > 1000, so max e for 3 is 6.

So e=0,1,2,3,4,5,6.

The total:
- For 3: e can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 with the constraints:
  - e=0 or 1 (always valid for perfect square)
  - e=2,4,6 (even)
  - e=3,5 (not valid, since max(e,2)=3 or 5, which is odd, not perfect square)

Thus:
- Valid e for 3 in {0,1,2,4,6}.

Now, for other primes, their exponents are unconstrained. For n ≤ 1000, the prime factors are limited.

Generate all positive integers n ≤ 1000, check whether lcm(n, 9) is a perfect square, count such n.

Implement a direct enumeration over 1..1000:

- For each n, factorize n: get exponents of its prime factors.
- lcm's prime exponents: for 3, max(e,2), for others, the highest exponent in n.
- Check if all exponents in the lcm's factorization are even.

This is feasible with a simple loop.

Now, the code below performs this enumeration and counts such n, then outputs the total count.
