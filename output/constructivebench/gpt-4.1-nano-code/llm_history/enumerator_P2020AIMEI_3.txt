The problem asks to find the least natural number N that has a particular three-digit representation in base 11 and a 4-digit representation in base 8 with a specific pattern. 

Given:
- In base 11, N is represented by digits a, b, c: \( N = a \times 11^2 + b \times 11 + c \).
- In base 8, N is represented by 1, b, c, a: \( N = 1 \times 8^3 + b \times 8^2 + c \times 8 + a \).

Additional constraints:
- \( a, b, c < 11 \) and he also restricts \( a, b, c < 8 \) for the shared digits, so the actual bounds are \( a, b, c < 8 \).

We check all possible combinations to find the minimal N satisfying these equalities and inequalities.

```python
# Enumerate all possible digits for a, b, c (each < 8)
# For each combination, compute N in both representations
# Keep track of the minimal N satisfying the conditions

min_N = None
solutions = []

for a in range(8):
    for b in range(8):
        for c in range(8):
            N_base11 = a * 11**2 + b * 11 + c
            N_base8 = 1 * 8**3 + b * 8**2 + c * 8 + a
            if N_base11 == N_base8:
                N = N_base11
                solutions.append((N, a, b, c))
                if min_N is None or N < min_N:
                    min_N = N
                    min_solution = (N, a, b, c)
# Output all solutions found
for sol in solutions:
    print(f"Number: {sol[0]}, digits in base11: ({sol[1]}, {sol[2]}, {sol[3]})")
# Output the minimal value
print(f"Least such number: {min_solution[0]} with digits {min_solution[1:]} in base 11")
```
