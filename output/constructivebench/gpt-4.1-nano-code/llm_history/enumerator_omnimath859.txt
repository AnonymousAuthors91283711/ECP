This problem asks for the number of complex numbers \( z \) on the unit circle (\( \|z\|=1 \)) satisfying a specific polynomial equation:

\[
1 + z^5 + z^{10} + z^{15} + z^{18} + z^{21} + z^{24} + z^{27} = 0,
\]

where \( z \) lies on the complex unit circle. Since \( |z|=1 \), we can write \( z = e^{i\theta} \), reducing the problem to solving a trigonometric equation involving roots of unity.

The polynomial involves exponents that are multiples of 3, and many powers of \( z \) are repeating behaviors of specific roots. The pattern suggests the roots might be roots of unity with certain divisibility properties. To explore, we can evaluate the sum for roots of unity at various divisors of 27 (since the highest exponent is 27), and count how many satisfy the equation exactly.

# Approach
- Test \( z = e^{2\pi i k / n} \) for small divisors \( n \) of 27, particularly \( n = 3, 9, 27 \).
- For each, evaluate the sum, see if it's zero.
- Count the precise roots satisfying the equation.

# Implementation
- Loop over possible roots of unity at these orders.
- Check if the sum equals zero within a small numerical tolerance.
- Track and output the count of solutions found.

```python
import math

# List potential roots of unity orders dividing 27
orders = [3, 9, 27]
answers = set()

for n in orders:
    for k in range(n):
        z = math.cos(2 * math.pi * k / n) + 1j * math.sin(2 * math.pi * k / n)
        # Compute the sum of powers directly
        sum_poly = (1 +
                    z**5 + z**10 + z**15 +
                    z**18 + z**21 + z**24 + z**27)
        # Check if the sum is approximately zero (within a tolerance)
        if abs(sum_poly) < 1e-10:
            # Store roots as tuple of real and imag parts to avoid duplicates
            answers.add((round(z.real, 12), round(z.imag, 12)))
            print(f"Root at order {n}, k={k}: {z}")
            
print(f"Total roots found: {len(answers)}")
```
