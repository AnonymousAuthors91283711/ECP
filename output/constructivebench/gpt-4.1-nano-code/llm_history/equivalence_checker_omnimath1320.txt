Ground Truth Answer: 14
Proposed Answer: 3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest natural number n ≥ 3 where a specific modular condition holds regarding concatenated digits of powers of 2.

2. The ground truth answer is 14, which means that n=14 is the smallest number ≥3 that satisfies the given condition.

3. The proposed answer is 3, which would mean n=3 satisfies the condition and is the smallest such number.

4. The condition involves checking modulo 2^170, which is a very large number. For small values like n=3, it's extremely unlikely that the condition would be satisfied because 2^(10*3) = 2^30 is much smaller than 2^170, making the modulo operation trivial.

5. The ground truth answer of 14 makes more sense as 2^(10*14) = 2^140 is closer in magnitude to 2^170, making the modular condition potentially meaningful.

6. Without performing the exact calculation, we can reasonably conclude that n=3 is too small to satisfy the given condition involving such large exponents.
