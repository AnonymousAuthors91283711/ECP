Ground Truth Answer: Real.sqrt 3 - 1

noncomputable def f (a b z : ℂ) : ℂ := (z + a) / (z + b)
Proposed Answer: 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves a complex function f(a,b,z) = (z + a)/(z + b) where |a| = 1
2. We're looking at the supremum minus infimum of radii r where there exists b with |b| = r such that applying f four times returns the identity function
3. The ground truth answer is √3 - 1 ≈ 0.732
4. The proposed answer is 2

The ground truth answer comes from careful analysis of the functional equation and the geometry of Möbius transformations. The key points are:
- The condition requires f^4 = id, meaning f has order 4 in the Möbius group
- This imposes specific conditions on a and b
- The minimal radius occurs when b is closest to the unit circle (r = 1)
- The maximal radius occurs when b is farthest (r = √3)

The proposed answer of 2 is significantly larger than √3 - 1 and doesn't match the mathematical analysis. Therefore:

<<<False>>>
