[write_program]
This appears to be a formal theorem statement in Lean theorem prover syntax, not a typical Python problem. However, your request is for a Python enumeration program that can assist in conjecturing and proving answers, especially by enumerating possibilities based on given parameters.

Given the context, the problem might relate to combinatorics involving groups with properties like hair color and glasses count. For example, if we interpret `blackHair`, `glasses`, `both`, and total as parameters in a set problem, perhaps the goal is to find counts of some subset.

Assuming the core logical relationship:
- Total = 20
- Black Hair = 10
- Glasses = 5
- Both (black hair and glasses) = 3

The expression `blackHair - both` might be asking for the number of people with black hair but no glasses.

Here's a simple enumerator in Python to list all possible counts of people with black hair only, given these parameters, within small ranges or constraints, and to output the answer immediately.

```python
# Parameters
total = 20
blackHair = 10
glasses = 5
both = 3

# Enumerate all possible values for the number with black hair only
for black_only in range(blackHair - both + 1):
    # The number with black hair only is at least 0 and at most blackHair - both
    # The total with glasses, including those with both
    for glasses_only in range(glasses - both + 1):
        # Compute total with glasses only
        total_glasses = glasses_only + both
        if total_glasses > glasses:
            continue  # can't exceed total glasses

        # Total with black hair and/or glasses
        total_covered = black_only + both + glasses_only
        if total_covered <= total:
            # The remaining are neither black-haired nor wearing glasses
            neither = total - total_covered
            answer = blackHair - both  # black hair but no glasses
            print("Black hair only:", black_only)
            print("Glasses only:", glasses_only)
            print("Neither:", neither)
            print("Answer (black hair not glasses):", answer)
```

This code enumerates possible distributions consistent with the given parameters and outputs the count of people who have black hair but no glasses immediately. You can adapt it to explore more constraints or to find the extremal counts needed for the theorem.

```python
# Parameters
total = 20
blackHair = 10
glasses = 5
both = 3

# Enumerate possible counts with black hair only
for black_only in range(blackHair - both + 1):
    for glasses_only in range(glasses - both + 1):
        total_glasses = glasses_only + both
        if total_glasses > glasses:
            continue
        total_covered = black_only + both + glasses_only
        if total_covered <= total:
            neither = total - total_covered
            answer = blackHair - both
            print("Black hair only:", black_only)
            print("Glasses only:", glasses_only)
            print("Neither:", neither)
            print("Answer (black hair not glasses):", answer)
```
