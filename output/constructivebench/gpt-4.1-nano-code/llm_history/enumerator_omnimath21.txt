The problem is to find all quadruples \((x, y, z, w)\) of natural numbers such that \(2^x \cdot 3^y - 5^z \cdot 7^w = 1\). We want to enumerate possible solutions by searching over small parameter values, since very large exponents make the search infeasible. We'll set reasonable bounds, for example \(x, y, z, w \leq 10\), and check for solutions within these bounds.

This approach allows us to find initial solutions (exact or approximate) for conjecture and verification. We will print each found solution immediately.

```python
# Program to enumerate solutions to 2^x * 3^y - 5^z * 7^w = 1 with small bounds
max_exponent = 10  # bounds for exponents

for x in range(max_exponent + 1):
    for y in range(max_exponent + 1):
        for z in range(max_exponent + 1):
            for w in range(max_exponent + 1):
                lhs = 2**x * 3**y
                rhs = 5**z * 7**w
                if lhs - rhs == 1:
                    print(f"(x={x}, y={y}, z={z}, w={w})")
```
