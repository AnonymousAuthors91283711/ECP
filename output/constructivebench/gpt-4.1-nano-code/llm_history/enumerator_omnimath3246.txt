The problem involves counting specific lists of length \(3k + 1\) with distinct integers between 1 and \(3k + 1\). The numerator counts such lists where partial sums are not divisible by 3, and the denominator counts all such distinct lists. The expression is a ratio of these counts, parameterized by \(k\).

Given the complexity and combinatorial nature, itâ€™s helpful to test small \(k\) values, enumerate the lists, and analyze the ratio. The program will:

- Fix small \(k\) values (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
- Generate all permutations of \(\{1, 2, ..., 3k + 1\}\).
- For each permutation, check the list length and the divisibility condition on partial sums.
- Count valid lists for numerator and denominator.
- Compute and print the ratio when possible.

This approach leverages small parameters for feasibility and directly counts the structures.

```python
from itertools import permutations

# Let's consider small parameter values for enumeration
k_values = [1, 2, 3]

for k in k_values:
    n = 3 * k + 1
    elements = list(range(1, n + 1))
    total_lists = 0
    valid_lists = 0
    for p in permutations(elements):
        total_lists += 1
        partial_sum_divisible = False
        current_sum = 0
        for i, val in enumerate(p, start=1):
            current_sum += val
            if current_sum % 3 == 0:
                partial_sum_divisible = True
                break
        if not partial_sum_divisible:
            valid_lists += 1
    ratio = valid_lists / total_lists if total_lists else 0
    print(f"k = {k}, numerator counts = {valid_lists}, total permutations = {total_lists}, ratio = {ratio}")
```
