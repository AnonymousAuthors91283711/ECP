The pattern and symmetry of the enumerated solutions, combined with the conditions on a, b, c > 0, prime p, and the quadratic relation, suggest that solutions involve permutations of small positive integers satisfying the given equation. Ignoring p constraints for the sum of squares, plausible solutions are permutations of (1, 1, 4) with p=2.

The main issues are the use of a descriptive sentence instead of a proper Lean expression and incorrect syntax leading to unknown identifiers and unexpected tokens. The goal is to produce a set of tuples satisfying the solution pattern, which from the enumeration appears to be permutations of (1, 1, 4) with p=2, considering the constraints satisfied by the original problem.

Given the enumeration:
- (1, 1, 4, 2)
- (1, 4, 1, 2)

and noting the symmetry, the complete set of solutions consistent with the enumerated examples is:

- all permutations of (1, 1, 4) with prime p=2.

Since permutations of (1,1,4) are (1,1,4), (1,4,1), (4,1,1), we can write the set explicitly as these:

```lean
{(a, b, c, p) | (a, b, c, p) = (1, 1, 4, 2) ∨ (a, b, c, p) = (1, 4, 1, 2) ∨ (a, b, c, p) = (4, 1, 1, 2)}
```

This explicitly lists all permutations of (1, 1, 4) with p=2, covering the enumerated solutions and assuming all solutions are permutations of these.

In Lean, the concise set expression is:

```lean
<<<{(a, b, c, p) | (a, b, c, p) = (1, 1, 4, 2) ∨ (a, b, c, p) = (1, 4, 1, 2) ∨ (a, b, c, p) = (4, 1, 1, 2)}>>>
