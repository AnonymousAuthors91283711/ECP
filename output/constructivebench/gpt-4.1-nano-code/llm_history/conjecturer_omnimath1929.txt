omnimath1929_answer := 28. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern indicates that the only numbers n between 1 and 100 satisfying (10 * n).divisors.card = 3 * n.divisors.card are those where n divides 15. These are n = 5 and n = 15. The count of such n is 2, matching the observed answer. 

Therefore, the closed-form answer is 2.
