The problem asks for the least positive integer \( x \) such that there exists positive \( y \) with \( 7x^5 = 11 y^{13} \). To find candidate solutions, we can enumerate small positive integers \( y \), compute corresponding \( x \), check if \( x \) is integer and positive, and keep track of the minimal \( x \).

Here's the reasoning:
- For each \( y \), compute \( x^5 = (11 y^{13}) / 7 \).
- Check if \( (11 y^{13}) \) is divisible by 7.
- If divisible, take the 5th root of \( (11 y^{13})/7 \) (checking if it results in an integer \( x \)).
- Record such \( x \), and update the minimal one.

This enumeration is efficient for small \( y \).

```python
import math

# Initialize minimal x to None
min_x = None
min_y = None

# Iterate over small positive y values
for y in range(1, 1000):
    numerator = 11 * (y ** 13)
    if numerator % 7 == 0:
        numerator_div = numerator // 7
        # Check if numerator_div is a perfect 5th power
        x_candidate = round(numerator_div ** (1/5))
        # Validate if x_candidate^5 == numerator_div exactly
        if x_candidate ** 5 == numerator_div:
            x = x_candidate
            if x > 0:
                # Update minimal solution if needed
                if min_x is None or x < min_x:
                    min_x = x
                    min_y = y
                    print(f"Found candidate: x = {x}, y = {y}")

if min_x is not None:
    print(f"Minimum x = {min_x} with y = {min_y}")
else:
    print("No solutions found for y in range up to 1000.")
```
