The problem appears to be a number theory or algebraic problem involving finding integer solutions to an equation involving k, and then calculating the sum of squares for those solutions. The key equation is:

k * (k + 1) * (k + 2) = 8 * (k + (k + 1) + (k + 2))

Simplify the right side:
k + (k + 1) + (k + 2) = 3k + 3

So RHS = 8 * (3k + 3) = 24k + 24

The LHS is:
k * (k + 1) * (k + 2) = k * (k^2 + 3k + 2) = k^3 + 3k^2 + 2k

Set them equal:
k^3 + 3k^2 + 2k = 24k + 24

Bring all to one side:
k^3 + 3k^2 + 2k - 24k - 24 = 0
k^3 + 3k^2 - 22k - 24 = 0

Now, we'll search for integer solutions. Since k > 0, try small positive integers:

Factors of constant (-24) are ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±6, ±8, ±12, ±24

Test these as roots of the cubic:

For k=1:
1 + 3 - 22 - 24 = -42 ≠ 0

k=2:
8 + 12 - 44 - 24 = -48 ≠ 0

k=3:
27 + 27 - 66 - 24 = -36 ≠ 0

k=4:
64 + 48 - 88 - 24 = 0 → YES, root at k=4

Test others to be thorough:

k=6:
216 + 108 - 132 - 24 = 168 ≠ 0

k=8:
512 + 192 - 176 - 24 = 504 ≠ 0

k=12:
1728 + 432 - 264 - 24 = 1872 ≠ 0

k=24:
13824 + 1728 - 528 - 24 ≠ 0

Only k=4 satisfies the cubic equation.

Now, compute the sum of squares:

k=4:
4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 = 16 + 25 + 36 = 77

Hence, the answer is 77.

```python
# Program to verify the solution and compute the sum of squares for k=4
k = 4
sum_of_squares = k**2 + (k+1)**2 + (k+2)**2
print(sum_of_squares)
```
