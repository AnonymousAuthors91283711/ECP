This problem involves summing specific exponential values based on pairs, and possibly determining an answer. Since the goal is to enumerate candidates and the code seems to involve summing \(2^{2y}\) for pairs \((x, y)\), we can interpret the task as computing this sum for given pairs. 

To assist in conjecturing, I'll generate all possible sums based on the provided pairs, then identify the total sum. As there's no explicit need for optimization beyond straightforward enumeration, we'll perform direct computation.

```python
# Enumerate all pairs and compute the sum of 2^(2*y) for each pair
pairs = [(1,6), (2,3), (3,2), (6,1)]
values = [2 ** (2 * y) for (x, y) in pairs]
total_sum = sum(values)
print(f"Pairs: {pairs}")
print(f"Values (2^(2*y)): {values}")
print(f"Total sum: {total_sum}")
```
