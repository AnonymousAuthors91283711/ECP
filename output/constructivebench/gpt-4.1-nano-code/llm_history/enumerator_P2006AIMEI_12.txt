To address the problem, we need to find all solutions `x` between 100 and 200 degrees that satisfy the trigonometric equation:

\[
\cos^3(3x\pi/180) + \cos^3(5x\pi/180) = 8 \cos^3(4x\pi/180) \cos^3(x\pi/180)
\]

We will:
- Convert degrees into radians for computation.
- Search within the interval 100° to 200°.
- Use a small sampling step (e.g., 0.1°) to find candidate solutions.
- Check each candidate with a high-precision comparison to account for floating-point errors.
- Stream solutions when found, printing each satisfying `x`.
- Sum all solutions and store in the variable `P2006AIMEI_12_answer`.

Here's the code:

```python
import math

# Define the equation as a function
def equation(x_deg):
    x_rad = math.radians(x_deg)
    # Compute cosines for multiples
    cos3x = math.cos(3 * x_rad)
    cos5x = math.cos(5 * x_rad)
    cos4x = math.cos(4 * x_rad)
    cosx = math.cos(x_rad)
    left = cos3x**3 + cos5x**3
    right = 8 * (cos4x**3) * (cosx**3)
    return left - right

solutions = []
step = 0.1  # degrees
x = 100.0
while x <= 200:
    val = equation(x)
    # Check if solution approximately zero
    if abs(val) < 1e-8:
        print(f"Solution at x = {x:.2f} degrees")
        solutions.append(x)
    x += step

# Compute the sum of solutions
P2006AIMEI_12_answer = sum(solutions)
print(f"Sum of solutions: {P2006AIMEI_12_answer}")
```
