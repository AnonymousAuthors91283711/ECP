[write_program]
This problem appears to involve finding integer solutions to the equation:

\[ x^5 + x^4 + 1 = 3^y \times 7^z \]

where \( x, y, z \in \mathbb{N} \). Since the right side is a product of powers of only 3 and 7, the left side must factor accordingly, and the goal is to enumerate solutions to help analyze possible solutions or conjecture their form.

Given the problem's nature, we will:
- Fix small ranges for \( x, y, z \).
- For each \( x \), compute \( x^5 + x^4 + 1 \).
- Factor the result into prime factors to check if it's composed solely of powers of 3 and 7.
- Collect solutions and print them immediately when one matches.

This approach balances computational efficiency with comprehensive enumeration. The search space is limited, and the program streams answers as it finds them.

```python
import math

def is_power_of_prime(n, p):
    """Check if n is a power of prime p."""
    if n < p:
        return False
    while n % p == 0:
        n //= p
    return n == 1

# Explore small ranges for x, y, z.
max_x = 20
max_exponent = 10  # reasonable upper bound for y and z

for x in range(max_x + 1):
    val = x**5 + x**4 + 1
    # Factor val into 3^y * 7^z?
    temp = val
    # Count powers of 3
    y = 0
    while temp % 3 == 0:
        temp //= 3
        y += 1
    # Count powers of 7
    z = 0
    while temp % 7 == 0:
        temp //= 7
        z += 1
    if temp == 1 and y <= max_exponent and z <= max_exponent:
        # Valid solution found
        print((x, y, z))
```
