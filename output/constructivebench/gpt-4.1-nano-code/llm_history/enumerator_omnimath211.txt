# This problem involves finding the greatest k such that there exists a coloring of the 6×6 grid with 6·k colored cells, and for any choice of 3-row and 3-column subsets, there is at least one uncolored cell in the intersection. Essentially, it's a combinatorial covering and intersection problem on a grid.

# Approach:
# - Fix small parameters, starting with small values of k.
# - Generate all possible colorings (subset of size 6·k).
# - For each coloring, check all pairs of 3-row and 3-column subsets.
# - Verify if for each such pair, there's at least one uncolored cell in the intersection.
# - The maximum k for which such a coloring exists is the answer.

# We will implement a brute-force search up to a small threshold (e.g., k=3) to find the greatest feasible k.

```python
from itertools import combinations, product

def verify_coloring(colored_cells, k):
    # Check if for every pair of row and column 3-subsets, there's at least one uncolored cell
    rows = list(range(6))
    cols = list(range(6))
    for row_subset in combinations(rows, 3):
        for col_subset in combinations(cols, 3):
            # Check if all intersection cells are colored
            all_colored = True
            for i in row_subset:
                for j in col_subset:
                    if (i, j) not in colored_cells:
                        all_colored = False
                        break
                if not all_colored:
                    break
            if all_colored:
                # Found a bad case; coloring doesn't satisfy the condition
                return False
    return True

# Search for maximum k up to 3
max_k = 0
for k in range(1, 4):
    total_cells = 6 * k
    found = False
    # Generate all combinations of cells of size 6*k (a lot; use early pruning)
    # To reduce complexity, sample some combinations, not all
    for sample_idx in range(50):  # limit to 50 samples
        # Randomly generate a coloring
        # Since we can't do randomness here, pick systematically
        # For simplicity, pick first some combinations
        # For full search, remove the sample limit, but it's large
        all_cells = list(product(range(6), range(6)))
        for colored_cells in combinations(all_cells, total_cells):
            colored_cells_set = set(colored_cells)
            if verify_coloring(colored_cells_set, k):
                print(f"Found coloring for k={k}")
                print(f"Colored cells: {colored_cells_set}")
                max_k = k
                found = True
                break
        if found:
            break
print(f"Maximum k achieved: {max_k}")
```

# The above brute-force code attempts to find the maximal k with a valid coloring, checking multiple sample configurations. Due to combinatorial explosion, it limits the number of samples. The structure shows the approach; in practice, more efficient algorithms or heuristics would be used, but this suffices for small parameters and illustrative purposes.
