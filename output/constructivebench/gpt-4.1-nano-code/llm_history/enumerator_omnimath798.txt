The problem involves finding all natural numbers `n` for which there exists exactly one 8-element subset of â„• such that all elements are positive and the sum of the elements is `n`. To help conjecture the pattern of such `n`, we'll enumerate all 8-element subsets of small positive integers, calculate their sums, and record the distinct `n` that admit a unique such subset. 

We'll limit the enumeration with small parameters for efficiency, focusing on small positive integers (e.g., 1..20). For each subset with 8 distinct positive integers, we will:
- Check if the sum `n` has exactly one such subset.
- Record that sum if so, and ensure no duplicates.

This approach streams answers, avoiding hardcoded solutions, and should help in identifying the pattern of `n`.

```python
from itertools import combinations

# Small range for enumeration
max_element = 20
subset_size = 8

# Dictionary to count how many subsets sum to a given number
sum_counts = {}

# For each combination of 8 distinct positive integers
for s in combinations(range(1, max_element + 1), subset_size):
    total = sum(s)
    sum_counts[total] = sum_counts.get(total, 0) + 1

# Print sums that occur exactly once (i.e., uniquely)
for n, count in sum_counts.items():
    if count == 1:
        print(n)
```
