The problem involves finding nonnegative integers `b, r, w, p` satisfying several constraints, including equalities relating differences and sum conditions. The goal is to enumerate all candidate solutions to help identify the true answer (which appears to be related to some specific value). The constraints suggest specific relationships between the variables.

Given the equalities:
- \(130 - b = 164 - r\)
- \(130 - b = 188 - w\)
- \(164 - r = 188 - w\)

We can derive:
- \(r = b + (164 - 130) = b + 34\)
- \(w = b + (188 - 130) = b + 58\)

And from the first sum:
- \(b + r + w + p = (130 + 164 + 188) - P2009AIMEII_1_answer = 482 - P2009AIMEII_1_answer\)

Substituting `r` and `w`:
- \(b + (b+34) + (b+58) + p = 482 - P2009AIMEII_1_answer\)
- \(3b + 92 + p = 482 - P2009AIMEII_1_answer\)

Constraints:
- \(b \le 130\), but since \(b \ge 0\), and considering the derivations, \(b \ge 0\).
- Similarly, \(r \le 164 \Rightarrow b + 34 \le 164 \Rightarrow b \le 130\)
- \(w \le 188 \Rightarrow b + 58 \le 188 \Rightarrow b \le 130\)

Since all these upper bounds are around 130, and \(b \ge 0\), we can iterate over \(b\) in [0, 130].

For each \(b\), compute \(p\):
- \(p = 482 - P2009AIMEII_1_answer - 3b - 92\)

And verify:
- \(p \ge 0\)

The unknown \(P2009AIMEII_1_answer\) appears as an unknown constant; since the problem is about enumerating potential solutions, we'll enumerate for various small values of \(P2009AIMEII_1_answer\), e.g., 0, 1, 2, etc., to observe solutions.

Here's the code:

```python
# Enumerate possible answers based on small trial values
for answer in range(0, 11):  # try small answers 0..10
    total_sum = 482 - answer
    print(f"Trying answer={answer}, total_sum={total_sum}")
    for b in range(0, 131):  # b from 0 to 130
        # Compute p
        p = total_sum - 3 * b - 92
        if p < 0:
            continue  # p must be nonnegative
        # Derive r and w
        r = b + 34
        w = b + 58
        # Check constraints
        if r <= 164 and w <= 188:
            print(f"b={b}, r={r}, w={w}, p={p}")
```

This code enumerates all feasible solutions for small candidate answers, helping to verify or conjecture the true answer.
