Ground Truth Answer: -984
Proposed Answer: -2000 + (1000 - (-1000)) * 2
Let me analyze the problem and the proposed answer.

The problem asks to compute the sum of floor(2025/(j + 0.5)) for j ranging from -1000 to 1000. The ground truth answer is -984.

The proposed answer suggests:
-2000 + (1000 - (-1000)) * 2 = -2000 + 2000*2 = -2000 + 4000 = 2000

This is clearly different from the ground truth answer of -984. The proposed answer seems to be making an incorrect assumption about the behavior of the floor function in this context. The floor function's behavior changes depending on the value of j, and the proposed answer doesn't account for this properly.
