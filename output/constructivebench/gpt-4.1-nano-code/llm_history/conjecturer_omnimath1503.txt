Total reachable points for k=51: 200. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
<<<fun k : ℕ => if 51 ≤ k then (k + 1) + 99 + 99 else 0>>>

/ The pattern indicates the reachable set's size depends linearly on \(k\), with a maximum at \(k=51\), resulting in 200. For \(k \geq 51\), total points are \((k + 1) + 99 + 99 = k + 199\).
