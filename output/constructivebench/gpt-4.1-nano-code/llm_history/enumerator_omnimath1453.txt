Let's analyze the given set: {x ∈ ℝ | -19 < x < 98 ∧ cos²x + 2sin²x = 1}. 

Simplify the equation:
cos²x + 2sin²x = 1  
Recall sin²x + cos²x = 1, thus cos²x = 1 - sin²x. Substitute:
(1 - sin²x) + 2sin²x = 1  
1 - sin²x + 2sin²x = 1  
1 + sin²x = 1  
sin²x = 0  
sin x = 0

Solutions for sin x = 0 are x = nπ, for n ∈ ℤ.

Within the interval -19 < x < 98, find all integer n such that:
-19 < nπ < 98

Number of solutions = count of n with nπ in that interval.

Calculate bounds:
nπ > -19 ⇒ n > -19/π  
nπ < 98 ⇒ n < 98/π

Approximations:
-19/π ≈ -6.05  
98/π ≈ 31.21

n ∈ integers satisfying:
n ≥ -6 (since n > -6.05)  
n ≤ 31 (since n < 31.21)

Thus, n from -6 to 31 inclusive.

Total solutions = from n = -6 to 31. Count:
Number of integers = (31 - (-6)) + 1 = 38

We need to count the total solutions and output that number (the cardinality of set). The range of n is from -6 to 31.

Let's enumerate all solutions:

- For each n in [-6, 31], x = nπ.

Here's the code to generate these solutions:

```python
import math

# Compute relevant bounds
lower_bound = -19 / math.pi
upper_bound = 98 / math.pi

# Find integer n's satisfying bounds
n_start = math.ceil(lower_bound)
n_end = math.floor(upper_bound)

# Collect solutions
solutions = [n * math.pi for n in range(n_start, n_end + 1)]
for x in solutions:
    print(x)

# The number of solutions
print(len(solutions))
```

This code enumerates all the solutions nπ within the interval, printing each solution immediately, then outputs the total count.

```python
import math

# Calculate bounds for n
n_start = math.ceil(-19 / math.pi)
n_end = math.floor(98 / math.pi)

# Generate and print solutions
solutions = [n * math.pi for n in range(n_start, n_end + 1)]
for x in solutions:
    print(x)

# Print total number of solutions
print(len(solutions))
```
