Ground Truth Answer: fun n => 8 * n
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => 0
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a function `omnimath3490_answer` that takes a natural number `n` and returns another natural number, with the following properties when `n=7`:
   - The result must be even
   - 9*n must be odd
   - n+8 must be odd
   - n² must be odd
   - n*(n-2) must be odd

2. For n=7:
   - Ground truth (8*n) gives 56 (even)
   - Proposed answer gives 0 (even)
   Both satisfy the first condition.

3. Checking other conditions with n=7:
   - 9*7=63 (odd) ✓
   - 7+8=15 (odd) ✓
   - 7²=49 (odd) ✓
   - 7*5=35 (odd) ✓

4. However, the proposed answer returns 0 for ALL inputs, which fails when n is even:
   - For n=2: 0 is even (✓), but:
     - 9*2=18 should be odd (but it's even) ✗
     - 2+8=10 should be odd (but it's even) ✗
     - 2²=4 should be odd (but it's even) ✗
     - 2*0=0 should be odd (but it's even) ✗

The ground truth answer (8*n) works for all n where the conditions hold (specifically when n is odd), while the proposed answer only works when n=7 but fails for other odd numbers and all even numbers.
