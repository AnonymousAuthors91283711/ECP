The problem provides an equation and a constraint:

\[ 13 + \frac{T - 20}{4} = T \quad \text{where } T > 20. \]

Our goal is to find the value(s) of \( T \) satisfying this equation, with \( T > 20 \).

Let's solve algebraically first:

\[
13 + \frac{T - 20}{4} = T
\]
Multiply both sides by 4:
\[
4 \times 13 + T - 20 = 4T
\]
\[
52 + T - 20 = 4T
\]
\[
32 + T = 4T
\]
\[
32 = 3T
\]
\[
T = \frac{32}{3} \approx 10.666...
\]

But since \( T \) must be an integer (per ℕ), there's no integer solution equal to exactly \( \frac{32}{3} \). Therefore, no solutions satisfy the exact equation with \( T \in \N \).

Given the pattern in the original problem, possibly the intention is to explore nearby integers to see if some approximate solutions satisfy the equation or to identify if any integer solutions exist. But since the original is strictly mathematical and \( T \in \N \), and from the algebra, no integer solutions exist satisfying the equation exactly, the program will enumerate integers greater than 20 and check if the left side equals \( T \).

---

Here's the Python code that attempts to find such integers:

```python
# Enumerate T > 20, check if the equation holds exactly
for T in range(21, 50):  # arbitrary upper bound
    if 13 + (T - 20) / 4 == T:
        print(T)
# Since from algebra T should be 32/3 (~10.666), no integer T > 20 will satisfy exactly.
# But we can output the approximate solution for completeness.
approx_T = 32/3
print(f"Approximate solution: T ≈ {approx_T}")
```
