  Nat.card {p : ℕ × ℕ // 0 < p.1 ∧ 1 < p.2 ∧ (∑ x in Finset.Ico p.1 (p.1 + p.2), x) = 15} = P2006AMCA_8_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: (1, 5)
(2, 4)
(3, 3)
(4, 2). Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The problem counts pairs (p₁, p₂) with p₁ > 0, p₂ > 1, and their sum from p₁ to p₁ + p₂ - 1 equals 15. The sum of an arithmetic sequence: sum = p₂ * (p₁ + (p₁ + p₂ - 1))/2 = p₂ * (2p₁ + p₂ - 1)/2. Testing enumerated pairs shows solutions where p₂ divides 30 and p₁ is accordingly determined to satisfy sum=15.

Final expression: <<<((15 * 2) / (2 + 1))>>> 

This simplifies to the number of suitable pairs, considering divisibility and bounds giving solutions (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2). These correspond to p₂ dividing 30 with compatible p₁. The total count is 4. 

Answer: <<<4>>>
