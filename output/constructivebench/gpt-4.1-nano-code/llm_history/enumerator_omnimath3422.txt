This problem involves checking the existence of natural numbers \( n \) such that \( n^2 \) equals specific powers, and then determining which of these exists to satisfy the logical disjunction. The key is to determine if any of those squares are perfect squares, i.e., if \( n^2 = a^b \) for some \( a, b \), then \( a^b \) must be a perfect square. 

Let's evaluate each of these cases:
- \( n^2 = 2^3 = 8 \): 8 is not a perfect square.
- \( n^2 = 3^5 = 243 \): 243 is not a perfect square.
- \( n^2 = 4^7 = (2^2)^7 = 2^{14} = 16384 \): 16384 is a perfect square since \( 128^2 = 16384 \).
- \( n^2 = 5^9 = 5^{9} \):  \( 5^9 \) is \( 5^8 \times 5 = (5^4)^2 \times 5 \). Since \( 5^4 = 625 \), and \( 625^2 = 390625 \), so \( 5^9 \) is not a perfect square (it's \( 5 \) times a perfect square).
- \( n^2 = 6^{11} = (2 \times 3)^{11} = 2^{11} \times 3^{11} \): Not a perfect square because exponents are odd.

Only \( 4^7 \) yields a perfect square.

Now, determine \( n \):
\[
n^2 = 2^{14} \Rightarrow n = 2^7 = 128.
\]

Therefore, only the third disjunct is true, with \( n=128 \).

To express this outcome as an answer to the question, the value of \( omnimath3422_answer \) should be \( 2^{14} \).

---

```python
# The only desired perfect square is 4^7 = 2^14
# Which is 16384, and n=128 since 128^2=16384.

value = 2 ** 14  # 16384
print(value)

# Check that this matches the logical equivalence:
# The statement is true if and only if there exists n such that n^2 = 16384, and n=128.
# So, we set omnimath3422_answer to this value.

# Note: Since the problem asks to produce an answer stream, we output the answer directly.
