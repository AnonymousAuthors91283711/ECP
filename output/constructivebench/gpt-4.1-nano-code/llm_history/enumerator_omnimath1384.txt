The problem describes a polynomial \(f\) with degree 2007, defined as \(f = X^{2007} + 17 X^{2006} + 1\), which is separable. For any root \(r\) of \(f\), the polynomial \(P\) of degree 2007 satisfies \(P(r + r^{-1})=0\). We need to find the value of \(\frac{P(1)}{P(-1)}\).

Given the symmetry in roots \(r\) satisfying \(f(r)=0\), and the relation involving \(r + r^{-1}\), it's natural to analyze the roots and their sums \(r + r^{-1}\). This reduces to exploring roots \(s = r + r^{-1}\), which satisfy a certain polynomial derived from \(f\).

We set up a computational enumeration over potential roots \(r\) of a manageable form, examining the behavior of \(r + r^{-1}\), especially at \(+1\) and \(-1\). In particular, roots \(r=\pm1\) simplify \(r + r^{-1}\) computations and might be roots of \(f\).

Let's implement code to:

- Find roots \(r\) of \(f\) over small rational candidates.
- For each root \(r\), compute \(s = r + r^{-1}\).
- Use the relation to approximate or identify \(P(1)\) and \(P(-1)\), considering their potential zero.

Note:
- Precise algebraic solution requires more advanced tools; here, we'll focus on rational root testing and symmetry, leading to an educated conjecture.

```python
# Enumeration of roots for polynomial f over small rationals, and their sums r + 1/r
from sympy import symbols, Poly, solve, Rational

X = symbols('X')

# Define the polynomial f = X^2007 + 17*X^2006 + 1
# For computational feasibility, analyze for small degree equivalents
# Since degree is high, we attempt heuristic evaluation with small candidates
# Focus on rational candidates for roots: r = 1, -1, possibly some small rationals

candidate_r = [Rational(1), Rational(-1), Rational(1/2), Rational(-1/2), Rational(2), Rational(-2)]
results = []

for r in candidate_r:
    # Check if r is a root of f
    val = r**2007 + 17 * r**2006 + 1
    if val == 0:
        s = r + 1/r
        results.append((r, s))
        print(f"Root r: {r}, r + r^-1: {s}")

# Now, analyze the special roots r=1 and r=-1
# For r=1: f(1) = 1 + 17 + 1 = 19 ≠ 0, so not root
# For r=-1: f(-1)=(-1)^2007 +17*(-1)^2006 +1 = -1 +17*1 +1=17 ≠ 0
# No roots at ±1; check nearby rational candidates
# Since manual checking suggests roots may not be simple rationals, 
# consider the relation to P(1)/P(-1)

# Given the symmetry and the structure, and guided by polynomial root behavior,
# you can approximate that the ratio might be 1 based on the symmetry of roots.

# Final conjecture based on symmetry:
print("Likely P(1)/P(-1) = 1")
