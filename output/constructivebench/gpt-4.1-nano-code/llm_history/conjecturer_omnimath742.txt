The pattern suggests the critical point occurs when sqrt(n+99) - sqrt(n) is just less than 1, i.e., approximately at n ≈ 2402. This is where the difference approaches 1, but is still less. Simplifying, the boundary n ≈ (k^2 - 99) for some k satisfying the inequality. For the least n, the minimal integer where difference < 1 corresponds to n = 2402.
