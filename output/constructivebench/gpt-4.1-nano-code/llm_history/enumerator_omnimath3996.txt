The problem asks for the greatest number m of a certain form: m = card {b | a + b divides a * b} for some a â‰¤ 1983, and we need to find the maximum such m over all a in [0, 1983].

Let's analyze the problem:
- For each a, find the set {b | a + b | a * b} and compute its size.
- The goal is to find the maximum size over all a.

Note: Since the problem involves number theory divisor relations, we'll sample small values of a, compute associated sets, and track the maximum size found.

Here's the implementation to enumerate candidate values:

```python
# Enumerate possible 'a' from 0 to 1983
# For each 'a', find all 'b' (say, within a reasonable range) such that (a + b) divides a * b
# Count how many such 'b' satisfy this condition, record the maximum
# Since b can be arbitrarily large, limit search for b in a manageable range for demonstration

def main():
    max_size = 0
    answer = 0
    threshold_b = 2000  # a chosen limit for b based on problem scope
    for a in range(0, 1984):
        count = 0
        for b in range(0, threshold_b + 1):
            divisor = a + b
            if divisor != 0 and (a * b) % divisor == 0:
                count += 1
        print(f"a={a}, size={count}")
        if count > max_size:
            max_size = count
            answer = max_size
    print("Maximum size:", max_size)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code searches through a subset of b-values for each a, finds the size of the set of b satisfying the divisibility condition, and tracks the maximum size. The result provides an approximate solution to conjecture the true maximum.
