The problem appears to involve examining divisibility properties of expressions of the form (a + 1)^n - a^n for positive integers a and n, with n dividing the expression. We want to find all pairs (a, n) satisfying this divisibility property, and then formalize the answer as a set of pairs.

To assist in conjecture and proof, I will:
- Enumerate small values of a and n.
- Check divisibility of (a+1)^n - a^n by n.
- Record and print pairs where the divisibility holds.
- Use small bounds for a and n to keep output within limit.

Here's the program:

```python
# Enumerate small positive integers a, n
# Check for divisibility of (a+1)^n - a^n by n
# Print pairs (a, n) whenever divisible, to help conjecture

max_a = 20  # small range for a
max_n = 20  # small range for n

for a in range(1, max_a + 1):
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        numerator = (a + 1) ** n - a ** n
        if numerator % n == 0:
            print((a, n))
```
