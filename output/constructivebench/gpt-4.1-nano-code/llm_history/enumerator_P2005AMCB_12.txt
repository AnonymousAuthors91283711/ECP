This problem involves relationships between roots of quadratic polynomials and their parameters. Without additional context, the key is to analyze the roots of the given quadratics:
- \(X^2 + C p * X + C m\) with roots \(r, s\),
- \(X^2 + C m * X + C n\) with roots \(2r, 2s\).

Given the roots, Vieta's formulas give:
- For the first quadratic: \(r + s = -p\) and \(rs = m\),
- For the second quadratic: \(2r + 2s = -m\) and \(4rs = n\).

From these:
- \(2(r + s) = -m\),
- but \(r + s = -p\).

So, \(-p \times 2 = -m\) implies:
\[ -2p = -m \Rightarrow m = 2p. \]

Similarly, from root product:
\[ 4rs = n \Rightarrow 4m = n, \]
since \(rs = m\).

Thus, the key relation is \(n = 4m\), and \(m = 2p\).

Putting it all together:
\[ n / p = (4m) / p = 4 (2p) / p = 8. \]

Hence, the answer should be 8.

Below is a Python program to verify possible values for small parameters:

```python
# Verify the relationship for small rational values with integer numerator/denominator
# to find the consistent ratio n/p.
from fractions import Fraction

# Define small rational parameter samples
possible_p = [Fraction(i, 1) for i in range(1, 6)]  # p = 1,2,3,4,5

for p in possible_p:
    m = 2 * p  # From analysis
    n = 4 * m  # From analysis
    ratio = n / p
    print(f"p = {p}, m = {m}, n = {n}, n/p = {ratio}")
```

This program enumerates small rational values to confirm the ratio n/p is always 8, aligning with our derived conclusion.
