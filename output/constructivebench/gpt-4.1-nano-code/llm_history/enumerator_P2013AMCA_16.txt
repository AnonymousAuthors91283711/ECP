The problem involves finding the greatest possible value of some mean subject to given conditions. The core challenge is to generate candidate mean values and verify inequalities, focusing on the maximum possible mean value under the constraints.

Given the means:
- totalA / A = 40, so totalA = 40A
- totalB / B = 50, so totalB = 50B
- The combined means:
  - (totalA + totalB) / (A + B) = 43
  - (totalA + totalC) / (A + C) = 44

We want to find the maximum possible mean `m` such that there exist totalB' and totalC' satisfying the constraints, especially with the mean of totalB' + totalC' over B + C being `m`.

Since the problem involves ratios and linear constraints, the maximum mean `m` will happen when totalB' + totalC' is maximized, given the constraints.

Here's a way to approximate the maximal value by setting totalC' in terms of C, and totalB' in terms of B, then iterating over a small range (since A, B, C are positive integers). We'll try small values; the largest mean occurs at boundary conditions.

```python
# Enumerate small positive integer values for A, B, C
# Under constraints, compute totalA, totalB, totalC
# Compute possible totalB', totalC' to maximize the combined mean
# Confirm constraints and track maximum mean value

A_vals = range(1, 10)
B_vals = range(1, 10)
C_vals = range(1, 10)

max_mean = -float('inf')
max_params = None

for A in A_vals:
    totalA = 40 * A
    for B in B_vals:
        totalB = 50 * B
        for C in C_vals:
            totalC = 44 * C - totalA  # From meanAC: (totalA + totalC) / (A + C) =44
            # Check if totalC compatible with meanAC:
            if totalC < 0:
                continue
            # Now find totalB' and totalC' to maximize the combined mean
            # The combined mean: (totalB' + totalC') / (B + C)
            # with constraints:
            # totalB'/B=50 => totalB' = 50*B
            # (totalA + totalB') / (A + B) = 43 => totalB' = 43*(A + B) - totalA
            # So totalB' must be equal to both 50*B and 43*(A + B) - totalA
            totalB_prime_candidate = 50 * B
            totalB_needed = 43 * (A + B) - totalA
            if totalB_prime_candidate != totalB_needed:
                continue
            # Similarly, totalC' must satisfy:
            # (totalA + totalC') / (A + C) =44 => totalC' = 44*(A + C) - totalA
            totalC_prime = 44 * (A + C) - totalA
            if totalC_prime < 0:
                continue
            # Compute the mean:
            m = (totalB_prime_candidate + totalC_prime) / (B + C)
            if m > max_mean:
                max_mean = m
                max_params = (A, B, C)

print(f"Maximum mean value approximated at approximately: {max_mean}")
print(f"Using parameters: A={max_params[0]}, B={max_params[1]}, C={max_params[2]}")
print(f"Corresponding totalB'={50*max_params[1]}, totalC'={44*(max_params[0]+max_params[2]) - 40*max_params[0]}")

# Streaming some candidate results
for A in range(1, 4):
    totalA = 40 * A
    for B in range(1, 4):
        totalB = 50 * B
