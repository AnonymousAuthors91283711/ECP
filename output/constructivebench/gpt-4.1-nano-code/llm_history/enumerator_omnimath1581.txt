The problem defines a recursive function `f`, then asks for the sum over all `x` in `0..2018` where `f(x+1) = 19`, of `(x + 1)`. To assist in conjecturing and proving, I will enumerate all `x` in that range where `f(x+1) = 19`, and sum these `x+1` values. Since the exact `f` pattern is not given explicitly, I'll implement `f` recursively and check for `f(x+1) = 19` for each `x`, printing matches as they are found, and finally compute the sum.

Because the recursive `f` resembles a binary process and values can grow large, I will use memoization for efficiency. The search space is small enough for enumeration within constraints, and I will avoid excessive computation.

```python
def f(n, memo={}):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    if n == 0:
        result = 0
    elif n == 1:
        result = 1
    elif n >= 2:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            result = 2 * f(n // 2, memo)
        else:
            result = 2 * f((n // 2), memo) - 1
    memo[n] = result
    return result

matches = []
sum_x_plus_1 = 0
for x in range(2019):
    val = f(x+1)
    if val == 19:
        print(f"x+1 = {x+1}")
        matches.append(x+1)
        sum_x_plus_1 += x+1

print(f"Sum of all x+1 where f(x+1)=19: {sum_x_plus_1}")
```
