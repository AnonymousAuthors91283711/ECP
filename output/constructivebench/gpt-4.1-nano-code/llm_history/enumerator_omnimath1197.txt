The problem involves a system of linear equations over the coefficients \( a_i \) with power terms, where we are asked to determine the value of \( a(1) \). This resembles moments of a sequence with polynomial relationships, often approached via linear algebra or polynomial interpolation. 

Given the constraints:
- For all \( k \in \{0, 1, 2, \dots, 2003\} \),
  \(\sum_i a_i i^{k+1} = 0 \),
- and
  \(\sum_i a_i i^{2004} = 1 \).

This implies a sequence of sums involving powers, which can be viewed as moments of a certain measure or a polynomial interpolation problem.

To explore the possible answer for \( a(1) \), we can attempt to numerically approximate the coefficients matching these constraints. Since the problem spans a large range (up to 2004), we will sample small bounds for \( i \), say from 1 to 10, to understand the behavior â€” as this greatly reduces complexity while giving insight into the structure.

We'll implement a linear algebra approach: construct the matrix of moments, solve for \( a_i \) (or approximate the coefficient corresponding to \( i=1 \)), and output that answer directly when we find it.

```python
import numpy as np

# Sample small range for i for demonstration
max_i = 10
indices = np.arange(1, max_i + 1)

# Construct the matrix for the power sums constraints
# Rows correspond to k from 0 to max_i-2 (i.e., 0 to 8), matching the system
matrix = np.vstack([indices ** (k+1) for k in range(max_i - 1)]).T

# The right side vector: zeros for k in 0..1983, but since we only have max_i constraints
# we take the last one as 1 (corresponds to the power 2004), scaled accordingly
b = np.zeros(max_i -1)
b[-1] = 1  # Corresponds to the highest power sum constraint

# Solve the linear system for a_i coefficients
try:
    a_coeffs = np.linalg.lstsq(matrix, b, rcond=None)[0]
except np.linalg.LinAlgError:
    a_coeffs = None

# The coefficient corresponding to i=1 is a_coeffs[0]
# Output the value for interpretation
if a_coeffs is not None:
    print("Approximate a(1):", a_coeffs[0])
else:
    print("No solution found")
```
