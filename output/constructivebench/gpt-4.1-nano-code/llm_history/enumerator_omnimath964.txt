[write_program]
The problem appears to be about finding the least N such that for every m, there exists a subset s of Fin n with the product of (x.val + 1) modulo 100 equal to m. This is a coverage problem over all residues modulo 100, for some subset products.

Since the question asks for the least such N and the problem is complex, I will write a small enumeration program in Python that, for small N, checks whether all residues modulo 100 can be obtained as products of subsets plus 1 in the range 0..N.

I'll follow these steps:
- Fix a small N (e.g., from 1 to 20).
- For each N, generate all possible products of subsets of {0, 1, ..., N-1} (i.e., elements of Fin N).
- For each subset, compute product of (x+1).
- Record all residues modulo 100.
- Check if residues cover all modulo classes from 0 to 99.
- When a N satisfies the coverage, print it immediately and stop.

This will help in conjecturing the minimal N.

```python
from itertools import chain, combinations

def check_coverage(N):
    elements = list(range(N))
    residues = set()
    # Generate all subset products
    for subset in chain.from_iterable(combinations(elements, r) for r in range(N+1)):
        prod = 1
        for x in subset:
            prod = (prod * (x + 1)) % 100
        residues.add(prod)
    # Check if all residues modulo 100 are covered
    return len(residues) == 100

for N in range(1, 21):
    if check_coverage(N):
        print(f"N = {N} covers all residues modulo 100")
        break
```
