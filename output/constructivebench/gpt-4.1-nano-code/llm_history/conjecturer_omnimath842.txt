The key error arises because `s` in `abbrev omnimath842_answer : ℕ := fun s => s 5` is not explicitly specified as a function from `Fin 6 → ℕ`. The type inference fails because `s` is not declared with a precise type. 

In Lean, when extracting data from a set of functions with constraints, it's often clearer to explicitly specify the type of `s`. Given the enumeration `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 48]`, the last element `s 5` corresponds to `s` being a function `(Fin 6) → ℕ` with specific properties that satisfy the set conditions. Since the enumeration suggests the last term is 48, and the sequence is increasing as powers of 2 plus a correction (here, 48), the candidate answer should reflect the last element in that sequence. 

The current answer is a simple function `s` applied at 5, but the fix is to define `omnimath842_answer` as a specific natural number, in particular, the maximum element in the sequence, which according to the enumeration is 48.

Thus, the corrected form should directly assign `48`.

**Final Answer:**

<<<48>>>

This answer is algebraically consistent with the enumeration, simplifies the proof obligation, and correctly types as an `ℕ`. It captures the maximum value of the sequence, fulfilling the set condition of having sum 79 and the divisibility properties, matching the maximum enumerated answer.
