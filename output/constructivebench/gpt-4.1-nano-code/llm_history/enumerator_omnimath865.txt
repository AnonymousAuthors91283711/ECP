This problem involves a recursive sequence defined by:

- \( a_0 = 2 \)
- \( a_{n+1} = \frac{a_n}{1 + a_n} \)

We need to explicitly compute \( a_{2012} \), or at least approximate or determine its value by enumerating possibilities. Given the recursion, the sequence appears to approach zero because each subsequent term is smaller (since dividing by \(1 + a_n\) when \( a_n > 0 \) reduces the value).

To aid in the conjecture, I'll implement an enumeration of the sequence values for small \( n \), print each term immediately, and observe the behavior. Because the problem prefers exact or approximate values, I'll output the sequence values step by step, without hardcoding the final answer.

```python
# Sequence parameters
a0 = 2
n_terms = 30  # compute first 30 terms to observe pattern

a = a0
print(f"n=0, a={a}")
for n in range(1, n_terms):
    a = a / (1 + a)
    print(f"n={n}, a={a}")
```

This code will output each term in the sequence, helping to observe the trend toward zero, which suggests the limit as \( n \to \infty \) is 0. Since 2012 is large, \( a_{2012} \) will be extremely close to zero.
