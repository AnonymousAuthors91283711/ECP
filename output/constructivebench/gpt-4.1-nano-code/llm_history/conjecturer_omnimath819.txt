Total count: 7. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the pattern and the set condition involving digits in base 3, the numbers are powers of 3 within [1, 1000]. The count of such numbers is the exponents from 0 to 6, since 3^6=729 < 1000, but 3^7=2187 > 1000. 

Thus, the count is 7, representing powers 3^0 through 3^6.
