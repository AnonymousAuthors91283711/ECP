This problem involves finding integer pairs (a, b) satisfying the equation:

(b^2 + 7*(a - b))^2 = a^3 * b

We need to enumerate possible solutions for integers a and b, perhaps within a small range, and output each candidate as soon as it's found. The goal is to explore candidate pairs efficiently, check the condition, and print solutions immediately.

Given the symmetry and the nature of the equation, we'll restrict a and b to small ranges, such as from -10 to 10, for demonstration purposes. This small range allows manageable enumeration and quickly identifies solutions without excessive computation.

Here's the implementation:

```python
# Enumerate integer pairs (a, b) within small bounds
# Check the given equation for equality
# Print each solution immediately upon discovery

for a in range(-10, 11):
    for b in range(-10, 11):
        # To avoid division by zero in case b=0 (though the RHS is zero when b=0)
        if b == 0:
            continue
        lhs = (b**2 + 7*(a - b))**2
        rhs = a**3 * b
        if lhs == rhs:
            print((a, b))
```
