This problem appears to involve solving or exploring functions \(f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) satisfying a functional equation \(x \cdot f(x + f(y)) = (y - x) \cdot f(f x)\). To assist conjecture, I will generate candidate functions (e.g., linear functions \(f(x) = a x + b\)) and check which satisfy the equation. The approach involves:

- Enumerating small parameters \(a, b\) to generate candidate linear functions.
- Testing the functional equation for multiple sample points.
- Printing each candidate \(f\) that satisfies the equation (or approximates it within some tolerance).

This enumeration will help identify potential solutions and inform further proof strategies.

```python
# Enumerate small parameter ranges for linear functions f(x) = a * x + b
# Check which candidates satisfy the functional equation for sampled points

import math

def satisfies_equation(f, test_points):
    for x in test_points:
        for y in test_points:
            left = x * f(x + f(y))
            right = (y - x) * f(f(x))
            if not math.isclose(left, right, rel_tol=1e-9, abs_tol=1e-9):
                return False
    return True

test_points = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]
solutions_found = []

# Enumerate small coefficients a, b in some small range
for a in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
    for b in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
        def f(x, a=a, b=b): return a * x + b
        if satisfies_equation(f, test_points):
            print(f"Candidate solution f(x) = {a} * x + {b}")
            solutions_found.append(f)

# Also check for f ≡ 0, f ≡ constant functions, and identity
def f_zero(x): return 0
def f_identity(x): return x

if satisfies_equation(f_zero, test_points):
    print("Solution: f(x) ≡ 0")
if satisfies_equation(f_identity, test_points):
    print("Solution: f(x) ≡ x")
```
