theorem omnimath145 :
  IsGreatest {n : ℕ | ∃ (answers : Fin 16 → Fin n → Fin 4),
    ∀ (s1 s2 : Fin 16), s1 ≠ s2 →

The constraints imply a maximal \( n \) separating responses with at most one collision per pair. Since responses are functions \( answers : Fin 16 \to Fin n \), and the intersection must have at most one common \( p \), we identify this as a code with minimum pairwise distance ≥2. Max size without overlap is 16, so the maximum \( n \) is 16.
