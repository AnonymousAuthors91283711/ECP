theorem omnimath2766 : 
  ∀ x : ℝ, (1 + 3 + x) / 3 = 3 ↔ x = omnimath2766_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: x = 5 satisfies the equation with LHS = 3.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
First, simplify the left side: (1 + 3 + x) / 3 = (4 + x) / 3.  
Set equal to 3: (4 + x) / 3 = 3.  
Multiply both sides by 3: 4 + x = 9.  
Subtract 4: x = 5.  

Thus, the unique solution for x is 5.

. Enumerated Answers: x = 5 satisfies the equation with LHS = 3.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The main issue is that your proposed answer includes a non-learned comment ("First, simplify...") directly in the definition, which Lean treats as an invalid expression because the abbreviation expects a valid ℝ value. To fix this, we should directly define `omnimath2766_answer` as the constant ℝ value that solves the equation, which is 5.0 in floating point or 5 in exact ℝ. Since the theorem mentions `x` in ℝ, and the expected answer is a real number, the cleanest form is to define it as `5` (which Lean interprets as `5.0` in ℝ).

Additionally, the proof involves algebraic simplification, which the theorem states, so the answer should be just the numerical solution.

Hence, the correction is to assign `omnimath2766_answer` to ℝ’s 5, and remove the explanatory comments.
