This problem involves exploring functions \(f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}\) with certain properties:
- Strict monotonicity: \(f\) is strictly increasing.
- Initial condition: \(f(1) = 2\).
- Functional equation: \(f(f(n)) = f(n) + n\) for all \(n\).

Our goal is to enumerate possible solutions (functions \(f\)) that satisfy these conditions, and to find the value of \(f(1)\) (which is given as 2) and any other possible consistent values or constraints.

We can approach this by explicitly constructing candidate functions starting from known restrictions for small \(n\). Since the only initial condition is \(f(1)=2\) and strict monotonicity, \(f(2)\) must be greater than 2, \(f(3)\) greater than \(f(2)\), etc. The key functional equation for small \(n\) provides recursive constraints.

Given the complexity, we'll:
- Fix the initial value \(f(1)=2\).
- Enumerate possible \(f(2)\) (must be > 2).
- For each choice, determine \(f(3)\) subject to constraints from the functional equation.
- Check if the functional equation holds for small \(n\) and whether the function can be extended.

This enumeration will be kept small, just testing plausible initial values, and output the candidate functions satisfying the constraints.

```python
# Enumerate possible values of f(2), f(3), and check the functional relation for small n.
# This is a simplified approach to understand possible solutions.

def main():
    solutions = []
    # f(1) is given as 2
    f1 = 2
    for f2 in range(f1 + 1, f1 + 10):  # f(2) > f(1), small range for enumeration
        # Check whether this choice does not violate strict monotonicity
        # Now determine f(3) candidates
        for f3 in range(f2 + 1, f2 + 10):
            # Check f(f(1)) = f(1) + 1 -> f(2) = 2 + 1 = 3
            # But f(2) is f2, so for n=1: f(f(1)) = f(2), must be equal to f(1) + 1=3
            if f2 != 3:
                continue
            # For n=2: f(f(2)) = f(2) + 2
            # Need to check if f(f(2))=f(3), so f(3)=f2+2
            expected_f3 = f2 + 2
            # Ensure f(3) matches expected and is > f(2)
            if f3 != expected_f3:
                continue
            # Now check for n=3: f(f(3))=f(3)+3
            # f(f(3))=f(expected_f3)
            # For consistency, set:
            # f(expected_f3) = f(3) + 3
            # But f(3)=expected_f3, so:
            # f(expected_f3)=expected_f3+3
            # We can just record the function values so far:
            f_values = {1: f1, 2: f2, 3: f3}
            # Extend further if needed, but for simplicity, accept this candidate
            # storing the candidate function
            solutions.append(f_values)
            print(f"Candidate function: {f_values}")
    # Output the solutions
    for sol in solutions:
        print(f"Solution: {sol}")

main()
