Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: 0.08
<<<True>>>

The proposed answer of 0.08 is correct for the given problem. Here's the verification:

Given:
- Small price (sprice) = 1.5
- Large price (lprice) = 2.0
- Small increase (sincrease) = 0.1 (10%)
- Large increase (lincrease) = 0.05 (5%)
- Quantities: squantity = 2, lquantity = 1

Original total cost = (2 × 1.5) + (1 × 2.0) = 3 + 2 = 5
New total cost = (2 × 1.5 × 1.1) + (1 × 2.0 × 1.05) = 3.3 + 2.1 = 5.4
Increase = 5.4 - 5 = 0.4
Percentage increase = (0.4 / 5) = 0.08 (8%)

The proposed answer matches this calculation exactly.
