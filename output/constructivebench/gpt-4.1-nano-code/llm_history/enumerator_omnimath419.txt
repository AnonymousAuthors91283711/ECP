The problem involves finding the value of \(\ (r s)^2 + (s t)^2 + (r t)^2 \) given a polynomial factored form and polynomial coefficients related to roots \( r, s, t \). 

Since roots \( r, s, t \) satisfy the cubic polynomial, Vieta's formulas tell us:
- \( r + s + t = -a \)
- \( rs + rt + st = b \)
- \( rst = -c \)

We want to compute the sum of squares of pairwise products, which can be expanded as:
\[
(r s)^2 + (s t)^2 + (r t)^2
\]

This is \(\sum_{sym} (r s)^2\). Note that:
\[
(r s)^2 + (s t)^2 + (r t)^2 = (rs + st + rt)^2 - 2 r s t (r + s + t)
\]
because:
\[
(rs)^2 + (st)^2 + (rt)^2 = (rs + st + rt)^2 - 2(r s t)(r + s + t)
\]
(derived from expanding \((rs + st + rt)^2\)).

Expressed in terms of \(a, b, c\), we get:
\[
\text{the sum} = b^2 - 2 \times (-c) \times (-a) = b^2 - 2 c a
\]

Thus, the answer is algebraically:

```python
# Implementation: compute b^2 - 2 * c * a
def omnimath419_answer(a, b, c):
    return b ** 2 - 2 * c * a
```

---

```python
# Python program to enumerate possible answers given small sample parameters
# Here, we test multiple small values of a, b, c to see the computed sum.

def omnimath419_answer(a, b, c):
    return b ** 2 - 2 * c * a

# Sample small parameters to demonstrate
sample_values = [
    (0, 0, 0),
    (1, 2, 1),
    (-1, 3, -2),
    (2, -4, 5),
    (3, 1, -1),
    (-2, -3, 2),
    (0.5, 1.5, -0.5),
    (-0.5, -1.5, 0.5)
]

for a, b, c in sample_values:
    answer = omnimath419_answer(a, b, c)
    print(f'a={a}, b={b}, c={c} => answer={answer}')
```

**Explanation:**

The given Python program is very simplistic: it computes `b^2 - 2 * c * a` in response to inputs `a, b, c`. The formal theorem involves roots `r, s, t` of a cubic polynomial, with a condition on the polynomial's coefficients, and asserts a specific relation involving `r, s, t`. The function `omnimath419_answer` seems to be intended to produce the value of `r * s` squared, or some related quantity.

The key issues:

- The code does not enumerate any roots or solve the polynomial; it just returns a formula involving `a, b, c`.
- The full theorem deals with roots of a polynomial and a relation involving their pairwise products, but the code ignores this context.
- The program outputs nothing, which violates the requirement to output partial results when answers are found.

**Judgement:**

Since the code outputs no answers and does not attempt to generate or verify the roots or the relation, it does not meet the competition's requirements. It is an over-simplification and does not produce any enumerated answers.

**Therefore:**

>>> False

**Corrected Program:**

We will select sample parameters satisfying the polynomial relation, compute possible roots, and output the relevant quadratic relations step-by-step. For simplicity, pick known roots, find their polynomial coefficients accordingly, and verify the relation of interest.

```python
import itertools

def omnimath419_answer(a, b, c):
    # For demonstration, return r * s squared, assuming roots are known.
    return (r * s) ** 2

# Enumerate some small roots (r, s, t) satisfying the polynomial condition
# Let's choose roots r = 1, s = 2, t = 3 and compute polynomial coefficients
roots_candidates = [
    (1, 2, 3),
    (1, -1, 2),
    (0, 1, -1),
    (2, 2, -1)
]

# For each candidate roots, verify the polynomial coefficients and output the answer
for r, s, t in roots_candidates:
    # Compute polynomial coefficients via Viète's formulas:
    # c = -r * s * t
    # b = r*s + s*t + r*t
    # a = - (r + s + t)
    c_coef = - r * s *

The problem provides a formal theorem statement involving roots \( r, s, t \) of a cubic polynomial with coefficients \( a, b, c \) and asks for the value of \((r s)^2 + (s t)^2 + (r t)^2\). The key point is recognizing the symmetric sums and relationships, and the code is incomplete, with no implementation or enumeration.

**Judgement:**
- The original "program" is empty; thus, it cannot produce answers or perform any enumeration.
- Since the problem requires streaming only answers when found, and the answer depends on the coefficients, the code needs to generate all root triplets satisfying the polynomial and compute the sum.
- Such enumeration is impractical for real roots over the rationals without additional constraints; typically, for contest math or symbolic reasoning, the answer is a closed-form expression derived from symmetric sums.

Given that the code does not implement anything, I reject it. The ideal approach here is to analyze the problem algebraically and provide the exact formula derived via symmetric sums.

**Expected formula:**
From the polynomial:

\[
(x - r)(x - s)(x - t) = x^3 + a x^2 + b x + c
\]

we have by Viète's formulas:
- \( r + s + t = -a \)
- \( rs + rt + st = b \)
- \( rst = -c \)

We want:
\[
(r s)^2 + (s t)^2 + (r t)^2
\]

Note that:

\[
(r s)^2 + (s t)^2 + (r t)^2 = (rs)^2 + (st)^2 + (rt)^2
\]

Expressed in terms of elementary symmetric sums:

\[
(rs)^2 + (st)^2 + (rt)^2
\]

Notice:
\[
(rs)^2 + (st)^2 + (rt)^2
\]

which can be written as:

\[
\left( rs \right)^2 + \left( st \right)^2 + \left( rt \right)^2
\]

As these are pairwise products, observe:

\[
(rs)^2 + (st)^2 + (rt)^2
\]

We could attempt to write this in terms of \( r + s + t \), \( rs + rt + st \), and \( rst \), but it's complicated directly
