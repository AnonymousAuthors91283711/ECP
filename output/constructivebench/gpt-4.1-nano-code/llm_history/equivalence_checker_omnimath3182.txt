Ground Truth Answer: fun a b => a + b
Proposed Answer: fun a b : ℕ => 45 * a + b - 45 - a
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the minimal sum a' + b' where a', b' are positive integers satisfying 45a' + b' = 2021.

2. The ground truth answer correctly gives the sum a + b.

3. The proposed answer gives 45a + b - 45 - a = 44a + b - 45.

Let's test with concrete values:
- When a=44, b=41 (since 45*44 + 41 = 1980 + 41 = 2021)
  - Ground truth: 44 + 41 = 85
  - Proposed: 44*44 + 41 - 45 = 1936 + 41 - 45 = 1932

The results are clearly different (85 vs 1932), and the proposed answer doesn't match the required sum a + b.
