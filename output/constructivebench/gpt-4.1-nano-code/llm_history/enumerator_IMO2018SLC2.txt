The problem appears to be a formalization of an extremal combinatorics puzzle involving placing knights and queens on a chessboard, ensuring no knight attacks another and that a certain point `f` (a function from configurations to positions) avoids attacking any knight. We want to find the maximum number of knights `K` that can be placed under these constraints.

Since this is a high-school level problem translated into a formal theorem, and considering the bounds for enumeration, we focus on small values of `K`, especially because larger `K` quickly become computationally intractable. Our approach:
- Choose small K values, say from 1 to 20.
- For each K, check the possible placements and whether the constraints can be satisfied.
- Capture the maximal K for which the constraints hold, i.e., the largest K with a configuration satisfying all conditions.

Because the problem is theoretical and the code must stream answers, we'll programmatically generate and test small configurations, looking for the largest K.

```python
# We will brute-force small values of K from 1 up to, say, 20.
# For each K, we will attempt to find a configuration of knights 
# that are pairwise non-attacking and the existence of a point `f`
# satisfying the constraints.
# This is a complex search, but for small K, feasible in enumeration.

import itertools

# Define knight attack squares offsets
knight_moves = [(-2, -1), (-2, 1), (-1, -2), (-1, 2),
                (1, -2), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 1)]

def is_non_attacking(points):
    # Check all pairs for knight attacks
    for (x1, y1), (x2, y2) in itertools.combinations(points, 2):
        dx = x1 - x2
        dy = y1 - y2
        if (dx, dy) in knight_moves or (dx, dy) in [(m[0], m[1]) for m in knight_moves]:
            return False
        # Check attack if they are knight attacks
        if (abs(dx), abs(dy)) in [(2, 1), (1, 2)]:
            return False
    return True

# For demonstration, iterate over small K, attempt to find solutions
max_K_found = 0
max_K_solution = None

for K in range(1, 21):
    # Generate a small sample of possible configurations
    # For simplicity, test random placements - here, enumerate over small sets
    # Since exhaustive check is large, we limit ourselves to some fixed configurations
    # For demonstration, attempt placing knights linearly
    for coords in itertools.combinations(itertools.product(range(3), repeat=2), K):
        points = list(coords)
        if not is_non_attacking(points):
            continue
        # Suppose f is the center (1,1)
        f_point = (1, 1)
        # Check if f_point does not attack any real knight
        if any(abs(x - f_point[0]) == 2 and abs(y - f_point[1]) == 1 or
               abs(x - f_point[0]) == 1 and abs(y - f_point[1]) == 2
               for (x, y) in points):
            continue
        # Valid configuration found
        max_K_found = K
        max_K_solution = coords
        print(f"Found configuration with K={K}: {coords}")
        break  # Move on to larger K
    else:
        continue
    # Break if we have found a maximum for current K
    # Continue increasing K if possible

# Output the maximum K found
print("Maximum K:", max_K_found)
