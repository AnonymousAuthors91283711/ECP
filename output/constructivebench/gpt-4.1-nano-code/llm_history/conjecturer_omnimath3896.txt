12. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
Given the pattern in the enumerated answers, the set contains divisors of 12 that are greater than or equal to 2, where the relation holds, notably 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. 8 does not fit the divisor pattern of 12; hence, the set includes positive divisors of 12 greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, the set is `{a : ℕ | a ∣ 12 ∧ a ≥ 2}`.
