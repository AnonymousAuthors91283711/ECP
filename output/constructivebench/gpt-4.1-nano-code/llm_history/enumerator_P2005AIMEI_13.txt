This problem involves enumerating paths from (0,0) to (5,5) in a grid with specific move restrictions and a condition preventing right angles. To assist in conjecturing the number of such paths, I'll implement a Python script that brute-force enumerates all possible valid sequences of moves, respecting the move rules and the no-right-angle condition.

The grid is small (from (0,0) to (5,5)), and moves are steps right, up, or diagonally up-right, with a maximum of 10 steps each. We will generate all possible sequences of 10 moves (since the path length is fixed at 11 points), check if they end at (5,5), validate move sequences, and check for right angles.

To efficiently prune hypotheses, the code will generate sequences recursively, verifying move validity, the endpoint, and the no-right-angle condition at each step. It instantly prints each valid path's count, and finally outputs the total count.

```python
# Enumerate all paths from (0,0) to (5,5) with move constraints and no right angle condition
def generate_paths(path, steps):
    if len(path) == 11:
        if path[-1] == (5, 5):
            print("Path found:", path)
            return 1
        return 0
    count = 0
    x, y = path[-1]
    # Possible moves: right, up, diagonal
    candidates = [
        (x + 1, y),
        (x, y + 1),
        (x + 1, y + 1)
    ]
    for nx, ny in candidates:
        if 0 <= nx <= 5 and 0 <= ny <= 5:
            new_path = path + [(nx, ny)]
            # Check no right angle condition if at least 3 points
            if len(new_path) >= 3:
                p1, p2, p3 = new_path[-3], new_path[-2], new_path[-1]
                v1 = (p2[0] - p1[0], p2[1] - p1[1])
                v2 = (p3[0] - p2[0], p3[1] - p2[1])
                # Dot product
                dot = v1[0]*v2[0] + v1[1]*v2[1]
                if dot == 0:
                    continue  # Skip if there's a right angle
            count += generate_paths(new_path, steps)
    return count

total_paths = generate_paths([(0,0)], 10)
print("Total valid paths:", total_paths)
```

This script efficiently enumerates all paths, confirms the endpoint, and respects the move and angle constraints, helping to conjecture the total number of such paths.
