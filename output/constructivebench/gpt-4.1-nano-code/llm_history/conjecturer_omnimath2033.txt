The problem counts functions from Fin 5 to Fin 6 × Fin 6 where both projections are injective, and the images are pairwise distinct. Since both projections are injective, the image components are distinct and non-equal in each pair. Total arrangements: choose 5 distinct first components from 6, then assign 5 distinct second components from remaining 5, with orderings. Hence, the total count is 6P5 * 5P5 = 6!/(6-5)! * 5!/(5-5)! = 6*5*4*3*2 * 1 = 720 * 120 = 86400.
