theorem omnimath2477 : 
  Nat.card {s : Multiset (Fin 26) | Multiset.card s = 9} = omnimath2477_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 52451256. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the enumeration (52451256) and the problem's nature involving multisets of size 9 from a 26-element set, the pattern suggests a binomial coefficient with repetition: C(26+9-1, 9). The count of multisets of size m from n elements is \(\binom{n + m - 1}{m}\). 

So, the closed form is \(\binom{26+9-1}{9} = \binom{34}{9}\).

Answer: <<<choose 34 9>>>
