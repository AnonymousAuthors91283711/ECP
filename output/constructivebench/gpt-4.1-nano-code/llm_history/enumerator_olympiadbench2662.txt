Below is a Python program to find the smallest positive natural number \( N \) satisfying the conditions:
- \( N > 0 \),
- \( 14 \mid 20 \times N \),
- \( 20 \mid 14 \times N \).

By analyzing the divisibility conditions:
- \( 20 \times N \equiv 0 \pmod{14} \),
- \( 14 \times N \equiv 0 \pmod{20} \).

We search for the minimal \( N \) fulfilling these conditions, enumerating candidates starting from 1 upward.

```python
# Enumerate N from 1 upwards to find the minimal N satisfying the conditions
max_search = 10**6  # an upper limit to avoid infinite loops

for N in range(1, max_search + 1):
    # Check divisibility conditions
    if (20 * N) % 14 == 0 and (14 * N) % 20 == 0:
        print(N)
        break
```
