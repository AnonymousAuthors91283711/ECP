This problem involves analyzing the number of divisors of 2014! and related logarithmic calculations. We will estimate the number of divisors (M), then analyze whether the logarithm (N) is close to an integer, and determine the value of `omnimath1743_answer`. Since the problem uses abstractions from Lean's mathlib, we interpret it as:  

- `M` := number of divisors of 2014!  
- `N` := rounded value of log(M)  

Our goal: find the value of `omnimath1743_answer` that best fits the relation `N = omnimath1743_answer`. Given the extensive size of 2014!, directly computing `M` is impossible, but we can estimate the number of divisors using prime factorization exponents.

The number of divisors of n! is:  
\[ d(n!) = \prod_{p \leq n} (a_p + 1) \]
where \( a_p \) is the exponent of prime p in n!.

We can approximate the sum of exponents for each prime p \(\leq n\):

\[ a_p = \sum_{k=1}^\infty \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^k}\right\rfloor \]

In practice, for small primes p \(\leq 2014\), this sum converges rapidly.

Here's the plan:

- For all primes p ≤ 2014, compute \( a_p \).
- Compute \( M = \prod (a_p + 1) \).
- Compute N ≈ log(M).
- Round N to get `omnimath1743_answer`.

        count += n // power
        power *= p
    return count

for p in primes:
    a_p = exponent_in_factorial(2014, p)
    total_divisors_log_sum += math.log(a_p + 1)
log_M = total_divisors_log_sum

# Calculate N as round of log(M)
N = round(log_M)

# Output the estimated answer
print(N)
