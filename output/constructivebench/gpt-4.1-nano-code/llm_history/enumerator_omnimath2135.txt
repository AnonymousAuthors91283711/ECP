The problem involves counting the number of injective (pairwise distinct) functions \( a: \mathrm{Fin}\ 5 \to \mathbb{Z} \), with constraints that each \( a_i \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} \), and no three of the \( a_i \) are in arithmetic progression, i.e., no three distinct elements \( a_i, a_j, a_k \) satisfy \( a_i + a_k = 2a_j \). Since the domain is finite and small, we can enumerate all permutations of \( \{1,2,3,4,5\} \), check for the no-3-AP condition, and count the valid arrangements.

This enumeration will count all permutations of \{1,2,3,4,5\} that satisfy the non-3-AP property. The total number of permutations is 120, manageable for explicit iteration.

```python
import itertools

# List of all permutations of 1..5
elements = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
count = 0

for perm in itertools.permutations(elements):
    valid = True
    # Check all triplets for 3-term arithmetic progression
    for i in range(5):
        for j in range(i + 1, 5):
            for k in range(j + 1, 5):
                a, b, c = perm[i], perm[j], perm[k]
                # Check if these form an arithmetic progression
                if a + c == 2 * b:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if not valid:
                break
        if not valid:
            break
    if valid:
        print(perm)
        count += 1

print(f"Total valid arrangements: {count}")
```
