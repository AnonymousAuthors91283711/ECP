[write_program]
The problem is to find four prime numbers \( p, q, r, s \) such that their product equals 27,000,001 and their sum is some value, which we need to determine. To assist in conjecturing, we can write a Python program that enumerates prime quadruples with product equal to 27,000,001 and outputs their sums.

Since 27,000,001 is relatively large, but we can make some observations:
- All prime factors are likely small because the product is only around 27 million.
- The prime factors are probably not too large because their product should exactly match 27,000,001.

Our approach:
- Generate primes up to a reasonable limit.
- Check combinations of four primes whose product is 27,000,001.
- For each valid quadruple, print the sum.

To make the enumeration manageable, we'll:
- Generate a list of primes up to, say, 10,000.
- For each pair of primes, check if their combined product divides 27,000,001.
- Factor the remaining product to find the other two primes.

Here's the code:

```python
import math

# Generate list of primes up to limit
def generate_primes(n):
    sieve = [True] * (n+1)
    sieve[0:2] = [False, False]
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if sieve[i]:
            for j in range(i*i, n+1, i):
                sieve[j] = False
    return [p for p in range(2, n+1) if sieve[p]]

target = 27000001
primes = generate_primes(10000)

# Convert list to set for quick lookup
prime_set = set(primes)

# Enumerate possible quadruples
for i, p in enumerate(primes):
    if p > target:
        break
    for q in primes[i:]:
        product_pq = p*q
        if product_pq > target:
            break
        if target % product_pq != 0:
            continue
        remaining = target // product_pq
        # Now find r, s such that r*s = remaining, both primes
        for r in primes:
            if r < p:  # ensure order to avoid duplicates
                continue
            if r*r > remaining:
                break
            if remaining % r == 0:
                s = remaining // r
                if s in prime_set and s >= r:
                    sum_primes = p + q + r + s
                    print(f'p={p}, q={q}, r={r}, s={s}, sum={sum_primes}')
```

This code searches for prime quadruples multiplying to 27,000,001 and outputs each found combination’s sum immediately, assisting in conjecture formation about the sum’s value.
