  (h1 : tan x + tan y = 4) 
  (h2 : cot x + cot y = 5) : 
  tan (x + y) = omnimath1241_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 20. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests the answer depends on combining the given sums of tangents and cotangents. By expressing everything in terms of \( \tan x \) and \( \tan y \), we derive a quadratic relation with solution \( \tan(x + y) = 6 \).
