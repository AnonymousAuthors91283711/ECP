This problem asks us to find the least positive integer \( n \) such that the polynomial \((X+1)^n - 1\) can be expressed as \((X^2 + 1) P + 3 Q\), where \( P, Q \in \mathbb{Z}[X] \).

Key insight:
- The condition \((X+1)^n - 1 = (X^2 + 1) P + 3 Q\) implies the polynomial difference is divisible by \(X^2 + 1\) modulo 3.
- Equivalently, \((X+1)^n - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{X^2 + 1, 3}\).

To understand this, work over the finite field \(\mathbb{F}_3\), considering \((X+1)^n - 1 \pmod{3}\) and \((X^2 + 1)\).

The strategy:
- Enumerate \(n\) starting from 1.
- For each \(n\), compute \((X+1)^n - 1\) over \(\mathbb{Z}_3[X]\).
- Check if the polynomial reduces to a multiple of \(X^2 + 1\) modulo 3, meaning it's divisible by \(X^2 + 1\) in \(\mathbb{F}_3[X]\).
- Use polynomial division to verify divisibility.
- Stop at the first \(n\) where this condition holds, outputting that \(n\).

Let's implement this.

```python
# Enumerate n starting from 1, check divisibility condition
from sympy import symbols, Poly, GF, binomial

X = symbols('X')

def polynomial_mod3(coeffs):
    # Create polynomial over GF(3)
    return Poly(coeffs, X, domain=GF(3))

def poly_power_mod3(n):
    # Compute (X+1)^n - 1 over GF(3)
    # Binomial coefficients over GF(3)
    coeffs = [binomial(n, k) % 3 for k in range(n+1)]
    poly = Poly(coeffs[::-1], X, domain=GF(3))
    # subtract 1 (constant term)
    poly = poly - Poly(1, X, domain=GF(3))
    return poly

def is_divisible_by_Q(poly, Q):
    # Check if poly divisible by Q
    q_poly = Poly(Q, X, domain=GF(3))
    _, remainder = divmod(poly, q_poly)
    return remainder.as_expr() == 0

Q_poly = Poly(X**2 + 1, X, domain=GF(3))

n = 1
max_n = 30  # limit to prevent long runtime
while n <= max_n:
    poly_n = poly_power_mod3(n)
    if is_divisible_by_Q(poly_n, Q_poly):
        print(n)
        break
    n += 1
# If no n found within range, conclude no such n (here 30 is enough for small checks)
```
