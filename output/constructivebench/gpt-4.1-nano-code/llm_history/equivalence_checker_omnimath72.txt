Ground Truth Answer: fun n t => (n + t - 1) / t
Proposed Answer: fun n t => (n - 1) * t + 1
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum number of teams (k) where we can select one distinct color from each team, given n colors and teams of size ≤ t.

2. The ground truth answer (n + t - 1)/t is correct because:
   - It represents the pigeonhole principle solution where we distribute n colors into teams of size t
   - The ceiling function (implied by integer division) gives the minimal number needed to guarantee a selection

3. The proposed answer (n - 1)*t + 1 is incorrect because:
   - It grows quadratically with t, while the correct answer grows linearly
   - For example, when n=2, t=2:
     * Ground truth: (2+2-1)/2 = 1.5 → 2 (correct)
     * Proposed: (2-1)*2+1 = 3 (incorrect)

<<<False>>>
