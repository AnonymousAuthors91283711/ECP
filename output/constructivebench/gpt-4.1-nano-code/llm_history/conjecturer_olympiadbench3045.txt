Let's analyze the conditions in the filter:

- 1 < b
- b^1 ≤ 41, i.e., b ≤ 41
- 41 < b^2, i.e., b^2 > 41

The largest b with b^2 ≤ 41 is b = 6, since 6^2=36 ≤ 41, but 7^2=49 > 41. For b^2 > 41, the smallest such b is 7, because 7^2=49 > 41.

So, the valid b are: integers greater than 1 with 7 ≤ b ≤ 41, and b ≥ 7 because 6^2=36 ≤ 41 and 7^2=49 > 41.

But the condition b^1 ≤ 41 is automatically true for b ≤ 41.

Thus, the set of b satisfying all conditions is {7, 8, ..., 41}.

Answer: the size of {7, 8, ..., 41} is 41 - 7 + 1 = 35.

In Lean:

<<<41 - 7 + 1>>>
