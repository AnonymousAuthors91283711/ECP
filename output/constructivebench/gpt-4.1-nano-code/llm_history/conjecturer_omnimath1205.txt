theorem omnimath1205 (n : ℕ) :
  IsLeast {m : ℕ | 0 < m ∧ ∀ (α : Type) (w : Vector α (2^n)), 
    (fun w => (List.range n).foldl (fun w' k => switcheroo n k w') w)^[m] w = w} 
  (omnimath1205_answer n) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: For n = 1, minimal return time: 1
For n = 2, minimal return time: 1
For n = 3, minimal return time: 1. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
Given the pattern that the minimal return time is 1 for n=1, 2, 3, and assuming the problem involves a symmetric or cyclic operation over vectors of size 2^n, the minimal return time likely remains 1 for all n. This is based on the behavior observed at small n, possibly indicating the operation is an involution or the identity after finite steps.
