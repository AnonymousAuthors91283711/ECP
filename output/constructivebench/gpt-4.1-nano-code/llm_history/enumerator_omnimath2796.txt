This problem involves exploring the relationship between real numbers \( p, q, r, x_1, x_2 \) based on quadratic equations and inequalities. Specifically, for each \( r \) in the interval \((p, q)\), there must exist distinct negative \( x_1, x_2 \) satisfying:

\[
x_1 x_2 = r + 87,\quad x_1 + x_2 = r + 7
\]

Given \( x_1, x_2 \) are roots of the quadratic:

\[
t^2 - (r+7)t + (r + 87) = 0
\]

The discriminant \( \Delta \) is:

\[
\Delta = (r+7)^2 - 4(r+87) = r^2 + 14r + 49 - 4r - 348 = r^2 + 10r - 299
\]

For real roots \( x_1, x_2 \), need:

\[
r^2 + 10r - 299 \geq 0
\]

Solve \( r^2 + 10r - 299 \geq 0 \):

- Roots at \( r = \frac{-10 \pm \sqrt{100 + 4*299}}{2} \)
- \( \sqrt{100 + 1196} = \sqrt{1296} = 36 \)

Thus:

\[
r = \frac{-10 \pm 36}{2}
\]
- \( r = \(-10 + 36)/2 = 26/2 = 13 \)
- \( r = (-10 - 36)/2 = -46/2 = -23 \)

So the discriminant is non-negative when \( r \leq -23 \) or \( r \geq 13 \).

But the roots \( x_1, x_2 \) must be **both negative** and **distinct**, with \( x_1 \neq x_2 \), which requires missing roots to both be negative.

Check:

\[
x_{1,2} = \frac{r+7 \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{2}
\]

For both roots negative:

\[
\frac{r+7 - \sqrt{\Delta}}{2} < 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{r+7 + \sqrt{\Delta}}{2} < 0
\]

The larger root is:

\[
\frac{r+7 + \sqrt{\Delta}}{2}
\]

To be negative:

\[
r + 7 + \sqrt{\Delta} < 0 \Rightarrow \sqrt{\Delta} < - (r + 7)
\]

But since \(\sqrt{\Delta} \geq 0\), for the inequality to hold:

\[
r + 7 < 0
\]

Similarly, the smaller root:

\[
\frac{r+7 - \sqrt{\Delta}}{2} < 0
\]

which always holds if \( r + 7 < 0 \), because subtracting then would give a more negative result.

Thus, the interval of \( r \) where both roots are negative: \( r + 7 < 0 \Rightarrow r < -7 \)

Additional constraint: \( r \leq -23 \), to have real roots. Since \(-23 < -7\), the combined condition is:

\[
r \leq -23
\]

But for **both roots to be negative** (and distinct), \( r \leq -23 \) suffices.

Now, the interval for \( r \):

\[
r \leq -23
\]

In particular, for \( r < -7 \), the roots are both negative. The interval \((p, q)\) is contained within this range.

Let's pick an example interval:

\[
p = -25, \quad q = -20
\]

which is within \( r \leq -23 \).

Now, the key point: the set of \( r \) satisfying all is approximately \( r \leq -23 \).

Since the problem asks to **find \( p, q \)** and compute:

\[
p^2 + q^2
\]

Given the above, the minimal \( p \) for the interval is near \(-25\), and the maximum \( q \) near \(-20\).

Thus, approximate candidates:

- \( p = -26 \)
- \( q = -20 \)

and check whether roots are negative and distinct for all \( r \in (p, q) \).

- For \( r=-25 \):

\[
\Delta = (-25)^2 + 10 \times (-25) - 299 = 625 - 250 - 299 = 76 > 0
\]

- Roots:

\[
x_{1,2} = \frac{r+7 \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{2} = \frac{-25+7 \pm \sqrt{76}}{2} = \frac{-18 \pm 8.7178}{2}
\]

- \( x_1 \approx (-18 + 8.7178)/2 = -4.6411 \)

- \( x_2 \approx (-18 - 8.7178)/2 = -13.3589 \)

Both roots negative and distinct.

Same for \( r = -24 \):

\[
\Delta = 576 + 240 - 299 = 517 > 0
\]

Roots:

\[
\frac{-17 \pm \sqrt{517}}{2}
\]
\[
\sqrt{517} \approx 22.74
\]

Roots:

- \( \frac{-17 + 22.74}{2} \approx 2.87 \) (positive root, so roots are not both negative)

Thus, at \( r \approx -24 \), roots are not both negative, but slightly less than \(-23\) (the threshold). The critical value where roots start to become non-negative is at \( r = -23 \), where discriminant is zero.

To ensure both roots are negative for x_1, x_2 (distinct, both negative):

- The critical \( r \) is just less than \(-23\)

Set \( r = -23.0001 \):

\[
\Delta \approx (-23.0001)^2 + 10 \times (-23.0001) - 299 \approx 529.060 \\
\text{roots} \approx \frac{-23.0001 + 7 \pm \sqrt{529.060}}{2}
\]

\[
\approx \frac{-16.0001 \pm 23.00}{2}
\]

- Larger root:

\[
( -16.0001 + 23.00)/2 \approx 3.495 \quad \text{(positive, roots not both negative)}
\]

Hence, to guarantee both roots negative and distinct, pick:

\[
p = -26 \quad,\quad q= -23
\]

The maximum \( r \) in that interval:

\[
r \to -23^-,
\]

but to be safe, pick \( p=-26 \), \( q=-23 \).

Calculate:

\[
p^2 + q^2 = 676 + 529 = 1205
\]

---

**Final step: compute \( p^2 + q^2 \)**

```python
# Choosing parameters p=-26, q=-23 based on the analysis above
p = -26
q = -23
answer = p**2 + q**2
print(answer)
# Output: 1205
```
