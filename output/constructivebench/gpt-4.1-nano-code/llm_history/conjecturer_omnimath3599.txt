abbrev omnimath3599_answer : ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3599 (f : ℝ → ℝ) :
  (∀ (x : ℝ) (hx : x ≠ 0) (y : ℝ), f (x^2 + y) ≥ ((1/x) + 1) * f y) ↔ f = omnimath3599_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Constant candidates satisfying the inequality on sample points:
f(y) = 0 (constant)
Candidate: f(y) = 0

Linear candidates satisfying the inequality on sample points:
f(y) = linear function
Candidate: <function <lambda> at 0x7fd5b96298a0>. Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
Given the constant candidate \(f(y) = 0\) fitting the criterion, and that the inequality is preserved under the zero function, the logical candidate as the unique solution is the zero function.  
Final answer: <<< fun y : ℝ => 0 >>>
