[write_program]
This Lean code appears to be a formal mathematical statement involving a sum over a range, but it's incomplete due to the `sorry` placeholders. To assist in conjecturing the sum, I'll generate candidate sums based on plausible functions f(n). Since no explicit definition of `f(n)` is provided, I'll assume a simple example: f(n) = n. 

By summing n over 0 to 2013, we get an explicit, exact formula: sum = n*(n-1)/2 for n terms. I will write a Python program to enumerate partial sums of the first N integers, then output the total sum at N=2014, which is the sum from 0 to 2013.

This approach helps verify the sum and give a concrete conjecture. The code will print each partial sum at key points and finally output the total sum.

```python
# Enumerate partial sums of f(n)=n over range 0 to 2013
# Print each partial sum to assist in conjecturing the total sum
n_max = 2014
for n in range(0, n_max + 1, 100):  # steps of 100 for brevity
    partial_sum = sum(range(n))
    print(f"Sum of f(n) from 0 to {n-1}: {partial_sum}")
# Compute total sum explicitly
total_sum = sum(range(n_max))
print(f"Total sum from 0 to {n_max - 1}: {total_sum}")
```
