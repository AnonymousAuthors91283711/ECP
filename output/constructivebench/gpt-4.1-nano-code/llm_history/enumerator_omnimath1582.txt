The problem appears to be a mathematical theorem involving functional equations, specifically a family of functions satisfying certain conditions involving parameters x, y, z > 0. The goal is to classify (or characterize) all functions `f : ℝ → ℝ` satisfying the given property, and to do so, we seek to identify the set `omnimath1582_answer` that contains these functions.

Since the code uses Lean's Mathlib, date-specific definitions, and a particular functional equation, and asks for an enumeration approach, I'll write a Python program that:

- Considers simple, small-enumeration candidates for `f`, for example, constant or linear functions.
- Checks which candidates satisfy the functional equation for various small positive inputs.
- Streams outputs as solutions are found.
- Uses small sample parameter values for the variables x, y, z > 0.

We avoid hardcoding the answer, aiming instead to generate possible functions matching the criteria.

Here's the reasoning:

- Focus on simple functions: constant, linear, quadratic.
- For each candidate, test several small positive x, y, z.
- If the candidate satisfies the functional equation within a tolerance, print it as a candidate.
- Since the functional equations are intricate, actual full proof would be complex, but we're only enumerating candidates to conjecture.

```python
# Enumeration to find simple functions satisfying the functional equation, for conjecture
import math

def check_function(f, test_points):
    # Check if f satisfies the equation at given points:
    # (z + 1) * f(x + y) = f(x * f(z) + y) + f(y * f(z) + x)
    for x, y, z in test_points:
        lhs = (z + 1) * f(x + y)
        rhs = f(x * f(z) + y) + f(y * f(z) + x)
        if abs(lhs - rhs) > 1e-6:
            return False
    return True

# Sample small positive points for testing
test_points = [
    (0.1, 0.2, 0.3),
    (0.5, 0.5, 0.5),
    (1.0, 1.0, 1.0),
    (0.2, 0.4, 0.6),
    (0.3, 0.3, 0.7),
]

# Candidate functions:
# 1. Constant functions
constants = [lambda x, c=c: c for c in [0, 1, 2]]

# 2. Linear functions: f(x) = a * x + b
lin_params = [
    (a, b)
    for a in [-1, 0, 1, 2]
    for b in [-1, 0, 1]
]
linear_funcs = [lambda x, a=a, b=b: a * x + b for a, b in lin_params]

# 3. Simple quadratic functions: f(x) = c x^2
quadratic_coeffs = [0.5, 1, -0.5]
quadratic_funcs = [lambda x, c=c: c * x ** 2 for c in quadratic_coeffs]

# Check constant functions
for f in constants:
    if check_function(f, test_points):
        print("Candidate constant function:")
        print(f"f(x) = {f(0)}")
        
# Check linear functions
for f in linear_funcs:
    if check_function(f, test_points):
        print("Candidate linear function:")
        print(f"f(x) = {f(1)} * x + {f(0)} - {f(1)} * 0")
        
# Check quadratic functions
for f in quadratic_funcs:
    if check_function(f, test_points):
        print("Candidate quadratic function:")
        print(f"f(x) = {f(1)} * x^2")
```
