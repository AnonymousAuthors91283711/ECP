Let's analyze the given equation:

x^9 + (9/8) x^6 + (27/64) x^3 - x + (219/512) = 0

Notice the pattern of exponents: 9, 6, 3, and a linear term in x, along with a constant.

Observe that the first three terms involve powers of x^3:

x^9 = (x^3)^3  
(9/8) x^6 = (9/8) (x^3)^2  
(27/64) x^3 = (27/64) x^3

Rearranged, the polynomial is:

(x^3)^3 + (9/8)(x^3)^2 + (27/64) x^3 - x + 219/512 = 0

Set y = x^3:

y^3 + (9/8) y^2 + (27/64) y - x + 219/512 = 0

Solve for x:

x = y^3 + (9/8) y^2 + (27/64) y + (219/512)

But the original term has -x, so substituting into the original, we get:

x = y^3 + (9/8) y^2 + (27/64) y + (219/512)

But the polynomial includes -x, so to find roots, look for x in terms of y.

Alternatively, for roots, try specific rational values for x; perhaps integers or simple rationals.

Test x=1:

Compute:

1^9 + (9/8)*1^6 + (27/64)*1^3 -1 + 219/512

= 1 + (9/8)*1 + (27/64)*1 -1 + 219/512

= (1 -1) + 9/8 + 27/64 + 219/512

Simplify:

(0) + 1.125 + 0.421875 + 0.427734375 ≈ 1.9746 ≠ 0

Try x=0:

0 + 0 + 0 - 0 + 219/512 ≈ 0.4277 ≠ 0

Try x=-1:

(-1)^9 + (9/8)*(-1)^6 + (27/64)*(-1)^3 - (-1) + 219/512

= -1 + (9/8)*1 + (27/64)*(-1) + 1 + 219/512

= (-1 + 1) + 1.125 - 0.421875 + 0.4277 ≈ 1.1315 ≠ 0

Try x=2:

512 + (9/8)*64 + (27/64)*8 - 2 + 219/512

Calculate:

512 + (9/8)*64 = 512 + 9*8 = 512 + 72 = 584

(27/64)*8 = 27/8 = 3.375

Sum: 584 + 3.375 - 2 + 0.4277 ≈ 585.8027 ≠ 0

Similarly x=-2 or fractional guesses.

Alternatively, perhaps the roots are related to cube roots of rational expressions.

Since form is complicated, set small rational values for x and evaluate:

Write code to attempt rational candidates for roots: x in {-1, 0, 1, 2, -2, 1/2, -1/2, 3/2, -3/2}.

Given the problem wants streaming answers, we can write code to evaluate the polynomial for candidate roots with some rational or integer samples.

Let's code to evaluate over small rational candidates, then print the ones with polynomial value close enough to zero (e.g., absolute error < 1e-6).

Since the code is to be efficient and streaming, we'll implement a small candidate set.

Here's the code:

```python
# Search for roots among small rational candidates
def evaluate_poly(x):
    return x**9 + (9/8)*x**6 + (27/64)*x**3 - x + (219/512)

candidates = [-2, -1.5, -1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2]
for x in candidates:
    val = evaluate_poly(x)
    if abs(val) < 1e-6:
        print(x)
```
