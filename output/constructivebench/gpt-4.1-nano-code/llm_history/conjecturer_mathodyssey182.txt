abbrev mathodyssey182_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem mathodyssey182 (x : ℝ) : 
  4 * (x + 4) = 24 + 3 * (2 * x - 2) ↔ x = mathodyssey182_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: x = -1 is a solution, since 12 = 12. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The given equation simplifies to 4x + 16 = 24 + 6x - 6, which reduces further to 4x + 16 = 18 + 6x, thus 16 - 18 = 6x - 4x, resulting in -2 = 2x, so x = -1. The only solution for x is -1.
