This problem appears to involve solving an algebraic equation involving real numbers. From the theorem, the key expression looks like \( 18 \cdot t + 12 \cdot t = 45 \), which can be simplified to \( (18 + 12) \cdot t = 45 \), i.e., \( 30 \cdot t = 45 \). Therefore, \( t = \frac{45}{30} = 1.5 \). The answer \( P2023AMCA_1_answer \) is defined to be equal to \( 18 \cdot t \) based on the conjunction \( 18 \cdot t = P2023AMCA_1_answer \).

The program will brute-force or directly compute potential \( t \) values. Since it's straightforward, skip brute-force and output the exact solution.

```python
# The problem reduces to solving 30 * t = 45 for t.
# The solution is t = 45 / 30 = 1.5.
# Then the answer is P2023AMCA_1_answer = 18 * t = 18 * 1.5 = 27.

t_value = 45 / 30
answer = 18 * t_value
print(f"t = {t_value}")
print(f"P2023AMCA_1_answer = {answer}")
```
