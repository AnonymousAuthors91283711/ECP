This problem involves finding the number of solutions \(x > 0\) in \(\mathbb{R}\) to the equation:

\[
(3 \times 2^{\lfloor \log_2 x \rfloor} - x)^{16} = 2022 \times x^{13}.
\]

Given the nature of the problem, the key difficulty lies in the discretization induced by \(\lfloor \log_2 x \rfloor\), which partitions the positive real line into intervals \([2^k, 2^{k+1})\). On each such interval, \(\lfloor \log_2 x \rfloor = k\), simplifying the equation to:

\[
(3 \times 2^{k} - x)^{16} = 2022 \times x^{13}.
\]

Our plan is:

- For small integer \(k\) over a finite range (say, from 0 to 10), since the question is about enumeration and small parameters.
- For each \(k\), consider the interval \(x \in [2^k, 2^{k+1})\).
- Search for solutions numerically within each interval, focusing on potential roots.

Since the problem likely has only a small number of solutions, a brute-force search with a fine grid within each interval is practical; this matches the requirement to quickly find exact or approximate solutions, streaming results immediately.

We'll implement:

- Loop over small \(k\),
- For each interval, evaluate the function \(f_k(x) = (3 \times 2^{k} - x)^{16} - 2022 \times x^{13}\),
- Use the sign change method or sifting with a fine grid to locate solutions,
- When a root is found, print it immediately.

This approach will be efficient because the intervals are bounded, and the grid is fine but limited in number.

```python
import numpy as np

def f(k, x):
    return (3 * 2**k - x)**16 - 2022 * x**13

solutions_found = []

# Range of k to consider
for k in range(0, 11):
    left = 2**k
    right = 2**(k+1)
    xs = np.linspace(left, right, 1000)
    ys = f(k, xs)
    # Detect sign changes indicating roots
    for i in range(len(xs) - 1):
        if ys[i] * ys[i+1] <= 0:
            # Approximate root via bisection within [xs[i], xs[i+1]]
            a, b = xs[i], xs[i+1]
            for _ in range(50):  # refine root
                mid = (a + b) / 2
                val = f(k, mid)
                if abs(val) < 1e-8:
                    root = mid
                    break
                if f(k, a) * val < 0:
                    b = mid
                else:
                    a = mid
            else:
                root = (a + b)/2
            # Stream the solution
            print(f"Solution in interval [2^{k}, 2^{k+1}): x â‰ˆ {root:.8f}")
            solutions_found.append(root)
```
