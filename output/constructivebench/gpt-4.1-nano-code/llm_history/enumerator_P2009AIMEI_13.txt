This problem involves finding the least value of s such that there exists a sequence a(n) with a specific relationship, and it begins with the initial condition a(1) + a(2) = s, with a recurring formula for subsequent terms.

Since the problem looks complex algebraically, an effective way to explore solutions is to search over small initial values a(1) and a(2), generate the sequence, verify the formula, and record the minimal s that satisfies the conditions. We can limit a(1), a(2) to a small range (e.g., 0 to 10) and evaluate the sequences accordingly.

We will:
- Iterate over small values for a(1) and a(2)
- Generate sequence terms using the given recurrence
- Check if the recurrence holds
- Keep track of the minimal sum s

The code will:
- For each pair (a1, a2), compute s and test whether the sequence remains consistent, perhaps for a fixed number of steps.
- Output feasible s values immediately.

```python
# Enumerate small initial values to find candidates for s
import sys

min_s = None
for a1 in range(11):
    for a2 in range(11):
        s = a1 + a2
        # Generate next terms using the recurrence, check consistency for a few steps
        a = [a1, a2]
        consistent = True
        for n in range(1, 15):  # check first 15 terms for stability
            if n+1 >= len(a):
                break
            numerator = a[n-1] + 2009
            denominator = 1 + a[n]
            if denominator == 0:
                consistent = False
                break
            a_next = numerator / denominator
            # Check if a_next is close to integer (since the original formula likely yields integers)
            if abs(a_next - round(a_next)) > 1e-6:
                consistent = False
                break
            a_next_int = round(a_next)
            a.append(a_next_int)
            # Verify the recurrence formula matches
            if a[n+1] != a_next_int:
                consistent = False
                break
        if consistent:
            print(s)
            if min_s is None or s < min_s:
                min_s = s

# Output the minimal s found
if min_s is not None:
    print(f"Minimum s: {min_s}")
else:
    print("No solution found in the search range.")
```
