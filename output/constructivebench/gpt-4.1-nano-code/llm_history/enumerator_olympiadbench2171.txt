The problem appears to be a reasoning task involving a functional equation: find all functions \(f : \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{Q}\) satisfying \(f(xf(x)+y) = f(y) + x^2\) for all rationals \(x,y\). 

To explore solutions, we can test some specific values (e.g., \(x=0\)) to deduce properties, and look for candidates like polynomial functions that might satisfy the equation. A common approach is to try linear functions \(f(x) = a x + b\), because quadratic functions are more complex and the equation involves \(x^2\).

Below, I will implement a Python enumeration that systematically tries simple rational functions, particularly linear functions \(f(x) = a x + b\) for small rational \(a, b\). For each candidate, the code will:
- Verify if the functional equation holds for several sample points.
- Output candidates that satisfy the equation over those points, as potential solutions.

This will help narrow down the solutions or conjecture their form. The enumeration is designed to be efficient by limiting tries to small rational values of \(a, b\), and checking only a few sample points.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Generate small rational numbers for coefficients
candidates = [Fraction(n, d) for n in range(-2, 3) for d in range(1, 3)]  # -2..2 rational, denominator 1..2

# Test candidate linear functions f(x) = a*x + b
solutions = []

for a in candidates:
    for b in candidates:
        def f(x):
            return a * x + b
        # Check the functional equation at some sample points
        test_points = [Fraction(n, 1) for n in range(-2, 3)]  # -2..2
        valid = True
        for x in test_points:
            for y in test_points:
                lhs = f(x * f(x) + y)
                rhs = f(y) + x**2
                if lhs != rhs:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if not valid:
                break
        if valid:
            print(f"Candidate solution: f(x) = {a}*x + {b}")
            solutions.append((a, b))
```
