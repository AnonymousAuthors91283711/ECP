theorem omnimath1380 (e f : ℝ) 
  (h1 : e / f = 3 / 4) 
  (h2 : sqrt (e^2 + f^2) = 15) 
  : e * f = omnimath1380_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 108.0
108.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests that the answer is a constant derived from the given ratios, specifically 3 * 4 = 12, and scaled by the resulting value of e^2 + f^2 under the constraints. Solving for e * f based on the given ratio and hypotenuse length yields 108.0.
