This is a problem involving four integers A, B, C, D that satisfy certain inequalities and ratios. Given the conditions:
- \(A < B < C < D\)
- \(\frac{B - A}{C - A} = \frac{1}{5}\)
- \(\frac{C - B}{D - C} = 2\)

The goal is to find \(\frac{B - A}{D - C}\).

Since the ratios are defined, let's parametrize the differences:

Let \(A\) be an integer (arbitrary baseline, since only differences matter). Set:
- \( C - A = 5k \) for some positive integer \(k\) (since \(\frac{B - A}{C - A} = 1/5\)), so:
  \[
  B - A = \frac{1}{5} (C - A) = k
  \]
  implying \( B = A + k \)

- Similarly, \(\frac{C - B}{D - C} = 2\), so:
  \[
  C - B = 2(D - C)
  \]
  But \( C - B = (C - A) - (B - A) = 5k - k = 4k \)

  Therefore:
  \[
  4k = 2(D - C) \Rightarrow D - C = 2k
  \]
  and since \( D = C + 2k \)

Now, in terms of \(A\) and \(k\), the differences are:

- \( B = A + k \)
- \( C = A + 5k \)
- \( D = C + 2k = A + 5k + 2k = A + 7k \)

Given the inequalities \(A < B < C < D\), which becomes:

\[
A < A + k < A + 5k < A + 7k
\]

For this to hold:

- \(k > 0\)
- \(A\) arbitrary, but as integers, with \(A\) less than the others. Since increasing \(A\) shifts all values by the same amount, the differences are governed by \(k > 0\).

Finally, the ratio:
\[
\frac{B - A}{D - C} = \frac{k}{2k} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

which is a constant, independent of \(A\) or \(k\) (as long as \(k > 0\)).

Thus, the answer is always:
\[
\frac{1}{2}
\]

To confirm, let's implement a code that verifies this with small integer samples.

```python
# Enumerate small positive integer values for k and A to verify the ratio
for k in range(1, 5):
    for A in range(0, 3):
        B = A + k
        C = A + 5 * k
        D = C + 2 * k
        ratio = (B - A) / (D - C)
        print(f"A={A}, B={B}, C={C}, D={D} => ratio={ratio}")
        assert ratio == 1/2  # should always be true
```

This confirms the ratio is always 1/2, regardless of chosen parameters, given the constraints.

Answer: 1/2
