theorem P2003AIMEI_8 :
  ∃ (a b c d : ℕ),
    0 < a ∧ a < b ∧ b < c ∧ c < d ∧
    2 * b = a + c ∧
    c^2 = b * d ∧
    d - a = 30 ∧
    a + b + c + d = P2003AIMEI_8_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Solution: a=18, b=27, c=36, d=48, sum=129
Minimum sum solution: a=18, b=27, c=36, d=48, sum=129. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the pattern in the enumerated solutions, the values are fixed, satisfying the constraints. Since these are unique with respect to the sum, the sum is always 129.
