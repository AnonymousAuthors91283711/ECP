Ground Truth Answer: fun a => (2 * a + 5) / 5
Proposed Answer: fun a => 1 + (2/5) * a
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer `fun a => (2 * a + 5) / 5` and the proposed answer `fun a => 1 + (2/5) * a`.

First, let's simplify the ground truth answer:
(2 * a + 5) / 5 = (2a)/5 + 5/5 = (2/5)a + 1 = 1 + (2/5)a

This is exactly the same as the proposed answer. The expressions are mathematically equivalent, just written in different forms.
