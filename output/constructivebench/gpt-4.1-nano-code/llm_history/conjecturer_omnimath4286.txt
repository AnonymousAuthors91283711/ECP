abbrev omnimath4286_answer : Set (ℤ × ℕ) := sorry
theorem omnimath4286 (x : ℤ) (y : ℕ) : 
    x^2 * (1 + x^2) = -1 + 21^y ↔ (x, y) ∈ omnimath4286_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: (0, 0)
(2, 1)
(-2, 1). Expected Answer Type: Set (ℤ × ℕ)
The pattern suggests the solutions occur for x in {0, ±2} with corresponding y values y=0 when x=0 and y=1 when x=±2. Valid solutions satisfy the quadratic and exponential relation, simplifying to the set where x^2=0 or 4 and matching y. 

<<<{ (x, y) | (x = 0 ∧ y = 0) ∨ (x^2 = 4 ∧ y = 1) }>>>
