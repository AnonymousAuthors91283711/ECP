Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests the answer is the product of prime powers and their factors. Based on the pattern, the simplified closed form appears as a product of prime powers, notably including factors like previous divisors and their powers. Considering the previous enumerations, the answer resembles a product involving powers of 7, 11, 13, 49 (=7^2), 77, 91, 121 (=11^2), etc. The dominant product appears to be a large composite involving these factors. The most consistent pattern yields the answer as:

<<<7^3 * 11^2 * 13^2 * 19^2 * 29^2 * 37^2 * 41^2* 43 * 47 * 53 * 59 * 61 * 67 * 71* 73 * 79 * 83 * 89* 97>>>
