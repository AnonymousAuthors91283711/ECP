The problem appears to be about analyzing a list of natural numbers where consecutive elements satisfy certain multiplication relations, and the sum of the list elements equals 2023. The goal is to find all possible answer values consistent with these conditions, probably focusing on the sum or specific elements that satisfy the chain of relations.

Given the relations involve factors of 2 and 5, the list's elements are connected via multiplication or division by these numbers. To find possible solutions, we can generate sequences starting from small initial values, applying the allowed relations, and tracking their sums. The key is to explore all such sequences up to length constraints, ensuring we identify all possible sums or boundary solutions.

Below is an approach that:
- Considers small starting points,
- Extends sequences respecting the chain conditions,
- Tracks sums,
- Finds exactly those sequences summing to 2023.

We aim to find all possible sums that can occur under these rules, streaming each valid sum when discovered.

```python
# Generate sequences based on chain relations involving factors of 2 and 5
# Starting from small initial values, extend sequences forward and backward
# to find all sequences summing to 2023.

def generate_sequences(start, max_length=20):
    # Generate all possible sequences starting from 'start'
    sequences = [(start, [start])]  # (current_value, sequence)
    results = []
    for _ in range(max_length):
        new_sequences = []
        for value, seq in sequences:
            # Explore neighbors based on the chain relations
            neighbors = [2 * value, 5 * value]
            if value % 2 == 0:
                neighbors.append(value // 2)
            if value % 5 == 0:
                neighbors.append(value // 5)
            for neighbor in neighbors:
                new_seq = seq + [neighbor]
                new_sequences.append((neighbor, new_seq))
        sequences = new_sequences
    # Filter sequences with sum == 2023
    for _, seq in sequences:
        s = sum(seq)
        if s == 2023:
            print('Sequence:', seq)
            yield s

# Explore starting from small values to find all possible sums equal to 2023
# Note: We limit starting values for efficiency.
for start_value in range(1, 20):
    for answer_sum in generate_sequences(start_value):
        print('Possible sum:', answer_sum)
```
