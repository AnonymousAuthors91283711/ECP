. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The pattern suggests the set contains composite numbers, especially prime powers, given the constraints on sums and injectivity. The candidates are 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 16, 18, 20, which include powers of 2, 3, and their products.

Conjecture: the set includes numbers n with prime power structure or their products greater than 3, notably, set {4,6,8,9,10,12,15,16,18,20}.

. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The proposed answer aims to identify a set of natural numbers related to the problem, which involves properties of sums over sets, injectivity, modulus constraints, and particular numeric structures. The enumerated answers suggest that the set includes the numbered integers from 2 up to 20. Since the final answer is to be a set of ℕ, and based on the pattern from enumerated solutions, the simplest and most comprehensive fixed form that matches the pattern is the set of all integers from 4 to 20 inclusive. 

This choice aligns with the pattern in the enumerated answers where key numbers are those greater or equal to 4 (probably due to some small case exceptions at 2 or 3). To keep it general and in line with the enumerated solutions, the set is best expressed as a finite set including the integers 4 through 20.

. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The goal is to define the set in Lean that matches the pattern observed in the enumerated answers (from 2 to 20). The core issue is that the previous placeholder employed plain comments and natural language, which are invalid in Lean syntax. 
To resolve this, I will directly define `omnimath4062_answer` as the finite set of natural numbers from 4 through 20, inclusive, matching the pattern inferred from the enumeration. This choice aligns with the general pattern and is suitable as a fixed answer in set notation.

Since the enumerated solutions list from 2 onwards, and the pattern in the reasoning favors starting from 4 (perhaps due to context in the original problem), I will define `omnimath4062_answer` as the set `{4, 5, 6, ..., 20}`. 

Here's the corrected Lean code:

<<<{4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20}>>>
