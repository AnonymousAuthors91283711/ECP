Maximum subset size for n=3: 4. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
The pattern suggests the maximum size is 4, with subsets symmetric around zero avoiding triplet sums of zero, specifically excluding certain symmetric triples. Based on the enumeration, the subset size approaches 4 for n ≥ 3, with common elements being symmetric around zero like ±1, ±2, ±3. A general form captures symmetric pairs with an explicit zero inclusion, avoiding triplets summing to zero. Hence, for n> 0, a suitable closed form is:

<<<fun n : ℕ => 4>>>

This maximizes subset size while obeying the constraints.
