Ground Truth Answer: {(0, 1, 2)}
Proposed Answer: ( { (w, l, t) | w + l + t = 3 } ) \ ( { (w, l, t) | ∀ g_for g_against : ℕ, g_for ≤ g_against } )
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is mostly correct in its structure but has some issues:
1. The ground truth answer is a specific set {(0,1,2)} while the proposed answer is a more general set difference
2. The proposed answer correctly captures the condition w+l+t=3 and the existence of g_for > g_against
3. However, the proposed answer is not exactly equivalent to the ground truth answer since it includes all tuples where w+l+t=3 and there exists some g_for > g_against, while the ground truth answer specifically excludes only (0,1,2)

The proposed answer is more general than needed, but captures the essential mathematical conditions. Therefore, it's "Close" but not exactly equivalent.
