abbrev P2002AMCA_1_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem P2002AMCA_1 : 
  (roots ((2 * X + 3) * (X - 4) + (2 * X + 3) * (X - 6))).sum = P2002AMCA_1_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 7/2
Proposed Answer: (3 : ℚ)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the sum of roots of the polynomial (2X + 3)(X - 4) + (2X + 3)(X - 6).

2. First, let's simplify the polynomial:
   (2X + 3)(X - 4) + (2X + 3)(X - 6) = (2X + 3)[(X - 4) + (X - 6)] = (2X + 3)(2X - 10)

3. The roots are:
   - From (2X + 3): X = -3/2
   - From (2X - 10): X = 5

4. Sum of roots: -3/2 + 5 = (-3/2 + 10/2) = 7/2

The ground truth answer is correct (7/2), while the proposed answer is 3. These are not equivalent.
