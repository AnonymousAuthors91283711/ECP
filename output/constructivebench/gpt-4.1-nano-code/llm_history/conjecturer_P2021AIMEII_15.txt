theorem P2021AIMEII_15 (f g : ℕ → ℕ) (h : ∀ n, f n = 2 * f (n - 1) + g (n - 1)) (h0 : f 0 = 1) (h1 : g 0 = 0) :
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ f n * 7 = g n * 4} P2021AIMEII_15_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: No solution found within range.
. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the recurrence, initial values, and the equation, the growth pattern suggests that no positive integer n satisfies 7f(n) = 4g(n) because the sequences grow exponentially but their ratio never stabilizes to a rational number 4/7. Therefore, the set is empty.
