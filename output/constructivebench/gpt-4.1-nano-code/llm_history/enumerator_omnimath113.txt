[write_program]
The problem appears to be a logical statement involving functions from finite sets, inequalities, and prime numbers. We need to explore possible functions \(k : Fin\,2002 \to \mathbb{N}\) that satisfy certain properties:

- Each \(k(i) > 0\),
- All \(k(i)\) are distinct for different \(i\),
- For all \(n \geq 2001\), there exists some \(i\) such that \(k(i) \times 2^n + 1\) is prime.

To explore this, I will:

- Enumerate small candidate functions with distinct positive values.
- Focus on small values of \(k(i)\), e.g., from 1 to 10.
- Check the prime condition for \(n\) starting from 2001 up to a small limit (say 2003) due to computational constraints.
- Since the overall search space is huge, only small candidate sets are tested, and the code streams answers when a suitable candidate is found.

This will help in forming conjectures about the validity of such functions.

```python
import sympy
from itertools import permutations

# Small sample values for k(i)
candidate_values = list(range(1, 11))

# Limit for n to check primes (for practical runtime)
n_start = 2001
n_end = 2003  # Small check for demonstration

# Generate all permutations of candidate values for k functions
# with length 5 to limit search space
for length in range(3, 6):
    for candidate in permutations(candidate_values, length):
        # Check the prime condition for n from n_start to n_end
        prime_condition_met = True
        for n in range(n_start, n_end + 1):
            if not any(sympy.isprime(k * 2 ** n + 1) for k in candidate):
                prime_condition_met = False
                break
        if prime_condition_met:
            print(f"Candidate k-values: {candidate} satisfies the condition for n={n_start}-{n_end}")
```
