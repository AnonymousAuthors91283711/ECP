The problem appears to involve finding a list of natural numbers such that when a certain recursive operation is applied via foldr, the resulting integer equals -2013. Specifically, the fold combines elements with the formula: `n * (-4) + d`. 

To approach this numerically, we can simulate the process in Python. We'll find all sequences of natural numbers whose folding yields -2013, prioritizing exact integer solutions. Since the problem allows us to choose small sample parameters and is high-school level, we'll assume the list length is manageable (say, up to length 10), and each element ranges from 0 to 10 to keep computations efficient.

The main idea:
- We'll generate all sequences of length up to 10, with elements from 0 to 10.
- For each sequence, simulate the fold operation.
- If it results in -2013, print the sequence immediately.

This brute-force approach won't be exhaustive beyond small lists, but it should help find possible candidates. Since the expected answer in the problem is a list, we will enumerate sequences until we find some that satisfy the condition.

```python
# Enumerate sequences of natural numbers with small length and values
# to find candidates where fold matches -2013

from itertools import product

target = -2013
max_length = 10
value_range = range(0, 11)  # 0 to 10 inclusive

# Function to simulate the fold
def fold_sequence(seq):
    n = 0
    for d in reversed(seq):  # foldr processes from right to left
        n = n * (-4) + d
    return n

# Generate all sequences within the constraints
for length in range(1, max_length + 1):
    for seq in product(value_range, repeat=length):
        result = fold_sequence(seq)
        if result == target:
            print(seq)
```
