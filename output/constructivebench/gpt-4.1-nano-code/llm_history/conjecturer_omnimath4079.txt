. Enumerated answers: (0, 1, 4). Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ × ℕ)
The only solution for 2^x + 9 * 7^y = z^3 with small nonnegative integers is (0, 1, 4). For x > 0, 2^x grows quickly but cannot match z^3 unless specific conditions hold; with y = 1, 9*7 = 63, and 2^x + 63 = z^3. Trying small x reveals only x = 0 yields z=4. Therefore, the set of solutions simplifies to this singleton.
