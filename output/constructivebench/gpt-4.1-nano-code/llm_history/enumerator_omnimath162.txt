The problem appears to involve a symmetric relation over triples of real numbers and parameters \( m, n \). The theorem states an equivalence between a certain identity involving powers of three real numbers and the membership of the pair \((m,n)\) in a set `omnimath162_answer`. Our goal is to explore the possible pairs \((m,n)\) satisfying the given identity, which simplifies to understanding for which \(m, n\) the relation holds universally.

Given the nature of the equation, key observations:
- The identity is symmetric in \(x,y,z\) and linear in the powers.
- The numerator involves sums of powers, and the denominator normalizes these sums.
  
To explore possible solutions, we can:
- Fix small values of \(m, n\), and test the identity for several triples \((x,y,z)\), especially symmetric or simple cases such as \(x=y=z\), or specific values that satisfy \(x + y + z = 0\).

Approach:
- For small \(m, n \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\), test the identity across several sample triples.
- For each pair, output whether it satisfies the identity.
- Collect those that satisfy the condition for all tested triples, and these pairs will form our `omnimath162_answer`.

Efficiency:
- Limit checks to small parameter values.
- Pick simple, symmetric triples with real values to quickly verify the identity.

Here's the code:

```python
# Program to identify pairs (m, n) satisfying the identity for several test triples.
def test_identity(m, n):
    test_triples = [
        (1, -1, 0),
        (2, -2, 0),
        (1, 2, -3),
        (0.5, -0.5, 0),
        (3, -3, 0),
        (1, 1, -2),
        (2, 3, -5)
    ]
    for x, y, z in test_triples:
        # test that x + y + z == 0
        if abs(x + y + z) > 1e-8:
            continue  # only consider triples with sum zero
        numerator_left = (x**(m + n) + y**(m + n) + z**(m + n))
        denominator_left = (m + n)
        value_left = numerator_left / denominator_left

        numerator_right = ((x**m + y**m + z**m) / m) * ((x**n + y**n + z**n) / n)
        # handle division by zero
        if m == 0 or n == 0:
            continue
        if abs(numerator_right) < 1e-12:
            continue
        value_right = numerator_right

        if abs(value_left - value_right) > 1e-6:
            return False
    return True

# List to store candidates
candidate_pairs = []

# Enumerate small pairs (m, n)
for m in range(1, 6):
    for n in range(1, 6):
        if test_identity(m, n):
            print(f"Pair (m={m}, n={n}) satisfies the identity.")
            candidate_pairs.append((m, n))
```
