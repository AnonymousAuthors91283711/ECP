To assist with this problem, I will analyze the equations systematically. Since the problem involves unknowns \(b, c, r, d\), and a parameter \(P_{2016AIMEII_1}\), I will choose small sample values for the parameter and then enumerate all possible \((b, c, r, d)\) combinations that satisfy the given equations, focusing on integer solutions.

Key equations:
- \(b = P \times r\)
- \(c = P \times r^2\)
- \((P - 5) + d = b - 9\)
- \((b - 9) + d = c - 25\)
- \(P < b < c\)
- \(P + b + c = 444\)

From the equations, we can derive:
\[
d = (b - 9) - (P - 5) = b - 9 - P + 5 = b - P - 4
\]
and
\[
(b - 9) + d = c - 25 \implies (b - 9) + (b - P - 4) = c - 25
\]
Simplify:
\[
2b - P - 13 = c - 25 \implies c = 2b - P + 12
\]

But we also have:
\[
b = P r,\quad c = P r^2
\]

Thus:
\[
P r^2 = 2b - P + 12
\]
and
\[
b = P r
\]

Substituting:
\[
P r^2 = 2 P r - P + 12
\]

Dividing through by \(P\) (assuming \(P \neq 0\)):
\[
r^2 = 2 r - 1 + \frac{12}{P}
\]

For the solutions to be integers, \(\frac{12}{P}\) should be integer. Let's pick small divisors of 12 for \(P\), for example, \(P=1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12\).

I'll choose a few \(P\) values, a small range for \(r\), compute \(b, c, d\), check the constraints, and output the valid solutions.

```python
# Enumerate small parameter P, then iterate over small r values to find solutions
for P in [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]:
    for r in range(1, 20):  # small r to limit complexity
        # Check if 12/P is integer
        if 12 % P != 0:
            continue
        # Compute r^2 from derived equation
        r_squared = 2 * r - 1 + 12 // P
        if r_squared != int(r_squared):
            continue
        r_sq = int(r_squared)
        b = P * r
        c = P * r_sq
        # Check ordering: P < b < c
        if not (P < b < c):
            continue
        # Compute P + b + c
        sum_abc = P + b + c
        if sum_abc != 444:
            continue
        d = b - P - 4
        # Double check the last equations via substitution:
        # (b - 9) + d == c - 25
        if (b - 9) + d == c - 25:
            print(f"P={P}, r={r}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}")
```
