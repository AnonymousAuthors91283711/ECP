. Enumerated answers: L = 1, T(L) = 0 = 0^2
L = 2, T(L) = 0 = 0^2. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The pattern suggests T(L) computes a sum over integers n from 1 to L of floor(n^3/9). For L=1 or 2, T(L)=0, which is 0^2. For larger L, T(L) becomes positive and sometimes a perfect square, but at small L, the value is 0. The set includes L=1 and 2, where T(L)=0.

Answer: 
<<<{1, 2}>>>
