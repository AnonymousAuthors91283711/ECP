  IsGreatest {p : ℝ | 0 < p ∧ (p * (1 - 0.2)) * (1 + 0.075) ≤ 43} P2023AMCB_2_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 50.0
p = 50.0000000000, p * multiplier = 43.0000000000
p = 49.9999999900, p * multiplier = 42.9999999914
p = 49.9999990000, p * multiplier = 42.9999991400
p = 49.9999000000, p * multiplier = 42.9999140000. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The pattern suggests the maximum \(p\) close to 50 where \(p \times (0.8) \times 1.075 \leq 43\). Simplify the multiplication to \(p \times 0.86 \leq 43\), leading to \(p \leq \frac{43}{0.86} \approx 50\). The greatest \(p\) satisfying is approximately 50.
