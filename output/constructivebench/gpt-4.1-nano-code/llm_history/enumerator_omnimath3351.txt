The given theorem states that there exists a unique natural number n less than 10 such that 91 divides the expression \(12345 \times 10^4 + n \times 10^3 + 789\), and this n equals the answer. Our goal is to find that n.

To do this, we can enumerate n from 0 to 9, compute the expression for each n, and check divisibility by 91. We will output each candidate n and the result of the divisibility check.

Since the problem specifies that there is a unique such n, once we find it, we can set that as the answer.

```python
# Enumerate n from 0 to 9, check divisibility, and find the unique n satisfying the condition
for n in range(10):
    value = 12345 * 10**4 + n * 10**3 + 789
    if value % 91 == 0:
        omnimath3351_answer = n
        print(n)  # Stream the found answer immediately
```

This script efficiently finds the unique n satisfying the divisibility condition and prints it immediately.
