Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => if n % 2 = 0 then n / (n + 1) else 1
<<<None>>>
The problem involves evaluating a polynomial P at n+1, where P is defined by its values at integers from 0 to n. The ground truth answer is not provided (marked as "sorry"), and the proposed answer gives a piecewise function based on n's parity. Without knowing the actual polynomial P or its properties, we cannot verify if the proposed answer is correct. The problem appears to be about polynomial interpolation and extrapolation, but the proposed solution's form seems too simplistic compared to what would typically be expected from such a problem. However, we cannot definitively say it's wrong without more information.
