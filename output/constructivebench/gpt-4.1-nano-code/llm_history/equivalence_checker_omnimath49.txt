Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (if Even n then 0 else 2^((n-1)/2), 2^n)
Proposed Answer:  fun n => (2^(n/2), 2^(n/2))
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves finding minimal values for two functions of a sequence z(k) with specific constraints on real/imaginary parts and product norms.

2. The ground truth answer:
   - First component: 0 for even n, 2^((n-1)/2) for odd n
   - Second component: always 2^n

3. The proposed answer:
   - First component: 2^(n/2) for all n
   - Second component: 2^(n/2) for all n

Comparison:
- For the first component:
  * When n is even: ground truth gives 0, proposed gives 2^(n/2) (non-zero)
  * When n is odd: ground truth gives 2^((n-1)/2), proposed gives 2^(n/2) (different)
- For the second component:
  * Ground truth gives 2^n, proposed gives 2^(n/2) (different for all n > 0)

The proposed answer is completely different from the ground truth in all cases except when n=0 (where both would give (1,1)).
