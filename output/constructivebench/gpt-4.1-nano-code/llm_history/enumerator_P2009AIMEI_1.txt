This problem involves finding the greatest difference `d` between two 3-digit numbers constructed from digits `a, b, c` with certain conditions: the middle digit `b` is shared, the two numbers are permutations with specific relations, and the difference is computed accordingly. The goal is to enumerate all such differences and find the maximum value.

Key points:
- `a`, `b`, `c` are digits (1-9 for `a`, 0-9 otherwise).
- Both numbers are 3-digit, i.e., from 100 to 999.
- The relations involve `b^2 = a * c`.
- The difference `d = (abc) - (cba)` with the numbers interpreted as integer values.
- We need to find the maximum such `d`.

To efficiently enumerate, we'll:
- Loop through small values for `a, b, c` within plausible ranges.
- Check the conditions on `b^2 = a * c`.
- Construct numbers and compute differences.
- Track the maximum difference and output all differences as they are found.

```python
# Enumerate digits with constraints and find the greatest difference d between the two numbers.
max_d = None
for a in range(1, 10):             # a: 1-9 (leading digit)
    for b in range(0, 10):         # b: 0-9
        for c in range(0, 10):     # c: 0-9
            if b**2 != a * c:
                continue
            num1 = 100 * a + 10 * b + c
            num2 = 100 * c + 10 * b + a
            if 100 <= num1 <= 999 and 100 <= num2 <= 999:
                d = num1 - num2
                # Output each difference immediately
                print(d)
                if (max_d is None) or (d > max_d):
                    max_d = d
# After enumeration, print the maximum difference
print("Maximum difference:", max_d)
```
