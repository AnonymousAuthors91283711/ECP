This problem involves analyzing the sequence \(x: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R}\) defined with given initial conditions and a recursive relation for \(n \geq 4\). The task is to determine the infimum of the set \(\{n \mid x_n \leq 10^{-6}\}\).

Given:
- Fixed initial values: \(x_1=1\), \(x_2=1\), \(x_3=2/3\).
- Recursive rule for \(n \geq 4\):

\[
x_n = \frac{(x_{n-1})^2 \cdot x_{n-2}}{2 x_{n-2}^2 - x_{n-1} x_{n-3}}
\]

We can simulate this sequence with small sample computations to see where \(x_n \leq 10^{-6}\), then deduce the minimal such \(n\). The sequence likely diminishes rapidly; we seek the minimal \(n\) for which this condition holds.

**Approach:**
- Use the initial values.
- Implement the recursive formula.
- Generate terms until we find an \(x_n \leq 10^{-6}\) or hit a reasonable upper limit.
- Output each \(n\) along with \(x_n\) as it is computed for analysis.

**Note:** To maximize efficiency:
- Use floating point calculations.
- Stop once the threshold is crossed.

```python
# Enumerate sequence and find minimal n with x_n <= 10^-6
x = [None, 1.0, 1.0, 2/3]  # 1-based indexing
threshold = 1e-6
max_terms = 100  # limit to prevent infinite loops

for n in range(4, max_terms + 1):
    numerator = (x[n-1] ** 2) * x[n-2]
    denominator = 2 * (x[n-2] ** 2) - x[n-1] * x[n-3]
    # Protect against division by zero
    if denominator == 0:
        break
    x_n = numerator / denominator
    x.append(x_n)
    print(f"n={n}, x_{n}={x_n}")
    if x_n <= threshold:
        print(f"Sequence crosses threshold at n={n} with x_{n}={x_n}")
        break
```
This code generates terms and streams a minimal \(n\) where \(x_n \leq 10^{-6}\).
