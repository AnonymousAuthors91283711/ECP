This problem seems to involve finding positive integers `(a, b, c)` such that the given polynomial condition holds for a specific expression involving cube roots, and their sum is 98. The key steps to efficiently tackle this are:

- Since the polynomial evaluated at `((a^{1/3} + b^{1/3} + 1) / c)` equals zero, it implies that `((a^{1/3} + b^{1/3} + 1) / c` is a root of the polynomial `8x^3 - 3x^2 - 3x - 1`. 
- For a polynomial with real coefficients, roots can be real or complex; given the context, focus on real roots.
- To simplify, assume the root is rational or manageable.
- Note that `a, b, c` are positive integers and `a + b + c = 98`.

Given the complexity, a practical approach for enumeration:

- Choose small positive integer values of `c` (say, 1 to 20).
- For each `c`, iterate over possible `a, b` such that `a + b = 98 - c`.
- For each `(a, b)`, compute `X = (a^{1/3} + b^{1/3} + 1) / c`.
- Check if `X` is a root of the polynomial (within a small tolerance) by evaluating `8X^3 - 3X^2 - 3X - 1`.

This shows the process of enumerating solutions with manageable computations.

```python
import math

# Polynomial: p(x) = 8x^3 - 3x^2 - 3x - 1
def poly(x):
    return 8*x**3 - 3*x**2 - 3*x - 1

# Check if x is a root of the polynomial within a tolerance
def is_root(x, tol=1e-6):
    return abs(poly(x)) < tol

# Enumerate over possible c, a, b
for c in range(1, 21):  # small c values for efficiency
    remaining = 98 - c
    for a in range(1, remaining):
        b = remaining - a
        # Compute the expression involving cube roots
        a_cbrt = a ** (1/3)
        b_cbrt = b ** (1/3)
        X = (a_cbrt + b_cbrt + 1) / c
        if is_root(X):
            # Found a candidate
            print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, X={X}")
```
