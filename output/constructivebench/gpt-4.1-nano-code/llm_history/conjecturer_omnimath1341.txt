Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the enumeration and the pattern observed, the minimal maximum sum from pairs (a, b, c, d) satisfying the specified conditions appears to be 21, evidenced by the pair (1, 20, 2, 19). Since the sum is minimized in a configuration with small values of a and b, and increases as the values grow, the answer likely corresponds to the maximal sum over such selected quadruples, which is 21 in this pattern.

The error in the provided expression stems from the syntax: in Lean, an abbreviation or definition requires `:=` rather than an `where` clause, and the expression itself must be a value, not a logical statement or comment. 

Based on the pattern and the minimal sum, the answer should be expressed as a concrete function of `a` and `b`, representing the sum `a + b` where they satisfy the properties (distinct positive integers, sum for pairs equal). Using the minimal configuration (a=1, b=20), the sum is 21, but we need a concrete, generalized least upper bound, which is 21.

Thus, the fixed, compile-able answer in Lean should be:

<<<21>>>

**Explanation**: The minimal maximal sum among all quadruples `(a, b, c, d)` satisfying the described properties turns out to be 21. The pattern from enumerated solutions confirms that the minimal maximum sum is 21, achieved by pairs like `(1, 20, 2, 19)`. Since the problem asks for the greatest (maximal) `s = a + b` over all such quadruples, and the minimal maximum sum is 21, the answer is 21.
