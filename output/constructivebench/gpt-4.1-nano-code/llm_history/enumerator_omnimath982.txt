The problem involves exploring the Lebesgue measure of a set in the unit square defined by a modular condition involving an integer `n`, and the notation suggests a connection to number theory and measure theory concepts. Given its complexity and the structure, a plausible approach is to approximate the set by discretizing the `p` space (the unit square) and checking the condition for small integer values of n near a certain range, possibly from -5 to 5, to gather candidate values for the measure.

Since the problem asks for an enumeration of potential answers, and the set depends on a parameter `n`, we can sample a grid of points in `[0,1]Ã—[0,1]` for the `(p.1, p.2)` variables, for each candidate `n`, check the condition, count the measure approximation, and output the measures found. This can help in conjecturing the measure.

Here's a code snippet that performs this sampling for small `n`, approximates the measure, and prints possible answers. It keeps the process efficient by reducing the grid resolution and avoiding unnecessary calculations.

```python
import numpy as np

# Parameters
grid_size = 100  # resolution of the grid
n_range = range(-5, 6)  # sample n from -5 to 5

# Prepare grid points
p_vals = np.linspace(0, 1, grid_size)
measure_candidates = []

# For each n, approximate the measure of the set
for n in n_range:
    count = 0
    for p1 in p_vals:
        for p2 in p_vals:
            numerator = p1 - p2
            denominator = p1 + p2
            if denominator == 0:
                continue
            ratio = numerator / denominator
            if abs(ratio - n) < 0.5:
                count += 1
    measure_estimate = count / (grid_size ** 2)
    print(f"Candidate n={n}: Approximate measure = {measure_estimate}")
    measure_candidates.append(measure_estimate)

# Since the original problem asks for the measure of the whole set,
# these candidate measures help conjecture the actual measure,
# likely a sum or union consideration based on these slices.
