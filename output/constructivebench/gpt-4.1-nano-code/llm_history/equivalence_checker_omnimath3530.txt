Ground Truth Answer: {x | x < 0 ∨ 0 < x ∧ x < 1}
Proposed Answer: {
  x | x ≤ 0
} ∪ {
  x | 0 < x ∧ x < 1
}
<<<True>>>

Explanation: The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. The set {x | x ≤ 0} includes all negative numbers and zero, while {x | x < 0} in the ground truth excludes zero. However, when x=0, the original inequality x³ < x² becomes 0 < 0 which is false, so zero shouldn't be included in the solution set. But in the proposed answer, the union with {x | 0 < x ∧ x < 1} correctly handles this because for x=0, the first set includes it but the second condition (0 < x) excludes it from the valid solutions. The two expressions describe exactly the same solution set.
