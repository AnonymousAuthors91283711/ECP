This code snippet appears to be a formal proof script using Mathlib (a Lean library), defining a theorem with parameters on finite types and several conditions, but the actual core of the theorem is left as a `sorry`, which suggests an incomplete proof.

Given the context, the problem likely involves analyzing relationships among these finite integer variables under these constraints, perhaps locating their possible values, or the value of `M`.

To assist in such a problem, I will generate all experimental candidate solutions that satisfy the given constraints, focusing on the relations involving N, M, R, A, L, Rh, with the domain restrictions since types are `Fin 12` (integers from 0 to 11).

I will:
- Assign small sample values (0..11) to variables as needed.
- Enforce the given equations.
- Generate solutions streaming immediately upon detection.
- Since the problem is about the value of M, and all variables are constrained, I will enumerate possibilities in a small range, checking for consistency.

```python
# Enumerator for finite variables in range 0..11
# Enforces the given relations to find consistent assignments

for N in range(12):
    M_candidates = []
    # From h₁: N.val + 6 = M.val
    M = N + 6
    if M >= 12:
        continue
    for R in range(12):
        # From h₄: R = Rh + 2
        for Rh in range(12):
            if R != Rh + 2:
                continue
            # From h₅: Rh = N + 1
            if Rh != N + 1:
                continue
            if Rh >= 12:
                continue
            # From h₂: A = R + 1
            A = R + 1
            if A >=12:
                continue
            # From h₆: A = 5
            if A != 5:
                continue
            # From h₃: L = M + 2
            L = M + 2
            if L >=12:
                continue
            # Now check if all constraints hold
            # Confirm A=5 is consistent
            if A == 5:
                print(f"Possible values: N={N}, M={M}, R={R}, Rh={Rh}, A={A}, L={L}")
                print(f"  Derived: M={M}, L={L}")
```

This code enumerates small sets of values, enforcing the relations and outputting feasible candidate solutions immediately.

**Note:** Because the main goal is to help with conjecture, not formal proof, this enumeration approximates the potential solution space.
