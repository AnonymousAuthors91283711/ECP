Given the symmetry and the pattern in the enumerated solutions, the triplets are permutations of (a, b, c) with positive integers summing to 10; additionally, the special solutions involving zero and the duplicated pairs suggest the core pattern involves the points where some variables are 1 or 0. The solutions with zero occur when one variable is zero and the other two sum to 10, with specific relations.  
The consistent "core" solutions are permutations of (1, k, 10 - 1 - k) for k in 1..9, avoiding duplicates and zero cases, which cover all fundamental solutions.  
Therefore, the total count relates to the sum over k=1..9, summing the permutations, which totals 20 solutions.  
Distilling this, the number of solutions is 20, encapsulating all the listed solutions as permutations.  

Final answer: <<<20>>>
