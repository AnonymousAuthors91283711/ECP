The problem appears to involve the set of functions from `Fin 2` to `Fin 5`, which are like 2-element sequences with values in 0..4, and a condition involving quadruples in the set `S`. The theorem asserts an upper bound on the size of such a set under some condition.

To assist in conjecture, I'll implement code that:
- Enumerates all possible functions from `Fin 2` to `Fin 5`, i.e., all pairs of values (since `Fin 2` has 2 elements, and `Fin 5` has 5).
- For a small sample, I'll generate all subsets of such functions.
- For specific subsets, I'll check the property involving quadruples (`a, b, c, d`) and verify the negation condition.
- The goal is to find the maximum size of a subset `S` satisfying this property.

This helps establish an upper bound or suggest the value of the `omnimath2089_answer`.

```python
# Enumerate all functions from Fin 2 to Fin 5 as pairs of numbers
# that represent the images of 0 and 1
functions = [(a, b) for a in range(5) for b in range(5)]

max_size = 0
best_sets = []

# Check all subsets of functions (small sample, limit to size 10 for feasibility)
# For demonstration, only consider subsets up to size 6
from itertools import combinations

for size in range(1, 7):
    for subset in combinations(functions, size):
        S = list(subset)
        # Check the property:
        # For all a, b, c, d in S: if {a, b, c, d} are all in S, then
        # Not both a0=c0 and b0=d0 and a1=b1 and c1=d1
        # i.e., the negation of the condition must hold:
        valid = True
        for a, b, c, d in combinations(S, 4):
            a0, a1 = a
            b0, b1 = b
            c0, c1 = c
            d0, d1 = d
            if {a, b, c, d} <= S:
                if (a0 == c0) and (b0 == d0) and (a1 == b1) and (c1 == d1):
                    valid = False
                    break
        if valid:
            size_curr = len(S)
            print(f"Valid subset of size {size_curr}: {S}")
            if size_curr > max_size:
                max_size = size_curr
                best_sets = [S]

# Output the largest found
print(f"Maximum subset size satisfying the condition: {max_size}")
```
