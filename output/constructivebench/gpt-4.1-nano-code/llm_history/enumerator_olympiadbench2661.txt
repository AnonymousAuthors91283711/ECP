This problem asks for the smallest natural number \( K \) such that \( 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times K \geq 70 \). Simplifying the left side:

\[
4 \times 3 \times 2 \times K = 24 \times K
\]

We need the smallest \( K \) with:

\[
24K \geq 70
\]

Since \( K \) is a natural number, the smallest \( K \) satisfying this inequality can be found by dividing 70 by 24 and taking the ceiling:

\[
K \geq \frac{70}{24} \approx 2.916\ldots
\]

Thus, the minimal integer \( K \) is 3. To verify and enumerate possible answers, we can check \( K = 1, 2, 3, \dots \), and find the first \( K \) where \( 24K \geq 70 \). Since the problem requires a proof of least such \( K \), and the enumeration approach helps in conjecturing, here's a program that does this efficiently:

```python
# Enumerate K starting from 1 upwards
for K in range(1, 20):  # limit to a small upper bound for efficiency
    product = 24 * K
    print(f"K={K}, 24*K={product}")
    if product >= 70:
        print(f"Answer: {K}")
        break
```
