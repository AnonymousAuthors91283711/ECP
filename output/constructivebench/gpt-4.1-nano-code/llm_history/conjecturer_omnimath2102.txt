Total solutions for a: 1. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The problem asks for the total solutions for a, given the quadratic equation x^2 - a*x + a = 0 with conditions. The discriminant D = a^2 - 4a must be nonnegative for solutions to exist, so a^2 ≥ 4a, i.e., a(a - 4) ≥ 0, implying a ≥ 4 (since a > 0). With the quadratic solutions an integer x, for a ≥ 4, there are two solutions. Thus, total solutions for a are 4 (since a=4 gives solutions, and solutions are only for a≥4). The total is 4.
