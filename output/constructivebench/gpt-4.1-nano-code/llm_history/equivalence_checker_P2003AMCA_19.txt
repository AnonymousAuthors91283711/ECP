abbrev P2003AMCA_19_answer : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ → ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem P2003AMCA_19 (a b c : ℝ) (ha : a ≠ 0) :
  (let f := fun x => a*(x-5)^2 + b*(x-5) + c
   let g := fun x => -a*(x+5)^2 - b*(x+5) - c
   (f + g) = P2003AMCA_19_answer a b c) ∧ 
  10 * b ≠ 0 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun a b c x => 10 * b * x + (50 * b + 2 * c)
Proposed Answer: fun a b c x => a * 0 + b * 30 + c
Let's analyze the problem and the answers carefully:

1. The problem defines two functions f and g, then asks for their sum (f + g). The ground truth answer correctly computes this sum:
   - f(x) = a*(x-5)² + b*(x-5) + c
   - g(x) = -a*(x+5)² - b*(x+5) - c
   - f(x) + g(x) = a[(x-5)² - (x+5)²] + b[(x-5) - (x+5)] + (c - c)
   - Simplifying: a(-20x) + b(-10) + 0 = -20a x - 10b

2. However, the ground truth answer given is 10*b*x + (50*b + 2*c), which doesn't match our calculation. This suggests there might be a typo in the ground truth answer.

3. The proposed answer is a*0 + b*30 + c, which is a constant function (doesn't depend on x), while the correct answer should be linear in x.

4. Neither answer matches what we would expect from the problem statement. The proposed answer is completely wrong as it's missing the x dependence entirely.
