The problem asks to compute the number of triples \((k,m,n)\) with each parameter up to 100, satisfying the equation:

\[ 2^m \cdot n - 2^n \cdot m = 2^k \]

We need to enumerate all such triples and count them, then output the total count.

Approach:
- Loop over all \(k, m, n \leq 100\)
- Check if the equation holds
- Increment count if it does
- Print each valid triple immediately
- Assign the total count at the end to `omnimath1101_answer`

This brute-force enumeration is manageable because \(100^3 = 1,000,000\) iterations, which should be feasible within these constraints.

```python
# Count the number of triples (k, m, n) with the given properties
count = 0
for k in range(101):
    for m in range(101):
        for n in range(101):
            lhs = (2 ** m) * n - (2 ** n) * m
            if lhs == 2 ** k:
                print(f"({k}, {m}, {n})")
                count += 1
print(f"Total count: {count}")
# Assign to the answer variable
omnimath1101_answer = count
```
