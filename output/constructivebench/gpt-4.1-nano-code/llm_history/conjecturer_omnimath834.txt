  Complex.abs (b * c + c * a + a * b) = omnimath834_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Vertices: a=0j, b=(18+0j), c=(9+15.588457268119894j)
Sides: |ab|=18.0, |bc|=18.0, |ca|=18.0
|a + b + c|=31.176914536239792
|bc + ca + ab|=323.99999999999994. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The vertices form an equilateral triangle with side 18, and sum of vertices magnitude is 36, suggestive of symmetric configuration. The value |bc + ca + ab| is maximized when vertices are evenly spaced on a circle, leading to |b c + c a + a b| = 3 * 18^2 = 972.  

Answer: <<<972>>>
