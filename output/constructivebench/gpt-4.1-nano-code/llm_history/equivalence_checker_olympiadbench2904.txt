  olympiadbench2904_answer (A, B) = 3750 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun (A, B) => (15 * (1800 / 20) * (1/B) / (1/A))
Proposed Answer: fun p : ℚ × ℚ => (p.1 + p.2) * 1000
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us A = 1/9 and B = 1/25, and asks for a function that returns 3750 when given these inputs.

2. Ground Truth Answer:
   - When we plug in A=1/9 and B=1/25:
   - (15 * (1800/20) * (1/B) / (1/A)) = (15 * 90 * 25 / 9) = 15 * 90 * 25 / 9 = 3750

3. Proposed Answer:
   - (p.1 + p.2) * 1000 = (1/9 + 1/25) * 1000 ≈ (0.111 + 0.04) * 1000 ≈ 151.111... ≠ 3750

The proposed answer gives a completely different and incorrect result compared to the ground truth answer. They are not equivalent.
