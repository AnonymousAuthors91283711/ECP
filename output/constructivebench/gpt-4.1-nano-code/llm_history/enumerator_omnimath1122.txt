This problem appears to involve computing a specific sum of probabilistic terms involving binomial coefficients and powers. The formula resembles the sum of two terms representing probabilities of certain outcomes, perhaps related to binomial distributions. To assist in conjecturing the answer, we'll enumerate possible values by explicitly calculating the two terms and their sum. Since the binomial coefficient (choose 6 4) is fixed, we can evaluate the expression precisely in Python and print the result immediately when found.

```python
from math import comb

# Fixed binomial coefficient
binom = comb(6, 4)

# Probabilities
p1 = 2/3
p2 = 1/3

# Term 1: choose 6 4 * (2/3)^5 * (1/3)^2
term1 = binom * (p1 ** 5) * (p2 ** 2)
print("Term 1:", term1)

# Term 2: choose 6 4 * (1/3)^5 * (2/3)^2
term2 = binom * (p2 ** 5) * (p1 ** 2)
print("Term 2:", term2)

# Sum of the two terms
answer = term1 + term2
print("Answer:", answer)
```
