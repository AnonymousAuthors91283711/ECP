The problem involves finding the maximum value of the ratio x'/y' for integers x', y' between 10 and 99, with their sum constrained so that their average is 60, i.e., x' + y' = 120. We are to examine all such pairs and determine which yields the maximum ratio x'/y'. The maximum ratio occurs when x' is as large as possible and y' is as small as possible within the constraints. So, for all pairs (x', y') with x' + y' = 120, 10 ≤ x', y' ≤ 99, the ratio x'/y' is maximized when x' is maximum and y' is minimum, i.e., x' = 99, y' = 21. We just need to verify these bounds and print the maximum ratio.

```python
# Enumerate all pairs (x', y') with constraints 10 ≤ x', y' ≤ 99, and x' + y' = 120
# Find the pair that maximizes x'/y'
max_ratio = 0
max_pair = (0, 0)
for x in range(10, 100):
    y = 120 - x
    if 10 <= y <= 99:
        ratio = x / y
        print(f"Pair (x={x}, y={y}) with ratio={ratio}")
        if ratio > max_ratio:
            max_ratio = ratio
            max_pair = (x, y)

print(f"Maximum ratio: {max_ratio} achieved at pair {max_pair}")
```
