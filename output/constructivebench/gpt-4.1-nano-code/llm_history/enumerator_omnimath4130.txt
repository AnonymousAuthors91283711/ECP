The problem asks to find all triplets \((a,b,c)\) of positive integers such that:
- \(a \times b - c = 2^{k_1}\),
- \(b \times c - a = 2^{k_2}\),
- \(c \times a - b = 2^{k_3}\),

for some non-negative integers \(k_1, k_2, k_3\).

Since the problem involves exponential powers of 2, I will test small positive integers for \(a, b, c\), check if the three conditions are satisfied with some powers of 2, and enumerate all solutions with small bounds.

I'll limit \(a, b, c\) to small values (e.g., 1 to 10) to keep computations manageable and avoid hardcoded solutions, streaming solutions as soon as they satisfy the conditions.

```python
# Enumerate all positive integer triples (a, b, c) with small bounds
# For each, check if the three differences are powers of two
# If so, print the triplet and corresponding k-values
import math

def is_power_of_two(n):
    return n > 0 and (n & (n - 1)) == 0

for a in range(1, 11):
    for b in range(1, 11):
        for c in range(1, 11):
            diff1 = a * b - c
            diff2 = b * c - a
            diff3 = c * a - b
            if all(n >= 0 for n in (diff1, diff2, diff3)):
                if all(is_power_of_two(n) for n in (diff1, diff2, diff3)):
                    k1 = int(math.log2(diff1))
                    k2 = int(math.log2(diff2))
                    k3 = int(math.log2(diff3))
                    print(f"(a, b, c) = ({a}, {b}, {c}) -> "
                          f"2^{k1}={diff1}, 2^{k2}={diff2}, 2^{k3}={diff3}")
```
