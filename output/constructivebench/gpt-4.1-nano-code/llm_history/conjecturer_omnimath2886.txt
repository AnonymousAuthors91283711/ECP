Total solutions for k: 7. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The solutions hinge on the Diophantine equations and the linear relations between x, y, and k. The sequence hints at a pattern related to multiples of specific solutions, with the greatest common divisor considerations. Based on the data, the values increase roughly by increasing scale factors, resembling a linear function proportional to the solutions. The only answer matching these scale and pattern constraints is 147, consistent as the largest solution in the enumerated list.
