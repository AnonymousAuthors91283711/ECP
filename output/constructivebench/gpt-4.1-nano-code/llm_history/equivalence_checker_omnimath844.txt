Ground Truth Answer: 2004002
Proposed Answer: (2 * (2001)^2) - 2004
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves summing an alternating series with quadratic terms from k=0 to 2000 (Finset.range 2001).

2. Ground truth answer: 2004002
3. Proposed answer: (2*(2001)^2) - 2004 = 2*4004001 - 2004 = 8008002 - 2004 = 8005998)

The proposed answer evaluates to 8005998, which is clearly different from the ground truth answer of 2004002. The proposed formula doesn't match the actual sum.
