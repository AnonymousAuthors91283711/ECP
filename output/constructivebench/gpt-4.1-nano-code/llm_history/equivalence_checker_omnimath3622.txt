Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {m : ℕ | 2 ≤ m}
<<<None>>>

Since the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's intentionally left undefined in the Lean proof assistant), we cannot verify whether the proposed answer {m : ℕ | 2 ≤ m} is equivalent to the ground truth. The problem appears to be about finding the set of natural numbers m > 0 where certain conditions about sequences a and g hold, but without knowing the intended solution, we cannot determine if the proposed answer is correct.
