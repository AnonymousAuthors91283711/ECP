The problem appears to relate to integer solutions of the generalized Fermat equation: \(a^n + b^n = c^n\), with \(a,b,c > 0\) and \(n \in \mathbb{Z}\). It asks to determine for which integers \(n\) there exist positive integers \(a,b,c\) satisfying the equation. Based on Fermat's Last Theorem, such solutions only exist for \(n=2\) over the reals, but not for integers \(n>2\).

To assist in the conjecture, we'll enumerate small integer values of \(n\), check possible \(a, b, c\), and list the solutions found. Since the problem is high school level, focus on small \(n\), say from -2 to 3, and small \(a, b, c\), up to 20.

The program will:
- Print the parameter \(n\),
- Search for solutions with \(a, b, c \in \{1, \dots, 20\}\),
- Indicate when solutions are found,
- Avoid hardcoding conclusions, just enumerate possibilities.

The goal:
- Check for solutions at each \(n\),
- List solutions immediately,
- Determine the values of \(n\) (positive, negative, or zero) for which solutions exist.

```python
import math

# Define the range for k
max_base = 20
n_values = list(range(-2, 4))  # From -2 to 3

for n in n_values:
    solutions_found = False
    for a in range(1, max_base+1):
        for b in range(1, max_base+1):
            sum_pow = a ** n + b ** n
            # For negative n, compute c as the nth root of sum_pow
            if n != 0:
                # Avoid division by zero
                if sum_pow <= 0:
                    continue
                c = round(sum_pow ** (1 / n))
                # Check if c^n equals sum_pow
                if c > 0 and abs(c ** n - sum_pow) < 1e-6:
                    print(f"n={n}, a={a}, b={b}, c={c} (solution)")
                    solutions_found = True
            else:
                # n=0: a^0 + b^0 = 1 + 1 = 2
                # c^0=1, so c^0=2? no, so check if c^0=2
                c = 1  # 1^0=1, no
                # For c=2, 2^0=1, no
                # No solution for n=0 in positive c
                pass
    if not solutions_found:
        print(f"n={n}: no solutions found with bases up to {max_base}")
```
