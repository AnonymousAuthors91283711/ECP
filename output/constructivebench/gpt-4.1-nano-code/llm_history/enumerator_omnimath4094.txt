This problem involves analyzing a function T: ℕ → ℕ with specific properties related to divisibility and summation. To assist in conjecturing the answer, I will implement a Python script that enumerates small candidate values for T(n), given the constraints:

- T(n) > 0
- For each k > 0, n divides the sum of integers from 1 to k, provided n ≤ T(n) (implying T(n) bounds the sum)
- n divides the sum of 1 to T(n)

Since the constraints seem to involve divisibility and sum relationships, I'll select small n values and generate candidate T(n), filtering those satisfying the conditions.

The key is to produce all T(n) values up to a small bound (say 20), check the constraints, and print candidates immediately. This will help with conjecturing the possible "omnimath4094_answer" set.

```python
# Enumerate small functions T: ℕ → ℕ satisfying the given properties.
# For each n, consider possible T(n) from 1 to 20.
# Check if T(n) > 0 and divisibility conditions hold.

def sum_1_to_k(k):
    return k * (k + 1) // 2

max_N = 10  # limit for the domain
max_T = 20  # upper bound for T(n) candidates

def satisfies_conditions(n, Tn):
    if Tn <= 0:
        return False
    sum_Tn = sum_1_to_k(Tn)
    if sum_Tn % n != 0:
        return False
    # Check for all k > 0 (up to some bound), if n divides sum of 1..k whenever n ≤ T(n)
    for k in range(1, Tn + 1):
        total = sum_1_to_k(k)
        # Only need to verify for k ≤ Tn probably, as per the problem statement
        if total % n != 0:
            return False
    return True

# For each n, find candidate T(n)
for n in range(1, max_N + 1):
    for Tn in range(1, max_T + 1):
        if satisfies_conditions(n, Tn):
            print(f"The candidate T({n}) = {Tn}")
```
