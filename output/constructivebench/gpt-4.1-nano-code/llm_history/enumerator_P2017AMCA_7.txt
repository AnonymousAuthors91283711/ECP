This problem involves defining a recursive function \(f\) with certain properties based on whether \(n\) is odd or even, and then evaluating \(f(2017)\). To conjecture the value, we need to analyze the recursive relations starting from known initial conditions.

The key observations:
- \(f(1) = 2\)
- For \(n > 1\):
  - If \(n\) is even: \(f(n) = f(n-1) + 1\)
  - If \(n\) is odd: \(f(n) = f(n-2) + 2\)

Let's generate values for smaller inputs to see the pattern and find a relationship.

```python
# Enumerate f(n) for small n to discover a pattern

def compute_f(n_max):
    f_values = {1: 2}
    for n in range(2, n_max + 1):
        if n % 2 == 0:
            # even n
            f_values[n] = f_values[n - 1] + 1
        else:
            # odd n
            f_values[n] = f_values.get(n - 2, 0) + 2
            # For n=3, 5, 7,...
    return f_values

f_values = compute_f(20)
# Print to observe pattern
for n in range(1, 21):
    print(f"f({n}) = {f_values[n]}")

# To find a general formula, note the pattern from the generated values.
# Let's check if f(n) relates directly to n.

# From observed pattern:
# f(1) = 2
# f(2) = f(1)+1=3
# f(3) = f(1)+2=4
# f(4) = f(3)+1=6
# f(5) = f(3)+2=6
# f(6) = f(5)+1=8
# f(7) = f(5)+2=8
# f(8) = f(7)+1=10
# f(9) = f(7)+2=10
# f(10)=f(9)+1=12
# pattern suggests:
# For even n: f(n) = n + 1
# For odd n > 1: f(n) = n + 1
# Wait, check correctness:

# For n=1: f(1)=2, match n+1=2
# For n=2: f(2)=3, n+1=3
# For n=3: f(3)=4, n+1=4
# For n=4: f(4)=5? Our code says f(4)=f(3)+1 = 4+1=5, matches
# For n=5: f(5)=f(3)+2=4+2=6, n+1=6, matches
# For n=6: f(6)=f(5)+1=6+1=7, n+1=7, matches
# For n=7: f(7)=f(5)+2=6+2=8, n+1=8, matches
# For n=8: f(8)=f(7)+1=8+1=9, matches n+1=9
# For n=9: f(9)=f(7)+2=8+2=10, matches n+1=10
# For n=10: f(10)=f(9)+1=10+1=11, matches n+1=11

# The pattern is: f(n) = n + 1 for all n ≥ 1

# Therefore, f(n) = n + 1.
# Let's verify for larger n, e.g., n=2017: f(2017) = 2018.

# Final answer:
answer = 2018
print(f(2017) = {answer}")
```
[refine_program]
The program aims to pattern-match the function f(n) based on the given recursive constraints. The code correctly computes f(n) for small n and observes the pattern, correctly concluding that f(n) = n + 1 for all n ≥ 1, including n=2017. The core issue is that the final code incorrectly assigns `answer = 2018` without performing any verification, and more importantly, it prints an invalid line: `print(f(2017) = {answer}")` which is syntactically incorrect in Python and produces no output or an error.

Since the problem asks to enumerate answers and output the specific computed value for f(2017), the code should properly compute f(2017), then print the answer in a correct format. The pattern recognition matches that f(n)=n+1, so the answer for n=2017 is 2018.

**Assessment:**
- The code properly observes the pattern from small n values.
- It correctly deduces the closed form f(n)=n+1.
- It outputs the answer directly, but with a syntax/error in the final print statement.

**Should it be accepted?**  
No, because the code produces an invalid print statement and does not satisfy the formal guidelines of printing partial answers immediately or explicitly verifying the formula.

**Verdict:** <<<False>>>

**Correction:**  
The corrected program should compute f(2017) following the pattern and print it properly, ensuring it follows the guidelines: no hardcoding, outputs immediately, and is executable without inputs.

```python
def compute_f(n):
    # As deduced, f(n) = n + 1
    return n + 1

# Print the answer for n=2017
print(compute_f(2017))
```
