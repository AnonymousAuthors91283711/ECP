abbrev omnimath3398_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath3398 : 1 / (2 + (2 / 3)) = omnimath3398_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 3/8
. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The answer given is 3/8, which is a rational number that can be expressed as a simplified fraction. 

The pattern suggests a straightforward rational number, and based on the enumeration, the answer is a fixed constant value. 

Since the expression 1 / (2 + (2 / 3)) simplifies to 3/8 directly, a closed-form answer is:

<<<(3 : ℚ) / 8>>>

This matches the answer type and the enumerated answer.
