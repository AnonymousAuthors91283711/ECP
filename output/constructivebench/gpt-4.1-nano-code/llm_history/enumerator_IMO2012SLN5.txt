This problem appears to relate to a functional characterization involving the radical function (product of distinct prime factors). The problem asks for all functions \(f:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}\) satisfying a specific divisibility condition involving their images and radicals, and then to describe the set of solutions explicitly.

We will:
- Search for elementary or constant solutions that satisfy the condition.
- Explore simple candidate functions like constant functions or functions proportional to \(\operatorname{rad}(n)\).
- Check whether any other simple solutions exist up to a certain bound.
- For each candidate, verify the divisibility condition directly.
- Output candidates as they are found.

Since the problem is about divisibility properties, simple functions like constant functions or functions proportional to radicals are promising starting points. Also, because of the divisor condition involving radicals, the constant function \(f(n)=k\) might be a solution for certain \(k\).

```python
# Enumerate simple solutions (constant functions and functions proportional to rad(n))
def prime_factors(n):
    factors = set()
    d = 2
    while d * d <= n:
        while n % d == 0:
            factors.add(d)
            n //= d
        d += 1
    if n > 1:
        factors.add(n)
    return factors

def rad(n):
    # Product of distinct prime factors
    product = 1
    for p in prime_factors(n):
        product *= p
    return product

# Candidate functions: constant functions f(n) = c; functions proportional to rad(n), e.g. f(n)=k*rad(n)
# Check for constant functions c>=0
for c in range(5):
    # Verify the condition for c
    valid = True
    for n in range(1, 20):
        if rad(c) == 0:
            continue
        if rad(c) == 0:
            continue
        # Check divisibility: rad(c) divides rad(c * rad(n))
        left = rad(c)
        val = c * rad(n)
        right = rad(val)
        if right % left != 0:
            valid = False
            break
    if valid:
        print(lambda n: c)

# Additionally, test functions of the form f(n) = r * rad(n)
for r in range(1, 5):
    def f(n, r=r):
        return r * rad(n)
    valid = True
    for n in range(1, 20):
        left = rad(f(1))
        val = f(n)
        right = rad(val)
        if right % left != 0:
            valid = False
            break
    if valid:
        print(f)

# The code systematically explores simple candidate functions to conjecture solutions
