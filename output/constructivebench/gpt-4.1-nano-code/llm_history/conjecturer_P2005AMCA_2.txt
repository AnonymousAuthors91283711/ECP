abbrev P2005AMCA_2_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2005AMCA_2 : 
  ∃! (x : ℝ), 2 * x + 7 = 3 ∧ P2005AMCA_2_answer * x - 10 = -2 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: -4.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The unique real number `x` satisfying the linear system is found by solving `2x + 7 = 3` which yields `x = -2`, then checking the second condition `P2005AMCA_2_answer * x - 10 = -2` implies `P2005AMCA_2_answer * (-2) - 10 = -2`, leading to `P2005AMCA_2_answer = 4`. The solutions match the enumerated answer `-4.0` or `4.0`, but only one satisfies the unique existence condition for the original problem, indicating the answer is `-4`.\
Answer: <<<-4.0>>>
