Total pairs: 8. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Since all pairs satisfy a + b = 44 / 4 = 11, with constraints 4 < a < b < 22, and the pairs are symmetric around 11, the pairs are (5,6), (6,5), etc., but since the pairs are ordered in ℤ × ℤ, only positive, increasing pairs are considered. The valid pairs are (5,6), (6,7), (7,8), (8,9), (9,10), (10,11), (11,12), (12,13), but these don't match enumerated pairs; the enumeration indicates they are pairs like (5,21), (6,20), ..., (12,14). Given the pattern, the pairs are symmetric with sums proper and fixed difference: the pairs have a + b = 26, considering 4 + a + b + 22 = 13 * 4, but the enumeration suggests that a + b = 26, with a from 5 up to 12, and b from 21 down to 14. Counting these gives 8 pairs.

Hence, the total number of pairs is 8, matching the enumeration.

Final answer:

<<<8>>>
