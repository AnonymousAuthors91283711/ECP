This pattern suggests that the minimal difference is when both sequences sum to approximately equal values; thus, the absolute difference is their difference, which is 290.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The core issue with the proposed answer ` (794 - 504) = 290` is that it's a Prop (proposition) in Lean, not a natural number (ℕ). Since `abbrev P2013AMCB_15_answer : ℕ := ...` expects an ℕ, you should provide the numerical result directly, not an equation or equality statement.

Looking at the pattern and the enumerated answers, it appears the minimal value for the difference |head! as - head! bs| that satisfies the conditions is achieved when `a0 = b0 = 504`. This suggests the minimal difference is zero, corresponding to `a0 = b0 = 504`.

Thus, the proper answer in Lean syntax as an ℕ is simply `504`. This is consistent with the pattern where the minimal difference found is zero, which can be written as `0` (zero).

Final answer:
<<<504>>>

This fixed answer is a proper ℕ constant, aligns with the pattern seen in the enumerations, and is the natural choice for the minimal value of the absolute difference under the given conditions.
