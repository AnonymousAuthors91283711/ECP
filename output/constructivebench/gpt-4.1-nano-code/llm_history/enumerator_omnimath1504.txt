[write_program]
Below is a Python program that enumerates the positive integers N to find all values satisfying the given floor conditions involving floor divisions by 3, 5, 7, and 35. It outputs all such Ns and identifies the greatest one within a reasonable threshold (up to 200) to assist in conjecturing and proving the "greatest" N.

```python
# Enumerate N > 0 up to a threshold (e.g., 200)
# For each N, check if:
# floor(N/3) == floor(N/5) + floor(N/7) - floor(N/35)
# Collect and print all such Ns, track the maximum

max_limit = 200
answers = []

for N in range(1, max_limit + 1):
    a = N // 3
    b = N // 5
    c = N // 7
    d = N // 35
    
    if a == b + c - d:
        print(N)  # Print each answer immediately
        answers.append(N)

# Output the greatest answer found
if answers:
    print("Greatest N:", max(answers))
else:
    print("No solutions found within the range.")
```
