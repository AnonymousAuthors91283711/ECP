  P2014AIMEI_8_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 937. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the constraints, the number N has the form abc with 100 ≤ abc < 1000, and N = abc * 10 + d with d < 10, so abc corresponds to the first three digits of N. The conditions N^2 ≡ N mod 10000 and N in range [1000, 9999] suggest N is a fixed point of the last four digits, i.e., a solution to N^2 ≡ N mod 10000. Known solutions are the positive fixed points of x^2 ≡ x mod 10000, which include 937, matching the enumerated answer.

Thus, the final answer is a number matching these properties, which is 937.
