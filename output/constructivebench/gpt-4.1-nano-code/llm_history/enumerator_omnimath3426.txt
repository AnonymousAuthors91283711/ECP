The problem appears to involve analyzing the inequalities involving a rational number \(a = \frac{1}{n}\), with \(n > 1\). The goal seems to be to characterize when \((a^2 < a \land a < \frac{1}{a})\) holds, and relate this to some property `omnimath3426_answer`. To assist, we'll explicitly test candidates for \(a = 1/n\) where \(n > 1\), and verify the inequalities.

Let's analyze:

- \(a = \frac{1}{n}\), with \(n > 1\),
- \(a^2 < a\) becomes \(\frac{1}{n^2} < \frac{1}{n}\), i.e., \(1/n^2 < 1/n\),
- \(a < 1/a\) becomes \(\frac{1}{n} < n\) (since \(a = 1/n\)),
- Knowing \(n > 1\), \(1/n < 1\), and \(n > 1\).

The inequalities are straightforward to check for small \(n\). We'll enumerate small \(n\) from 2 to, say, 10, to find those \(a\) satisfying the inequalities, and possibly identify the property described by `omnimath3426_answer`.

```python
# Enumerate small n > 1, compute a = 1/n, verify inequalities, and print results.
for n in range(2, 11):
    a = 1 / n
    # Check the inequalities
    condition1 = a**2 < a  # Should hold for all n > 1
    condition2 = a < 1 / a  # Since a=1/n>0 and n>1, this should hold for all n>1
    # For small n, directly assess both conditions
    if condition1 and condition2:
        print(f"n={n}, a={a:.3f}, a^2={a**2:.3f}, a<1/a={a<1/a}")
```
