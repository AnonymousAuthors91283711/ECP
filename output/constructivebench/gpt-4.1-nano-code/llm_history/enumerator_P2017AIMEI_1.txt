The problem seems to involve counting the number of triples of points with certain collinearity conditions in a geometric configuration. Although the original code is in Lean and uses the mathlib library, we can interpret the core logic: 

- There are total points divided into vertices and points on segments AB, BC, and CA.
- We consider all triples of points (`allTriples`).
- Subtract triples that are colinear on each segment (`colinearAB`, `colinearBC`, `colinearCA`).
- The answer is the total number of triplets minus those on the segments, which corresponds to triples forming the "interior" of the figure, presumably.

In Python, we'll:
- Generate the total number of points.
- Generate combinations of points (triples).
- Count those triples where points are colinear on a line segment.
- We avoid enumerating all triples explicitly due to efficiency; instead, we'll use combinatorial reasoning.

Here's a Python program that computes this reasoning efficiently, printing answers as it computes:

```python
from math import comb

# Parameters
vertices = 3
abPoints = 3
bcPoints = 4
caPoints = 5

# Total points
totalPoints = vertices + abPoints + bcPoints + caPoints

# Helper function to compute combinations
def combinations(n, r):
    return comb(n, r)

# Number of points on each segment (including vertices)
# For counting colinear triples on each side:
# Each side has its vertices plus the points added on that side
ab_segment_points = vertices + abPoints
bc_segment_points = vertices + bcPoints
ca_segment_points = vertices + caPoints

# Total number of triples
total_triples = comb(totalPoints, 3)

# Triples where all three points are on the same segment
def colinear_triples(segment_points):
    # Number of triples within points on the same segment
    return comb(segment_points, 3)

# Count of triples on each segment (adding them to subtract later)
ab_triples = colinear_triples(ab_segment_points)
bc_triples = colinear_triples(bc_segment_points)
ca_triples = colinear_triples(ca_segment_points)

# Inclusion-exclusion
answer = total_triples - (ab_triples + bc_triples + ca_triples)

print(f"Total points: {totalPoints}")
print(f"Total triples: {total_triples}")
print(f"Triples on AB: {ab_triples}")
print(f"Triples on BC: {bc_triples}")
print(f"Triples on CA: {ca_triples}")
print(f"Answer (triples not on any side): {answer}")
```
