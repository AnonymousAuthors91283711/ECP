. Enumerated answers: 16. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the recurrence and initial conditions, the sequences resemble forms related to Fibonacci numbers and their variants. Given the pattern of products and differences, the sequences seem to produce Fibonacci-like growth, with (x n).natAbs % 100 quite likely aligning with a consistent modulo pattern. The common residue pattern of Fibonacci numbers mod 100 is known to repeat periodically. A plausible conjecture is that the sequence mod 100 stabilizes around 16 for large n, especially for n=2012, given the pattern in the enumerated answers indicating a small fixed set.
