theorem omnimath3673 (p q : ℕ) :
  p.Prime ∧ q.Prime ∧ p < 2005 ∧ q < 2005 ∧ q ∣ (p^2 + 4) ∧ p ∣ (q^2 + 4) ↔ (p, q) ∈ omnimath3673_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: (2, 2)
(5, 29)
(29, 5). Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ)
The solutions involve primes p, q with p < 2005, q < 2005, satisfying q | p^2 + 4 and p | q^2 + 4. From the pattern in enumerated answers, symmetry suggests that solutions are pairs where p and q satisfy these divisibility relations, with small primes (including 2 and 5) fulfilling the conditions. Given the symmetry and examples, the set appears to be {(2, 2), (5, 29), (29, 5)}. The pattern implies general solutions are these pairs, explicitly those with prime components matching divisibility pattern.

<<<{(2, 2), (5, 29), (29, 5)}>>>

This set matches the enumerated solutions and the logical pattern.
