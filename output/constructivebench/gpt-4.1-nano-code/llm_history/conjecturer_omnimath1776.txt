open Complex Polynomial

abbrev omnimath1776_answer : Set ℂ := sorry
theorem omnimath1776 (x : ℂ) : 
    x^4 + 2 * x^3 + 2 * x^2 + 2 * x + 1 = 0 ↔ x ∈ omnimath1776_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found root: (6.123233995736766e-17+1j)
Found root: (-1+1.2246467991473532e-16j)
Found root: (-1.8369701987210297e-16-1j). Expected Answer Type: Set ℂ
The roots are approximately 1, -1, and 1j or -1j. The polynomial factors as (x + 1)^2(x^2 + 1). So, the solution set includes -1 (double root) and the roots of x^2 + 1, which are ±i. 

Final answer:
<<<{ -1, I, -I }>>>
