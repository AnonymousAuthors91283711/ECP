This problem appears to be a formal theorem statement involving real numbers, sequences, and a recurrence relation, asking for the characterization of certain real numbers related to the sequence defined by a recurrence. The key is to understand the sequence's behavior given the recursive formula:

x_{n+1} = (x_n + α)/ (β * x_n + 1)

and the condition that α * β > 0 (both positive or both negative). The goal is to find all 'a' such that no sequence beginning at 'a' satisfies that recurrence condition, which is a subtle problem likely involving fixed points or invariant properties.

Since it's a formal proof approach, and actual proof details are complex, I will write a Python script that attempts to enumerate possible starting points a for particular small values of α, β, and sequences generated under these constraints, then identify candidates 'a' that do not admit such sequences.

To keep within token limits, I will:

- Use sample small values for α and β, both positive (e.g., α=1, β=1) for simplicity.
- Enumerate initial values of 'a' in a small range.
- For each 'a', simulate the sequence for a limited number of steps.
- Check if the sequence stabilizes or diverges, or satisfies certain properties.
- Output potential 'a' values that seem to have no such sequence satisfying the recurrence (based on simulation).
- Avoid hardcoding solutions, just explore possible starting points.

```python
# We explore initial starting points 'a' to determine whether sequences starting at 'a' can satisfy the recurrence.
# For simplicity, assume alpha=1 and beta=1, both positive, so alpha*beta=1>0.
# We check starting points in a range and simulate sequences for a fixed number of steps.

def simulate_sequence(a, alpha, beta, steps=20, tolerance=1e-6):
    x = a
    for _ in range(steps):
        denom = beta * x + 1
        if denom == 0:
            return 'diverge'
        x_next = (x + alpha) / denom
        # Check for divergence
        if abs(x_next) > 1e6:
            return 'diverge'
        x = x_next
    return x

# Enumerate starting points from -10 to 10
candidates = []
for a in [i * 0.5 for i in range(-20, 21)]:
    result = simulate_sequence(a, alpha=1, beta=1)
    # Collect 'a' if sequence diverges or doesn't satisfy some stability criteria
    if result == 'diverge':
        print(f"Starting at a={a} diverges or escapes to infinity.")
    else:
        # If the sequence stabilizes or converges, print the limit (approximate)
        print(f"Starting at a={a} stabilizes to approx {result}")

# The above helps to identify initial points where sequences do not reproduce the recurrence pattern.
# For detailed proof, further analysis is required, but this script explores potential candidates.
