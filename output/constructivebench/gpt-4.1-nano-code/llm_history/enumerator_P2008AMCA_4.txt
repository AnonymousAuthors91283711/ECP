The problem involves the product: \(\prod_{n=0}^{501} \frac{4(n+2)}{4(n+1)}\).

This simplifies analytically as follows:
\[
\prod_{n=0}^{N} \frac{4(n+2)}{4(n+1)} = \prod_{n=0}^{N} \frac{n+2}{n+1}
\]
since the 4â€™s cancel out.

This telescopes:
\[
\frac{2}{1} \times \frac{3}{2} \times \frac{4}{3} \times \dots \times \frac{N+2}{N+1} = \frac{N+2}{1}
\]

with telescoping cancellations, leaving only the numerator of the last term over the first denominator.

For \(N=501\), the product is:
\[
\frac{501+2}{1} = 503
\]

Here's the Python code that performs the enumeration, confirming the telescoping result numerically:

```python
# Verify the telescoping product for n in range 0 to 501
def compute_product(N):
    result = 1
    for n in range(N+1):
        numerator = 4 * (n + 2)
        denominator = 4 * (n + 1)
        result *= numerator / denominator
        # print intermediate, but per instructions, streaming output
        print(result)
    return result

# Since 4 factors cancel, the exact product is N+2
N = 501
product_value = compute_product(N)
print(f"Product for N={N}:", product_value)
```
