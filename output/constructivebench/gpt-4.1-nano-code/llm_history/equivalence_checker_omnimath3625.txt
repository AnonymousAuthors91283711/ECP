Ground Truth Answer: ∅
Proposed Answer: {(0, 0), (-2, 2)}
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The equation is m⁵ - n⁵ = 16mn
2. The ground truth says there are no integer solutions (empty set)
3. The proposed answer suggests two solutions: (0,0) and (-2,2)

Testing the proposed solutions:
- For (0,0): 0⁵ - 0⁵ = 0 = 16*0*0 → valid
- For (-2,2): (-2)⁵ - 2⁵ = -32 - 32 = -64 = 16*(-2)*2 = -64 → valid

The ground truth claims there are no solutions, but we've found two valid solutions in the proposed answer. Therefore, the ground truth is incorrect and the proposed answer is correct.

However, we should also check if there are any other solutions. Testing small integers shows these might be the only solutions, but we can't be certain without a full proof.

Since the proposed answer contains valid solutions not present in the ground truth, they are not equivalent.
