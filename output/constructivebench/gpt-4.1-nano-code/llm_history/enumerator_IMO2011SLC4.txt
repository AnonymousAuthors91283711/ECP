This problem resembles a classic combinatorial set partitioning problem from IMO 2011 SLC #4, where the goal is to maximize the size of a partition of the natural numbers into disjoint sets with certain sum properties. Analyzing the constraints suggests that the maximum size is roughly related to dividing the natural numbers into sets where each set contains pairs summing to values starting from 15.

Key insight:
- For each set \(A_i\), there are elements \(x, y\) such that \(x + y = n \ge 15\).
- To maximize the number of disjoint sets, we can try to partition the natural numbers into as many sets as possible, where each set contains pairs summing to the same or different \(n \ge 15\).

Approach:
- For \(n \ge 15\), we consider pairs \((x, y)\) with \(x + y = n\).
- We want to find the largest possible number of such disjoint collections.
- The smallest sum \(n\) is 15, where pairs are \((1, 14), (2, 13), ..., (7, 8)\).
- Each sum \(n\) yields \(\left\lfloor \frac{n-1}{2} \right\rfloor\) disjoint pairs \(\{x, n - x\}\).

Therefore, the number of sets corresponds to the maximum number of disjoint pairs we can form, which is limited by the total number of pairings for each \(n\). Since the sets are disjoint, the maximum number of sets we can form corresponds to the minimum over all \(n \ge 15\) of the number of pairs possible.

In practice, since the problem asks for the greatest such \(k\), the maximum number is when we consider all sums \(n \ge 15\), and choose within these sets those pairs that collectively are disjoint across all \(n\). The best case is to pick one pair per sum, leading to an overall count of all such pairs considering the minimal sums.

Let's implement a enumeration for small sums to estimate the maximum:

```python
# Enumerate the maximum number of disjoint pairs formed from sums n >= 15
# For each sum n, pairs are (x, n - x) with 1 <= x < n / 2 + 1
# To maximize the number of sets, pick one pair per sum, ensuring disjointness across sums.

max_pairs_per_sum = []
for n in range(15, 30):  # small sample sums to estimate
    pairs = []
    for x in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        y = n - x
        if x != y:
            pairs.append((x, y))
    # Number of pairs is n//2
    max_pairs_per_sum.append(len(pairs))
    print(f"Sum {n}: can form {len(pairs)} disjoint pairs.")

# The total maximum is limited by the minimal number of pairs per sum in the sample
# Here, pick the minimal among these (which is about 7 pairs for sum 15, 14)
# But for the entire natural numbers, the maximum is unbounded; goal is to find the supremum

# Approach: For large n, the number of pairs per sum is roughly n//2 - 1.
# The total number of disjoint pairs formed overall is approximately the sum over n of pairs, but since pairs are disjoint across all sets, the maximum is min over n of pairs sets.

# For a rough estimate, considering all sums from 15 up to 29:
answer_estimation = min(max_pairs_per_sum)
print(f"Estimated upper bound for the maximum number of sets: {answer_estimation}")
```
