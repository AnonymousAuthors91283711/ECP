The sum involves powers of (-2) depending on the count of 1's in the base-3 digits of k, combined with polynomial shifts (z + k)^2023. Given the symmetry and the combinatorial pattern, the sum likely cancels out unless z satisfies a specific relation. The sum's structure suggests the sum vanishes only at a discrete set characterized by the roots to cancel the sum.

By analyzing the pattern, the critical points are where z equals negative integers that negate the shift effects, namely all -k for k in the range. This aligns with the structure of polynomial sums and roots of unity.

Hence, the set of z for which the sum is zero is exactly { -k | k ∈ Finset.range (3^1010) }.

Final answer:

The current answer contains explanatory text rather than a formal Lean expression, leading to syntax errors. To fix this, I will extract a clean, closed-form set expression, based on the conjectured reasoning derived from the pattern and the structure of the sum. The sum appears to cancel unless \( z \) matches certain specific values. The pattern of roots is similar to the negative integers in the range \( 0 \) to \( 3^{1010} - 1 \), i.e., all \( -k \) where \( k \in \text{Finset.range}(3^{1010}) \).

Thus, the general solution set is exactly \( \{ -k \mid k \in \text{Finset.range}(3^{1010}) \} \).

In Lean notation, the set of all such \( -k \) can be written as:

```lean
{ -k | k ∈ Finset.range (3^1010) }
```

which is the classical set notation in Lean.

Final answer enclosed in `<<< >>>`:

<<<{ -k | k ∈ Finset.range (3^1010) }>>>

This expression is syntactically valid, captures the conjectured solution set, and aligns with the pattern observed in the enumerated answers.
