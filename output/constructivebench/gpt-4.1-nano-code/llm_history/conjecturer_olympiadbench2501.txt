The key issue in the current answer is the use of `π`, which is undefined in Lean's core mathlib without explicit import or notation. To fix this, I will replace `π` with `Real.pi`, the standard notation for π in Lean's mathlib. Based on the enumerated roots, these roots are at odd multiples of π/6, specifically at `(2k + 1) * π/6`. Therefore, the solution set is all real x such that x equals `(2k + 1) * π / 6` for some integer k.

The corrected Lean expression:

<<<{x : ℝ | ∃k : ℤ, x = (2 * k + 1) * Real.pi / 6}>>>

This expression is consistent with the roots found approximately and uses only definitions available in mathlib, ensuring it compiles correctly.
