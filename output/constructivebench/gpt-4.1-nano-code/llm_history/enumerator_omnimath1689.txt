This problem asks about solutions to the equation \(11k + 2n = 2007\) where \(n \leq k\). The goal is to find all nonnegative integer pairs \((n, k)\) satisfying this, then determine the size of this set, i.e., the number of solutions, and possibly its finiteness.

To enumerate solutions, note:
- For each \(k\), \(n = (2007 - 11k)/2\).
- \(n\) is integer only if \(2007 - 11k\) is even.
- \(n \geq 0\) implies \(2007 - 11k \geq 0\).

Since \(2007\) is odd, and \(11k\) is odd if \(k\) is odd and even if \(k\) is even (since 11 is odd):

- \(2007 - 11k\) is even iff \(11k\) is odd, which happens iff \(k\) is odd.

So, only odd \(k\) values can produce integer \(n\).

We iterate over odd \(k\) such that \(11k \leq 2007\):

- \(k \leq \lfloor 2007/11 \rfloor = 182\) (since \(11 \times 182=2002 \leq 2007\))
- \(k\) odd, from 1 to 181 (inclusive).

For each such \(k\):

- Compute \(n = (2007 - 11k)/2\)
- Keep only solutions with \(n \geq 0\) and \(n \leq k\).

The number of solutions is the size of this set.

Let's implement this to list all solutions and count their total:

```python
# Enumerate solutions for 11k + 2n = 2007 with n <= k and n >= 0
solutions = []

for k in range(1, 183, 2):  # k odd, from 1 to 181
    numerator = 2007 - 11 * k
    if numerator < 0:
        break
    if numerator % 2 != 0:
        continue
    n = numerator // 2
    if n >= 0 and n <= k:
        solutions.append((n, k))
        print(f"n = {n}, k = {k}")

# Output total number of solutions
print(f"Total solutions: {len(solutions)}")
```

This code will stream each found solution and finally print their total count, confirming the finite set size.
