  IsGreatest {n : ℕ | n < 2012 ∧ ∀ d : ℕ, d ∣ n → (digits 2 d).count 1 ≤ 2} omnimath1984_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 1536. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Based on the enumeration, the largest number less than 2012 satisfying the digit 2 count condition is 1536, ensuring all divisors' digit 2 counts are ≤ 2. The pattern suggests that the answer is fixed at 1536, without needing to check other candidates explicitly.
