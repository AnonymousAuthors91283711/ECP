The problem appears to involve finding two finite subsets A and B of natural numbers with certain properties. Specifically, for all real x in (0,1), the difference between the sums of x to the powers in A and B is very small. The goal is to demonstrate the existence of such sets, subject to size constraints, and ultimately determine if the property holds.

Since the problem involves bounding the difference of sums for all x in (0,1), and sets A and B are finite, a reasonable strategy is to test small, concrete sets that satisfy the size constraints and see if they fulfill the inequality for a representative sample of x-values approaching 0 and 1. For simplicity, test sets with small sizes and check the inequality for several x-values.

Here's a straightforward enumeration approach:
- Choose small sample sets for A and B (e.g., A = {0, 1, 2}, B = {0, 1, 2}).
- For each pair, test the inequality at selected x-values in (0,1).
- If the inequality holds, print these sets.
- Given the constraints, check if the difference gets sufficiently small.

Below is a simple program to do this. It does not prove the universal quantifier but helps find candidate sets satisfying the inequality at sample points, aiding in conjecture.

```python
import math

# Sample small sets A and B within size constraints
candidate_sets = [
    ({0, 1, 2}, {0, 1, 2}),
    ({0, 1, 3}, {0, 2, 3}),
    ({0, 2}, {1, 3}),
    ({0, 1, 4}, {1, 2, 4}),
]

# Sample x-values approaching 0 and 1
x_values = [0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 0.9, 0.99]

for A, B in candidate_sets:
    print(f"Testing sets A={A}, B={B}")
    for x in x_values:
        sum_A = sum(x ** a for a in A)
        sum_B = sum(x ** b for b in B)
        diff = abs(sum_A - sum_B)
        bound = (1 - x) ** 2011
        # Check if the difference is less than the bound
        if diff < bound:
            print(f"  x={x}: difference={diff:.3e} < bound={bound:.3e} -> OK")
        else:
            print(f"  x={x}: difference={diff:.3e} >= bound={bound:.3e}")
```
