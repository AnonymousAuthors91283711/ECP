The problem involves solving a system of equations involving natural numbers and a real variable \( t \):

\[
\begin{cases}
c t + s = 100 \\
c + s t = 101
\end{cases}
\]

with constraints:
- \( t > 1 \)
- \( c < s \)
- \( c \geq 1 \)

Since the variables are integers (except \( t \)), we can try small values for \( c \) and \( s \), solve for \( t \), check the constraints, and identify solutions where \( s > 50 \).

```python
# Enumerate small c and s, compute t, check constraints.
# Since c >= 1, s > c, and s > 50 when needed, limit s to a reasonable range.
# Solve for t from the two equations:
# c * t + s = 100 => t = (100 - s) / c
# c + s * t = 101 => t = (101 - c) / s
# For solutions, these two expressions for t must be equal.

for c in range(1, 50):  # limit to c small to ensure computational efficiency
    for s in range(c+1, 150):  # s > c
        t1_num = 100 - s
        t2_num = 101 - c
        if c != 0 and s != 0:
            if t1_num * s == t2_num * c:
                t = t1_num / c  # since c != 0
                if t > 1:
                    # Check consistency: t computed from both equations should match
                    if abs((100 - s) / c - (101 - c) / s) < 1e-8:
                        # Check if s > 50
                        if s > 50:
                            print(s)
```
