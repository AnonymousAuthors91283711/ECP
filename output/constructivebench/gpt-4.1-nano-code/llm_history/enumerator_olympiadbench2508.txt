The problem provides a functional equation:

\[
f\left(\frac{2x + 1}{x}\right) = x + 6, \quad \text{for } x \neq 0,
\]

and asks for the value of \(f(4)\).

Given the functional equation, to find \(f(4)\), we need to find an \(x\) such that:

\[
\frac{2x + 1}{x} = 4.
\]

Let's enumerate possible \(x\) values that satisfy this equation.

\[
\frac{2x + 1}{x} = 4 \implies 2x + 1 = 4x \implies 1 = 2x \implies x = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

Substitute \(x = 1/2\):

\[
f(4) = x + 6 = \frac{1}{2} + 6 = 6.5.
\]

Verify whether \(x = 1/2\) satisfies the original conditions (it does, as \(x \neq 0\)).

Since the functional equation directly associates the value of \(f(4)\) to \(x=1/2\), the answer is \(6.5\).
