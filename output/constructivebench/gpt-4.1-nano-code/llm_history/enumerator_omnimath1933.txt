The problem appears to involve counting solutions to specific equations with non-negative integers, then considering a ratio of certain counts as n approaches infinity, and defining an answer based on the limit. Although the full formal proof and limit are complex, for enumeration, we can focus on computing the counts `hP(n)` and `hB(n)` for small `n` and the ratio `(P n) / (B n)` explicitly.

Given the problem's structure:
- `P(n)` counts solutions to `p 1 + 10 * p 2 + 25 * p 3 + 100 * p 0 = n` with `p` bounded
- `B(n)` counts solutions similar to `P(n)` but with the additional constraint `b 0 ≥ 1`.

We will:
- Enumerate `n` from 0 up to a small threshold (e.g., 200).
- For each `n`, compute `hP(n)` and `hB(n)` explicitly by iterating over feasible solutions.
- Print the ratio `(hP(n).to_real / hB(n).to_real)` whenever `hB(n) ≠ 0`.
- Focus on small `n` for efficiency and clarity.

```python
# Enumerate counts hP(n) and hB(n) for small n and compute their ratio
max_n = 200

# Function to count solutions to p1 + 10*p2 + 25*p3 + 100*p0 = n
def count_P(n):
    count = 0
    for p0 in range(n // 100 + 1):
        rem0 = n - 100 * p0
        for p3 in range(rem0 // 25 + 1):
            rem1 = rem0 - 25 * p3
            for p2 in range(rem1 // 10 + 1):
                rem2 = rem1 - 10 * p2
                p1 = rem2
                if p1 >= 0:
                    count += 1
    return count

# Function to count solutions with b0 >= 1
def count_B(n):
    count = 0
    for b0 in range(1, n // 100 + 1):
        rem0 = n - 100 * b0
        for b3 in range(rem0 // 25 + 1):
            rem1 = rem0 - 25 * b3
            for b2 in range(rem1 // 10 + 1):
                rem2 = rem1 - 10 * b2
                b1 = rem2
                if b1 >= 0:
                    count += 1
    return count

print("n, hP(n), hB(n), ratio")
for n in range(max_n + 1):
    p = count_P(n)
    b = count_B(n)
    ratio = p / b if b != 0 else 'undefined'
    # Print results immediately
    print(f"{n}, {p}, {b}, {ratio}")
```
