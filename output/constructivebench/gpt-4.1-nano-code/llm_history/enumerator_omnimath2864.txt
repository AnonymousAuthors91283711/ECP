This problem involves solving for `length`, given the constraints:

- `hiked = 0.6 * length`
- `length - hiked = 8`

From the second equation, substituting `hiked = 0.6 * length`, we get:

`length - 0.6 * length = 8`  
`(1 - 0.6) * length = 8`  
`0.4 * length = 8`  
`length = 8 / 0.4 = 20`

The answer is thus 20, which we will find by enumerating possible `length` values around the derived solution to verify calculations. To follow the requirements, I will write a Python script that searches through a small range to confirm and identify the exact value.

```python
# Enumerate values of length around the expected solution to verify
for length in range(0, 41):  # Check from 0 to 40
    hiked = 0.6 * length
    if abs(length - hiked - 8) < 1e-9:
        print(f"length = {length}")
        print(f"hiked = {hiked}")
        # Since exact match is at length=20, it will be printed when length=20
```
