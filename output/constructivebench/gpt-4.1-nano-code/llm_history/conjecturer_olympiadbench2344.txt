theorem olympiadbench2344 :
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | n ≠ 0 ∧
    ∃ (a r : ℝ), r ≠ 0 ∧
    let t := fun k => a * r ^ (k - 1)
    t 1 * t n = 3 ∧ ∏ k in Finset.range n, t (k + 1) = 59049}
  olympiadbench2344_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n = 1, a ≈ 1.73205, r ≈ 34091.95605
. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The minimal n satisfying the conditions is 1, since the only sequence with a single term (n=1) trivially satisfies the product conditions with any nonzero a, and the minimal such n is obviously 1.
