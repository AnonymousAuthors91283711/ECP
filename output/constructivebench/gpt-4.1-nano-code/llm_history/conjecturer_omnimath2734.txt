Answer: 
Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The main issue with the current proposed answer is that it directly assumes c=26 without solving the equations, and the attempted definition syntax is invalid in Lean. To express c=something in a closed-form, we proceed algebraically from the three given equations:

1. (a + b + c)/3 = 16 ⇒ a + b + c = 48  
2. (c + d + e)/3 = 26 ⇒ c + d + e = 78  
3. (a + b + c + d + e)/5 = 20 ⇒ a + b + c + d + e = 100

From equations (1) and (3):

a + b + c = 48  
a + b + c + d + e = 100

Subtracting:

d + e = 100 - 48 = 52

From (2):

c + d + e = 78

Replace d + e with 52:

c + 52 = 78  
→ c = 78 - 52 = 26

So, c=26, independent of other variables, using the system of equations.

In Lean, the best way is to define the answer as a constant (here, 26), and then in the proof, show that c = 26 follows algebraically. 

Therefore, the concise representation of the answer is simply:

<<<26>>>

The initial failed syntax attempted to incorporate hypotheses and variables incorrectly; instead, the correct approach is to directly express the constant value of c as 26, derived from the algebraic manipulations of the equations.

This aligns with the pattern of the enumerated answers, all giving c=26, and is consistent with the logical deduction from the system.
