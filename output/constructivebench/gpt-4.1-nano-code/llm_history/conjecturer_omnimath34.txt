. Enumerated answers: For n=3, smallest unreachable positive integer is 7. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
The minimal unreachable positive integer appears to follow the pattern of \( 2^{n-1} + 2 \), based on enumeration for small n. This pattern is consistent with the known sequence where all smaller numbers are reachable by sums with varying signs and powers of 2, but the first unreachable is \( 2^{n-1} + 2 \).
