Given the structure of the sums and the equations, the solutions appear to relate to roots of a certain polynomial derived from the sum expressions. Both involve geometric series with the terms and the additional constants. The pattern suggests the solutions involve specific roots of related polynomial equations with symmetrical properties. Based on typical geometric series and the patterns in sums, the solutions are likely to be reciprocals or specific algebraic expressions in \( u \) and \( v \). 

A plausible structured answer, consistent with typical geometric series solutions, is:

<<<fun u v => u + v = 0>>>
