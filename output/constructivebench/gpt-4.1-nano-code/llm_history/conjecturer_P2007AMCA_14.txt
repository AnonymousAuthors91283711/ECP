Given the constraints and the pattern from enumerated solutions, the key insight comes from the factors of 45 and the requirement that the five integers are distinct. The factors involved are related to the values (6 - a), (6 - b), etc. Since their product is 45, they must be factors of 45, and the sum of the integers is linked to the sum of these factors plus 30 (because a = 6 - x, and similarly for others).

The factorization of 45 suggests options like {1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 45}, with some negative counterparts to ensure distinctness and satisfy the product.

By testing these, the sum of a through e aligns with the sum of the factors subtracted from 6, plus 30. When selecting appropriate distinct factors,

Final concise formula: 

<<<6 * 5 - 3>>>
