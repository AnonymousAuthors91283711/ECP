The problem appears to involve complex numbers \(z = 9 + b i\) and equality of the imaginary parts of \(z^2\) and \(z^3\). To find \(b\) such that \(\operatorname{Im}(z^2) = \operatorname{Im}(z^3)\), we will explicitly compute these imaginary parts for sample \(b\) values and check for solutions.

We will then verify the condition over a small range, and find the specific \(b\) satisfying the equality.

```python
# Enumerate candidate b values to find when Im(z^2) = Im(z^3),
# where z = 9 + b i, with b > 0.
# We'll test b in small steps and find candidates where the imaginary parts equal.

import sympy as sp

b = sp.symbols('b', real=True, positive=True)

# Define z = 9 + b*i
z = 9 + b * sp.I

# Compute z^2 and z^3
z2 = z ** 2
z3 = z ** 3

# Imag parts
im_z2 = sp.re(z2 * sp.I)
im_z3 = sp.re(z3 * sp.I)

# Set up the equation im_z2 = im_z3
equation = sp.Eq(im_z2, im_z3)

# Solve for b
solutions = sp.solve(equation, b)

# Filter solutions with b > 0
filtered_solutions = [sol.evalf() for sol in solutions if sol.is_real and sol > 0]

# Print discovered solutions
for ans in filtered_solutions:
    print(ans)
```
