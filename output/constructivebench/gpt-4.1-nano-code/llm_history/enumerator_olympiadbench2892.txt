This problem asks to find a unique integer \( n \) between 2009 and 3009 such that the sum of all odd divisors of \( n \) equals 1024, and to verify that \( n \) is uniquely determined by these conditions. To assist in conjecturing and proving the solution, I will write a Python script that enumerates all candidate \( n \) in the specified range, calculates the sum of odd divisors, and outputs each candidate that satisfies the sum condition.

The script prioritizes exact matches and streams all candidates that meet the condition, helping identify the potential unique \( n \).

```python
def divisor(n):
    """Return all divisors of n."""
    divs = set()
    for d in range(1, int(n**0.5)+1):
        if n % d == 0:
            divs.add(d)
            divs.add(n // d)
    return divs

results = []

# Range is from 2009 to 3009, exclusive of 3009
for n in range(2010, 3009):
    divs = divisor(n)
    odd_divs = [d for d in divs if d % 2 == 1]
    sum_odd = sum(odd_divs)
    if sum_odd == 1024:
        print(f"n = {n}, sum of odd divisors = {sum_odd}")
        results.append(n)

if len(results) == 1:
    print(f"Unique n satisfying condition: {results[0]}")
else:
    print(f"Candidates found: {results}")
```
