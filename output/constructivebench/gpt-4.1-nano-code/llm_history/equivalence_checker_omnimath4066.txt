abbrev omnimath4066_answer : Set (ℕ × ℕ) := sorry
theorem omnimath4066 (n k : ℕ) (h : n ≥ k) :
    (n, k) ∈ omnimath4066_answer ↔ k!! * (n - k)!! ∣ n!! := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(n, k) | k = 0 ∨ k = n ∨ (Even n ∧ Even k) ∨ (n, k) = (2, 1)}
Proposed Answer: { p : ℕ × ℕ | p.2 ≤ p.1 ∧ Nat.doubleFactorial p.2 * Nat.doubleFactorial (p.1 - p.2) ∣ Nat.doubleFactorial p.1 }
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is mostly correct in terms of the mathematical expression and logical structure, but it doesn't explicitly capture the special cases mentioned in the ground truth answer (k=0, k=n, and the specific case (2,1)). While the proposed answer's condition would technically include these cases (since they satisfy the divisibility condition), it doesn't explicitly list them as the ground truth does. The ground truth also specifically mentions the condition about even numbers, which is implied but not stated in the proposed answer. Therefore, while the answers are close in meaning, they're not exactly equivalent in presentation.
