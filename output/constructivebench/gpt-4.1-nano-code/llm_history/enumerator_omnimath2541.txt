The problem appears to involve a combinatorial construction related to partitioning a set of 2n elements into m triplets, with conditions on triplet sizes and coverage of pairs. Our goal is to compute or find the minimal such m for a given n â‰¥ 2, which appears akin to a minimal packing or cover problem.

Since the code is in Lean and introduces a function `omnimath2541_answer` and a theorem about its minimality, but the definitions are incomplete (`sorry` placeholders), we need to approximate or reason about small values of n to understand what the minimal m could be.

For small n, the minimal m is likely the smallest number of triplets covering pairs. We will:

- For n=2, determine minimal m.
- For small n, enumerate the minimal m candidates up to a threshold.
- Print candidate m values as potential minimal solutions, starting from small values and possibly stopping when enough coverage is achieved.

This approach aligns with the requirements: small sample parameters, immediate printing, and efficient enumeration.

```python
# We'll estimate minimal number of triplets (m) needed to cover all pairs of 2n elements,
# with each triplet covering 3 pairs, and each element appearing in some trips.
# For small n, minimal m is roughly ceil(combination(2n, 2) / 3).
import math

def main():
    # We'll test n values from 2 to 5 for demonstration
    for n in range(2, 6):
        total_pairs = (2 * n * (2 * n - 1)) // 2
        # Each triplet covers 3 pairs
        max_triplets_needed = math.ceil(total_pairs / 3)
        print(f"n={n}, total pairs={total_pairs}, minimal m candidate up to={max_triplets_needed}")
        for m in range(1, max_triplets_needed + 1):
            # For demonstration, we just output the candidate m
            # In real verification, we would attempt to construct such a cover
            print(f"Candidate minimal m: {m}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
