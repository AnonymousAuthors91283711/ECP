The solutions satisfy the quadratic form 7x + 14y = 5x^2 + 5xy + 5y^2, which simplifies to a quadratic relation. The enumerated solutions suggest linear relation involving (-1,3), (0,0), and (1,2), which fit the pattern y = x^2 or y = 2x in simplified forms. Collectively, these points lie on the set where y = x^2 - x, covering the solutions.
