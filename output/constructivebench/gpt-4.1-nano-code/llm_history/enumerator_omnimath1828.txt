This problem appears to involve algebraic manipulations related to roots of a polynomial and their symmetric expressions. Since it's specified using Lean code and hints at complex numbers, we should attempt to relate the expression \( x^7 + x^{-7} \) to properties of roots and polynomial evaluation.

Given the polynomial \( X^3 + X^2 - 2X - 1 \), we want to find all \( x \neq 0 \) such that if \( r = x + x^{-1} \), then \( r \) satisfies \( \text{eval } r (\text{polynomial}) = 0 \). The main challenge is to find the possible values of \( x^7 + x^{-7} \).

We'll approach this by:
1. Enumerating possible values of \( r = x + x^{-1} \) that satisfy the polynomial equation.
2. Using the recurrence relations for \( x^n + x^{-n} \) in terms of \( r \), since:
\[ x^n + x^{-n} = r \cdot (x^{n-1} + x^{-(n-1)}) - (x^{n-2} + x^{-(n-2)}) \]

We can:
- For candidate \( r \) values within a small range,
- Compute \( x^7 + x^{-7} \),
- And output the results.

The key is to find candidate \( r \) values that satisfy the polynomial when \( r = x + x^{-1} \). Since actual root solving is complex, we'll approximate solutions by testing small rational values.

Here is a possible Python enumeration program:

```python
# Enumerate candidate r values and compute x^7 + x^{-7}
# based on recurrence relations for x^n + x^{-n}
def main():
    # Candidate r values: small rationals between -3 and 3
    candidates = [r / 10 for r in range(-30, 31)]  # from -3.0 to 3.0 in steps of 0.1
    for r in candidates:
        # Evaluate polynomial at r: r^3 + r^2 - 2r - 1
        val = r**3 + r**2 - 2*r - 1
        # We check if val is close to zero
        if abs(val) < 0.2:
            # Compute x^n + x^{-n} via recurrence:
            # start with s0=2, s1=r
            s0 = 2.0  # x^0 + x^0
            s1 = r    # x + x^{-1}
            for n in range(2, 8):
                s_next = r * s1 - s0
                s0, s1 = s1, s_next
            # s1 now is x^7 + x^{-7}
            print(f"r = {r:.3f}, x^7 + x^{-7} â‰ˆ {s1:.3f}, polynomial value = {val:.3f}")

main()
```

This code tests small rational \( r \) values and computes the corresponding \( x^7 + x^{-7} \) based on the recurrence relation, directly addressing the problem's core.
