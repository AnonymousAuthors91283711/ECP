The problem asks us to find natural numbers n such that:
- the number of digits of n (base 10) is either 2021 or 2022,
- all digits of n are nonzero,
- all digits of n^2 are nonzero,
- the product of the digits of n is a perfect square,
- the product of the digits of n^2 is a perfect square.

Given the enormous size of these numbers, enumerating all such n directly is infeasible. Instead, we can focus on small sample candidates where the digit length is small and check the conditions to observe patterns. For the cases d = 2021 or 2022, the problem asks for a characterization, but in computational practice, we can only sample small cases for illustration.

Here's the plan:
- Pick small sample values of d to see if such nds exist.
- Generate candidate n with d digits, all nonzero (e.g., repeating '1's or '2's).
- Check the conditions efficiently.
- Immediately print any candidate that satisfies the conditions.

The code below performs these steps for small sample sizes (e.g., d=2 or 3), since enumerating for d~2021/2022 is not feasible.

```python
# Enumeration of candidate n with small digit lengths.
# For demonstration, consider small d, e.g., 2 or 3.
# We generate numbers with all nonzero digits, check conditions and print answers.
import itertools

def check_conditions(n_str):
    n = int(n_str)
    n_digits = list(map(int, n_str))
    # Condition: all digits nonzero (already guaranteed by generation)
    if any(k == 0 for k in n_digits):
        return False
    
    n_squared = n * n
    n_squared_str = str(n_squared)
    digits_n_squared = list(map(int, n_squared_str))
    if any(k == 0 for k in digits_n_squared):
        return False
    
    prod_digits_n = 1
    for d in n_digits:
        prod_digits_n *= d
    if int(prod_digits_n**0.5)**2 != prod_digits_n:
        return False
    
    prod_digits_nsquared = 1
    for d in digits_n_squared:
        prod_digits_nsquared *= d
    if int(prod_digits_nsquared**0.5)**2 != prod_digits_nsquared:
        return False
    
    return True

# Generate candidate numbers with specified digit length and all digits nonzero.
# For small d, we can try all combinations of digits 1-9.
for d in [2, 3]:
    for digits in itertools.product('123456789', repeat=d):
        n_str = ''.join(digits)
        if check_conditions(n_str):
            print(f"Candidate n for d={d}: {n_str} satisfies all conditions.")
```
