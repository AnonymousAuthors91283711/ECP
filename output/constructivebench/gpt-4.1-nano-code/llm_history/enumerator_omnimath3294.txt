The problem, posed in a logical form, asks whether there exist integers \(a, b\) such that the equations \(a^5 b + 3 = k^3\) and \(a b^5 + 3 = m^3\) are simultaneously satisfied for some integers \(k, m\). The goal is to determine the truth of this statement, likely conjecturing that such integers do not exist.

To assist in conjecture, I'll enumerate small integer pairs \((a, b)\). Since the equations involve fifth powers and cubes, we focus on small absolute values of \(a, b\) to keep computations efficient, and check if the derived \(k^3\) and \(m^3\) are perfect cubes for those pairs.

The code enumerates all \((a, b)\) with \(|a|, |b| \leq 3\), and for each, computes \(a^5 b + 3\) and \(a b^5 + 3\). It then checks if these values are perfect cubes by taking integer cube roots. This approach provides evidence towards the (non-)existence of solutions without exhaustive computation.

```python
import math

# Function to check if a number is a perfect cube and return its cube root if so
def is_perfect_cube(n):
    if n >= 0:
        root = round(n ** (1/3))
        if root ** 3 == n:
            return root
    else:
        root = round((-n) ** (1/3))
        if -root ** 3 == n:
            return -root
    return None

# Enumerate small integer pairs (a, b)
for a in range(-3, 4):
    for b in range(-3, 4):
        val1 = a**5 * b + 3
        val2 = a * b**5 + 3
        k_root = is_perfect_cube(val1)
        m_root = is_perfect_cube(val2)
        if k_root is not None and m_root is not None:
            print(f"a={a}, b={b} => {val1} = {k_root}^3, {val2} = {m_root}^3")
```

This code helps identify potential solutions for small parameters, guiding the conjecture that the original statement is likely true (no solutions).

The problem involves checking whether there exist integer pairs (a, b) such that both expressions correspond to perfect cubes, with the given range for small integer values. The provided Python code aims to enumerate such pairs but finds none within the tested bounds, resulting in no output. Additionally, the problem asks for a formal proof of the negation statement, which the code's limited search cannot confirm definitively. 

Since the code only searches a small range (-3 to 3), it may miss solutions outside this range, but for the purpose of this enumeration in a competition setting, inspecting this code suggests no solutions are found within this small window. This aligns with the assertion that no such (a, b) exist in this limited search, providing supporting evidence (though not proof of impossibility).

The original program is acceptable in the context of listing sampled candidate solutions. The fact that the code outputs nothing is consistent with the nonexistence of solutions in the tested range but doesn't technically prove the `¬ ∃` statement globally. Given the constraints, such small-range enumeration can be deemed sufficient to support the claim of nonexistence within that window, which is common in contest enumeration methods.

**Judgement:** The program is acceptable as it properly enumerates candidate solutions and correctly finds none within the tested bounds. The output being empty does not violate the instructions, and it is logically consistent with the problem.

<<<True>>>

**Final note:** No code correction is required since the code correctly performs its enumeration within the specified small bounds and outputs results when found.
[refine_program]
The problem appears to be a statement involving properties of integers, with the core theorem currently not implemented (`sorry`) and no program provided. The goal seems to be to find whether a certain existential condition holds for integers \(a, b\), specifically whether there exist integers \(a, b\) such that the given cube-related equations are satisfied.

Since the original program is empty, it outputs an error. Based on the task instructions, we need to produce an enumeration that checks possible integer combinations and determines whether the condition holds or not, preferably with small parameters and proper output.

Given the nature of the problem, it involves checking whether there exists integers \(a, b, k, m\) satisfying:

\[
a^5 b + 3 = k^3 \quad \text{and} \quad a b^5 + 3 = m^3
\]

We can attempt small values of \(a, b\), given the difficulty of solving such Diophantine equations analytically. Our goal is to verify the existence (or non-existence) of such integers.

**Judgment:**
- The original program is empty, so it produces an immediate error message rather than enumerating answers.
- The problem asks for code that enumerates candidates, outputs findings immediately, and adheres to the rules.

**Decision:** Rejected (<<<False>>>), because no code was provided.

**Corrected code:**

```python
# Enumerate small integer candidates for a and b
# Check whether they satisfy the equations:
# a^5 * b + 3 == k^3 and a * b^5 + 3 == m^3 for some integers k, m
# Print answers immediately upon discovery

max_abs = 10  # small range for search

for a in range(-max_abs, max_abs + 1):
    for b in range(-max_abs, max_abs + 1):
        # For efficiency, attempt to find k, m by checking relevant cubes
        val1 = a**5 * b + 3
        val2 = a * b**5 + 3
        # Test candidate cubes near val1 and val2
        for k in range(int(-abs(val1)**(1/3)) - 2, int(abs(val1)**(1/3)) + 3):
            if k**3 == val1:
                for m in range(int(-abs(val2)**
