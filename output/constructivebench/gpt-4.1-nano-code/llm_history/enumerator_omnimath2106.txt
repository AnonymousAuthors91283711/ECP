This problem involves analyzing the behavior of nested square root functions on natural numbers \( n \), specifically comparing \(\lfloor \sqrt{\lceil \sqrt{n} \rceil} \rfloor\) and \(\lceil \sqrt{\lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor} \rceil\). To investigate this, I'll write a Python program that enumerates all \( n \) from 1 to 10,000 and computes these expressions, checking whether they are equal. The goal is to understand how many \( n \) satisfy the condition within this range, which aids in forming conjectures or proofs.

```python
# Enumerate n from 1 to 10000
matches = []
for n in range(1, 10001):
    sqrt_n = n ** 0.5
    # Compute ceil and floor of sqrt(n)
    ceil_sqrt_n = int(sqrt_n) + (1 if sqrt_n - int(sqrt_n) > 0 else 0)
    floor_sqrt_n = int(sqrt_n)
    # Compute nested square roots
    left = int(( (ceil_sqrt_n) ** 0.5 ))
    right = int((floor_sqrt_n) ** 0.5 + 0.999999)  # approximate ceil of sqrt(floor_sqrt_n)
    # To avoid inaccuracies, explicitly compute ceil of sqrt
    import math
    left = math.floor(math.sqrt(ceil_sqrt_n))
    right = math.ceil(math.sqrt(floor_sqrt_n))
    # Check the condition
    if left == right:
        print(n)
        matches.append(n)
# Output total matching count for analysis
print("Total matches:", len(matches))
```
