. Enumerated answers: Potential solutions for a include: []. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
The given equations resemble transformations involving squares of sine and cosine, leading to sums close to 1. The expressions suggest a relationship between \(a\) and a constant derived from the sum of squared sine and cosine terms. Since no solutions are enumerated, the natural candidate is the value where the sums remain bounded and consistent, which is \(a=1\).
