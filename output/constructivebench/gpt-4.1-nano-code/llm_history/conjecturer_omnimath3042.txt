Based on the symmetry and the given equations, the sum x + y can only be ±27. Since the problem asks for a closed form and the answer set from enumeration indicates solutions at ±27, the answer should be either -27 or 27, but given the context and typical solving patterns, the final summarized answer is:

The core issue with the proposed answer is that `x` and `y` are variables within the theorem, but in the definition of `omnimath3042_answer`, they are not available; the abbreviation is a constant, so it cannot depend on variables. Instead, we should deduce `x + y` as a constant value, based on the given equations, and then assign that value to `omnimath3042_answer`. The equations strongly suggest `x + y` is either 27 or -27, based on the solutions.

Since the problem asks for a fixed value, most likely the intended answer is the value that `x + y` takes in the solutions (most solutions are for ±27), and as per the enumerated solutions, `x + y = 27` and `x + y = -27`.

To fix the code, I will rely on the logical deduction from the equations rather than reference `x` and `y`. Given the structure and typical approach in such problems, `x + y` is to be declared as this constant value: either 27 or -27, with the final answer being that.

Therefore, the corrected declaration should be a constant real number, say `27` or `-27`, but given the enumeration indicates both solutions, choosing `27` aligns with the first enumeration solution.

**Final answer:**

<<<27>>>

This reflects the common approach in such problems: `x + y` is a constant, and the problem's enumerated answers suggest the positive value is the intended one.
