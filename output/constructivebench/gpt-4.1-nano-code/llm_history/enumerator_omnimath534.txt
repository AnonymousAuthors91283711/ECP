This problem asks us to find the smallest five-digit number n (from 10,000 up to 99,999) that satisfies the following conditions:

- n is divisible by 99
- The digits of n form a palindrome (i.e., `digits 10 n` reversed equals `digits 10 n`)

My approach:
- Enumerate n from 10,000 to 99,999
- Check if n is divisible by 99
- Check if n's digits form a palindrome
- Output each candidate as soon as it's found
- Terminate at the first (smallest) such number

Below is the Python program that performs this enumeration:

```python
def is_palindrome(num):
    s = str(num)
    return s == s[::-1]

for n in range(10000, 100000):
    if n % 99 == 0:
        if is_palindrome(n):
            print(n)
            break
```
