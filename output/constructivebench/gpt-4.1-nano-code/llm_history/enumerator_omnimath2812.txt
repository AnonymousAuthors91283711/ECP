[write_program]
The provided code snippet appears to be a Lean theorem involving real numbers, but it has placeholders like `sorry` and an import statement that isn't valid in Python. The core algebraic expression seems to be `(x + 2 - x) * (2 - x - 2)`, which simplifies algebraically to `0 * (0) = 0`. 

Thus, the overall goal is to verify or find answers related to this expression, which straightforwardly simplifies to zero regardless of `x`. Since the task is to write a Python program that enumerates possible answers to assist in conjecturing or proving the true answer, and the algebra is simple, I will implement code to verify this for several sample values of `x`, and then confirm the simplified value always being zero.

The program:

- Sets a small sample set of `x` values.
- Computes the expression `(x + 2 - x) * (2 - x - 2)` for each.
- Since algebraically it simplifies to `0`, any `x` will produce 0.
- Prints all results as partial results, verifying the solution holds universally (or at least for the sample set).

This assists in conjecturing that the expression equals zero for all real numbers `x`.

```python
# Enumerate sample values of x and compute the expression to verify its value
sample_x_values = [-10, -1, 0, 1, 2, 10]

for x in sample_x_values:
    value = (x + 2 - x) * (2 - x - 2)
    print(f"x = {x}: ({x} + 2 - {x}) * (2 - {x} - 2) = {value}")
```
