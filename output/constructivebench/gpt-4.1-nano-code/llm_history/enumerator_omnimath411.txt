The given theorem is about the Fibonacci sequence \(F(n)\) with initial conditions \(F(0)=0\), \(F(1)=1\), and the recurrence \(F(n+2)=F(n+1)+F(n)\). We want to find all \(n\) in \([0, 100]\) such that 13 divides \(F(n)\).

It is known (from properties of Fibonacci numbers) that \(F(n)\) modulo 13 is periodic with period equal to the Pisano period for 13, which is 28. Therefore, \(F(n)\) mod 13 repeats every 28 steps.

To efficiently find all \(n\) in [0, 100] with 13 dividing \(F(n)\), we can:
- Compute \(F(n) \bmod 13\) for \(n=0 \dots 27\).
- Record \(n\) where \(F(n) \equiv 0 \pmod{13}\).
- Since the sequence repeats every 28, for each such \(n_0\), all \(n = n_0 + 28k\) up to 100 are also solutions.

Let's implement this approach:

```python
# The program computes Fibonacci numbers mod 13 up to the Pisano period (28)
# then finds all n <= 100 where F(n) is divisible by 13.

def fib_mod(n, mod=13):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = b, (a + b) % mod
    return a

solutions = []
period = 28  # Pisano period for 13
for n in range(period):
    if fib_mod(n, 13) == 0:
        # For each such n, check n + k*period <= 100
        k = 0
        while n + k*period <= 100:
            solutions.append(n + k*period)
            print(n + k*period)  # Stream answer as soon as found
            k += 1
```
