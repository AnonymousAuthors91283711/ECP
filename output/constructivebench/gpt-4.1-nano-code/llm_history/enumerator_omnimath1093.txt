The problem involves finding pairs of five-digit palindromic numbers (numbers equal to their own reverse) in a specific range (10,000 to 99,999) where \( a < b \), \( a \) and \( b \) are palindromes, and the difference \( d = b - a \) is minimal such that no palindrome exists strictly between \( a \) and \( b \).

To assist in conjecturing and identifying the minimal difference \( d \), I will enumerate all five-digit palindromes, sort them, and check adjacent pairs for the minimal difference.

Python implementation:
- Generate all five-digit palindromes.
- Find the minimal difference between consecutive palindromes.
- Stream the results as soon as candidate differences are found.
- Limit to minimal differences, print the pairs and their differences.

```python
# Generate all five-digit palindromes:
# A five-digit palindrome has the form: ABCBA, where A ∈ 1-9, B,C ∈ 0-9
palindromes = []
for A in range(1, 10):
    for B in range(10):
        for C in range(10):
            num = 10000 * A + 1000 * B + 100 * C + 10 * B + A
            palindromes.append(num)

# Sort the list of palindromes
palindromes.sort()

# Initialize minimal difference as large
min_diff = None
pairs = []

# Check consecutive palindromes for minimal difference
for i in range(len(palindromes) - 1):
    diff = palindromes[i+1] - palindromes[i]
    print(f"Checking pair: {palindromes[i]} and {palindromes[i+1]}, difference = {diff}")
    if min_diff is None or diff < min_diff:
        min_diff = diff
        pairs = [(palindromes[i], palindromes[i+1], diff)]
        print(f"New minimal difference found: {diff} between {palindromes[i]} and {palindromes[i+1]}")
    elif diff == min_diff:
        pairs.append((palindromes[i], palindromes[i+1], diff))
        print(f"Found another pair with same minimal difference: {diff} between {palindromes[i]} and {palindromes[i+1]}")

# Output all pairs with the minimal difference
print(f"\nAll pairs with minimal difference ({min_diff}):")
for a, b, d in pairs:
    print(f"Palindrome pair: {a} and {b}, difference: {d}")
```
