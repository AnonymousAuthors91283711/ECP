This problem asks us to find the smallest natural number \( n \) such that:
\[ \binom{n+2}{2} = \binom{n}{2} + T \]
with \( T = 75 \).

Let's analyze the problem:

\[
\binom{n+2}{2} = \frac{(n+2)(n+1)}{2}
\]
\[
\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}
\]

The condition:
\[
\frac{(n+2)(n+1)}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} + 75
\]

Multiply through by 2:
\[
(n+2)(n+1) = n(n-1) + 150
\]

Expand:
\[
n^2 + 3n + 2 = n^2 - n + 150
\]

Subtract \( n^2 \):
\[
3n + 2 = - n + 150
\]

Bring all to one side:
\[
3n + n = 150 - 2
\]
\[
4n = 148
\]
\[
n = 37
\]

Since \( n \) must be an integer, \( n=37 \) satisfies the equality. The minimal \( n \) is 37 because the equation is linear in \( n \) with a unique solution.

Let's verify:

\[
\binom{39}{2} = \frac{39 \times 38}{2} = 39 \times 19 = 741
\]
\[
\binom{37}{2} = \frac{37 \times 36}{2} = 37 \times 18 = 666
\]
\[
666 + 75 = 741
\]

It matches perfectly.

Below is a Python script to verify this:

```python
# Python code to find the smallest n satisfying the condition
T = 75
for n in range(1, 100):  # check within a reasonable range
    left = (n + 2) * (n + 1) // 2
    right = (n * (n - 1) // 2) + T
    if left == right:
        print(n)  # stream the found answer immediately
        break
```

This code enumerates values of \( n \) starting from 1, finds the minimal one that satisfies the equation, and outputs it immediately upon discovery.
