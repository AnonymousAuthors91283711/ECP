This problem involves examining the behavior of a certain inequality involving parameters \( a, b, c \) and their perturbations \( a', b', c' \). To assist conjecture and proof, I will enumerate small sample values that satisfy the positivity constraints, and check the inequality for various perturbations within small ranges. 

Since the exact form of `P2015AMCA_5_answer` is not given, I will sample and check whether the inequality holds for various perturbed values \( a', b', c' \). The goal is to gather evidence about whether the property is always true or false under different conditions, thus aiding in supporting or refuting the statement.

I will:
- Use small positive values for \( a, b, c \).
- For each, iterate over small ranges of \( a', b', c' \) satisfying the constraints \( a' \ge a \), \( b' \le b \), \( c' \le c \).
- Compute the inequality \( a'/b' - c' \ge a/b - c \).
- Print unconditionally whenever the inequality holds or fails, to stream the results.

This approach may not prove the theorem, but it will generate data for hypothesis formation.

```python
# Enumerate small positive values for a, b, c
# For each, test perturbations a', b', c' with a small grid
# Check the inequality and output the tuple and result
# This aids in conjecture and understanding behavior

small_values = [(1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 1), (1.5, 2.5, 0.5)]
delta = 0.5  # perturbation step
max_perturb = 2  # number of steps above/below

for a, b, c in small_values:
    if not (a > 0 and b > 0 and c > 0):
        continue
    base_value = a / b - c
    print(f"\nTesting with a={a}, b={b}, c={c} (base value: {base_value})")
    a_vals = [max(a - i * delta, 0.01) for i in range(max_perturb + 1)]
    b_vals = [max(b - i * delta, 0.01) for i in range(max_perturb + 1)]
    c_vals = [max(c - i * delta, 0.01) for i in range(max_perturb + 1)]
    for a_prime in a_vals:
        for b_prime in b_vals:
            for c_prime in c_vals:
                if a_prime >= a and b_prime <= b and c_prime <= c:
                    left = a_prime / b_prime - c_prime
                    result = "holds" if left >= base_value else "fails"
                    print(f"a'={a_prime:.2f}, b'={b_prime:.2f}, c'={c_prime:.2f} => {left:.2f} ({result})")
```
