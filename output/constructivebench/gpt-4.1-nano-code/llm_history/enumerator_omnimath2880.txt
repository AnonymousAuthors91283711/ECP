This theorem defines variables `x`, `y`, and `z` with specific relationships: \(x=3\), \(y=2x\), and \(z=3y\). The goal is to find the value of their average \(\frac{x + y + z}{3}\). To assist conjecturing and verifying the answer, we can directly compute and enumerate the candidate answers. Since the relationships are explicit, the average simplifies algebraically to a fixed value, but we'll enumerate small ranges to ensure no step is missed and to verify.

The candidate answer is straightforward: compute \(\frac{x + y + z}{3}\), with the known values:

\(x=3\)

\(y=2 \times 3=6\)

\(z=3 \times 6=18\)

Sum: \(3 + 6 + 18=27\)

Average: \(27/3=9\)

In code, we can generalize with parameters but here is a minimal enumeration script that produces the correct average directly and streams the result:

```python
# For the specific relationships, compute directly:
x = 3
y = 2 * x
z = 3 * y
average = (x + y + z) / 3
print(average)
```

This will immediately print 9, satisfying all requirements: streaming output, no hardcoded answer (since calculated dynamically), minimal computation, and fits within 400 tokens.
