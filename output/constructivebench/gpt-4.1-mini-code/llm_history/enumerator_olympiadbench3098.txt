The problem wants the smallest natural number \( n \) such that \( \frac{n}{3} > 10 \times \frac{1}{2} \). Simplifying, \( \frac{n}{3} > 5 \), so \( n > 15 \). We're to find the minimal \( n \in \mathbb{N} \) with \( n > 15 \), which is 16.

I'll write a Python program enumerating \( n \) values, checking the inequality, printing each candidate that satisfies it, to illustrate the minimal solution.

```python
# Enumerate natural numbers n, check n/3 > 10*(1/2) i.e. n/3 > 5, minimal such n is 16
threshold = 5  # 10*(1/2)

print("Enumerating n with n/3 > 5:")

for n in range(1, 25):
    lhs = n / 3
    if lhs > threshold:
        print(f"Candidate n = {n}, n/3 = {lhs}")
# After enumeration, print minimal answer
print("Minimal n satisfying n/3 > 5 is 16")
```
