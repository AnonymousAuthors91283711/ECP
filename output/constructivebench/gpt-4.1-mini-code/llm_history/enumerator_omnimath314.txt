The problem is about integer polynomials \(P\) with:

\[ P(0) + P(90) = 2018, \]

and we want to analyze the possible values of \(|P(20) + P(70)|\).

The theorem claims there is some minimal value \(\text{omnimath314_answer}\) such that for every polynomial \(P\) satisfying the sum condition, the absolute value of \(P(20)+P(70)\) is at least \(\text{omnimath314_answer}\), and this minimal value is achievable.

To explore this, we can enumerate integer polynomials of low degree and small coefficients to gather values of \(P(20)+P(70)\) under the constraint \(P(0)+P(90)=2018\).

We choose degrees up to 3 for feasibility, coefficients in a small range \([-10,10]\), and check the constraint.

We print each \(|P(20)+P(70)|\) found. At the end, we print the minimal value encountered.

```python
# Enumerate integer polynomials P with deg<=3, coeffs in [-10,10]
# Check constraint P(0)+P(90)=2018
# Print abs(P(20)+P(70)) values found and minimal such value.

def eval_poly(coeffs, x):
    # coeffs: [a0,a1,a2,a3], P(x)=a0 + a1 x + a2 x^2 + a3 x^3
    val = 0
    xp = 1
    for a in coeffs:
        val += a * xp
        xp *= x
    return val

def main():
    from math import inf
    min_val = inf
    deg = 3
    c_range = range(-10,11)  # coefficients from -10 to 10
    print("Enumerating integer polynomials degree â‰¤3 with coeffs in [-10,10]:")
    for a0 in c_range:
        for a1 in c_range:
            for a2 in c_range:
                for a3 in c_range:
                    coeffs = [a0,a1,a2,a3]
                    # Constraint: P(0)+P(90)==2018 
                    # P(0) = a0
                    # P(90) = a0 + a1*90 + a2*90^2 + a3*90^3
                    # sum = a0 + [a0 + 90 a1 + 8100 a2 + 729000 a3] = 2018
                    s = 2*a0 + 90*a1 + 8100*a2 + 729000*a3
                    if s == 2018:
                        val = eval_poly(coeffs,20) + eval_poly(coeffs,70)
                        abs_val = abs(val)
                        print(abs_val)
                        if abs_val < min_val:
