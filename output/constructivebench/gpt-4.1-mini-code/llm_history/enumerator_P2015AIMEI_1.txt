The problem involves evaluating two sums A and B defined over certain ranges and expressions and then finding the absolute difference. To assist in conjecturing the difference, we will:

- Compute A = sum_{k=0}^{19} [(2k+1)(2k+2) + 39]
- Compute B = 1 + sum_{k=0}^{18} [(2k+2)(2k+3)] + 38*39
- Calculate |A - B|

We'll print intermediate values and the final difference. Since these are simple sums, the program will compute exact integer values.

```python
def P2015AIMEI_1_enumerate():
    # Compute sum A
    A = 0
    print("Computing A:")
    for k in range(20):
        term = (2*k + 1) * (2*k + 2) + 39
        print(f"  k={k}: (2k+1)(2k+2) + 39 = {term}")
        A += term
    print(f"Sum A = {A}")
    
    # Compute sum B
    B = 1
    print("Computing B:")
    for k in range(19):
        term = (2*k + 2) * (2*k + 3)
        print(f"  k={k}: (2k+2)(2k+3) = {term}")
        B += term
    addend = 38 * 39
    print(f"Adding 38*39 = {addend} to B")
    B += addend
    print(f"Sum B = {B}")

    diff = abs(A - B)
    print(f"Absolute difference |A - B| = {diff}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    P2015AIMEI_1_enumerate()
```
