The problem is about natural numbers \(n\) that can be expressed as the sum \(a+b+c\) of three positive integers \(a,b,c\) with \(\gcd(a,b,c)=1\), such that
\[
n = \gcd(a b + c, a c - b).
\]
We want to enumerate such \(n\).

We will:
- Iterate over some range for \(a,b,c\).
- Check the gcd condition and the equation on \(n\).
- Print all \(n\) found, avoiding duplicates.
- Since gcd is 1 for \(a,b,c\), filter those triples.
- Print results for some range (e.g., all \(a,b,c \leq 20\)) to conjecture a pattern.

```python
from math import gcd

found = set()
max_val = 20  # range for a,b,c

for a in range(1, max_val + 1):
    for b in range(1, max_val + 1):
        for c in range(1, max_val + 1):
            if gcd(gcd(a, b), c) != 1:
                continue
            val1 = a * b + c
            val2 = a * c - b
            n = gcd(val1, val2)
            if n == a + b + c and n > 0:
                if n not in found:
                    found.add(n)
                    print(f"n={n}, a={a}, b={b}, c={c}")
```
This enumerates valid \(n\) according to the problem's equation and gcd condition. Running with small limits may reveal the structure or candidates for \(n\).
