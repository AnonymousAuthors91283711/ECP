The problem is: given the line 3x + 4y = 10, find the minimum value of x² + 16y². We want to enumerate possible values of x² + 16y² for points (x, y) on this line and find the minimal one.

I'll sample rational values of y, compute x from the equation, then compute x² + 16y². The program will also print the minimum value found.

```python
# Enumerate values of x^2 + 16 y^2 for 3x+4y=10 over some rational y values
# to get a conjecture about the minimal value.

def f(y): 
    # Given y, find x from 3x+4y=10 => x=(10-4y)/3
    x = (10 - 4 * y) / 3
    return x * x + 16 * y * y

def main():
    min_val = None
    # sample y in [-10,10] with step 0.5 for demonstration
    ys = [i * 0.5 for i in range(-20, 21)]
    for y in ys:
        val = f(y)
        print(f"y={y:.2f}, x={(10 - 4 * y)/3:.5f}, x^2+16y^2={val:.5f}")
        if (min_val is None) or (val < min_val):
            min_val = val
            min_y = y
    print(f"Minimum found: x^2 + 16 y^2 = {min_val:.5f} at y = {min_y:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
