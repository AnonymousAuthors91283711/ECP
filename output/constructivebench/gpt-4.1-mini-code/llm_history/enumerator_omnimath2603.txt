The problem involves counting certain functions \( f \) from a finite set of size \( m \) to subsets of another finite set of size \( n \), where each subset has size \( k \) and is closed under adding 1 modulo \( n \). Then it asks for the ratio of functions where there exists an element missing from all subsets.

We will enumerate all such functions for given \( n=10, k=5, m=4 \), count the total number and count those that exclude at least one element in all subsets, and then compute the scaled ratio \( 10000 * (|A|/|Ω|) \).

```python
from itertools import combinations, product

n = 10
k = 5
m = 4

# Generate all k-sized subsets of [0..n-1] that are "closed under +1 mod n"
# Because k=5 and closure under +1 mod n means the subset is an orbit of length k.

# Such subsets are exactly the sets of consecutive k elements modulo n
# For example, {0,1,2,3,4}, {1,2,3,4,5}, ... {9,0,1,2,3}

closed_subsets = []
for start in range(n):
    subset = frozenset((start + i) % n for i in range(k))
    closed_subsets.append(subset)

print(f"Closed subsets ({len(closed_subsets)}):")
for s in closed_subsets:
    print(sorted(s))

# Omega is all functions f: Fin m -> closed_subsets
# So total |Ω| = (number of closed subsets)^m
total_Omega = len(closed_subsets) ** m

count_A = 0
# f in Omega where ∃ x in [0..n-1] such that x not in f(i) for all i.
# Equivalently, union of f(i) is not full [0..n-1]

# We iterate over all functions f: [0..m-1] -> closed_subsets
for f in product(closed_subsets, repeat=m):
    union_all = set()
    for subset in f:
        union_all |= subset
    if len(union_all) < n:
        count_A += 1
        print(f"A function excluding elements: {sorted(set(range(n)) - union_all)}")

print(f"Total Omega = {total_Omega}")
print(f"Count A = {count_A}")
ratio = 10000 * count_A / total_Omega
print(f"10000 * (|A|/|Ω|) = {ratio}")
```
