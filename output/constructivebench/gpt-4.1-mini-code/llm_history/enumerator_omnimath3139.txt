The problem involves finding the value of \( x \) based on the parameter \( u = -6 \) and the given formula \( x = \frac{1}{3}(3 - 4u) \). To assist in conjecturing the true answer, the program will enumerate values of \( u \) around the given value \(-6\), compute the corresponding \( x \) for each, and print the exact fractions. This will help identify any patterns or explicit values.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Enumerate values around u = -6, including u = -6
test_us = [Fraction(u) for u in range(-8, -3)]

print("Enumerating x = (1/3)*(3 - 4*u) for u in", test_us)
for u in test_us:
    x = Fraction(1,3) * (3 - 4 * u)
    print(f"u = {u}, x = {x} = {float(x):.6f}")

# Specifically print the value for u = -6
u = Fraction(-6)
x = Fraction(1,3)*(3 - 4*u)
print(f"\nFor u = {u}, x = {x} = {float(x):.6f}")
```

This prints exact fractions for \( x \) for \( u = -6 \) and nearby values, enabling examination of the relationship and the exact solution.
