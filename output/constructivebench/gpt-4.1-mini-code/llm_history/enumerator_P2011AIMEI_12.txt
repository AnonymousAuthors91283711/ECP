We want to analyze permutations of \( n = 6 + w \) individuals (with some number of men among them) so that every man is next to at least one other man, and among those permutations count how many have a block of at least 4 men together. The goal is to find the smallest \( w \) making the ratio \(\frac{\text{success}}{\text{valid}} \leq \frac{1}{100}\).

To assist, we'll assume the problem involves 6 men and \( w \) women, total \( n=6+w \), and enumerate permutations of men and women:
- Valid permutations: every man adjacent to at least one other man.
- Success permutations: valid permutations with at least 4 men together.

We will:
- Generate permutations of men and women abstractly (by blocks).
- Enumerate all partitions of men where each man blocks represents grouped men.
- Enumerate ways to interleave men (in groups) and women.
- Count valid permutations and those with a block of length â‰¥4.

We iterate small \( w \) values (0 to 6), print counts and ratio, to observe the behavior and guess the minimal \( w \).

```python
from math import factorial as f

# Number of men fixed to 6
men = 6

    # Generate all partitions of n into positive integers (descending)
    # To split men into adjacent blocks 
    def helper(n, max_val, prefix):
        if n == 0:
            yield prefix
        else:
            for i in range(min(max_val, n), 0, -1):
                yield from helper(n - i, i, prefix + [i])
    return list(helper(n, n, []))
