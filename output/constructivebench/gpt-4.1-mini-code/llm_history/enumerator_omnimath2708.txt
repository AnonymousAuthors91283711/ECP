The problem is to find all integers \( x \) such that the average of five consecutive integers starting at \( x \) equals 9:
\[
\frac{x + (x+1) + (x+2) + (x+3) + (x+4)}{5} = 9.
\]
We want to find the least integer \( x \) satisfying this.

Let's enumerate integers \( x \) around 0, compute the average, and print out all \( x \) that yield an average of 9.

```python
# Enumerate integers x and check when the average of x,...,x+4 equals 9
# (x + x+1 + x+2 + x+3 + x+4)/5 = 9 => (5x + 10)/5 = 9 => x + 2 = 9 => x=7

for x in range(-10, 20):  # small range around 0 for demonstration
    total = x + (x+1) + (x+2) + (x+3) + (x+4)
    avg = total / 5
    if avg == 9:
        print(f"x = {x}: average = {avg}")

# From the equation the exact value is x=7. Let's print it explicitly:
x = 7
avg = (5*x + 10)/5
print(f"Least x with average = 9 is {x} with average {avg}")
```
