The problem is to find all integer pairs \((x, y)\) satisfying the Diophantine equation:

\[
7x + 14y = 5x^2 + 5xy + 5y^2.
\]

We'll enumerate integer pairs \((x,y)\) in a reasonable range (e.g., from \(-10\) to \(10\)) and print all solutions found. This will help conjecture the full solution set.

```python
# Enumerate integer solutions (x,y) to 7x + 14y = 5x^2 + 5xy + 5y^2
# For x,y in -10..10 print all solution pairs immediately

def main():
    print("Enumerating (x,y) with x,y in [-10..10] for equation:")
    print("7x +14y = 5x^2 + 5xy + 5y^2")
    for x in range(-10, 11):
        for y in range(-10, 11):
            lhs = 7*x + 14*y
            rhs = 5*x*x + 5*x*y + 5*y*y
            if lhs == rhs:
                print(f"Solution found: (x,y)=({x},{y})")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
