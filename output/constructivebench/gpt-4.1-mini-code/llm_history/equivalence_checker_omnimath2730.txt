Ground Truth Answer: 23/96
Proposed Answer: 7 / 16
Let's analyze the proposed answer (7/16) versus the ground truth (23/96):

1. The problem calculates the probability of getting exactly 3 wins before 2 losses in a Markov chain scenario with:
   - Initial win probability: 1/2
   - Win probability after a win: 3/4
   - Win probability after a loss: 1/3

2. The solution correctly identifies all 4 possible paths to get exactly 3 wins before 2 losses.

3. Calculating each path:
   - Path 1 (WWWL): (1/2)*(3/4)*(3/4)*(1/4) = 9/128
   - Path 2 (WWLWL): (1/2)*(3/4)*(1/4)*(1/3)*(2/3) = 6/288 = 1/48
   - Path 3 (WLWWL): (1/2)*(1/2)*(1/3)*(3/4)*(1/4) = 3/192 = 1/64
   - Path 4 (LWWWL): (1/2)*(1/3)*(3/4)*(3/4)*(1/4) = 9/384 = 3/128

4. Summing all paths:
   9/128 + 1/48 + 1/64 + 3/128 = (27 + 8 + 12 + 9)/384 = 56/384 = 7/48

Wait, this shows the ground truth (23/96) is actually incorrect, and the correct sum should be 7/48 (14/96), not 23/96. The proposed answer (7/16) is also incorrect.

However, comparing the proposed answer (7/16) with the ground truth (23/96), they are clearly different values (7/16 = 42/96 ≠ 23/96).
