The problem seems to involve finding numbers \( N \) for which there exists an interval of 1000 consecutive natural numbers such that every number in this interval has digit sum equal to \( N \). The conjecture likely concerns which values of \( N \) can appear like this.

We will enumerate all \( N \) up to some small bound, and for each \( N \), check if there's a block of 1000 consecutive numbers all with digit sum \( N \). Since 1000 consecutive numbers are quite a lot, we restrict the search to numbers \( m \) up to some manageable limit (e.g., 10,000 or 20,000). We print any discovered \( N \) for which such an interval exists, and finally print the minimal such \( N \).

```python
def digit_sum(n):
    return sum(map(int, str(n)))

# Search parameters
max_start = 20000  # max starting point for interval of length 1000
interval_length = 1000
found_N = set()

# For efficiency, precompute digit sums
digit_sums = [digit_sum(i) for i in range(max_start + interval_length)]

for start in range(max_start):
    # Digit sum of first number in interval
    val = digit_sums[start]
    # Check if all in interval have the same digit sum
    if all(digit_sums[start + offset] == val for offset in range(interval_length)):
        print(f"Found N={val} for interval starting at {start}")
        found_N.add(val)

if found_N:
    minimum_N = min(found_N)
    print(f"Minimum N with 1000-block of equal digit sums: {minimum_N}")
else:
    print("No N found with a block of 1000 consecutive numbers having equal digit sum")
```
