The problem involves finding a total number divisible by 9 such that:
- g = 3 * (total / 9)
- y = 4 * (total / 9)
- r = 2 * (total / 9)
- g + y = 63
Then r is the 2 * (total / 9). We want to find total and r.

Let's enumerate multiples of 9 where 3*(total/9) + 4*(total/9) = 63, so 7 * (total / 9) = 63 => total/9 = 9 => total=81, and then r=2 * 9 = 18.

We'll enumerate multiples of 9, check these conditions, and print candidates and finally the answer.

```python
# Enumerate total divisible by 9 and check conditions for g, y, r
def main():
    for total in range(9, 1000, 9):  # Check up to 1000
        div = total // 9
        g = 3 * div
        y = 4 * div
        r = 2 * div
        if g + y == 63:
            print(f"total={total}, g={g}, y={y}, r={r}")
            print(f"omnimath3100_answer (r) = {r}")
            # since g+y=63 uniquely determines total, can stop
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
