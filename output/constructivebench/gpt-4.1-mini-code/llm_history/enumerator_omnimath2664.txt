[write_program]
The problem involves evaluating a sum over pairs \((x,y)\) given as \((1,6), (2,3), (3,2), (6,1)\), where each term is \(2^{2y}\). The program will enumerate the calculated values and print the sum, helping conjecture a closed form or verify a proposed answer.

```python
# Enumerate values for the problem and sum them, printing intermediate results and final sum
pairs = [(1,6), (2,3), (3,2), (6,1)]

print("Pairs and corresponding 2^(2*y) values:")
values = []
for x, y in pairs:
    val = 2**(2*y)
    print(f"pair=({x},{y}), 2^(2*{y})={val}")
    values.append(val)

total = sum(values)
print(f"Sum of values: {total}")
```
