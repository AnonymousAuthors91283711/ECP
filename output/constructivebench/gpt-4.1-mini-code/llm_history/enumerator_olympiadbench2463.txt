The problem relates to enumerating certain multisets of positive integers whose product is 64 (since 64 = 2^6), corresponding to partitions of the integer 6 (exponent of 2) into sums of positive integersâ€”the exponent vectors translate into the multisets here.

I will write a Python program to enumerate and print all multisets (partitions) of 6 into positive integers, then print the count of these partitions. This matches the meaning of the "partitions" multiset in the theorem: each multiset corresponds to a multiset of exponents whose sum is 6 and maps to a multiset of numbers whose product is 64.

We print each partition and finally the count.

```python
# Enumerate all partitions of 6 as multisets of positive integers
# Each partition corresponds to a multiset of 2^exponents whose product is 64

def partitions(n, max_part=None):
    # Generate all partitions of n into parts <= max_part
    if max_part is None or max_part > n:
        max_part = n
    if n == 0:
        yield []
        return
    for i in range(min(max_part, n), 0, -1):
        for tail in partitions(n - i, i):
            yield [i] + tail

n = 6
all_parts = list(partitions(n))

# Map each partition (list of exps) to sorted multiset of 2^exps
def to_multiset(p):
    # Return a tuple of values sorted ascending, representing multiset
    return tuple(sorted(2**e for e in p))

unique_multisets = set()
for p in all_parts:
    ms = to_multiset(p)
    print(ms)
    unique_multisets.add(ms)

print(f"Total multisets: {len(unique_multisets)}")
```
