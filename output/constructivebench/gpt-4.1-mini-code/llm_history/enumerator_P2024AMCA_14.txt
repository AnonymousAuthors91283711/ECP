The problem involves a 5x5 integer matrix A where each row and each column forms an arithmetic progression (AP). Given some matrix entries, we want to find the value at A(0,1).

We have these conditions:

- For each row r, there exist integers a_r, d_r so that A[r,i] = a_r + i * d_r for i=0..4
- For each column c, there exist integers a'_c, d'_c so that A[i,c] = a'_c + i * d'_c for i=0..4
- A[4,4] = 0
- A[1,3] = 48
- A[3,2] = 16
- A[2,0] = 12

We want to find A[0,1].

We can try to enumerate all integer arithmetic progressions (with integer terms) for rows and columns consistent with these conditions. The key is that the position (r,c) must satisfy:

a_r + c * d_r = a'_c + r * d'_c

So the grid is defined by both sets of parameters (a_r, d_r) and (a'_c, d'_c) with coherence conditions.

Given known values, we'd try small integer values for these parameters to find consistent solutions, then output A[0,1].

We try small ranges for the differences and initial terms, considering the given constraints.

Below is a Python program to enumerate possibilities and print found values of A[0,1] consistent with the problem.

```python
# Enumerate integer 5x5 matrices A with arithmetic progressions in rows and columns,
# satisfying given points and print possible values at A[0,1].

def main():
    # To limit search, try arithmetic progressions with integer start and step in range [-50..50]
    vals = set()
    # We store row params: a_r and d_r for rows: 0..4
    # Similarly column params: a_c and d_c for cols: 0..4
    # Use the key equations to reduce search:
    # A[4][4] = a_4 + 4*d_4 = a'_4 + 4*d'_4 = 0
    # A[1][3] = a_1 + 3*d_1 = a'_3 + 1*d'_3 = 48
    # A[3][2] = a_3 + 2*d_3 = a'_2 + 3*d'_2 =16
    # A[2][0] = a_2 + 0*d_2 = a'_0 + 2*d'_0 =12

    # We loop over possible integer difference terms for rows and columns
    rng = range(-20, 21)  # smaller range to keep output small
    
    # We'll try all combinations for row diffs d_r and column diffs d'_c
