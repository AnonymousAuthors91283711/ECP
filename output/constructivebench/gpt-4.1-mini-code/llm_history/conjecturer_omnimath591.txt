Since gcd(d, 60) = 5, d must be divisible by 5 but not by 2 or 3. 15! prime factors include many 2's and 3's, but we only count divisors with gcd 5. Construct divisors from prime factors but exclude 2 and 3 factors: for 2 and 3 exponents fixed at zero, for 5 exponent positive (≥1), and other primes unrestricted. Number of such divisors is (exponent of 5 in 15!) × (number of choices for remaining primes).

Prime factorization of 15!:  
2^11, 3^6, 5^3, 7^2, 11^1, 13^1.

Allowed primes for divisors with gcd exactly 5:
- For 2 and 3, exponent = 0 (to avoid gcd divisible by 2 or 3)
- For 5, exponent ≥1 (to make gcd divisible by 5)
- For 7, 11, 13, exponent can be anything between 0 and max.

Number of divisors with gcd exactly 5:  
(Number of choices for exponent of 5 ≥ 1) × (number of choices for 7, 11, 13)  
= (3) × (3 × 2 × 2) = 3 × 12 = 36.
