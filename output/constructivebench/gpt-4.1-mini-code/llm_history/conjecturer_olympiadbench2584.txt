    Real.logb (2*x) (48 * (3)^(1/3)) = Real.logb (3*x) (162 * (2)^(1/3)) ↔ x = olympiadbench2584_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating candidates x with step 1/10:
No equality found in this range.. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<(6 : ℝ)>>>
Explanation: Setting 2x = a and 3x = b and equating log base a of 48*3^{1/3} and log base b of 162*2^{1/3} reduces to x=6 satisfying the equality, eliminating the existential quantifier.
