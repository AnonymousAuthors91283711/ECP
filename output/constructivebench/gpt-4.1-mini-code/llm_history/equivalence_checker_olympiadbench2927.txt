Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: 35 + 1 / 35
<<<None>>>
Since the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's not provided), we cannot determine whether the proposed answer "35 + 1/35" is equivalent to it. The problem involves finding the least positive real number x satisfying ⌊x⌋/(x - ⌊x⌋) = 35, and while the proposed answer seems plausible (as it satisfies the equation when x = 35 + 1/35), we cannot verify its equivalence without the ground truth answer.
