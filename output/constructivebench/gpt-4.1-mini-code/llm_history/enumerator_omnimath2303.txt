The problem studies the ratio of even numbers within the set of natural numbers having at least two digits (base 10) and all digits distinct (no repetition). We want to conjecture or approximate this ratio.

Approach:
- Enumerate numbers with 2 to a max digit length (say 4 or 5 for speed).
- Check that digits are distinct.
- Separate even and all such numbers.
- Print each found n and the ongoing ratio to observe convergence.
- Compare counts as we increase digit length.

Output a few candidate ratios and then a best guess.

```python
from math import comb

def digits(n):
    return list(map(int, str(n)))

def nodup(n):
    ds = digits(n)
    return len(set(ds)) == len(ds)

def is_even(n):
    return n % 2 == 0

max_len = 4  # up to 4-digit numbers for feasibility

total = 0
even_count = 0

print("Enumerating numbers with distinct digits, length >=2...")

for length in range(2, max_len+1):
    start = 10**(length-1)
    end = 10**length
    for n in range(start, end):
        if nodup(n):
            total += 1
            if is_even(n):
                even_count += 1
            if total % 500 == 0:
                # Print partial ratio
                print(f"After {total} numbers, even count ={even_count}, ratio={even_count/total:.6f}")

print(f"Total count={total}, even count={even_count}")
print("Final approximated ratio of even numbers with distinct digits (2 to {} digits): {:.6f}".format(max_len, even_count/total))
```
