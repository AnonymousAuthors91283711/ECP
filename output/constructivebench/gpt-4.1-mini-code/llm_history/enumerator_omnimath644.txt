[write_program]
The problem defines a sequence starting with s(0)=1, s(1)=2, s(2)=4, s(3)=6, and for n≥4, s(n) is the smallest integer greater than s(n-1) that cannot be expressed as the sum of s(i)+s(j) for any i<j<n. We want to explore the behavior of s(n) for some n, e.g., n=10 or 20, to conjecture values or patterns.

Below is a Python program that:
- Implements this sequence definition for n up to 20.
- Prints each term as soon as it is found.
- Uses sets for efficiency in checking sums.
- Avoids large n to keep runtime and output manageable.

```python
# Enumerate terms of the Omnimath sequence s(n):
# s(0)=1, s(1)=2, s(2)=4, s(3)=6;
# For n≥4, s(n) = smallest integer > s(n-1) not representable as s(i)+s(j) for i<j<n.

def is_sum_representable(x, seq, n):
    # Check if x = s(i) + s(j) for some i<j<n
    seen = set()
    for i in range(n):
        if x - seq[i] in seen:
            return True
        seen.add(seq[i])
    return False

def main():
    seq = [1, 2, 4, 6]
    print(f"s(0) = 1")
    print(f"s(1) = 2")
    print(f"s(2) = 4")
    print(f"s(3) = 6")
    for n in range(4, 20):
        candidate = seq[-1] + 1
        while is_sum_representable(candidate, seq, n):
            candidate += 1
        seq.append(candidate)
        print(f"s({n}) = {candidate}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
