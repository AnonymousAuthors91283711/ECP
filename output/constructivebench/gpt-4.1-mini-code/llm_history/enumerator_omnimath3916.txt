The problem involves analyzing sequences defined by a piecewise recurrence depending on divisibility by a parameter \( a \), with a step adding \( d \) otherwise, starting at 1. We want to find the greatest exponent \( n \) such that \( a^n \) divides some term \( x_k \).

To assist in conjecturing and proving the answer, we'll generate terms \( x_k \) for small pairs \((a,d)\) with \(\gcd(a,d)=1\), and print all \( n \) for which \( a^n \mid x_k \) for \( k \) up to a certain limit. We track the maximum exponent observed and print it at the end for each pair.

We limit \( a,d \) to small coprime integers greater than 1, say \( 2 \leq a,d \leq 5 \), and compute terms up to \( k \leq 50 \). The output is streamed as values are found, with final max per pair at the end.

```python
# Enumerate exponents n where a^n divides some x_k sequence term for small (a,d)

def v_p(n, p):
    # compute highest exponent e with p^e divides n
    e = 0
    while n % p == 0 and n != 0:
        n //= p
        e += 1
    return e

def gcd(a,b):
    while b:
        a,b = b,a%b
    return a

def main():
    max_terms = 50
    for a in range(2,6):
        for d in range(2,6):
            if gcd(a,d) != 1:
                continue
            print(f"Parameters: a={a}, d={d}")
            x = [1]
            # Track max n for a^n dividing some x_k
            max_n = 0
            for k in range(1, max_terms+1):
                prev = x[-1]
                if prev % a == 0:
                    nxt = prev // a
                else:
                    nxt = prev + d
                x.append(nxt)
                # Evaluate v_p(x_k,a)
                e = v_p(nxt, a)
                if e > 0:
                    print(f"k={k+1}, x_{k+1}={nxt}, v_{a}={e}")
                    if e > max_n:
                        max_n = e
            print(f"Maximum exponent n with a^n ∣ x_k for k≤{max_terms}: {max_n}\n")
