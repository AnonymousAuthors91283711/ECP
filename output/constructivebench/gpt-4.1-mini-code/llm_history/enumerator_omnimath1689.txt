The problem is to find all natural numbers \(n\) for which there exists a natural number \(k\) such that:
\[ 11k + 2n = 2007 \quad \text{and} \quad n \leq k. \]
We want to enumerate all such \(n\), count them, and identify the cardinality of this set.

The plan:
- Iterate over all natural numbers \(k\) such that \(11k \leq 2007\).
- For each \(k\), check if \(2n = 2007 - 11k\) is even and if \(n = \frac{2007 - 11k}{2}\) is a natural number.
- Check if \(n \leq k\).
- Print all \(n\) found.
- Print the total count at the end.

Since 2007 is fixed, this is straightforward to enumerate.

```python
# Enumerate all n in ℕ such that ∃ k ∈ ℕ: 11k + 2n = 2007 and n ≤ k

def main():
    total = 0
    print("Candidates n satisfying 11k + 2n = 2007 and n ≤ k (with some k):")
    # k must be ≤ 2007//11
    max_k = 2007 // 11
    for k in range(max_k + 1):
        remainder = 2007 - 11 * k
        # 2n = remainder => n = remainder/2 must be integer and ≥ 0
        if remainder < 0:
            continue
        if remainder % 2 != 0:
            continue
        n = remainder // 2
        if n >= 0 and n <= k:
            print(n)
            total += 1
    print("Total count of such n:", total)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
