The problem involves natural numbers \(m, n\) with \(m \ge n > 0\), such that the finite set 
\[
\{ k \in \mathbb{N} : 0 < k, | \log m - \log k | < \log n \}
\]
has exactly 50 elements. The goal is to maximize the product \(m \times n\).

To explore this, note that 
\[
| \log m - \log k | < \log n \iff \frac{m}{n} < k < m n,
\]
since \(\log k\) within \(\log n\) of \(\log m\) means \(k \in ( m / n , m n )\). The number of such \(k\) is the count of integers in \((m/n, m n)\).

The size of this set is 
\[
\#\{k \in \mathbb{N} : m/n < k < m n\} = \lfloor m n - 1 \rfloor - \lceil m/n + 1 \rceil + 1,
\]
but we will enumerate explicitly for small \(n\) and \(m\) and count the integers \(k\) in \((m/n, m n)\).

We want this count to be 50, and then maximize \(m n\).

We will try small \(n\) (1 to 20) and \(m\) from \(n\) up to a limit (say 500), and count the integers between \(m/n\) and \(m n\).

We print each \((m,n)\) pair for which the count is 50, and the product \(m \times n\).

Finally, output the max product found.

```python
# Enumerate (m,n) with m >= n > 0, count integers k with m/n < k < m*n,
# where count = 50. Print all such (m,n,m*n), then print max product.

def count_k(m, n):
    # Count integers k with m/n < k < m*n
    lower = m / n
    upper = m * n
    # Integers strictly between lower and upper
    # Count = floor(upper - 1) - ceil(lower + 1) + 1 if lower + 1 < upper - 1
    from math import ceil, floor
    start = ceil(lower)
    end = floor(upper)
    # We want k>lower and k<upper, so k in (lower, upper)
    # For example if lower=2.2, start=3; if upper=60.7, end=60
    # count = number of integers k with start <= k <= end
    cnt = end - start + 1
    return cnt if cnt >= 0 else 0

max_product = 0
print("Enumerating (m,n) with count of k in (m/n,m*n) = 50:")

for n in range(1, 21):
    for m in range(n, 501):
        c = count_k(m, n)
        if c == 50:
            prod = m * n
            print(f"m={m}, n={n}, count=50, product={prod}")
            if prod > max_product:
                max_product = prod

print(f"Maximum product m*n with count=50 is {max_product}")
```
