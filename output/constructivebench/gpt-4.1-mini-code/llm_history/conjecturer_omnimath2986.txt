. Enumerated answers: Enumerating integers n where sqrt(15) < n < sqrt(50):
n = -7 (since -7^2 = 49 satisfies 15 < n^2 < 50)
n = -6 (since -6^2 = 36 satisfies 15 < n^2 < 50)
n = -5 (since -5^2 = 25 satisfies 15 < n^2 < 50)
n = -4 (since -4^2 = 16 satisfies 15 < n^2 < 50)
n = 4 (since 4^2 = 16 satisfies 15 < n^2 < 50)
n = 5 (since 5^2 = 25 satisfies 15 < n^2 < 50)
n = 6 (since 6^2 = 36 satisfies 15 < n^2 < 50)
n = 7 (since 7^2 = 49 satisfies 15 < n^2 < 50)
Count of such integers n: 8. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
