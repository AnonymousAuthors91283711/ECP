    (∃ (n : ℤ), n^3 + b * n^2 + c * n + d = 0) →
    (fun n => n^3 + b * n^2 + c * n + d) 2015 * (fun n => n^3 + b * n^2 + c * n + d) 2016 ∈ olympiadbench1645_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {0}
Proposed Answer: {(2015 - n) * (2016 - n) * n^2 | n : ℤ}
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem states that if a cubic polynomial has an integer root, then the product of its values at 2015 and 2016 must be in some set (olympiadbench1645_answer).

2. The ground truth answer is {0}, meaning the product must be zero.

3. The proposed answer suggests a more complex set {(2015 - n) * (2016 - n) * n^2 | n : ℤ}.

Analysis:
- If the polynomial has a root n, then either:
  a) n = 2015, making f(2015) = 0, so the product is 0
  b) n = 2016, making f(2016) = 0, so the product is 0
  c) n is neither, but then the expression (2015-n)(2016-n)n² would be non-zero
- The ground truth {0} is correct because the product is only guaranteed to be zero
- The proposed answer includes many non-zero values (when n ≠ 2015,2016), which are not necessarily achievable
- The only guaranteed value is 0, as shown in the ground truth

Conclusion: The proposed answer is incorrect because it includes many values that aren't necessarily in the solution set. Only {0} is always correct.
