The problem involves the infinite sum \(\sum_{n=0}^\infty (n+1)\left(\frac{1}{1998}\right)^n\). To conjecture the closed-form of this sum, we'll enumerate partial sums for various denominators to recognize a pattern or closed form.

```python
# Enumerate partial sums of sum_{n>=0} (n+1)*x^n for various x=1/d, d integer > 1.
def partial_sum(x, terms=20):
    s = 0.0
    for n in range(terms):
        s += (n+1)*(x**n)
        print(f"n={n:2d}, term={(n+1)*(x**n):.10f}, partial_sum={s:.10f}")
    return s

def main():
    # We try several values close to 1/1998 to see the sum convergence and guess closed form.
    denominators = [2, 10, 100, 500, 1998]
    for d in denominators:
        x = 1/d
        print(f"\nPartial sums for x = 1/{d} = {x:.7f}")
        s = partial_sum(x)
        # Known formula for sum_{n=0}^\infty (n+1)*x^n = 1/(1-x)^2 for |x|<1
        formula = 1/(1-x)**2
        print(f"Formula: 1/(1-{x:.7f})^2 = {formula:.10f}")
        print(f"Difference = {abs(s - formula):.10e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This prints partial sums and compares with the closed form \( \frac{1}{(1-x)^2} \), for \(x = \frac{1}{1998}\), strongly suggesting the answer is \( \frac{1}{(1-\frac{1}{1998})^2} \).
