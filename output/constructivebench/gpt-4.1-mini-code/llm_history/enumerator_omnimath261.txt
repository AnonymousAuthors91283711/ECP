[write_program]
The problem involves sequences \(a_n\), \(x_k\), and \(A_k\) defined on natural numbers with given recursive and inequality constraints up to \(n=2002\). We want to explore the values of \(\sum A_k\) and compare it to \(l \cdot a_{2002}\), where \(l\) is a lower bound constant to be found.

To assist, I will write a Python program that:
- Initializes \(a_n\) by the given recursion,
- Generates various sequences \(x_k \geq 0\),
- Calculates \(A_k\) according to the formula,
- Computes \(\sum A_k\) and the ratio \(\sum A_k / a_{2002}\),
- Prints these values streaming, to help approximate or conjecture the minimal \(l\),
- Uses small sample values for \(x_k\) to keep computations manageable.

Since \(n=2002\) is large, I'll reduce it to a smaller \(N=10\) for practical runtime and insight. This reduction is a sample, outputs for \(N=10\) will reveal structure.

```python
# Enumerate and print possible values of sum A_k / a_N for sequences x_k >= 0, a_n with recursion given

N = 10  # reduced from 2002 for feasibility

def compute_a(N):
    a = [0]*(N+1)
    a[1] = 1/4
    for n in range(2, N+1):
        a[n] = 0.25*(1 + a[n-1])**2
    return a

def compute_A(x, a, N):
    A = [0]*(N+1)
    for k in range(1, N+1):
        numerator = x[k] - k
        s = 0
        for i in range(k, N+1):
            s += x[i]
        s += (k*(k-1))/2 + 1
        denominator = s**2
        A[k] = numerator / denominator if denominator != 0 else 0
    return A

def generate_xs(N, max_val=5, step=1):
    # Generate some test sequences x_k >= 0, here with fixed pattern increments for feasibility
    # For more coverage, we generate sequences where each x_k is 0 or 1 or 2 up to max_val
    # To keep output small, generate specific patterns only

    # Patterns to try:
    patterns = [
        [0]*(N+1),
        [k for k in range(N+1)],       # x_k = k
        [0]*(N+1),
        [1]*(N+1),
        [2]*(N+1),
        [k/2 for k in range(N+1)],
        [max(0, k-5) for k in range(N+1)],
    ]

    for p in patterns:
        yield p

def main():
    a = compute_a(N)
    print(f"N={N}, a[N]={a[N]:.6f}")

    for x in generate_xs(N):
        # ensure x[k]>=0 for k>=1
        if any(x[k] < 0 for k in range(1, N+1)):
            continue
        A = compute_A(x, a, N)
        sum_A = sum(A[1:])
        ratio = sum_A / a[N] if a[N] != 0 else float('inf')
        print(f"x[1..N]={[round(x[k],2) for k in range(1,N+1)]} sum A={sum_A:.6f} ratio={ratio:.6f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This code attempts to explore possible sums and their ratios to \(a_N\) given various sequences \(x\). The printed ratios may guide conjectures on minimal \(l\). Adjust \(N\), step, and patterns for more comprehensive search.
