The problem asks to count the number of four-digit numbers (from 1000 to 9999) that have at least one repeated digit.

We will enumerate all numbers in this range, check if there is any repeated digit, and print each such number. Then we'll print the total count.

```python
def has_repeated_digit(n):
    digits = list(str(n))
    return len(set(digits)) < len(digits)

count = 0
for n in range(1000, 10000):
    if has_repeated_digit(n):
        print(n)
        count += 1

print('Total count:', count)
```
