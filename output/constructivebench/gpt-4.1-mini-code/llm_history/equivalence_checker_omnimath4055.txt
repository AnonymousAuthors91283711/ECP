Ground Truth Answer: fun s => ∀ n, n ∈ s ↔ Even n
Proposed Answer: fun s => s = {n | 2 ∣ n}
<<<True>>>

Explanation: The ground truth answer states that the set `s` consists exactly of all even numbers (`∀ n, n ∈ s ↔ Even n`). The proposed answer states that `s` is equal to the set of numbers divisible by 2 (`s = {n | 2 ∣ n}`). These are equivalent because in mathematics, a number being even is equivalent to it being divisible by 2. Both answers correctly characterize the set `s` as the set of even numbers.
