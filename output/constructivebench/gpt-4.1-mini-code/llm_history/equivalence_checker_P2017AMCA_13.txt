Ground Truth Answer: 135
Proposed Answer: 60
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a scenario with two equations:
   - First equation: 180/60 = d/v (which simplifies to 3 = d/v)
   - Second equation: 276/60 = (d/3)/v + (2d/3)/(v-20) (which simplifies to 4.6 = d/(3v) + 2d/(3(v-20)))

2. From the first equation, we get v = d/3

3. Substituting v = d/3 into the second equation:
   4.6 = (d)/(3*(d/3)) + (2d)/(3*(d/3 - 20))
   Simplifies to:
   4.6 = 1 + (2d)/(d - 60)

4. Solving this:
   3.6 = 2d/(d - 60)
   3.6(d - 60) = 2d
   3.6d - 216 = 2d
   1.6d = 216
   d = 216/1.6 = 135

The ground truth answer (135) is correct based on this derivation. The proposed answer (60) doesn't satisfy the equations when we substitute back:
- If d=60, then v=20
- But the problem states v-20 > 0, which would be violated (20-20=0)
- Also, plugging d=60 into the second equation doesn't yield 4.6

<<<False>>>
