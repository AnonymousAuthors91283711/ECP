The problem involves finding digits \(a, b, c\) with \(1 \leq a \leq 9\), \(0 \leq b,c \leq 9\), \(a+b+c \leq 7\), and an integer \(t > 0\) such that:
\[
100a + 10b + c + 55t = 100c + 10b + a
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
55t = 99c - 99a = 99(c - a).
\]
Thus,
\[
t = \frac{99(c - a)}{55} = \frac{9 (c - a)}{5}.
\]
Since \(t\) is a positive integer, \(\frac{9(c - a)}{5}\) must be a positive integer, so \(c > a\), \(t > 0\) integer.

We want to find all triples \((a,b,c)\) meeting the digit sum constraint and this divisibility condition, then print their \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\).

We enumerate all such triples and print answers as found.

```python
# Find digits a,b,c satisfying:
# 1 <= a <= 9, 0 <= b,c <= 9,
# a+b+c <=7,
# there exists t>0 with 100a+10b+c + 55t = 100c +10b + a,
# i.e. 55t = 99(c-a), so t = 9*(c-a)/5, t>0 integer => c>a and 5|(9(c-a)) => 5|(c-a)

def main():
    for a in range(1, 10):
        for b in range(0, 10):
            for c in range(0, 10):
                if a + b + c <=7:
                    diff = c - a
                    if diff > 0 and (9*diff) % 5 == 0:
                        t = (9 * diff) // 5
                        if t > 0:
                            s = a*a + b*b + c*c
                            print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, t={t}, sum_of_squares={s}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
