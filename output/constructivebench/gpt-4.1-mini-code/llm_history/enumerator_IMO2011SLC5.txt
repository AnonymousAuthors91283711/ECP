The problem explores the maximum time \( t \) such that ants moving from positions inside an \( m \times m \) grid remain inside it, where each ant moves in one of the four axial directions at one unit per time. We want to enumerate possible values of \( t \) for small grid sizes \( m \) by trying all configurations of ants and directions to conjecture the maximum time.

We will:
- Enumerate ants' initial positions on the integer lattice points in the grid \( [0,m]^2 \).
- Assign directions from \{(1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1)\}.
- For each configuration, find the maximum \( t \) where all ants remain in the grid for times \( t' \le t \).
- Print each candidate \( t \).

To keep enumeration manageable, we consider ants only at integer lattice points and a small number of ants. We print discovered candidates and also show the parameters used (values of \( m \)). This will help form conjectures about \( t \).
