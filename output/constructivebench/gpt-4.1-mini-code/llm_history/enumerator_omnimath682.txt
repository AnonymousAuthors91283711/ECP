The problem is to find the greatest natural number \( n \) such that \( 2^n \) divides \( 3^{512} - 1 \). To assist with conjecturing the answer, we will create a Python program to compute the exact highest power of 2 dividing \( 3^{512} - 1 \) by examining powers of 2. We will enumerate all powers \( n \) from 1 upward as long as \( 2^n \) divides \( 3^{512} - 1 \), printing each valid \( n \) and finally outputting the largest found.

```python
# Find the highest power of 2 dividing 3^512 - 1
def v2(x):
    # returns the exponent of the highest power of 2 dividing x
    count = 0
    while x % 2 == 0:
        x //= 2
        count += 1
    return count

def main():
    base = 3
    exp = 512
    val = base**exp - 1

    max_n = v2(val)
    # Enumerate and print all n where 2^n divides val
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        print(f"2^{n} divides {base}^{exp} - 1")

    print(f"Largest n with 2^n divides {base}^{exp} - 1 is {max_n}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
