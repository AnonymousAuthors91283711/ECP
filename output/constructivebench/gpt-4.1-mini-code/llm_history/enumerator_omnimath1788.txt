[write_program]
We want to find the possible values of |a + b + c| for real numbers a, b, c satisfying the system:
a² - b c = 14
b² - c a = 14
c² - a b = -3

The program below tries small integer values for a, b, c in a reasonable range, filters those satisfying the system approximately (due to floating point), and prints |a + b + c| for those solutions found. This helps conjecture the possible values.

```python
import math

eps = 1e-6
found_sums = set()

print("Enumerating integer triples (a,b,c) with -10 <= values <= 10 satisfying:")
print("a^2 - b*c = 14, b^2 - c*a = 14, c^2 - a*b = -3")

for a in range(-10, 11):
    for b in range(-10, 11):
        for c in range(-10, 11):
            cond1 = a*a - b*c
            cond2 = b*b - c*a
            cond3 = c*c - a*b
            if abs(cond1 - 14) < eps and abs(cond2 - 14) < eps and abs(cond3 + 3) < eps:
                s = abs(a + b + c)
                if s not in found_sums:
                    found_sums.add(s)
                    print(f"|a+b+c| = {s} found for (a,b,c) = ({a},{b},{c})")

# Try also some rational variants (since exact integer solutions may be rare)
# But to keep output short, we avoid more.

if found_sums:
    print("\nCandidate |a+b+c| values found:")
    for val in sorted(found_sums):
        print(val)
else:
    print("No integer solutions found in range.")
```
