[write_program]
The problem involves a sequence defined by a linear recurrence relation and some initial conditions, with one equality condition relating two distant terms. We want to find the sum of the first 101 terms. The program below enumerates the sequence for plausible initial values, prints sums, and attempts to identify the sum respecting the constraint a(98) = a(99). The search tries small values at a0 to guess a solution and prints candidates.

```python
# Enumerate sequences a_n with recurrence:
# a_{n+3} = a_{n+2} - 2 a_{n+1} + a_n,
# with a1=1, a3=1, and condition a98 = a99.
# Since a0 unknown, try small integer values for a0 and a2.
# Then compute sums of first 101 terms and print those where a98==a99.

def main():
    # We fix a1=1, a3=1
    a1 = 1
    a3 = 1
    max_abs = 5  # range for a0 and a2 to try

    print("Trying sequences with a1=1, a3=1 and varying a0, a2 in [-5..5]")
    for a0 in range(-max_abs, max_abs+1):
        for a2 in range(-max_abs, max_abs+1):
            # Initialize array, indexing from 0 to 100
            a = [0]*101
            a[0] = a0
            a[1] = a1
            a[2] = a2
            a[3] = a3
            # Compute terms up to 100 using recurrence
            for n in range(0, 98):
                a[n+3] = a[n+2] - 2*a[n+1] + a[n]
            # Check condition a98 == a99
            if a[98] == a[99]:
                total = sum(a[:101])
                print(f"a0={a0}, a2={a2}, sum(0..100)={total} with a98=a99={a[98]}")
    print("Done.")

    main()
```
