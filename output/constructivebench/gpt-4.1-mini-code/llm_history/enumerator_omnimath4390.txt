The problem considers triples of integers \((x,y,z)\) such that:
\[
x^2 - y^2 = z \quad \text{and} \quad 3xy + (x - y)z = z^2.
\]
The code will enumerate integer triples \((x,y,z)\) with small values (e.g. in \([-10, 10]\)) and print those that satisfy the system exactly, to discover patterns or explicit solutions.

```python
# Enumerate integer triples (x,y,z) with |x,y,z| â‰¤ 10 satisfying:
# x^2 - y^2 = z and 3xy + (x - y)z = z^2
# Print all solutions found.

LIMIT = 10

for x in range(-LIMIT, LIMIT+1):
    for y in range(-LIMIT, LIMIT+1):
        z = x**2 - y**2  # from first equation
        # check second equation exactly
        lhs = 3*x*y + (x - y)*z
        rhs = z**2
        if lhs == rhs:
            print(f"(x,y,z) = ({x},{y},{z})")
```
