The problem concerns finding functions \( s: \{0,1\} \times \{0,\dots,4\} \to \mathbb{Z} \) such that each \( s(i, \cdot) \) is strictly monotone and satisfies the equation

\[
(s(i,0))^2 + (s(i,1))^2 + (s(i,2))^2 = (s(i,3))^2 + (s(i,4))^2,
\]

for each \( i = 0,1 \).

Our goal is to enumerate all such integer 5-tuples for each \( i \), obeying strict monotonicity and the equation above, then check pairs \( (s_0, s_1) \).

To manage complexity, we restrict search to small integer ranges (e.g., -10 to 10) for each coordinate, ensuring strict increase. This program enumerates such candidate functions \( s \), printing each found solution as a pair of sequences.

```python
# Enumerate strictly increasing integer 5-tuples s_i with coords in [-10..10]
# satisfying s_i0^2 + s_i1^2 + s_i2^2 = s_i3^2 + s_i4^2.
# Then enumerate such pairs (s_0,s_1) and print them.

def strictly_increasing_5_tuples(lo, hi):
    # Generate all strictly increasing 5-tuples in [lo, hi]
    # to keep search manageable, limit range modestly.
    for a in range(lo, hi-3):
        for b in range(a+1, hi-2):
            for c in range(b+1, hi-1):
                for d in range(c+1, hi):
                    for e in range(d+1, hi+1):
                        yield (a,b,c,d,e)

def satisfies_eq(t):
    return t[0]**2 + t[1]**2 + t[2]**2 == t[3]**2 + t[4]**2

def main():
    lo, hi = -10, 10
    candidates = []
    # Enumerate candidates for s_i
    for t in strictly_increasing_5_tuples(lo, hi):
        if satisfies_eq(t):
            print(f"s_i candidate: {t}")
            candidates.append(t)
    print(f"Total {len(candidates)} candidates for each s_i.")

    # Enumerate pairs (s_0, s_1) to check problem conditions
    print("Enumerating pairs (s_0, s_1):")
    count = 0
    # Just print some pairs to avoid huge output
    for i, s0 in enumerate(candidates):
        for j, s1 in enumerate(candidates):
            # Check strict monotonicity and equation hold per row trivially satisfied
            # Just print pairs for inspection
            print(f"s = [ {s0}, {s1} ]")
            count += 1
            if count >= 10:
                print("Reached 10 pairs, stopping.")
                return

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
