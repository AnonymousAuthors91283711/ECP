Since no rational solution appears and the equation involves logs with bases 4 and 8, rewrite:

log₄(3x) = log₈(2x)

This implies (3x) = (2x)^{log₈ 4} = (2x)^{2/3}

Raise both sides to power 3:

(3x)^3 = (2x)^2

27 x^3 = 4 x^2

Divide by x^2 (x > 0):

27 x = 4  →  x = 4/27 ∈ ℚ

So the rational solution is 4/27.

<<<4/27>>>
