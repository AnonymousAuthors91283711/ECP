The problem is about finding the least sum \( s \) of a 7-element finite set \( A \subset \mathbb{N} \) with positive distinct elements, such that every nonempty subset \( B \subseteq A \) has sum divisible by the size of \( B \). This means the average of every subset is an integer.

To assist in conjecturing the minimum sum and structure of \( A \), we'll enumerate 7-element strictly increasing sets of positive integers with small maximum elements, checking the divisibility condition for every subset. We'll print all sums \( s \) that satisfy the condition.

```python
from itertools import combinations

def is_valid_set(A):
    # Check if every nonempty subset has average an integer
    A = sorted(A)
    n = len(A)
    for r in range(1, n+1):
        for B in combinations(A, r):
            if sum(B) % r != 0:
                return False
    return True

def main():
    n = 7
    # We'll try sets A with elements in range 1..m, m increasing until some solutions are found
    # To limit output and runtime, we set max element up to 20
    max_element = 20
    results = []
    for A in combinations(range(1, max_element+1), n):
        if is_valid_set(A):
            s = sum(A)
            print(f"Set: {A}, sum: {s}")
            results.append(s)
    if results:
        print(f"Minimum sum found: {min(results)}")
    else:
        print("No valid sets found with elements up to", max_element)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
