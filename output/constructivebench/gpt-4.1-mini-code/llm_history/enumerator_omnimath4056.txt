The problem involves finding the minimum and maximum possible values of the product \(a b c d\) given the constraints:
- \(a + b + c + d = 2\)
- \(a b + b c + c d + d a + a c + b d = 0\)

To explore this, we'll enumerate possible quadruples \((a,b,c,d)\) with rational values satisfying the two equations approximately (due to floating point limits), and print the product \(a b c d\) when the conditions are nearly met. We'll scan over a small integer range to keep computations feasible.

```python
# Enumerate quadruples (a,b,c,d) with a+b+c+d=2 and sum of pairwise products=0,
# and print a*b*c*d values found. We'll scan over small integers and small fractions.

def close(x, y, tol=1e-6):
    return abs(x - y) < tol

def main():
    # Scan a,b,c in steps, compute d=2 - (a+b+c)
    # Check sum of pairwise products approximately zero
    # Range: -3 to 5 in 0.5 steps, enough to find patterns
    from itertools import product
    step = 0.5
    vals = [i * step for i in range(-6, 11)]  # from -3 to 5 inclusive by 0.5
    min_prod = None
    max_prod = None
    printed = set()
    for a, b, c in product(vals, repeat=3):
        d = 2 - (a + b + c)
        # Calculate sum of pairwise products:
        s = a*b + b*c + c*d + d*a + a*c + b*d
        if close(s, 0):
            p = a*b*c*d
            key = (round(a,2), round(b,2), round(c,2), round(d,2))
            if key in printed:
                continue
            printed.add(key)
            print(f"a={a:.2f}, b={b:.2f}, c={c:.2f}, d={d:.2f}, product={p:.6f}")
            if (min_prod is None) or (p < min_prod):
                min_prod = p
            if (max_prod is None) or (p > max_prod):
                max_prod = p
    if min_prod is not None and max_prod is not None:
        print(f"Minimum product found: {min_prod:.6f}")
        print(f"Maximum product found: {max_prod:.6f}")

    main()
