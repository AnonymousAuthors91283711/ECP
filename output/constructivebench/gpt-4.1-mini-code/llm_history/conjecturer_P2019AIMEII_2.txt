theorem P2019AIMEII_2 :
  let (p, q) := P2019AIMEII_2_answer
  probVisits7 7 = p / q ∧ p.Coprime q := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Computing probVisits7(n) for n=0..7
probVisits7(0) = 0/1
probVisits7(1) = 1/1
probVisits7(2) = 1/1
probVisits7(3) = 1/1
probVisits7(4) = 1/1
probVisits7(5) = 1/1
probVisits7(6) = 1/1
probVisits7(7) = 1/1

Answer for probVisits7(7): 1/1. Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ
<<<(1,1)>>>
