theorem omnimath2876 (a n : ℕ) (ha : a = 15) (hn : n = 51) :
    omnimath2876_answer a n = 218 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun a n => 
    match n with
    | 0 => a
    | n + 1 => 
      if Odd (omnimath2876_answer a n) then 
        (omnimath2876_answer a n) + 3 
      else 
        (omnimath2876_answer a n) + 5
Proposed Answer: fun a n => a * n / 3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for a recursive function definition where:
   - Base case: when n=0, return a
   - Recursive case: if previous result is odd, add 3; else add 5

2. The ground truth answer implements this exact recursive logic.

3. The proposed answer suggests a completely different, non-recursive formula: a*n/3

For the specific case given (a=15, n=51), let's test:
- Ground truth would produce 218 through recursive steps
- Proposed answer: 15*51/3 = 255, which doesn't match 218

The answers are fundamentally different in their approach and results. The proposed answer doesn't implement the required recursive logic and gives incorrect results.
