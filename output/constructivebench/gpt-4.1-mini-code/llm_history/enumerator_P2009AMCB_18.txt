The problem involves two functions, RachelPos and RobertPos, defined on the interval T = [600, 660], both involving fractional parts and periodicity. We want to compute the proportion of times t in T for which the positions are close to 1/2 within 1/8.

To assist with conjecturing P2009AMCB_18_answer, we enumerate values of t in T with a reasonable step and print those t satisfying the proximity condition, then estimate the ratio of the count satisfying the condition to the total points sampled.

```python
# Enumerate times t in [600,660] and check conditions on RachelPos and RobertPos
# RachelPos(t) = fractional part of t/90
# RobertPos(t) = 1 - fractional part of t/80
# Condition: |RachelPos(t) - 1/2| <= 1/8 and |RobertPos(t) - 1/2| <= 1/8

def fract(x):
    return x - int(x)

def check_condition(t):
    rachel = fract(t / 90)
    robert = 1 - fract(t / 80)
    return abs(rachel - 0.5) <= 0.125 and abs(robert - 0.5) <= 0.125

def main():
    T_start, T_end = 600, 660
    step = 0.1  # Step size for enumerating t, adjust for balance of speed and precision
    total_points = 0
    satisfying_points = 0

    print(f"Enumerating t in [{T_start}, {T_end}] with step {step}")
    for i in range(int((T_end - T_start) / step) + 1):
        t = T_start + i * step
        total_points += 1
        if check_condition(t):
            satisfying_points += 1
            print(f"t={t:.2f} satisfies condition: RachelPos={fract(t/90):.3f}, RobertPos={1 - fract(t/80):.3f}")

    ratio = satisfying_points / total_points
    print(f"Total points: {total_points}, Points satisfying condition: {satisfying_points}")
    print(f"Estimated ratio = {ratio:.5f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
