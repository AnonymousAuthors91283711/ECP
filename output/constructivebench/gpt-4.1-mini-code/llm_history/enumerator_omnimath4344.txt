[write_program]
The problem concerns a pursuit-evasion scenario on the plane with constraints on movement and tracking. Since formal proof is not requested here, we write a Python program that simulates or enumerates possible hunter and rabbit paths with given step constraints for small values and time horizons, aiming to explore plausibility of the hunter getting close to the rabbit after many steps.

The program samples parameters for small steps (e.g., 5 or 10) and enumerates possible paths of rabbit and hunter under distance constraints, printing any situations where the hunter ends near the rabbit in the long term or fails, to aid conjecture.

```python
import math
from itertools import product

def dist(a, b):
    return math.hypot(a[0]-b[0], a[1]-b[1])

# Generate all points reachable from a point in one step of length 1 on integer grid directions
def neighbors(p):
    x, y = p
    # 8 directions + stay option not allowed (distance must be exactly 1)
    # we approximate points by integer moves on grid with length 1 or close (considering floats)
    points = []
    for dx in [-1,0,1]:
        for dy in [-1,0,1]:
            if dx==0 and dy==0:
                continue
            nx, ny = x+dx, y+dy
            if math.isclose(dist(p,(nx,ny)),1,abs_tol=1e-9):
                points.append((nx,ny))
    return points

            for nxt in neighbors(path[-1]):
                yield path + [nxt]

# For fixed example, take one rabbit path and simulate hunter strategies that follow tracking device positions
# tracking device is constrained to be within 1 of rabbit at same t
# hunter strategy steps of length 1 and start at rabbit_path[0]
