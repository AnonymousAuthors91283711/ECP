theorem omnimath2000 :
  let ω : ℂ := exp (2 * π * I / 727)

  let prod := ∏ k ∈ Finset.range 6, f (k + 8)  -- k ranges from 8 to 13

Ground Truth Answer: 12 * π / 727
Proposed Answer: (Real.arcsin ((∏ k in Finset.range 6, (1 + (Complex.exp (2 * π * I / 727))^(3^(k + 7)) + (Complex.exp (2 * π * I / 727))^(2 * 3^(k + 7))))).im)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves complex roots of unity (ω = e^(2πi/727)) and a product of terms of form (1 + ω^a + ω^b).

2. The ground truth answer claims the angle α is exactly 12π/727.

3. The proposed answer gives α as arcsin of the imaginary part of the product, which is essentially restating the problem's condition (prod.im = sin α) rather than providing a simplified value.

The proposed answer doesn't simplify to the ground truth answer - it just rephrases the problem statement using arcsin. The ground truth provides an exact simplified value (12π/727), while the proposed answer doesn't simplify the expression at all.
