abbrev P2006AMCA_18_answer : Set ℝ := sorry
theorem P2006AMCA_18 (D : Set ℝ) (f : ℝ → ℝ) :
  (∀ x ∈ D, 1/x ∈ D ∧ f x + f (1/x) = x) ∧
  (∀ (s : Set ℝ), (∀ x ∈ s, 1/x ∈ s ∧ f x + f (1/x) = x) → s ⊆ D) ↔
  D = P2006AMCA_18_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: # Enumerating candidate sets D and linear f(x) = a x + b satisfying f(x)+f(1/x)=x
# Sample check on large domain for f(x) = 0.5*x - 0.5
x=0.5, f(x)+f(1/x) = 0.2500 (should be x=0.5)
x=1, f(x)+f(1/x) = 0.0000 (should be x=1)
x=2, f(x)+f(1/x) = 0.2500 (should be x=2)
x=4, f(x)+f(1/x) = 1.1250 (should be x=4)
x=10, f(x)+f(1/x) = 4.0500 (should be x=10). Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
<<<{x : ℝ | x ≠ 0}>>>
