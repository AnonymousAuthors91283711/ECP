abbrev omnimath2766_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2766 : 
  ∀ x : ℝ, (1 + 3 + x) / 3 = 3 ↔ x = omnimath2766_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Checking values of x in -10 to 10:
x = 5 satisfies (1 + 3 + x)/3 = 3
Checking decimal values near 5:
x = 5.0 satisfies (1 + 3 + x)/3 = 3. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<5>>>
