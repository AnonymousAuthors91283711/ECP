The problem asks for the largest size \( n \) of a subset \( S \) of the integers \(\{1, \ldots, 30\}\) such that for any distinct \(x, y \in S\), \((x+y) \not\equiv 0 \pmod{5}\).

We want to enumerate subsets and find the maximum cardinality \(n\) satisfying the condition. To do this efficiently, consider the elements by their residue modulo 5:

- Numbers modulo 5 can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
- The sum of two residues is zero mod 5 if residues sum to 0 mod 5.
- Pairs to avoid: (0,0), (1,4), (2,3)

So \(S\) cannot have two elements both congruent to 0 modulo 5. Also, \(S\) cannot contain elements both from classes 1 and 4, nor both from classes 2 and 3.

The problem reduces to choosing subsets from these residue classes that obey these constraints and maximizing size.

Enumerate and print filtered results up to max subsets with elements chosen from residue classes 0..4 within 1..30.

```python
# Enumerate maximum subsets of {1..30} avoiding pairs whose sum â‰¡ 0 mod 5

def main():
    # Partition numbers by residues mod 5
    residues = {r: [] for r in range(5)}
    for x in range(1, 31):
        residues[x % 5].append(x)

    # Key restriction:
    # - No two elements from residue 0 (only one allowed)
    # - No picking from both residue classes 1 and 4 simultaneously
    # - No picking from both residue classes 2 and 3 simultaneously

    # We'll try the 4 possible residue class combinations to fulfill conditions:
    # 1) Pick from residue 0 + 1 + 2
    # 2) Pick from residue 0 + 1 + 3
    # 3) Pick from residue 0 + 4 + 2
    # 4) Pick from residue 0 + 4 + 3

    # At most one element from residue 0 can be chosen
    max_res0 = min(len(residues[0]), 1)

    candidates = []

    for c1, c2 in [(1, 2), (1, 3), (4, 2), (4, 3)]:
        # The subset: pick all elements from c1 and c2 and max one from residues 0
        subset_size = len(residues[c1]) + len(residues[c2]) + max_res0
        # Print the configuration and size
        print(f"Residues used: 0({max_res0}), {c1}({len(residues[c1])}), {c2}({len(residues[c2])}) => size = {subset_size}")
        candidates.append(subset_size)

    # The maximal cardinality found
    answer = max(candidates)
    print(f"Maximum subset size without forbidden pairs: {answer}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
