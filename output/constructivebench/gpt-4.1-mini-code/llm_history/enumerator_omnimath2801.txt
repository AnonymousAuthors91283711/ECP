The problem deals with sets \( s \subseteq ( \text{Fin } 6 \times \text{Fin } 6 ) \) where:
- For every pair \((a,b) \in s\), \(a \neq b\).
- For each \(a \in \text{Fin } 6\), the number of \(b\)'s with either \((a,b)\) or \((b,a)\) in \(s\) is exactly 3.

Such an \(s\) represents an undirected 3-regular graph on the vertex set \(\{0, 1, ..., 5\}\), encoded as a set of ordered pairs to record directions arbitrarily chosen for edges. Each edge \(\{a,b\}\) corresponds to exactly one of \((a,b)\) or \((b,a)\) in \(s\). The count we want is the number of 3-regular simple graphs on 6 vertices, times \(2^{\text{number_of_edges}} = 2^{9} = 512\) to pick orientations consistently.

We will enumerate all 3-regular simple graphs on 6 vertices (with no loops or multiedges), then for each, print 512 is the number of possible orientations \(s\) corresponds to. This matches the problem's count.

Below, we generate all 3-regular graphs on 6 vertices using itertools and check degrees exactly 3. We will print each such graph and print cumulative counts.

```python
# Enumerate all 3-regular simple graphs on 6 vertices to assist in counting the given sets.

from itertools import combinations

V = 6
E = 9  # For 3-regular graph on 6 vertices, total edges = 6*3/2 = 9

edges_all = list(combinations(range(V), 2))  # all possible edges
n_all = len(edges_all)  # 15

def degrees_from_edges(edge_set):
    deg = [0]*V
    for (u,v) in edge_set:
        deg[u] += 1
        deg[v] += 1
    return deg

count_graphs = 0
count_s = 0
# We go through all subsets of edges of size 9 to find 3-regular graphs:
# There are C(15,9)=5005 subsets, feasible to check exhaustively.

for chosen_edges in combinations(edges_all, E):
    degs = degrees_from_edges(chosen_edges)
    if all(d == 3 for d in degs):
        count_graphs += 1
        # Each edge can be oriented in two ways, so for each 3-regular graph,
        # there are 2^9 possible sets s that satisfy the problem's conditions.
        candidate_count = 2**E
        print(f"3-regular graph #{count_graphs}, edges={chosen_edges}")
        print(f"Number of corresponding sets s = {candidate_count}")
        count_s += candidate_count
        # To keep output within limits, break after first few graphs
        if count_graphs >= 5:
            break

print(f"Enumerated {count_graphs} graphs (partial), partial sets s count: {count_s}")
print("The total number is conjectured to be count_graphs * 2^9 for all such graphs.")
```
This enumerates initial 3-regular graphs and prints how many sets \(s\) correspond to each. This should help conjecture and prove the exact count.
