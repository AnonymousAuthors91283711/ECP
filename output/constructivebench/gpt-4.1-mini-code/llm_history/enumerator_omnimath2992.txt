We want to explore the possible intersection sizes \( k = |A \cap B \cap C| \) for subsets \( A, B, C \subseteq \{1, \ldots, \text{total}\} \) with fixed cardinalities \( |A| = \text{dog}, |B| = \text{cat}, |C| = \text{turtle} \). 

Our task is to enumerate all feasible \( k \) values and find \( x = \max k \) and \( y = \min k \). Then print each feasible \( k \) found, followed by \( x-y \). We'll try several small sample parameters (like total up to 10) to observe patterns.

We leverage combinatorial bounds:
- \( k \le \min(\text{dog}, \text{cat}, \text{turtle}) \).
- Minimal \( k \) depends on the pigeonhole principle, e.g., \( k \ge \max(0, \text{dog} + \text{cat} + \text{turtle} - 2 \times \text{total}) \).

The program enumerates all \( k \) between these bounds and checks feasibility using inequalities derived from set cardinalities. For efficiency, we avoid set enumeration and use quick feasibility checks.

```python
# Enumerate possible triple intersections k = |A∩B∩C| for subsets of size dog,cat,turtle within total elements.
# Prints each feasible k immediately and then prints x - y.

def feasible_k(total, dog, cat, turtle, k):
    # Check if k is in the feasible range considering simple bounds:
    # Max triple intersection ≤ min sizes.
    if k < 0 or k > min(dog, cat, turtle):
        return False
    # The minimal intersection k must satisfy:
    # dog + cat + turtle - 2*total ≤ k ≤ min sizes
    # rearranged, maximal triple intersection cannot be less than max(0,dog+cat+turtle-2*total)
    min_k = max(0, dog + cat + turtle - 2*total)
    if k < min_k:
        return False
    # Upper bounds from pairwise intersections must also be satisfied:
    # Intersection of two sets can be at least dog + cat - total for each pair
    # Minimal triple intersection can't be bigger than any pair intersection
    pairs = [(dog, cat), (cat, turtle), (dog, turtle)]
    for x,y in pairs:
        if k > min(x,y):
            return False
        if k < max(0, x + y - total):
            return False
    # These conditions (derived from classic combinatorial set theory) give a strong necessary condition
    return True

def explore(total, dog, cat, turtle):
    print(f"Parameters: total={total}, dog={dog}, cat={cat}, turtle={turtle}")
    min_k = max(0, dog + cat + turtle - 2*total)
    max_k = min(dog, cat, turtle)
    feasible = []
    for k in range(min_k, max_k+1):
        if feasible_k(total, dog, cat, turtle, k):
            feasible.append(k)
            print(f"feasible k = {k}")
    if feasible:
        x = max(feasible)
        y = min(feasible)
        print(f"x - y = {x - y}")
    else:
        print("No feasible triple intersection found")

def main():
    # Test with small parameter samples to capture pattern (total up to 8 to limit output)
    samples = [
        (5,3,3,3),
        (6,4,3,2),

        (8,2,3,4),

        total, dog, cat, turtle = params
        explore(total, dog, cat, turtle)
