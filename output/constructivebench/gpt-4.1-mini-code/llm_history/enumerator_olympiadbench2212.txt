The problem involves sequences \((a_k)\) indexed by \(0 \le k \le N\) with real values, satisfying certain conditions depending on parameter \(n \ge 2\). We want to enumerate possible \(N\) such that there exists such a sequence \(a\). The key condition is a nonlinear equation for \(1 \le k \le N - 1\).

To help conjecture the form of the answer function \( \text{olympiadbench2212\_answer}(n) \), we will try small values of \(n\) (2 to 4) and sequences with small \(N\), verifying if a solution \(a_k\) exists.

Our approach:
- For each \(n\) in [2..4]
- For each \(N\) from 1 up to a small max (like 10)
- Attempt to find real numbers \(a_0, \ldots, a_N\) that satisfy:
  - \(a_0 + a_1 = -1 / n\)
  - For all \(k = 1, \ldots, N-1\), \((a_k + a_{k-1})(a_k + a_{k+1}) = a_{k-1} - a_{k+1}\)
- Enumerate solutions (if any) and print \(N\), \(n\), and one found sequence (or a note of existence).
- Stop early if solution is found for given \((n,N)\).

We attempt this using floating-point trial since this is an enumeration aidâ€”not a formal proof assistant.

# Given constraints are nonlinear: Solve for a sequence a_0,...,a_N (real numbers)
# with a_0 + a_1 = -1/n and for each k in [1, N-1]:
# (a_k + a_{k-1}) * (a_k + a_{k+1}) = a_{k-1} - a_{k+1}
#
# We'll try small N and n, and enumerate plausible solutions by searching simplified param spaces.
# Since dimension grows with N, only very small N are feasible.
#
# We fix a_0 and a_1 from few guesses (since a_0 + a_1 = -1/n),
# then compute a_2,...,a_N by rearranging formula when possible.
# We print every N and n for which sequence is consistent within tolerance.

def try_sequence(n, N):
    # a_0 + a_1 = -1/n
    # We'll try a_0 in fraction steps between -1 and 1, then a_1 = -1/n - a_0
    # Then try to compute successive a_k from the relation rewritten as quadratic:
    # For k in 1..N-1:
    # (a_k + a_{k-1})(a_k + a_{k+1}) = a_{k-1} - a_{k+1}
    # Fixing k, can we express a_{k+1} in terms of a_{k-1}, a_k?
    # Rearranged:
    # (a_k + a_{k-1})(a_k + a_{k+1}) = a_{k-1} - a_{k+1}
    # Let x = a_{k+1}
    # (a_k + a_{k-1})(a_k + x) + x = a_{k-1}
    # (a_k + a_{k-1})a_k + (a_k + a_{k-1})x + x = a_{k-1}
    # ((a_k + a_{k-1}) + 1) x = a_{k-1} - (a_k + a_{k-1}) a_k
    # x = (a_{k-1} - (a_k + a_{k-1}) a_k) / (a_k + a_{k-1} + 1) if denom != 0
    # We'll use this to recursively find next a_k.
    #
    # Challenge: denominator might be zero. We skip such cases.
