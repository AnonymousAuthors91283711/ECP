Enumerating approximate solutions in (-pi/2, pi/2):. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
The main problem here is that Lean does not recognize the shorthand π for the constant pi; instead, we need to use Real.pi explicitly (it is already imported from Mathlib under namespace Real). Hence, to fix the expression, replace π by Real.pi.

From the enumerated answers, the given function's condition 1 - sin(x)^4 - cos(x)^2 = 1/16 has solutions very close to ±π/4 (±0.785398). This matches the candidate answer but with π replaced by Real.pi.

So the corrected Lean expression is the set of x such that x equals -Real.pi / 4 or Real.pi / 4.
