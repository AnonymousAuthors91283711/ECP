The problem defines S as the set of numbers that can be expressed as the sum of three distinct powers of 2. It requests the least number n in S such that exactly 99 smaller elements of S exist. To explore this, we enumerate elements of S by choosing distinct triples (x,y,z) with x<y<z to avoid duplicates, generate numbers 2^x + 2^y + 2^z, sort them, and find the numbers with 99 smaller elements.

We test powers for x,y,z in a small range, say up to 20, as 2^20 is already over a million, enough to get more than 100 sums. We then sort and find the number where the count of smaller elements in S is 99.

```python
# Enumerate sums of 3 distinct powers of 2, for small exponent ranges
def main():
    from itertools import combinations
    max_exp = 20  # maximum exponent to consider
    S = set()
    for triple in combinations(range(max_exp), 3):
        val = 2 ** triple[0] + 2 ** triple[1] + 2 ** triple[2]
        print(f"Found sum: {val} = 2^{triple[0]}+2^{triple[1]}+2^{triple[2]}")
        S.add(val)
    sorted_S = sorted(S)
    print(f"Total sums found: {len(sorted_S)}")
    # Enumerate numbers that have exactly 99 smaller elements in S
    # That means the element at index 99 in sorted_S (0-based) has 99 smaller elements
    if len(sorted_S) > 99:
        candidate = sorted_S[99]
        smaller_count = 99
        print(f"Number with exactly 99 smaller elements: {candidate}")
        # Also print neighbors for context
        if 98 >=0:
            print(f"Smaller neighbor ({98}): {sorted_S[98]}")
        if 100 < len(sorted_S):
            print(f"Larger neighbor ({100}): {sorted_S[100]}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
