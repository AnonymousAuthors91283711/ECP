The problem is about approximating a positive real vector \( C \) with sum 100 by a natural number vector \( N \) with sum 100, minimizing \( \sum |N_i - C_i| \).

We'll enumerate over sampled vectors \( C \) with 5 entries summing to 100, then try to find integer vectors \( N \) summing to 100 to minimize the total absolute difference. This enumerates candidates for the minimal total absolute difference. We'll print \( C \), candidate \( N \), and total difference immediately when found, to assist conjecture about the minimal difference.
