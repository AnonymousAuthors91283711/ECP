The problem deals with combinatorial conditions involving drawing balls of three colors (Red, Blue, Yellow) from respective totals, then it states a result involving a fraction 9/26 under some parity conditions on the draw number. We will interpret this as follows:

- totalRed=50, totalBlue=50, totalYellow=30 are fixed totals.
- numDrawn=65 is fixed.
- Conditions on numDrawn+5 and numDrawn-5 being even means numDrawn is odd (65 is odd).
- The function omnimath1133_answer presumably gives some probability or combinational ratio depending on these parameters.
- The result states that omnimath1133_answer(...) = 9/26.

Since the problem is not fully specified, we attempt to enumerate all possible compositions of draws summing to numDrawn=65 from three colors with provided totals, and check some combinational ratio and print each possibility as a candidate. Then we print the total ratio found.

We will enumerate:
- R in [0..50]
- B in [0..50]
- Y in [0..30]
such that R+B+Y=65.

For each (R,B,Y) triple, compute the multinomial coefficient C(50,R)*C(50,B)*C(30,Y) as the "number of ways"; sum all for total ways. Then consider a conjectured answer, print partial results.

We will print the fraction of counts for some indicative condition if any (e.g., (R+B) even), or just print the triple and ways, to help find the ratio 9/26.

```python
from math import comb
from fractions import Fraction

totalRed = 50
totalBlue = 50
totalYellow = 30
numDrawn = 65

total_ways = 0
partial_sum = 0  # sum over triples satisfying condition

print(f"Parameters: totalRed={totalRed}, totalBlue={totalBlue}, totalYellow={totalYellow}, numDrawn={numDrawn}")

# Enumerate all valid draws
for R in range(max(0, numDrawn - totalBlue - totalYellow), min(totalRed, numDrawn) + 1):
    for B in range(max(0, numDrawn - R - totalYellow), min(totalBlue, numDrawn - R) + 1):
        Y = numDrawn - R - B
        if 0 <= Y <= totalYellow:
            ways = comb(totalRed, R) * comb(totalBlue, B) * comb(totalYellow, Y)
            total_ways += ways
            # Example condition: sum of Red and Blue drawn is even (arbitrary)
            if (R + B) % 2 == 0:
                partial_sum += ways
            # Print every 1000th iteration for brevity
            if (R * totalBlue + B) % 1000 == 0:
                print(f"R={R}, B={B}, Y={Y}, ways={ways}")

result = Fraction(partial_sum, total_ways)
print(f"Partial sum / total ways = {result} ≈ {float(result):.6f}")
print("Check if this matches the 9/26 fraction from the problem statement (≈0.346153)...")
```
