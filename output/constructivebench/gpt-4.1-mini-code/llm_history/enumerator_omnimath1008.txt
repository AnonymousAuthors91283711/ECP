[write_program]
This problem involves summing high powers of cosines of rational multiples of \(\pi\). To explore the sum numerically and conjecture its exact value, I will write a Python program that enumerates the sum for smaller values (like 3, 5, 7, 9) and increasing exponents (even powers), printing the partial results immediately. This might help detect patterns or known exact values.

```python
import math

def cos_power_sum(n, power):
    s = 0
    for k in range(1, n):
        val = math.cos(math.pi * k / n)
        s += val**power
    return s

# We'll try small odd n values, since 1007 is odd, and even powers as in problem (2014)
ns = [3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
powers = [2, 4, 6, 2014]

for n in ns:
    print(f"n={n}")
    for p in powers:
        s = cos_power_sum(n, p)
        print(f" Sum of cos(pi*k/{n})^{p} for k=1..{n-1}: {s:.10f}")

# Attempt to derive a pattern by printing ratios or integer closeness
# The user can observe the pattern and conjecture the exact answer for n=1007, power=2014.
```
