The problem appears to be about characterizing all integer triples \((a,b,c)\) for which 
\[
N = \frac{(a-b)(b-c)(c-a)}{2} + 2
\]
is equal to a power of 2016: \(N = 2016^n\), with \(n \in \mathbb{N}\).

To explore the problem numerically, we can:
- Enumerate integer triples \((a,b,c)\) in a small range.
- Compute \(N = \frac{(a-b)(b-c)(c-a)}{2} + 2\).
- Check if \(N\) is a positive integer and a power of 2016 (allowing \(n=0\) so powers include 1).
- Print such triples and the corresponding \(N\).

The factor \(\frac{(a-b)(b-c)(c-a)}{2}\) is always integer-valued because the product \((a-b)(b-c)(c-a)\) is always even (since it is the product of three integers with at least one even factor or odd behavior). Still, to safely compute, integers are preferred.

We will search for \(|a|,|b|,|c|\leq 10\); 21Â³=9261 triples is feasible.

For each triple with distinct \(a,b,c\), output if \(N\) is a power of 2016, i.e., \(N=2016^n\) for some \(n\).

Finally, output all triples found, candidate \(n\), and the corresponding \(N\).

```python
# enumerator.py
def is_power_of_2016(x):
    if x < 1:
        return False
    p = 1
    n = 0
    while p < x:
        p *= 2016
        n += 1
    return (p == x, n if p == x else None)

# We will enumerate (a,b,c) in -10..10 and check N
# N = ((a-b)*(b-c)*(c-a))//2 + 2
# Only consider triples with a,b,c distinct to avoid zero products.

print("Enumerating triples (a,b,c) with |a,b,c|<=10, distinct:")
found = []
for a in range(-10,11):
    for b in range(-10,11):
        if b == a:
            continue
        for c in range(-10,11):
            if c == a or c == b:
                continue
            prod = (a - b)*(b - c)*(c - a)
            # prod must be even for prod//2 to be integer
            if prod % 2 != 0:
                continue
            N = prod//2 + 2
            powcheck = is_power_of_2016(N)
            if powcheck[0]:
                n = powcheck[1]
                print(f"(a,b,c)=({a},{b},{c}), N={N} = 2016^{n}")
                found.append((a,b,c,N,n))
```
