[write_program]
The problem gives two equations:
2 = 0.1 * x and 2 = 0.2 * y,
and asks for x - y.

We can rewrite these equations as x = 2 / 0.1 and y = 2 / 0.2,
so x - y is straightforward to calculate exactly.

I will write a Python program as requested that enumerates these values and prints the difference.

```python
# Solve for x and y given:
# 2 = 0.1 * x  => x = 2 / 0.1
# 2 = 0.2 * y  => y = 2 / 0.2
# Then compute x - y

def main():
    # Given constants
    val = 2
    coeffs = [(0.1, 'x'), (0.2, 'y')]
    
    # Compute variables
    values = {}
    for c, var in coeffs:
        x_val = val / c
        print(f"{var} = {val} / {c} = {x_val}")
        values[var] = x_val
    
    diff = values['x'] - values['y']
    print(f"x - y = {values['x']} - {values['y']} = {diff}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
