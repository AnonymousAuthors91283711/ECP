Ground Truth Answer: {(1, 0), (1/100, -8), (100, 8)}
Proposed Answer: { p : ℝ × ℝ | p.1 > 0 ∧ p.2 = (Real.log p.1 / Real.log 10) ^ 3 ∧ p.2 = Real.log (p.1 ^ 4) / Real.log 10 }

The proposed answer is a general description of the solution set, while the ground truth answer provides specific points that satisfy the conditions. The proposed answer is correct in terms of the mathematical conditions, but it doesn't explicitly list the solutions like the ground truth does. The ground truth answer shows that there are exactly three points that satisfy both equations, while the proposed answer describes all possible points that satisfy the conditions. They are equivalent in terms of the mathematical conditions but differ in presentation.
