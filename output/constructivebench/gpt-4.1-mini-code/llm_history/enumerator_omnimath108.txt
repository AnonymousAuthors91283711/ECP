[write_program]
The problem asks to find the least prime \( p \) such that for all natural numbers \( a, b \), \( |3^a - 2^b| \neq p \). We will enumerate primes and check small ranges of \( a, b \) to identify candidates.

```python
from sympy import primerange, isprime

max_a = 10
max_b = 10
max_p = 100

# Generate primes up to max_p
primes = list(primerange(2, max_p))

# For each prime p, check if there exists a,b with |3^a - 2^b| = p
for p in primes:
    found = False
    for a in range(max_a+1):
        val_a = 3**a
        for b in range(max_b+1):
            val_b = 2**b
            diff = abs(val_a - val_b)
            if diff == p:
                found = True
                break
        if found: break
    if not found:
        print(f'Candidate prime with no |3^a - 2^b| = p found: {p}')
        print(f'This might be the least such prime.')
        break
```
