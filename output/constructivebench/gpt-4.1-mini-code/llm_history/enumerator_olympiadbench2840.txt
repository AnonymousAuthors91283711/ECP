The problem involves variables \( T \) and \( x \) related by the equation
\[
\log_2(4^{8!}) + \log_4(2^{8!}) = 6! \cdot T \cdot x
\]
with \( T = -10 \), and we want to find \( x \).

We can:
- Enumerate some factorial values for small numbers and evaluate the logarithmic expressions.
- Since factorial grows fast, 8! and 6! are large but computable.
- We'll compute exact values step-by-step and solve for \( x \).

```python
import math

# Precompute factorial values
fact6 = math.factorial(6)
fact8 = math.factorial(8)

T = -10
# Compute log_2(4^{8!}) = 8! * log_2(4)
log2_4 = 2  # since 4 = 2^2, log_2(4) = 2
lhs1 = fact8 * log2_4

# Compute log_4(2^{8!}) = 8! * log_4(2)
# log_4(2) = 1 / log_2(4) = 1/2 since 4=2^2
log4_2 = 1 / 2
lhs2 = fact8 * log4_2

lhs = lhs1 + lhs2

print(f"Parameters: 6! = {fact6}, 8! = {fact8}, T = {T}")
print(f"log_2(4^{fact8}) = {lhs1}")
print(f"log_4(2^{fact8}) = {lhs2}")
print(f"Sum of logs (LHS) = {lhs}")

# Given: lhs = 6! * T * x
# Solve for x:
x = lhs / (fact6 * T)
print(f"Computed x = {x}")
```
