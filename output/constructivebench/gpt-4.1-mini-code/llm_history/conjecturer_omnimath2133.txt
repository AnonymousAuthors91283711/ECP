  (List.sum (List.zipWith (fun (d : ℕ) (p : ℕ) => d * 4 ^ p) [1,0,2,0,1,2,1] [0,1,2,3,4,5,6])) = omnimath2133_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating terms:
Term 0: 1 * 4^0 = 1, Partial sum = 1
Term 1: 0 * 4^1 = 0, Partial sum = 1
Term 2: 2 * 4^2 = 32, Partial sum = 33
Term 3: 0 * 4^3 = 0, Partial sum = 33
Term 4: 1 * 4^4 = 256, Partial sum = 289
Term 5: 2 * 4^5 = 2048, Partial sum = 2337
Term 6: 1 * 4^6 = 4096, Partial sum = 6433
Final answer (sum): 6433. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
