The problem involves finding for integers \( x > 0 \):
- \( 100 \mod x = 10 \)
- Then determining \( 1000 \mod x \).

The goal is to identify the function `omnimath3197_answer(x)` for inputs \( x \) satisfying the first condition.

We will enumerate values of \( x \) from 1 to 200 (to cover reasonable candidates), check the condition \( 100 \bmod x = 10 \), then compute and print \( 1000 \bmod x \) alongside \( x \). This helps conjecture an explicit formula or pattern.

```python
# Enumerate integers x > 0 with 100 % x = 10, then print 1000 % x
# to assist in conjecturing omnimath3197_answer(x).

def main():
    # We'll check x in range from 11 to 200 (since 100 % x = 10 means x > 10)
    for x in range(11, 201):
        if 100 % x == 10:
            r = 1000 % x
            print(f"x={x}, 100 % x=10, 1000 % x={r}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
