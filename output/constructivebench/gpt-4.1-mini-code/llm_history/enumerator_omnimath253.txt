[write_program]
The problem considers pairs \((m,n)\) where there exist monic real polynomials \(P,Q\) with degrees \(m,n\) such that \(P(Q(t)) \neq Q(P(t))\) for any real \(t\). We want to find all such pairs.

To explore this:
- We test small degrees \(m,n\) (e.g., 1 to 4).
- For each \((m,n)\), attempt to find monic polynomials \(P,Q\) (parameterized by their coefficients) that make \(P(Q(t))-Q(P(t))\) have no real roots.
- We check if \(P(Q(t)) - Q(P(t))\) is identically zero or has real roots.
- We'll try simple forms (e.g., \(P(t) = t^m + a_{m-1} t^{m-1} + \cdots\), \(Q(t) = t^n + b_{n-1} t^{n-1} + \cdots\)) and vary lower-degree coefficients for testing.
- If we find some \((m,n)\) admitting such \(P,Q\), print it.

This enumerator will print candidates \((m,n)\) and concrete polynomials if found, for degrees up to 4.
