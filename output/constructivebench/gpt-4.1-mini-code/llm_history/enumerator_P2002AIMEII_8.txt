The problem asks to find the least positive integer \( k \) such that for every positive integer \( n \), the floor of \(\frac{2002}{n}\) is never equal to \( k \). This means we want to identify integers \( k \) that are not attained as \(\lfloor \frac{2002}{n} \rfloor\) for any positive integer \( n \), then find the smallest such \( k \).

To help conjecture the smallest such \( k \), we enumerate all distinct values of \(\lfloor \frac{2002}{n} \rfloor\) for \( n = 1, 2, ..., 2002 \). Then we identify gaps in this set to find possible missing values of \( k \). We'll print these missing \( k \) values as we find them, and finally output the smallest missing \( k \).

```python
def main():
    N = 2002
    attained = set()
    
    # For n=1 to N, compute floor(2002 / n)
    for n in range(1, N + 1):
        val = 2002 // n
        attained.add(val)
    
    # The values attained range from 1 to 2002; we find missing values in that range
    min_k = None
    for k in range(1, N + 1):
        if k not in attained:
            print(f"Missing k = {k}")
            if min_k is None:
                min_k = k
    
    if min_k is not None:
        print(f"Smallest such k = {min_k}")
    else:
        print("No missing k found within range 1 to 2002")

    main()
