The problem concerns finding the smallest integer \( k = m + n \) (with \( m, n \in \mathbb{N} \), \( m > 1 \)) such that the length of the interval where \(\log_m (n x)\) lies between \(-1\) and \(1\) is exactly \( \frac{1}{2013} \).

Since the problem uses the base-\(m\) logarithm and the interval \(\{ x \mid -1 \leq \log_m(n x) \leq 1 \}\), we can express this interval as:
\[
-1 \leq \log_m (n x) \leq 1 \iff m^{-1} \leq n x \leq m^1 \iff \frac{1}{n m} \leq x \leq \frac{m}{n}
\]
Therefore, the length of this interval is:
\[
\frac{m}{n} - \frac{1}{n m} = \frac{m^2 - 1}{m n}
\]
We want this length to equal \( \frac{1}{2013} \), hence:
\[
\frac{m^2 - 1}{m n} = \frac{1}{2013} \implies 2013 (m^2 - 1) = m n
\]
Our goal is to find \( m, n \in \mathbb{N} \), \( m > 1 \), minimizing \( k = m + n \) satisfying:
\[
m n = 2013 (m^2 - 1)
\]

We can compute \( n = \frac{2013 (m^2 - 1)}{m} \) and check when \( n \) is a positive integer. Then minimize \( m + n \).

Below is a Python enumerator following these deductions and printing candidates with their sums until minimal sum is found. It includes streaming print and parameter iteration.

```python
# Enumerate m>1 and compute n = (2013(m^2 -1))/m integer
# Print (m,n,m+n) when n integer, positive
# Find minimal m+n

def main():
    target_denominator = 2013
    min_sum = None
    print("Searching for (m,n) with length (m/n - 1/(m n)) = 1/2013, i.e. (m^2-1)/(m n)=1/2013")
    for m in range(2, 10000):
        numerator = target_denominator * (m*m -1)
        if numerator % m != 0:
            continue
        n = numerator // m
        if n <= 0:
            continue
        k = m + n
        print(f"m={m}, n={n}, sum={k}")
        if (min_sum is None) or (k < min_sum):
            min_sum = k
            print(f"  New min sum found: {min_sum}")
        if min_sum is not None and m > min_sum:  
            # since m > min_sum, sum = m+n >= m+1 > min_sum, stop early
            break
    print(f"Minimal sum k = {min_sum}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This should help in conjecturing the smallest \( k = m + n \) with the required interval length and check the condition modulo 1000 if needed.
