The problem involves three real numbers \(a,b,c\) satisfying certain nonlinear symmetric equations and ordering constraints. We want to approximate possible integer values near \(a^5\), with the error within 0.5 bound. To explore this numerically, let's enumerate various triples \((a,b,c)\) approximately satisfying the system, then compute and print candidates for \(a^5\) and corresponding integers \(n\).

Since solving the system exactly is difficult, we'll try some sample values for \(a,b,c\) respecting \(a \ge b \ge c\) and the positivity of \(a+b+c\). We'll print values \((a,b,c)\), approximate \(a^5\), and close integers \(n\).

```python
import math

# To reduce complexity, we try rational/decimal samples for (a,b,c) fitting a>=b>=c, a+b+c>0.
# Then check how close the equations are to zero.
# Variables: a,b,c from -2.0 to 2.0 stepping by 0.5 for quick test.

def eq1(a,b,c):
    return a**2*b*c + a*b**2*c + a*b*c**2 + 8 - (a + b + c)

def eq2(a,b,c):
    return a**2*b + a**2*c + b**2*c + b**2*a + c**2*a + c**2*b + 3*a*b*c + 4

def eq3(a,b,c):
    return a**2*b**2*c + a*b**2*c**2 + a**2*b*c**2 - 2 - (a*b + b*c + c*a)

eps = 0.1  # tolerance for approximate equality

print("Trying samples (a,b,c) with a≥b≥c and a+b+c>0 near solutions:")
