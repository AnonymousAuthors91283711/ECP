Ground Truth Answer: fun k => k + 1
Proposed Answer: fun k : ℕ => 2^k
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum size of a set S where a guessing strategy can perfectly match a Boolean sequence of length 2^k for all positions in S.

2. The ground truth answer suggests that the maximum size is k+1. This makes sense because:
   - It's related to information theory and the number of bits needed
   - For k bits, you can encode information to perfectly guess k+1 positions

3. The proposed answer suggests 2^k, which would mean you can perfectly guess the entire sequence. This is impossible because:
   - You can't perfectly predict all 2^k positions with limited information
   - The information-theoretic limit is much lower than this

The proposed answer is clearly incorrect as it claims you can guess the entire sequence perfectly, which violates information theory principles.
