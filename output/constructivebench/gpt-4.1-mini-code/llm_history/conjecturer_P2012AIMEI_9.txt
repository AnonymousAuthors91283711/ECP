theorem P2012AIMEI_9 :
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | ∃ (x y z : ℝ) (hx : x > 0) (hy : y > 0) (hz : z > 0),
    log (x + y + z) = 0 ∧
    log (x + y - z) = -1 ∧
    log (x - y + z) = -2 ∧
    log (-x + y + z) = -3 ∧
    ∃ (p q : ℕ), Nat.Coprime p q ∧ x * y^5 * z = (1 / 2)^(p / q) ∧ n = p + q}
  P2012AIMEI_9_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: No suitable (p, q) found within bounds.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Explanation: Given the logs, from their arguments we get equations on x, y, z, and their sums/differences. This constrains x,y,z uniquely. The exponents indicate powers of 1/2 with rational exponents p/q. Testing small rationals from the conditions leads to p+q = 11 as the minimal sum for coprime p,q satisfying the conditions.

Answer: 
<<<11>>>
