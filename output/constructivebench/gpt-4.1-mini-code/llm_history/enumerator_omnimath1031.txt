The problem involves computing the sum of phi_factorial(n) for n from 2 to 50 where gcd(n,50)=1, modulo 50. We will enumerate values of n satisfying gcd(n,50)=1, compute phi_factorial(n) which is the product of all k from 1 to n that are coprime to n, then sum these modulo 50.

```python
import math

def phi_factorial(n):
    # product of all k in [1..n] with gcd(k,n)=1
    prod = 1
    for k in range(1, n+1):
        if math.gcd(k, n) == 1:
            prod *= k
    return prod

def main():
    total = 0
    for n in range(2, 51):
        if math.gcd(n, 50) == 1:
            val = phi_factorial(n)
            print(f"n={n}, phi_factorial={val}")
            total += val
    answer = total % 50
    print(f"Sum mod 50 = {answer}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
