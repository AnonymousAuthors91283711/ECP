The problem asks for the smallest natural number \( n \) such that there exist 8 subsets (each of size 6) of an \( n \)-element set with pairwise disjointness and a certain intersection property. We will enumerate possible \( n \) values and try to construct families of sets \( f_i \) satisfying the given conditions. 

To keep the enumeration manageable, I pick small \( n \) starting from \( 6 \times 8 = 48 \) downward (or slightly smaller to test minimality). However, due to complexity, I'll start with \( n \) around 30 and print intermediate attempts. Sets are represented as bitmasks and subsets of \(\{0, \ldots, n-1\}\).

The conditions are:
- Each \( f_i \) has exactly 6 elements.
- The \( f_i \) are pairwise disjoint.
- For any quadruple \( i,j,k,l \) with \( i \neq k \), \( j \neq l \), the intersections \( f_i \cap f_j \) and \( f_k \cap f_l \) cannot both be nonempty.

Since each \( f_i \) is mutually disjoint, the first condition ensures disjointness of the \( f_i \). The tricky part is about intersections of different pairs, implying no two distinct pairs of subsets share a common element in their intersections at the same time. Given that \( f_i \cap f_j = \emptyset \) for \( i \neq j \), the intersection condition simplifies, so the problem is subtle.

I'll try to enumerate families of sets for varying \( n \) and print any successful construction or partial info.

```python
from itertools import combinations
from math import comb

def bitmask_from_subset(subset):
    bm = 0
    for x in subset:
        bm |= 1 << x
    return bm

def count_bits(x):
    return bin(x).count('1')

def disjoint(a, b):
    return (a & b) == 0

# For given n, try to find 8 pairwise disjoint subsets of size 6
def find_families(n):
    universe = range(n)
    six_subsets = [bitmask_from_subset(c) for c in combinations(universe,6)]
    # We'll try to find 8 pairwise disjoint subsets from six_subsets
    # Efficient pruning by backtracking
    found = []

    def backtrack(start, chosen):
        if len(chosen) == 8:
            # Check intersection property:
            # Since sets are disjoint, f_i ∩ f_j = empty for i≠j
            # Then (f_i ∩ f_j).Nonempty is False, so condition always holds
            print(f"Found family with n={n}:")
            for i,s in enumerate(chosen):
                elems = [j for j in range(n) if (s & (1 << j))]
                print(f" f[{i}] = {elems}")
            found.append(list(chosen))
            return True  # Found at least one family
        for i in range(start, len(six_subsets)):
            s = six_subsets[i]
            if all(disjoint(s, c) for c in chosen):
                if backtrack(i+1, chosen+[s]):
                    return True  # Stop after first found to reduce output
        return False

    backtrack(0, [])
    return len(found) > 0

# We'll try values of n from 30 up to 48 (6*8)
for n in range(30, 49):
    print(f"Trying n={n}...")
    if find_families(n):
        print(f"Minimum n found: {n}")
        break
```

The code tests \( n \) from 30 to 48, attempting to find 8 disjoint subsets of size 6. Since the second condition imposes additional constraints that become trivial if subsets are disjoint, this enumeration should identify the minimal \( n \).

Note: Computation may be heavy for large \( n \) but the output and token limit restrict full search. The printed families when found help conjecture the minimal \( n \).
