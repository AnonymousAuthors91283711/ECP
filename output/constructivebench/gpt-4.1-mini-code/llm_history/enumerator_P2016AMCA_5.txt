[write_program]
The problem involves even integers \( n > 2 \) which cannot be expressed as the sum of two primes. This relates to the Goldbach conjecture, which states all even integers greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes. It is unproven, so the problem is about enumerating exceptions (if any) up to some threshold.

The program will:
- Iterate over even numbers \( n > 2 \).
- For each \( n \), try all prime pairs \( p \leq n/2 \) to check if \( p + q = n \) for prime \( q = n - p \).
- Print out such \( n \) for which no such prime pair exists (possible counterexamples to Goldbach).
- Use a small threshold for enumeration, say up to 100, to keep the output short.

This process can help conjecture the set \( P2016AMCA_5\_answer \).

```python
# Enumerate even integers n > 2 up to 100 and check if they can be expressed as sum of two primes
def is_prime(x):
    if x < 2:
        return False
    if x == 2:
        return True
    if x % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(x**0.5)+1, 2):
        if x % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

print("Checking even n > 2 up to 100 for no prime sum representation:")
for n in range(4, 101, 2):
    can_be_expressed = False
    for p in range(2, n//2 + 1):
        if is_prime(p) and is_prime(n - p):
            can_be_expressed = True
            break
    if not can_be_expressed:
        print(f"n = {n} cannot be expressed as sum of two primes")

print("Enumeration done. No such n found up to 100 indicates support for Goldbach conjecture in this range.")
```
