[write_program]
This problem asks for the smallest positive real number \( n \) such that

\[
n + \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor + \lfloor n^{1/3} \rfloor = 2014.
\]

Since the floor terms depend on \(\sqrt{n}\) and \(\sqrt[3]{n}\), the problem reduces to checking integers \(n\) around 2014, as the floor expressions add nontrivially.

We write a Python program to try integers \( n \) from roughly 1900 to 2100 and print \( n \) whenever the equation holds. This helps narrow down the solution and conjecture the minimal \( n \).

```python
# Enumerate integers n around 2014 to find solutions to:
# n + floor(sqrt(n)) + floor(n^(1/3)) = 2014
# Print all n that satisfy the equation.

from math import sqrt, floor

target = 2014

# The sum n + floor(sqrt(n)) + floor(n^(1/3)) >= n, so n <= target
# We start from max(1, target - 50) up to target since floor terms are small compared to n.
start = max(1, target - 50)
end = target

for n in range(start, end + 1):
    s = n + floor(sqrt(n)) + floor(n ** (1/3))
    if s == target:
        print(f"n = {n}, sum = {s}")

# After enumerating candidates, print the minimal n found, if any.
# If no solution found, indicate so.

solutions = [n for n in range(start, end + 1) if n + floor(sqrt(n)) + floor(n ** (1/3)) == target]
if solutions:
    print(f"Minimal n found: {min(solutions)}")
else:
    print("No solution found in range.")
```
