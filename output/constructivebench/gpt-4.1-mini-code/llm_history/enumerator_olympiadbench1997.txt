The problem concerns a finite set \( S \subset \mathbb{R} \) with \( n \) elements such that each element \( x \in S \) can be expressed as a sum of exactly \( k \) distinct other elements from \( S \setminus \{x\} \).

Our goal is to enumerate values of \( n \) and \( k \) for small ranges (e.g. k=2 or 3, n up to some manageable number), and find such sets \( S \), then conjecture the function \( \text{olympiadbench1997\_answer}(k) \).

We proceed by:
- Choosing small \( k \ge 2 \),
- For each \( k \), trying \( n \) from \( k+1 \) up to some limit,
- Testing if there exists a finite set \( S \subset \mathbb{R} \) with cardinality \( n \) satisfying the condition that for every \( x \in S \), there is a \( k \)-subset of \( S \setminus \{x\} \) summing to \( x \).

We try the minimal examples by trial-and-error:
- Use integer sets for simplicity and to get exact values,
- Enumerate candidate sets \( S \) in increasing order or chosen pattern,
- For each \( x \in S \), check all \( k \)-subsets of \( S \setminus \{x\} \), sum them, and see if \( x \) equals any such sum.

Due to complexity, we limit ourselves to small parameters \( k = 2,3 \) and focus on \( n \) values up to about 7.

Below is a Python enumerator implementing this logic.

```python
from itertools import combinations

def check_set(S, k):
    # S: sorted list of distinct integers
    # For each x in S, check if exists T âŠ† S\{x}, |T|=k, sum(T)==x
    # Return True if condition holds for all x, else False
    for x in S:
        found = False
        others = [y for y in S if y != x]
        for T in combinations(others, k):
            if sum(T) == x:
                found = True
                break
        if not found:
            return False
    return True

def try_sets(n, k, search_range=range(-10, 11)):
    # Generate all combinations of 'n' distinct integers within search_range
    # to find sets S satisfying condition.
    # To limit output, only proceed while printing found solutions.
    from itertools import combinations
    vals = list(search_range)
    count_found = 0
    # Using ascending order to reduce duplicates
    for S in combinations(vals, n):
        if check_set(S, k):
            print(f"k={k} n={n} set={S}")
            count_found +=1
            if count_found > 5:  # avoid too much output per parameters
                break
    return count_found>0

def main():
    # We try k=2 and 3, n from k+1 up to 7 or 8
    for k in [2,3]:
        print(f"=== Trying k={k} ===")
        for n in range(k+1,8):
            found = try_sets(n,k)
            if found:
                print(f"Found example sets for k={k}, n={n}")
            else:
                print(f"No example sets for k={k}, n={n}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code prints any example sets \( S \) found. From the printed sets, one may conjecture the minimal \( n \) for given \( k \) such that the condition holds, i.e., \( \text{olympiadbench1997\_answer}(k) = n \).

This helps identify the values for unique \( n \) satisfying the problem condition.
