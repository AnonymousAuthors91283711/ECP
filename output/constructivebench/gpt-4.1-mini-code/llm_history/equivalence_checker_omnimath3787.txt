theorem omnimath3787 (a b c k : ℕ) :
  (a.Prime ∧ b.Prime ∧ c.Prime ∧ k > 0 ∧ a^2 + b^2 + 16 * c^2 = 9 * k^2 + 1) ↔

Ground Truth Answer: {(3, 3, 2, 3), (3, 37, 3, 13), (37, 3, 3, 13), (3, 17, 3, 7), (17, 3, 3, 7)}
Proposed Answer: {(a, b, c, k) | c = 3 ∧ a.Prime ∧ b.Prime ∧ k > 0 ∧ (a = 3 ∧ b = 17 ∨ a = 17 ∧ b = 3 ∨ a = 3 ∧ b = 37 ∨ a = 37 ∧ b = 3 ∨ a = 3 ∧ b = 3) ∧ a^2 + b^2 + 16 * 3^2 = 9 * k^2 + 1}
Let's analyze the two answers:

1. Ground Truth lists specific tuples that satisfy the condition:
   - (3,3,2,3)
   - (3,37,3,13)
   - (37,3,3,13)
   - (3,17,3,7)
   - (17,3,3,7)

2. Proposed Answer describes a set with:
   - c must be 3
   - a and b must be prime
   - k > 0
   - a and b must be in specific combinations (3,17), (17,3), (3,37), (37,3), or (3,3)
   - The equation must hold with c=3

The problems:
1. The ground truth includes (3,3,2,3) where c=2, but proposed answer requires c=3
2. The proposed answer misses the case where c=2 (the (3,3,2,3) case)
3. The proposed answer correctly captures all cases where c=3

Therefore, the proposed answer is partially correct but misses some cases.
