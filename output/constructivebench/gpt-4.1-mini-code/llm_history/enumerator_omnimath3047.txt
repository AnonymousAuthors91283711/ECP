The problem describes a round-robin arrangement of 3 players (Alvin, Bingyi, Cheska) playing a total of 60 games equally divided into 3 pairs. It provides win percentages in each pair and asks for the total wins of Bingyi. We want to enumerate the exact number of wins Bingyi can have given these percentages.

```python
# Enumerate Bingyi's total wins from the given percentages and total games
total_games = 60
pairs = 3
games_per_pair = total_games // pairs  # 20 games per pair

# Win count per pair (integer calculation, ensuring exact win counts)
alvin_wins_ab = games_per_pair * 20 // 100
bingyi_wins_bc = games_per_pair * 60 // 100
cheska_wins_ca = games_per_pair * 40 // 100

# Bingyi's wins:
# From Alvin-Bingyi pair, Bingyi wins = total games between them - Alvin's wins
bingyi_wins_ab = games_per_pair - alvin_wins_ab
# From Bingyi-Cheska pair, Bingyi wins as given
bingyi_wins_bc = bingyi_wins_bc
# From Cheska-Alvin pair, Bingyi is not involved, so wins = 0
# To verify, redsigning naming:
# bingyi_wins = bingyi_wins_ab + bingyi_wins_bc + cheska_alvin - cheska_wins_ca
# cheska_alvin = games_per_pair
# cheska_wins_ca = given, so Alvin wins = games_per_pair - cheska_wins_ca
# But Bingyi is not in this pair, so Bingyi wins from this pair = 0

# Total Bingyi wins:
bingyi_wins = bingyi_wins_ab + bingyi_wins_bc + (games_per_pair - cheska_wins_ca)

print("Alvin-Bingyi total games:", games_per_pair)
print("Alvin wins vs Bingyi:", alvin_wins_ab)
print("Bingyi wins vs Alvin:", bingyi_wins_ab)
print("Bingyi wins vs Cheska:", bingyi_wins_bc)
print("Cheska wins vs Alvin:", cheska_wins_ca)
print("Alvin wins vs Cheska:", games_per_pair - cheska_wins_ca)
print("Total Bingyi wins:", bingyi_wins)
```
