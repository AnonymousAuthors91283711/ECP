The problem involves a finite set \( S \subseteq \mathbb{N} \) and conditions on the maximum \( \max S \) and minimum \( \min S \) values and averages of subsets with those removed. We want to find the average of all elements in \( S \).

The constraints are:
- \( \max S = \min S + 72 \)
- Average without max: 32
- Average without max & min: 35
- Average without min: 40

We'll try small set sizes (cardinalities) \( n \) from 3 upwards (since removing two elements must still leave elements), solve linear equations for sums and sums-of-remaining elements, and print candidate averages, searching for rational values satisfying all conditions.

```python
# Enumerate possible answers to the average of S given conditions from the 2021 AMC B problem 12
from fractions import Fraction

def try_cardinality(n):
    # n = |S| >= 3 (to remove two elements)
    # Let minS = m, maxS = m+72
    # Sum(S) = total
    # Sum(S\{max}) = total - (m+72)
    # Sum(S\{min}) = total - m
    # Sum(S\{min,max}) = total - m - (m+72) = total - 2m - 72

    # Equations from averages:
    # (total - (m+72)) / (n-1) = 32 => total - m -72 = 32*(n-1)
    # (total - 2m - 72) / (n-2) = 35 => total - 2m -72 = 35*(n-2)
    # (total - m) / (n-1) = 40 => total - m = 40*(n-1)

    # From first and third:
    # total - m - 72 = 32*(n-1)
    # total - m = 40*(n-1)
    # Subtracting: (total - m) - (total - m -72) = 40*(n-1) - 32*(n-1)
    # 72 = 8*(n-1) => n-1 = 9 => n=10

    n = 10
    # total - m -72 = 32*9=288 => total - m = 360
    # total - m = 40*(9) =360 check consistent

    # From second:
    # total - 2m -72 = 35*(8) = 280
    # Using total - m =360 => total = 360 + m
    # Substitute total:
    # 360 + m - 2m -72 =280
    # 360 -72 + m - 2m =280
    # 288 - m =280 => m=8

    m=8
    total = 360 + m # =368

    # Average of S:
    average = Fraction(total, n)
    print(f"With n={n}, min={m}, max={m+72}, sum={total}, average={average}")
    return average

def main():
    # Since n=10 deduced, just output that
    avg = try_cardinality(10)
    print("Answer: average =", avg)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
