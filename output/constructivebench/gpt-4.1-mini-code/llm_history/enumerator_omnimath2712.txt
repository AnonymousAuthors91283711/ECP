The problem asks for positive integers \(x, y\) such that \(3^x \times 5^y = 225\) and then for the value of \(x + y\). Since \(225 = 15^2 = 3^2 \times 5^2\), \(x\) and \(y\) must satisfy \(3^x = 3^2\) and \(5^y = 5^2\). So \(x=2, y=2\) and \(x + y = 4\). The program below tries small positive \(x,y\) pairs and prints those satisfying the equation and their sums.

```python
# Enumerate positive integers x,y such that 3^x * 5^y = 225 and print x,y,x+y.

target = 225

for x in range(1, 10):
    for y in range(1, 10):
        prod = 3**x * 5**y
        if prod == target:
            print(f"x={x}, y={y}, x+y={x + y}")
```
