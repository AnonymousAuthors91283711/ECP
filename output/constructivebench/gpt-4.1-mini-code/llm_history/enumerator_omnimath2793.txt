The problem involves real numbers \(a\), \(b\) with \(a \neq b\), satisfying \(\frac{a + b}{a - b} = 3\), and asks to find the value of \(\frac{a}{b}\).

From the equation:

\[
\frac{a + b}{a - b} = 3
\]

Cross-multiplying:

\[
a + b = 3(a - b) \implies a + b = 3a - 3b
\]

Rearranging:

\[
a + b - 3a + 3b = 0 \implies -2a + 4b = 0 \implies 4b = 2a \implies 2b = a
\]

So \(a = 2b\).

Then:

\[
\frac{a}{b} = \frac{2b}{b} = 2
\]

We can confirm this by enumerating for sample \(a, b\) values satisfying the condition and printing candidates for \(a/b\), confirming the exact value 2 is the unique solution.

```python
# Enumerate possible real values a, b satisfying (a + b) / (a - b) = 3 with a != b
# and print corresponding a/b values to identify the answer.

# Since the equation is strict, we can pick sample b and solve for a.

def main():
    print("Enumerating for various b values:")

    for b in [1, -1, 2, -2, 0.5, -0.5]:
        if b == 0:
            continue  # avoid dividing by zero
        # From (a + b) / (a - b) = 3:
        # (a + b) = 3(a - b) => a + b = 3a -3b => -2a = -4b => a = 2b
        a = 2 * b
        if a == b:
            # a != b condition
            continue
        val = a / b
        print(f"b = {b}, a = {a}, a/b = {val}")

    print("Conclusion: a/b = 2 for all valid (a,b).")

    main()
