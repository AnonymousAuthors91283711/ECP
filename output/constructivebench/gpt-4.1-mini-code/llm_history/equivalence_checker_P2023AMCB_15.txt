Ground Truth Answer: True
Proposed Answer: ∀ (a b c : ℕ), 0 < a → 0 < b → 0 < c → 15 * a + 14 * b = c → (Nat.gcd c 210 = 1 ↔ Nat.gcd a 14 = 1 ∧ Nat.gcd b 15 = 1)
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer captures the main equivalence (Nat.gcd c 210 = 1 ↔ Nat.gcd a 14 = 1 ∧ Nat.gcd b 15 = 1) which is the most substantial part of the ground truth answer. However, it omits the two additional implications present in the ground truth:
1. (¬ (Nat.gcd a 14 = 1 ∨ Nat.gcd b 15 = 1) → ¬ Nat.gcd c 210 = 1)
2. (Nat.gcd c 210 = 1 → (Nat.gcd a 14 = 1 ∨ Nat.gcd b 15 = 1))

While these omitted implications are actually consequences of the main equivalence, they're explicitly stated in the ground truth answer. Therefore, the proposed answer is mostly correct but incomplete.
