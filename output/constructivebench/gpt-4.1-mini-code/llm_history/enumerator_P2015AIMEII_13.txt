The problem involves summing sine values over integers and counting how many partial sums are negative up to a certain index, with the goal of finding a threshold index where the count of negative sums reaches 100. We'll enumerate values of n and compute the partial sums to find where the count of negative sums hits 100 for the first time.

```python
import math

def main():
    # We will compute partial sums of sin(k) for k=1 to n,
    # count how many sums are negative, and look for when this count reaches 100.
    count_neg = 0
    n = 0
    # Store encountered results for inspection, capped at some max n for brevity
    max_n = 300  
    while n < max_n:
        n += 1
        partial_sum = sum(math.sin(k) for k in range(1, n+1))
        if partial_sum < 0:
            count_neg += 1
            print(f"n={n}, partial_sum={partial_sum:.6f} < 0, count_neg={count_neg}")
        else:
            print(f"n={n}, partial_sum={partial_sum:.6f} >= 0, count_neg={count_neg}")
        if count_neg == 100:
            print(f"Reached 100 negative partial sums at n={n}")
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This program enumerates n, computes partial sums of sin(k), counts negative sums and prints each step until the count of negative partial sums hits 100. This supports conjecturing the minimal n with exactly 100 negative partial sums.
