The proposed answer is a set comprehension that exactly matches the conditions given in the problem statement, while the ground truth answer provides explicit solutions that satisfy these conditions. The proposed answer is correct in terms of the mathematical formulation, but it doesn't explicitly list the solutions like the ground truth does. The two answers are equivalent in meaning but differ in presentation.
