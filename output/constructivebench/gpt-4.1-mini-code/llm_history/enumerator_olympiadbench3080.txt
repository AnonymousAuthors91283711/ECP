[write_program]
This problem involves finding natural numbers \(X,Y,Z\) less than some bound \(N\) (called olympiadbench3080_answer) such that a polynomial identity holds. We want to enumerate values of \(N\), then for each, try to find \(X,Y,Z < N\) satisfying:

\[
(2N^{2} + 5N + 3)(3N^{2} + 4N + 1) = 7N^{4} + 4N^{3} + X N^{2} + Y N + Z
\]

For each \(N\), we can expand the LHS exactly, then match coefficients on powers of \(N\) on RHS to identify possible \(X,Y,Z\). We print such triples that satisfy this with all values less than \(N\). We'll start from small \(N\), say 1 to 20, to keep outputs manageable and stop if found.

```python
# Enumerate N from 1 to 20
for N in range(1, 21):
    # Expand LHS: (2N^2+5N+3)(3N^2+4N+1)
    # = 2N^2*3N^2 + 2N^2*4N + 2N^2*1 + 5N*3N^2 + 5N*4N + 5N*1 + 3*3N^2 +3*4N +3*1
    # = 6N^4 + 8N^3 + 2N^2 +15N^3 +20N^2 +5N +9N^2 +12N +3
    # Summing terms by degree:
    # N^4: 6
    # N^3: 8 + 15 = 23
    # N^2: 2 + 20 + 9 = 31
    # N^1: 5 +12 =17
    # constant: 3
    lhs_coeffs = {4:6, 3:23, 2:31, 1:17, 0:3}

    # RHS: 7N^4 +4N^3 + X*N^2 + Y*N + Z
    # Coeff comparison:
    # 7N^4 = lhs_coeffs[4] => 7 = 6? No
    # So we want to find X,Y,Z with:
    # 7N^4 + 4N^3 + X*N^2 + Y*N + Z = lhs

    # Equate coefficients:
    # 7 == 6? No, so rearrange:
    # Move all but X,Y,Z to LHS:
    # lhs_coeffs[4]-7 = 6-7 = -1
    # lhs_coeffs[3]-4 = 23-4=19
    # So we have:
    # -1 N^4 +19 N^3 + 31 N^2 +17 N +3 = X N^2 + Y N + Z
    # But N^4 and N^3 terms cannot appear in RHS beyond 7N^4 +4N^3
    # So these terms must vanish for identity.
    # Hence no identity unless the problem allows X,Y,Z to 'absorb' all lower terms only.
    # So likely the problem wants the RHS to equal LHS exactly, in which case no solution unless N and X,Y,Z chosen well.

    # Instead, let's just compute
    val_lhs = (2*N**2 +5*N +3)*(3*N**2 +4*N +1)
    val_rhs_partial = 7*N**4 + 4*N**3

    # Required:
    # X*N**2 + Y*N + Z = val_lhs - val_rhs_partial
    diff = val_lhs - val_rhs_partial

    # Try all X,Y,Z < N with X*N**2 + Y*N + Z = diff
    # Max X = N-1, similarly for Y,Z
    found_any = False
    for X in range(N):
        for Y in range(N):
            Z_term = diff - X*N**2 - Y*N
            if 0 <= Z_term < N:
                found_any = True
                print(f"N={N} X={X} Y={Y} Z={Z_term}")
    if found_any:
        print(f"=== For N={N}, candidates as above ===")
```
This program enumerates all \(N\) from 1 to 20, and for each finds all triples \(X,Y,Z < N\) satisfying the polynomial identity. The printed output can help conjecture the minimal \(N\) and corresponding \(X,Y,Z\).
