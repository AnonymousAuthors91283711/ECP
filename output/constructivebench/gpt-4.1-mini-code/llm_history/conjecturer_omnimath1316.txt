abbrev omnimath1316_answer : ℤ := sorry
theorem omnimath1316 (p : ℤ[X]) (hp : p = X^3 + X^2 - 333 * X - 1001) (a b c : ℂ) 
  (hroots : (p.map (algebraMap ℤ ℂ)).roots = {a, b, c}) :
  a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = omnimath1316_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Sum of roots s1 = -1
Sum of products s2 = -333
Product of roots s3 = 1001
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 2003. Expected Answer Type: ℤ
<<<2003>>>
