The problem involves analyzing the ratio of certain "odd configurations" of dots to the total number of dots, where the dots are enumerated as 1 + 2 + ... + 6 = 21. The odd configurations seem to be particular weighted sums of these dots with weights 0 or 1 alternated.

We will enumerate the total dots and compute these two sums explicitly and print their ratio as a fraction.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# total dots: sum of 1 to 6
total_dots = sum(range(1, 7))
print(f"Total dots: {total_dots}")

# Odd configurations appear to be sums of some weighted dots:
# First sum: 1*0 + 2*1 + 3*0 + 4*1 + 5*0 + 6*1
sum1 = 1*0 + 2*1 + 3*0 + 4*1 + 5*0 + 6*1
print(f"Odd config 1 sum: {sum1}")

# Second sum: 1*1 + 2*0 + 3*1 + 4*0 + 5*1 + 6*0
sum2 = 1*1 + 2*0 + 3*1 + 4*0 + 5*1 + 6*0
print(f"Odd config 2 sum: {sum2}")

odd_configs = sum1 + sum2
print(f"Total odd configs sum: {odd_configs}")

# Compute the fraction odd_configs / total_dots exactly
ratio = Fraction(odd_configs, total_dots)
print(f"Ratio (odd_configs / total_dots) = {ratio} = {float(ratio):.6f}")
```
