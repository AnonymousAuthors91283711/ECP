abbrev omnimath4180_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath4180 (m : ℕ) (hm : 2 ≤ m) :
  (∀ n, m / 3 ≤ n → n ≤ m / 2 → (m - 2 * n) ∣ choose n (m - 2 * n)) ↔ m ∈ omnimath4180_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Checking m in [2..60]
m = 3 satisfies the divisibility condition for all valid n
m = 5 satisfies the divisibility condition for all valid n
m = 7 satisfies the divisibility condition for all valid n
Smallest such m: 3
Largest such m: 7. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
<<<{3, 5, 7}>>>
