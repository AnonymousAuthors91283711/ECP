The problem involves the sequence defined by
\[
a_0 = 1, \quad a_1 = 2^{1/19}, \quad a_{n+2} = a_{n+1} \cdot (a_n)^2,
\]
and the goal is to find the smallest positive integer \( k \) such that the product
\[
\prod_{i=1}^k a_i
\]
is an integer.

The program below computes the terms \( a_n \) symbolically in the form \( 2^{x_n} \) because each term is a power of 2 raised to some rational exponent. Then it computes the exponent of the product \(\sum_{i=1}^k x_i\) and checks for integrality by verifying if the total exponent is an integer. We print all candidates \( k \) where this happens up to some limit, then conclude with the minimum found.

```python
# Enumerate k to find smallest k with integer product of a_1...a_k
# a_0 = 1 = 2^0
# a_1 = 2^(1/19)
# a_{n+2} = a_{n+1} * (a_n)^2 = 2^{x_{n+1}} * 2^{2 x_n} = 2^{x_{n+1} + 2 x_n}
# We track x_n exponents as rationals.

from fractions import Fraction

def main():
    # Initialize exponents x_0, x_1
    x = [Fraction(0,1), Fraction(1,19)]
    max_k = 50  # search upper limit
    found_ks = []

    # Compute exponents using recurrence: x_{n+2} = x_{n+1} + 2*x_n
    for n in range(max_k + 2):
        if n+2 >= len(x):
            x.append(x[n+1] + 2*x[n])

    # Check for each k >=1 if sum_{i=1}^k x_i is integer
    for k in range(1, max_k+1):
        total_exp = sum(x[1:k+1], Fraction(0,1))
        if total_exp.denominator == 1:
            print(f"Integer product found for k={k}, total exponent sum={total_exp}")
            found_ks.append(k)

    if found_ks:
        smallest_k = min(found_ks)
        print(f"Smallest k with integer product: {smallest_k}")
    else:
        print("No integer product found up to k =", max_k)
