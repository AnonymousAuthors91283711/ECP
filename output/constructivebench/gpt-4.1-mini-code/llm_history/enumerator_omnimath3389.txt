This problem involves analyzing the sum involving powers of sine and products of cosine squares with geometric-style indices. We'll numerically enumerate the value of the sum for various small values of \(x\) (avoiding \(x\) where \(\sin x = 0\)) and check the partial sums to conjecture the closed form \( \text{omnimath3389_answer}(x) \).

We'll:
- Try a few rational multiples of \(\pi\) where \(\sin x \neq 0\).
- Evaluate the sum for \(n=2010\).
- Print the sum and the closed form conjectured partial sums for the initial terms to cross-check.

```python
import math

def partial_sum(x, n):
    # Computes sum_{k=0}^n (sin(2^k x))^2 * product_{m=0}^{k-1} (cos(2^m x))^2
    # product for k=0 is 1 since empty product
    s = 0.0
    prod = 1.0
    for k in range(n+1):
        term = (math.sin(2**k * x))**2 * prod
        s += term
        # Update prod for next k: prod *= (cos(2^k x))^2
        prod *= (math.cos(2**k * x))**2
    return s

def closed_form_rhs(x, n):
    # From theorem:
    # 1 - (sin(2^(n+1) * x))^2 / (4^(n+1) * (sin x)^2)
    snp1 = math.sin(2**(n+1)*x)
    denom = 4**(n+1) * (math.sin(x))**2
    return 1 - (snp1**2) / denom


# Select sample x values in (0, pi), avoiding sin x = 0
sample_xs = [math.pi/6, math.pi/4, math.pi/3, math.pi/5]

n = 2010

for x in sample_xs:
    print(f"x = {x:.6f}, sin(x) = {math.sin(x):.6f}")
    psum = partial_sum(x, n)
    rhs = closed_form_rhs(x, n)
    print(f"partial_sum({n}) = {psum:.15f}")
    print(f"1 - (sin(2^{n+1} * x))^2 / (4^{n+1} * (sin x)^2) = {rhs:.15f}")
    print(f"Difference = {abs(psum - rhs):.3e}")
    print("---")

# Also print first few partial sums and closed form results for n=0..5 for one x to see the pattern
x = math.pi/4
print(f"Checking initial terms for x = {x:.6f}")

for n_small in range(6):
    psum = partial_sum(x, n_small)
    rhs = closed_form_rhs(x, n_small)
    print(f"n={n_small}: partial_sum = {psum:.15f}, rhs = {rhs:.15f}, diff = {abs(psum - rhs):.3e}")
```
This program helps conjecture the formula given in the problem is true for various values of \(x\), and the formula for the sum matches the closed form.
