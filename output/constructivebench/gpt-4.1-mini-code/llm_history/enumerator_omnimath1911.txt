The problem involves comparing the cardinalities of two sets related to symmetric pairs over a set \( S = \{1, \dots, 6\} \). We want to understand the difference between:

- \( A = |\text{Sym}^2(S \times S)| \): the set of unordered pairs of pairs from \( S \times S \)
- \( B = |\text{Sym}^2(S) \times \text{Sym}^2(S)| \): the Cartesian product of unordered pairs from \( S \) with itself

We enumerate the values to conjecture \( A - B \).

```python
from math import comb

def sym2_card(n):
    # Number of symmetric pairs (unordered pairs with possible repeats) from a set of size n
    return comb(n + 1, 2)

def main():
    S = list(range(1, 7))
    n = len(S)
    n2 = n * n

    # A = number of unordered pairs from S x S
    # Size of SxS = n^2
    A = comb(n2 + 1, 2)
    print(f"A = |Sym2(SxS)| = C({n2}+1, 2) = {A}")

    # B = number of pairs (unordered pair of S) x (unordered pair of S)
    sym2_S = sym2_card(n)
    B = sym2_S * sym2_S
    print(f"B = |Sym2(S)|^2 = {sym2_S}^2 = {B}")

    diff = A - B
    print(f"A - B = {diff}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
