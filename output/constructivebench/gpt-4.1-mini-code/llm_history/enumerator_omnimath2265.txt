The problem asks to find unique digits AB = (A, B) with A, B â‰¤ 9 such that:

\[
(1001 A + 110 B)^2 = 57108249,
\]

and then find the number \(10A + B\).

We can iterate over all digits A, B from 0 to 9, compute \((1001 A + 110 B)^2\), and check if it equals 57108249. When a match is found, print \(10A + B\). Since it states uniqueness, we will also print how many matches found.

```python
target = 57108249
solutions = []

for A in range(10):
    for B in range(10):
        val = 1001 * A + 110 * B
        if val * val == target:
            ans = 10 * A + B
            solutions.append(ans)
            print(f"A={A}, B={B}, Number={ans}")

print(f"Total solutions found: {len(solutions)}")
if solutions:
    print(f"Unique answer: {solutions[0]}")
```
