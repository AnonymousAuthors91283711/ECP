The problem is to find coprime integers \(m, n\) such that 
\[
\prod_{i=0}^6 \left(1 - \frac{1}{i+2}\right) = \frac{m}{n}
\]
and
\[
100m + n = 108.
\]

Let's write a program to:
- compute the product exactly as a fraction for \(i=0,\dots,6\),
- find numerator \(m\) and denominator \(n\) in lowest terms,
- check candidates \(m,n\) with \(100m + n = 108\),
- print all coprime pairs that match the product fraction,
- then print the pair satisfying the linear condition.

```python
from math import gcd
from fractions import Fraction

# Compute the product exactly as a fraction:
prod = Fraction(1,1)
for i in range(7):
    prod *= (1 - Fraction(1, i+2))

m, n = prod.numerator, prod.denominator

print(f"Product fraction: {m}/{n}")

# Find all pairs (m, n) coprime with that fraction that satisfy 100*m + n = 108
# Since m, n are fixed by the fraction, check if 100*m + n == 108
# If not, try scaling fraction by k to see if the linear equation can hold with multiples

# k must be integer, so check small k to keep output concise
for k in range(1, 20):
    M = m * k
    N = n * k
    if gcd(M, N) == 1:
        total = 100 * M + N
        print(f"Testing k={k}: m={M}, n={N}, 100*m+n={total}")
        if total == 108:
            print(f"Answer: m={M}, n={N}")
            break
```

This will enumerate candidates and print the true answer once found.
