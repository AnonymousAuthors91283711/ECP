  Odd (omnimath3405_answer x) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun x => 7 * x + 4
Proposed Answer: fun x : ℤ => x
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem asks for a function f: ℤ → ℤ such that when 3x+1 is even, f(x) must be odd.

2. Ground truth answer is f(x) = 7x + 4:
   - Let's test: if 3x+1 is even, then x must be odd (since 3*odd+1=even, 3*even+1=odd)
   - For odd x, 7x is odd (7*odd=odd), plus 4 makes it odd (odd+even=odd)
   - This satisfies the condition

3. Proposed answer is f(x) = x:
   - If x is odd (when 3x+1 is even), then f(x) = x is odd
   - This actually satisfies the condition too!

Both functions satisfy the requirement that when 3x+1 is even (which implies x is odd), the output is odd. The proposed answer is simpler but equally valid.
