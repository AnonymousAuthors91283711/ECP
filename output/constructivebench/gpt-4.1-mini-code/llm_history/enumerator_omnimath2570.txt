This problem asks for the sum of the squares of the first 50 odd numbers modulo 1000. To assist in conjecturing the answer, we'll enumerate the sum of (2k+1)^2 for k=0 to 49, printing the running total modulo 1000 as we go.

```python
# Enumerate sum of squares of first 50 odd numbers modulo 1000
# sum_{k=0}^{49} (2k+1)^2 mod 1000

def main():
    total = 0
    print("k, (2k+1)^2, running_sum mod 1000")
    for k in range(50):
        val = (2*k + 1)**2
        total += val
        mod_total = total % 1000
        print(f"{k}, {val}, {mod_total}")
    print(f"Final answer: {mod_total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
