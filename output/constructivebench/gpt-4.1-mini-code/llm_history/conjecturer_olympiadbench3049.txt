theorem olympiadbench3049 :
  IsLeast {s : ℕ | ∃ (x y : ℕ), 20 * x + 80 * y = s ∧ (x + y > 0) ∧ s / (x + y) = 34} olympiadbench3049_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found candidate: s=1020 with x=23, y=7, average=34
Found candidate: s=2040 with x=46, y=14, average=34
Minimum s with average 34: 1020. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<1020>>>
