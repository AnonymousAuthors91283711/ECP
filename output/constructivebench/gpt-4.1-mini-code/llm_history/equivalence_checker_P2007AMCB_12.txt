Ground Truth Answer: fun totalStudents seniorsAvg overallAvg => 
    (overallAvg * totalStudents - seniorsAvg * (9 * totalStudents / 10)) / (totalStudents / 10)
Proposed Answer: fun totalStudents seniorsAvg overallAvg => 
  overallAvg * totalStudents / (totalStudents - 9 * totalStudents / 10) - 9 * seniorsAvg
Let's analyze the two answers carefully.

1. Ground Truth Answer:
- Computes the total points from all students (overallAvg * totalStudents)
- Subtracts the points from seniors (seniorsAvg * (9*totalStudents/10))
- Divides the remaining points by number of juniors (totalStudents/10)

2. Proposed Answer:
- First term computes overallAvg divided by fraction of juniors (totalStudents - 9*totalStudents/10)
- Second term subtracts 9*seniorsAvg

Let's algebraically manipulate the proposed answer to see if it matches the ground truth:

Proposed = overallAvg*totalStudents/(totalStudents/10) - 9*seniorsAvg
          = 10*overallAvg - 9*seniorsAvg

Ground Truth = (overallAvg*totalStudents - 9/10*seniorsAvg*totalStudents)/(totalStudents/10)
             = (overallAvg - 9/10*seniorsAvg)*totalStudents/(totalStudents/10)
             = (overallAvg - 9/10*seniorsAvg)*10
             = 10*overallAvg - 9*seniorsAvg

The two expressions are algebraically equivalent.
