theorem olympiadbench2445 (x y : ℝ) (hx : x > 0) (hy : y > 0) :
  logb 10 (x^3) + logb 10 (y^2) = 11 ∧ logb 10 (x^2) - logb 10 (y^3) = 3 ↔ (x, y) = olympiadbench2445_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Computed exact solution:
x = 10^3 = 1000
y = 10^1 = 10
Check eq1 (should be 11): 11
Check eq2 (should be 3): 3
log10(x^3) + log10(y^2) = 11.0
log10(x^2) - log10(y^3) = 3.0
. Expected Answer Type: ℝ × ℝ
<<<(10^3, 10^1)>>>
