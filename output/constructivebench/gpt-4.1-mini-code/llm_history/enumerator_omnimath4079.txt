The problem is to find all triples of natural numbers \((x,y,z)\) such that \(2^x + 9 \cdot 7^y = z^3\).

A straightforward approach is to enumerate small values for \(x\) and \(y\), compute \(2^x + 9 \cdot 7^y\), and check whether it is a perfect cube \(z^3\).

We'll print out each triple found immediately and then print all triples found in a certain search range to conjecture the exact set. We'll restrict \(x\) and \(y\) to small values (say up to 20) for efficiency.

```python
# Enumerate triples (x, y, z) with 0 <= x,y <= 20 and check if 2^x + 9*7^y = z^3

import math

max_exp = 20

def is_perfect_cube(n):
    if n < 0:
        return False
    root = round(n ** (1/3))
    return root**3 == n or (root+1)**3 == n or (root-1)**3 == n

results = []

for x in range(max_exp+1):
    pow2 = 2 ** x  # 2^x
    for y in range(max_exp+1):
        val = pow2 + 9 * (7 ** y)
        # Check if val is a perfect cube and get z
        root = round(val ** (1/3))
        candidates = [root-1, root, root+1]
        for z in candidates:
            if z >= 0 and z**3 == val:
                print(f"(x={x}, y={y}, z={z}) satisfies 2^{x} + 9*7^{y} = {z}^3 = {val}")
                results.append((x,y,z))

print("\nAll found triples:")
for triple in results:
    print(triple)
```
