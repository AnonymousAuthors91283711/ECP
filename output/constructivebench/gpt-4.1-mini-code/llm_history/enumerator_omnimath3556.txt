The problem asks for a natural number \( n \) between 100 and 1997 such that \( \frac{2^n + 2}{n} \) is an integer, and this \( n \) is unique in that range. To assist in conjecturing the solution, we enumerate all \( n \) in the range [100, 1997] where \( n \) divides \( 2^n + 2 \).

```python
# Enumerate n in [100,1997] where (2^n + 2) divisible by n.
# Print each candidate immediately.

def main():
    for n in range(100, 1998):
        # Check divisibility: (2^n + 2) % n == 0
        # Use pow with mod to handle large exponentiation efficiently.
        if (pow(2, n, n) + 2) % n == 0:
            print(f"Candidate n = {n}, (2^{n} + 2) divisible by {n}")
    # Note: pow(2,n,n) == 2^n mod n
    # So the condition simplifies to (2^n mod n + 2) mod n == 0

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
