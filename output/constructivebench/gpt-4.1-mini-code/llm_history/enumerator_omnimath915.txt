The problem involves sets \( S \subseteq \mathbb{N} \) satisfying a property \( P \) characterized by the existence of elements \( a < b < c \) with \( a, c \in S \) but \( b \notin S \). We want to understand the cardinality of the collection of all such sets \( S \).

To aid conjecture, I will enumerate small subsets of \(\{0,1,2,3\}\), check property \(P\), and print those satisfying it. This may help identify the pattern in the size of \(\{S \mid P(S)\}\). For enumeration, I consider subsets of \(\{0,\ldots,n-1\}\) for small \(n\).

```python
from itertools import chain, combinations

def powerset(iterable):
    # Generate all subsets of iterable
    s = list(iterable)
    return chain.from_iterable(combinations(s, r) for r in range(len(s)+1))

def has_property(S):
    # S is a set of natural numbers
    S_set = set(S)
    for b in S_set:
        if b not in S_set:
            continue
    # The property requires existence of a < b < c with a,c in S and b not in S
    # Check all triples a,b,c with a < b < c
    for a in S_set:
        for c in S_set:
            if a < c:
                for b in range(a+1, c):
                    if b not in S_set:
                        # Found a < b < c with a,c in S and b not in S
                        return True
    return False

def main():
    max_n = 5  # keep small to limit output size
    for n in range(1, max_n):
        print(f"Subsets of {{0,...,{n-1}}} satisfying P:")
        count = 0
        universe = list(range(n))
        for subset in powerset(universe):
            S = set(subset)
            if has_property(S):
                print(sorted(S))
                count += 1
        print(f"Total subsets satisfying P for n={n}: {count}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
