The problem asks to numerically approximate or exactly evaluate the triple integral:
\[
\int_0^1 \int_0^1 \int_0^1 \min(a, \min(b,c)) \, dc\, db\, da
\]

We want to enumerate values for the integral, possibly by discretization, to conjecture the exact value.

Since \(\min(a,b,c) = \min(a,\min(b,c))\), the integrand is symmetric in \(a,b,c\). We can sample over a grid of values in \([0,1]^3\), compute min(a,b,c), average over samples (which approximates the integral).

Printing partial sums and improved approximations after each refinement will help conjecture the answer.

```python
# Approximate the integral of min(a,b,c) over [0,1]^3 by discretization
# Enumerate values using a uniform grid with increasing resolution
# Print partial approximate results immediately

def approximate_integral(n):
    step = 1.0 / n
    total = 0.0
    for i in range(n):
        a = (i + 0.5) * step
        for j in range(n):
            b = (j + 0.5) * step
            for k in range(n):
                c = (k + 0.5) * step
                val = min(a, b, c)
                total += val
    volume = 1.0  # volume of integration cube
    return total * (step**3)


print("Estimating ∫_0^1∫_0^1∫_0^1 min(a,b,c) dcdcdbda")

# Enumerate for increasingly fine grids
for n in [2, 4, 8, 16]:
    approx = approximate_integral(n)
    print(f"n={n}, approximate integral = {approx:.6f}")

# From the pattern, conjecture the exact value:
# integral of min(a,b,c) over unit cube = 1/4 = 0.25

print("Conjectured exact value: 1/4 = 0.25")
```
