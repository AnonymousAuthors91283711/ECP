Ground Truth Answer: 1006
Proposed Answer: (2012 * 2013) / 2 % 2012
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem defines a recursive sequence where:
   - a(1) = 1
   - a(n+1) = (a(n) + (n+1)) mod 2012

2. The ground truth answer is 1006.

3. The proposed answer calculates (2012*2013)/2 mod 2012.

Let's evaluate the proposed answer:
- (2012*2013)/2 = 2012*(2013/2) = 2012*1006.5
- But since we're working with integers, this suggests the proposed answer is trying to calculate the sum 1+2+...+2012 mod 2012
- The sum 1+2+...+2012 = 2012*2013/2 = 2012*1006 + 1006
- Therefore mod 2012 gives 1006

The proposed answer's approach is correct in spirit but has two issues:
1. It doesn't account for the recursive nature of the sequence definition
2. The division by 2 in the mod space needs careful handling (though coincidentally works here)

However, the final numerical result matches the ground truth. The reasoning is different but the conclusion is correct.
