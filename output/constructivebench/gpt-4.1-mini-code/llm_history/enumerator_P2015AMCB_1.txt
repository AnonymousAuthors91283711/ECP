[write_program]
The problem appears to involve rational numbers and exponents, possibly from the 2015 American Mathematics Competitions B problem 1. The expression to evaluate is \( 2 - (-2)^{-2} \).

I'll write a Python program that calculates this expression exactly using Python's `fractions.Fraction` to keep exact rational values and prints the result.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Compute (-2)^-2 = 1/((-2)^2) = 1/4
base = Fraction(-2)
exponent = -2  # integer exponent

power = base ** exponent
# Calculate 2 - (-2)^-2 exactly
result = Fraction(2) - power

print("2 - (-2)^-2 =", result)
```
