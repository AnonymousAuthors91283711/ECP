  IsLeast {k : ℕ | Finset.sum (Finset.range k) (fun i => 2 * i + 1) = n} (P2004AMCB_8_answer n) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun n => Int.toNat ⌊(Real.sqrt (1 + 8 * n) - 1) / 2⌋
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => Nat.sqrt n
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest natural number k such that the sum of the first k odd numbers equals n (specifically when n=100). The sum of first k odd numbers is known to be k².

2. The ground truth answer correctly solves for k in the equation k² = n, giving k = √n. The expression (√(1+8n)-1)/2 is actually the solution for triangular numbers, not sums of odd numbers, so this appears incorrect.

3. The proposed answer Nat.sqrt n is exactly what we'd expect for solving k² = n, which is the correct solution for sums of odd numbers.

The ground truth answer seems to be solving the wrong equation (triangular numbers instead of sums of odd numbers), while the proposed answer correctly solves the actual problem.
