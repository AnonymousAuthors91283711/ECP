Ground Truth Answer: fun total dog cat turtle => min (min dog cat) turtle - (dog + cat + turtle - 2 * total)
Proposed Answer: fun total dog cat turtle => Nat.min dog (Nat.min cat turtle) - Nat.max 0 (dog + cat + turtle - 2 * total)
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer:

1. The first term (minimum of the three counts) is equivalent:
   - min (min dog cat) turtle = Nat.min dog (Nat.min cat turtle)

2. The second term differs:
   - Ground truth: (dog + cat + turtle - 2 * total)
   - Proposed: Nat.max 0 (dog + cat + turtle - 2 * total)

The difference is that the proposed answer ensures the result is non-negative by taking max with 0, while the ground truth allows negative values. However, in the context of set cardinalities (which are always non-negative), the proposed answer's approach is more correct.

The expressions are equivalent when (dog + cat + turtle - 2 * total) ≥ 0, but differ when it's negative. Since the problem deals with cardinalities, the proposed answer is actually more accurate.
