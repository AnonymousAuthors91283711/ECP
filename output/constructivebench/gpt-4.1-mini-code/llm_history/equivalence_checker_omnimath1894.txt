Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ c : ℝ, ∀ x, f x = c * x^2}
<<<Close>>>

The proposed answer suggests that the solutions are all quadratic functions of the form f(x) = c*x². While this is indeed a valid solution (you can verify it satisfies the functional equation), it might not be the complete solution set. The ground truth answer might include additional solutions or specify constraints on the constant c. Without seeing the ground truth answer, we can't be certain if this is the complete solution, hence "Close" is the most appropriate response.
