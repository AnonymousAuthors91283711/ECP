Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (n^3 + 3*n^2 - 1, -n^3 + 3*n + 1)
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℤ => (-n^3 + 3*n + 1, n^3 + 3*n^2 - 1)
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer, just with the components swapped. Both answers represent the same set of solutions, just in different orders. The set {(a,b) | ...} is identical to {(b,a) | ...} when considering unordered pairs, and the problem statement uses a union of sets which makes the order irrelevant. Therefore, the answers are equivalent.
