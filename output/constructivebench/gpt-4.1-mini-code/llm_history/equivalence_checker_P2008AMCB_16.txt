Ground Truth Answer: {(4, 6), (5, 12)}
Proposed Answer: {(a, b) | ∃ k : ℕ, k > 0 ∧ a = 2 * k + 1 ∧ b = 4 * k + 4} ∪ {(a, b) | ∃ k : ℕ, k > 0 ∧ a = 2 * k ∧ b = 2 * k + 4}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for pairs (a,b) where b > a > 0 and there exist x,y such that:
   - x+2 = a
   - y+2 = b
   - x*y = (a*b)/2
   - 2 divides a*b

2. Ground truth gives two specific solutions: (4,6) and (5,12)

3. Proposed answer gives two infinite families:
   - Odd a: a = 2k+1, b = 4k+4
   - Even a: a = 2k, b = 2k+4

Let's test the ground truth solutions against the proposed answer:

For (4,6):
- Fits the even case with k=2 (a=2*2=4, b=2*2+4=8) but b should be 6, not 8 - doesn't match
- Doesn't fit the odd case

For (5,12):
- Fits the odd case with k=2 (a=2*2+1=5, b=4*2+4=12) - matches perfectly

The proposed answer misses (4,6) and includes incorrect pairs like (2,6), (3,8), etc. It only correctly captures (5,12) from the ground truth.
