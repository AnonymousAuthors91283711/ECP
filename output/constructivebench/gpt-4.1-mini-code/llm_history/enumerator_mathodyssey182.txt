[write_program]
The problem asks to solve the equation \(4(x+4) = 24 + 3(2x - 2)\) for \(x\). We'll write a Python program to symbolically solve the equation and enumerate potential solutions for a few values around the expected root to confirm and see any other possibilities.

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

x = symbols('x')

# Define the equation
eq = Eq(4*(x + 4), 24 + 3*(2*x - 2))

# Solve the equation
solutions = solve(eq, x)

print("Equation: 4*(x+4) = 24 + 3*(2*x - 2)")
print("Potential solutions:")
for sol in solutions:
    print(sol)

# Enumerate values around the solution for x in range -3 to 3 to check close integers
print("\nEnumerating x values and checking equation equality:")
for val in range(-3, 4):
    lhs = 4*(val + 4)
    rhs = 24 + 3*(2*val - 2)
    if lhs == rhs:
        print(f"x = {val} satisfies the equation: {lhs} = {rhs}")
```
