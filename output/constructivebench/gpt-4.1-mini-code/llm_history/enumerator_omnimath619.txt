The problem involves finding the number of positive integers k for which there exist positive integers a, b satisfying k*(a+b) = 2013*lcm(a,b). To explore this, we consider small values for a,b and compute k for which the equation holds, printing them as candidates.

```python
from math import gcd

# We aim to find positive integers k for which there exist positive integers a,b:
# k*(a+b) = 2013*lcm(a,b)
# Since lcm(a,b) = a*b//gcd(a,b), rewrite:
# k*(a+b) = 2013*(a*b)//gcd(a,b) => k = 2013*(a*b)//(gcd(a,b)*(a+b))

N = 30  # small bound for a,b to enumerate
print("Enumerating candidates k from a,b in 1..30 satisfying k*(a+b) = 2013*lcm(a,b)")
k_values = set()
for a in range(1, N+1):
    for b in range(1, N+1):
        s = a + b
        g = gcd(a, b)
        numerator = 2013 * a * b
        if numerator % (g*s) == 0:
            k = numerator // (g*s)
            if k > 0:
                print(f"k = {k} for a={a}, b={b}")
                k_values.add(k)

print(f"\nCandidates k found (unique): {sorted(k_values)}")
print(f"Total distinct k candidates found: {len(k_values)}")
```
