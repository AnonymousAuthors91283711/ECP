Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {n : ℕ | ∃ k : ℕ, k > 0 ∧ n = k^3 ∧ k % 10 ≠ 0 ∧ ∃ m : ℕ, m^3 = k}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is mostly correct but has some differences in formulation compared to the ground truth. The key differences are:
1. Uses ℕ instead of ℤ for k and m
2. Uses k % 10 ≠ 0 instead of ¬(10 ∣ n)
3. The last condition is slightly different (m^3 = k vs m^3 = (n/1000))

While the spirit of the answer is similar, these technical differences make it not fully equivalent to the ground truth answer. The conditions are related but not identical in their mathematical formulation.
