[write_program]
The problem defines functions \( f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) satisfying the functional equation 
\[ f(f(x) f(y)) + f(x + y) = f(x y). \]

The program will enumerate simple candidate functions (constant, linear) over some sample values of \( x,y \) to see which satisfy the relation closely or exactly, focusing on exact values, printing each candidate function as soon as discovered (if the functional equation holds for tested values).

```python
# Enumerate simple candidate functions f:R->R and test the functional equation on sample x,y
def check_f(f, name, samples):
    # Check if f satisfies f(f(x)*f(y)) + f(x+y) = f(x*y) for all x,y in samples
    for x in samples:
        for y in samples:
            lhs = f(f(x)*f(y)) + f(x + y)
            rhs = f(x * y)
            if round(lhs,10) != round(rhs,10):  # approximate equality for floats
                return False
    print("Candidate function:", name)
    return True

def main():
    samples = [0,1,-1,2,-2,0.5,-0.5]  # small sample values to test

    # Constant functions: f(x) = c
    for c in [-1, 0, 1, 2]:
        f = lambda x, c=c: c
        if check_f(f, f"f(x) = {c}", samples):
            pass

    # Identity: f(x) = x
    f = lambda x: x
    if check_f(f, "f(x) = x", samples):
        pass

    # Negation: f(x)= -x
    f = lambda x: -x
    if check_f(f, "f(x) = -x", samples):
        pass

    # Square: f(x) = x^2
    f = lambda x: x*x
    if check_f(f, "f(x) = x^2", samples):
        pass

    # Linear: f(x)=a x + b for small integer a,b
    for a in range(-2,3):
        for b in range(-2,3):
            f = lambda x, a=a,b=b: a*x + b
            if check_f(f, f"f(x) = {a}x + {b}", samples):
                pass
