The problem is about a function \( f:\mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{Q} \) satisfying a functional equation on positive rationals: \(f(ab)=f(a)+f(b)\) for positive rationals \(a,b\), and on primes \(p\), \(f(p) = p\). We want to find a specific rational number \(x\) (the answer), presumably related to the problem, such that \(f(x) < 0\).

To assist with conjecturing what \(x\) could be, let's enumerate some candidate rationals constructed from primes and test the values \(f(x)\) must take, using the given conditions. Since \(f\) is additive on multiplication, \(f\) behaves like a logarithm, but with assigned values \(f(p)=p\) on primes.

Since \(f\) is additive over multiplication, by prime factorization of any positive rational \(q = \prod p_i^{e_i}\), we must have
\[ f(q) = \sum e_i f(p_i) = \sum e_i p_i. \]

So to find \(q\) with \(f(q) < 0\), we want to find rationals with integer powers so that the weighted sum of primes is negative, possibly involving negative powers (which correspond to denominators).

Let's enumerate rationals with numerators and denominators from small primes raised to small powers, calculate \(f(q)\), and print those with \(f(q)<0\).

We'll try rationals of the form:
\[ q = \frac{p_1^{a} p_2^{b}}{p_3^{c} p_4^{d}} \]
with small primes \(p_i\) and exponents \(a,b,c,d\) in \{-3,..3\}, ignoring zero exponent factors, and calculate sums of corresponding prime times exponent in numerator minus denominator.

We will print all such rational candidates with negative \(f(q)\) values to conjecture potential answers.
