The problem involves four positive angles α, β, γ, δ summing to 2π with a chain of equalities involving expressions of their tangents and cosines multiplied by 3,4,5,6 respectively. We want to investigate the value of the first expression 3*tan(α)/(1+1/cos(α)) given these constraints.

We will try small discrete angles α and numerically solve for β, γ, δ using the equalities and sum, printing feasible sets and their resulting value of 3*tan(α)/(1+1/cos(α)). This can help conjecture the exact constant or approximate value.

```python
import math

# Simplify expression f(x) = k * tan x / (1 + 1/cos x)
def f(k, x):
    c = math.cos(x)
    if abs(c) < 1e-12 or abs(math.cos(x)) == 0:
        return None  # avoid division by zero
    denom = 1 + 1/c
    if denom == 0:
        return None
    return k * math.tan(x) / denom

# Given f(3, a) = C, solve for x = b,c,d with multipliers 4,5,6 and equal f values as C
# From the problem f(3,a) = f(4,b) = f(5,c) = f(6,d)
# So for given a, find b,c,d satisfying f(k,x) = C

# We'll try to find angles b,c,d by searching numerically

def find_angle(k, target, start=0.01, end=2*math.pi, step=1e-4):
    # Search for angle x in [start,end] with f(k,x) close to target
    x = start
    while x < end:
        val = f(k, x)
        if val is not None and abs(val - target) < 1e-6:
            return x
        x += step
    return None

# Enumerate α from small angles up to near 2π, try to find matching β,γ,δ
print("Enumerating candidate solutions:")
for i in range(1, 314):  # α from 0.01 to ~3.14 (pi)
    a = i * 0.01
    if a <= 0 or a >= 2*math.pi:
        continue
    C = f(3, a)
    if C is None:
        continue
    b = find_angle(4, C, 0.01, 2*math.pi)
    if b is None:
        continue
    c = find_angle(5, C, 0.01, 2*math.pi)
    if c is None:
        continue
    d = find_angle(6, C, 0.01, 2*math.pi)
    if d is None:
        continue
    s = a + b + c + d
    if abs(s - 2*math.pi) < 1e-3:
        print(f"α={a:.4f}, β={b:.4f}, γ={c:.4f}, δ={d:.4f}, sum={s:.4f}, value={C:.6f}")

# This prints approximations of the quadruple and value in real numbers.
# From the output, the constant value can be hypothesized.
