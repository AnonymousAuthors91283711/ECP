The problem is to find the sum of all positive divisors of 1184. We will write a Python program that enumerates all positive divisors of 1184, prints each divisor found, and finally prints their sum.

```python
# Enumerate positive divisors of 1184, print each, then print their sum.

def divisors(n):
    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5)+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            yield i
            if i != n // i:
                yield n // i

n = 1184
divs = sorted(divisors(n))
total = 0
for d in divs:
    print(d)
    total += d
print("Sum of divisors:", total)
```
