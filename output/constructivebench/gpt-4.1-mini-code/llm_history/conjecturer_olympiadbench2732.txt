. Enumerated answers: Enumerating integer pairs (r, s) with r * s = 93 and r + s = 20
No pairs found. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Explanation: Given r + s = -b and r * s = 93, and (r+1)+(s+1) = 22, so r + s + 2 = 22 → r + s = 20, which contradicts r + s = -b, so b = -20. Similarly, (r+1)(s+1) = c = r s + r + s + 1 = 93 + 20 + 1 = 114.

Final answer in Lean:
<<<114>>>
