We have a geometric sequence defined by geometric(n) = a * r^n, with known values at n=5 and n=8:
- a * r^5 = 7! = 5040
- a * r^8 = 8! = 40320

From these equations, we can find r and then a. Let's enumerate rational possibilities for r as fractions p/q (with q small) and check if a becomes rational, then print candidates.

```python
from math import factorial
from fractions import Fraction

# Given values:
g5 = factorial(7)    # 7! = 5040
g8 = factorial(8)    # 8! = 40320

# We want to find rational r = p/q so that:
# a * r^5 = g5 and a * r^8 = g8
# Dividing: (a r^8)/(a r^5) = r^3 = g8 / g5 = 40320 / 5040 = 8
# So r^3 = 8 â†’ r = 2
# Then a = g5 / r^5 = 5040 / 2^5 = 5040 / 32 = 157.5

print(f"r^3 = g8/g5 = {g8}/{g5} = {g8/g5}")
print("Check integer root candidates for r:")
for r_candidate in [1, 2, 3, 4]:
    r3 = r_candidate ** 3
    if r3 == g8 // g5:
        a_val = Fraction(g5, r_candidate**5)
        print(f"r = {r_candidate} satisfies r^3 = 8")
        print(f"a = g5 / r^5 = {g5} / {r_candidate}^5 = {float(a_val)} (exact {a_val})")

# Let's try some rational roots:
print("Enumerating rational candidates p/q for r with small denominators:")
for q in range(1, 5):
    for p in range(1, 10):
        r = Fraction(p, q)
        # Check if r^3 == 8
        if r ** 3 == 8:  # exact match
            a_val = Fraction(g5, r ** 5)
            print(f"r = {r} exactly satisfies r^3=8")
            print(f"a = {a_val} = {float(a_val)}")

# Print final solution candidates explicitly:
r = 2
a = Fraction(g5, r**5)
print(f"Final candidates:")
print(f"a = {a} = {float(a)}, r = {r}")
```
