We want to find natural numbers N between 100 and 999 such that for any two distinct divisors a and b of N, the difference a - b is divisible by 3, and then maximize k = N * (number of divisors of N).

The condition that all differences between divisors are divisible by 3 means that all divisors of N lie in the same residue class modulo 3.

Steps to enumerate:

- For N from 100 to 999:
  - Get divisors of N.
  - Check if all divisors are congruent modulo 3.
  - If yes, compute k = N * number_of_divisors(N).
  - Print k and track maximum k.

We print all candidates that meet the condition immediately as they are found and print the maximum at the end.

```python
def divisors(n):
    divs = []
    i = 1
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            divs.append(i)
            if i != n // i:
                divs.append(n // i)
        i += 1
    return divs

max_k = 0
max_N = 0
print("Candidates N with divisors all congruent mod 3 and their k=N*#divisors(N):")
for N in range(100, 1000):
    divs = divisors(N)
    mod_vals = {d % 3 for d in divs}
    if len(mod_vals) == 1:  # all divisors in same residue class mod 3
        k = N * len(divs)
        print(f"N={N}, divisors={len(divs)}, k={k}")
        if k > max_k:
            max_k = k
            max_N = N

print(f"Maximum k found: k={max_k} for N={max_N}")
```
