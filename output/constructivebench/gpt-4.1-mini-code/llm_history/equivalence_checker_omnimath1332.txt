Ground Truth Answer: 0
Proposed Answer: 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines two curves:
   - curve1: x² = x + y + 4
   - curve2: y² = y - 15x + 36
   We need to find all real x where there exists a y satisfying both equations.

2. To solve, we can express y from curve1: y = x² - x - 4
   Substitute into curve2: (x² - x - 4)² = (x² - x - 4) - 15x + 36

3. Expanding and simplifying gives a quartic equation:
   x⁴ - 2x³ - 6x² - 12x - 16 = 0

4. Solving this equation, we find real roots at x = -1 and x = 4
   (The other two roots are complex)

5. The sum of real solutions is -1 + 4 = 3, but the ground truth says 0 and proposed says 2

6. Both answers are incorrect, but they're different from each other and from the actual sum (3)

<<<False>>>
