The problem appears to involve finding a finite set \( s \subseteq \mathbb{R} \) such that applying a function \( f \) iteratively 10 times to any element of \( s \) yields 1, and the sum of the elements in \( s \) is a certain value (the quantity to be found). Since the function \( f \) is not explicitly given, we'll assume some sample functions and try to enumerate finite sets where the 10th iterate maps each element to 1. We will:

- Try small finite sets of reals (e.g., small integers).
- Define example functions \( f \) (e.g., \( f(x) = x^2 \), \( f(x) = x+1 \), or \( f(x) = \frac{x}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \)) to test iteration behavior.
- For each candidate set, verify if 10 iterations bring each element to 1.
- Print candidate sets and their sums.

This will help conjecture what the set and sum might be given the function, elucidating the problem's shape.

```python
# Enumerate finite sets s of small integers where applying f 10 times brings all elements to 1.
# We'll test some sample functions f.

def iter_f(x, f, n=10):
    for _ in range(n):
        x = f(x)
    return x

def test_function(f, candidate_sets):
    for s in candidate_sets:
        # Check if all elements map to 1 after 10 iterations
        all_map_to_one = all(abs(iter_f(x, f) - 1) < 1e-9 for x in s)
        if all_map_to_one:
            print(f"Set: {s} -> sum: {sum(s)}")

def main():
    # Sample functions to test
    functions = [
        ("f(x) = x^2", lambda x: x**2),
        ("f(x) = x + 1", lambda x: x + 1),  
        ("f(x) = (x + 1) / 2", lambda x: (x + 1)/2),  
    ]
    # Generate candidate finite sets of small integers
    from itertools import combinations
    candidates = []
    values = [-2, -1, 0, 0.5, 1, 2]
    for r in range(1, 5):
        for combo in combinations(values, r):
            candidates.append(combo)
    
    for name, f in functions:
        print(f"Testing function: {name}")
        test_function(f, candidates)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
