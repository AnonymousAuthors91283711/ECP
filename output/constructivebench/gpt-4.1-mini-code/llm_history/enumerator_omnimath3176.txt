The problem involves a polynomial \( P \) whose coefficients are themselves polynomials with integer coefficients, i.e. \( P \in \text{Polynomial}(\text{Polynomial}(\mathbb{Z})) \). The condition given is that for every real \( a \), evaluating \( P \) at \( \lfloor a \rfloor \) (which gives a polynomial in one variable with integer coefficients), then evaluating this resulting polynomial at \( \lfloor 2a \rfloor \), is zero:

\[
\forall a \in \mathbb{R}, \quad \text{eval}(\text{eval}(P, \lfloor a \rfloor), \lfloor 2a \rfloor) = 0.
\]

The goal is to determine all such \( P \) with this property and especially conjecture explicit forms for them.

I will write a Python program that enumerates candidate polynomials \( P \in \text{Polynomial}(\text{Polynomial}(\mathbb{Z})) \) of small degree and small integer coefficients. For computational feasibility, I will represent \( P \) as a polynomial in \( x \) whose coefficients are polynomials in \( y \):

\[
P(x) = \sum_{i=0}^d Q_i(y) x^i,
\]

where each \( Q_i(y) \) is a polynomial with integer coefficients.

Given \( a \), the evaluation reduces to

\[
\text{eval}(\text{eval}(P, \lfloor a \rfloor), \lfloor 2a \rfloor) = \sum_{i=0}^d Q_i(\lfloor 2a \rfloor) \cdot (\lfloor a \rfloor)^i.
\]

We must have this zero for all integers \( m = \lfloor a \rfloor \) and all integers \( n = \lfloor 2a \rfloor \) satisfying \( n \in \{2m, 2m+1\} \). (Because if \( m = \lfloor a \rfloor \), then \( 2a \in [2m, 2(m+1)) \), so \( \lfloor 2a \rfloor \) is either \( 2m \) or \( 2m + 1 \).)

Therefore the condition reduces to: for all integers \( m \) and for \( n \in \{2m, 2m+1\} \),

\[
\sum_{i=0}^d Q_i(n) m^i = 0.
\]

I will let degrees be 1 for both \( x \) and \( y \) polynomials initially to see if any nontrivial \( P \) satisfies the condition, then increment degree or coefficient bounds.

The program will enumerate small-degree polynomials \( P \), test over a sample of integer pairs \( (m, n) \) with \( n \in \{2m, 2m+1\} \) and print candidates \( P \) that satisfy the condition exactly over these samples as strong evidence for the problem statement.

# Enumerate polynomials P(x) = Q0(y) + Q1(y)*x + Q2(y)*x^2 + ...,
# where each Q_i(y) = a_{i,0} + a_{i,1} y + a_{i,2} y^2 + ...,
# all coefficients integers in a small range.
# For each candidate P, check for all integer pairs (m,n) with n in {2m, 2m+1}
