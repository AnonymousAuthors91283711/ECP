Ground Truth Answer: 3 / 5
Proposed Answer: 1/2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find the value of p (between 0 and 1) where the probability expressions for binomial outcomes with parameters (4, p) are equal for exactly 2 successes and exactly 3 successes.

2. The equation to solve is:
   C(4,2) * p² * (1-p)² = C(4,3) * p³ * (1-p)

3. Simplifying:
   6 * p² * (1-p)² = 4 * p³ * (1-p)
   We can divide both sides by 2p²(1-p) (valid since p≠0 and p≠1):
   3(1-p) = 2p
   3 - 3p = 2p
   3 = 5p
   p = 3/5

4. The ground truth answer is indeed 3/5 (0.6), while the proposed answer is 1/2 (0.5).

The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't satisfy the original equation. The correct solution is p = 3/5.
