The problem seems to define a linear function watchTime based on actualTime, and asks for the actualTime solution that makes watchTime equal to 22, and states a minimality condition on that actualTime.

To assist in conjecturing the solution, the Python program below enumerates actualTime values in a reasonable range around 12 (the shift in the formula), computes watchTime for each, and prints those achieving watchTime close to 22.

```python
# Enumerate actualTime values near 12 and compute watchTime = (actualTime - 12) * (57.6/60) + 12
# Print actualTime for watchTime values near 22 for conjecturing the answer.

def watchTime(t):
    return (t - 12) * (57.6 / 60) + 12

step = 0.1
t_min, t_max = 12, 30  # range starting at 12 since formula shifts by 12
threshold = 1e-6  # precision threshold for equality

t = t_min
while t <= t_max:
    w = watchTime(t)
    if abs(w - 22) < threshold:
        print(f"actualTime {t} => watchTime {w}")
    t += step

# Also print exact solution by rearranging: watchTime = 22 -> (t-12)*(57.6/60)+12=22
# So (t-12)*(57.6/60)=10 => t-12=10*(60/57.6) => t=12 + 600/57.6
exact_t = 12 + 600/57.6
exact_w = watchTime(exact_t)
print(f"Exact solution actualTime = {exact_t} with watchTime = {exact_w}")
```
