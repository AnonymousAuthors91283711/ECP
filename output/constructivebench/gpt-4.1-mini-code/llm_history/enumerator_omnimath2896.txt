The problem involves integers \( d, e \) where \( d \) is odd and \( e \) is even, and asks to count the number of odd integers \( x \) in the set 
\[
\{d + d, (e + e) \times d, d \times d, d \times (e + d)\}.
\]
Since the set has only 4 elements, the program will enumerate these elements for small sample values of \( d, e \), check their oddness, and count how many are odd, printing results as we go.

```python
# Enumerate samples of odd d and even e, compute given set elements,
# print which are odd, and the count of odd elements in the set.

def is_odd(n):
    return n % 2 == 1 or n % 2 == -1

def is_even(n):
    return n % 2 == 0

odds_to_check = [1, 3, 5]     # sample odd d values
evens_to_check = [0, 2, 4]   # sample even e values

for d in odds_to_check:
    for e in evens_to_check:
        s = set([d + d, (e + e)*d, d*d, d*(e + d)])
        odd_elements = [x for x in s if is_odd(x)]
        print(f"d={d}, e={e}, set={sorted(s)}")
        print(f" odd elements: {sorted(odd_elements)}")
        print(f" count odd elements = {len(odd_elements)}")
        print("-" * 30)
```
This program prints each candidate set and its odd elements count for several sample values of \( d \) and \( e \), to conjecture the answer.
