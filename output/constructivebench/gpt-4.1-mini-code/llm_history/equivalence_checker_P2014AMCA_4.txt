Ground Truth Answer: fun a b c d e => (b * d * e) / (a * c)
Proposed Answer: fun a b c d e => (b * d * e : ℚ) / (a * c : ℚ)
<<<True>>>

The proposed answer and ground truth answer are equivalent. The only difference is the explicit type annotation `: ℚ` in the proposed answer, which doesn't change the mathematical meaning since the division operation `/` already implies rational numbers are being used. Both expressions compute the same value of (b*d*e)/(a*c) as a rational number.
