[write_program]
The problem involves the set \( S = \{ x \in \mathbb{R} \mid \exists a,b, 1 \leq a \leq b \leq 2, x = \frac{3}{a} + b \} \). We want to find \(\sup S\) and \(\inf S\), then examine \(\sup S + \inf S\).

I will write a Python program to enumerate possible values of \(x = 3/a + b\) for rational \(a,b\) in this domain, trying \(a,b\) on small grids between 1 and 2 to approximate supremum and infimum, printing found values immediately. Then I will output the approximate sums.

```python
# Enumerate candidates x = 3/a + b with 1 <= a <= b <= 2, using fine grids for a,b
# Print each candidate immediately, then print approximate sup + inf at the end

def frange(start, stop, step):
    while start <= stop:
        yield start
        start += step

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import math
    step = 0.01
    candidates = []
    print("Enumerating values x = 3/a + b with 1 <= a <= b <= 2:")
    for a in frange(1, 2, step):
        # For each a, b ranges from a to 2
        for b in frange(a, 2, step):
            x = 3 / a + b
            print(f"x = 3/{a:.2f} + {b:.2f} = {x:.5f}")
            candidates.append(x)

    inf = min(candidates)
    sup = max(candidates)
    print(f"\nApproximate inf S = {inf:.5f}")
    print(f"Approximate sup S = {sup:.5f}")
    print(f"Sum sup S + inf S = {sup + inf:.5f}")
```
