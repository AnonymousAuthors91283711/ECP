theorem omnimath2975 :
  let ben_outcomes := [5, 10, 20]
  let jamie_outcomes := [30, 40]
  let total_outcomes := List.product ben_outcomes jamie_outcomes
  let favorable := total_outcomes.filter (fun (b, j) => b + j = 50)
  favorable.length * (1 : ℚ) / total_outcomes.length = omnimath2975_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Favorable pair: (10, 40), sum=50
Favorable pair: (20, 30), sum=50
Total outcomes: 6
Favorable count: 2
Probability (rational): 1/3. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
<<<(2 : ℚ) / 6>>>
