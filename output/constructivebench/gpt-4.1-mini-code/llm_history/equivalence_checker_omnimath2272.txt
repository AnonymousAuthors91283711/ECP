Ground Truth Answer: 7/72
Proposed Answer: (6 * (6^1) * (5^1) + 6 * (4 * (6^1) * (5^1) + 6 * (6^1))) / 6^4
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
This is a probability problem asking for the probability that in a function from Fin 4 → Fin 6, at least one element in the codomain (Fin 6) is mapped to by at least 3 elements in the domain. The ground truth answer is 7/72.

Proposed Answer Analysis:
The proposed answer is a complex expression:
(6 * (6^1) * (5^1) + 6 * (4 * (6^1) * (5^1) + 6 * (6^1))) / 6^4

Let's simplify it step by step:
1. Denominator is clearly 6^4 (total possible functions)
2. Numerator:
   - First term: 6 * 6 * 5 = 180
   - Second term: 6 * (4*6*5 + 6*6) = 6*(120 + 36) = 6*156 = 936
   - Total numerator: 180 + 936 = 1116
3. Simplified fraction: 1116/1296 = 31/36

This doesn't match the ground truth 7/72 (≈0.0972 vs 31/36≈0.8611). The proposed answer is much larger than the correct probability.

The correct calculation should count:
1. Cases where exactly 3 elements map to one value (C(4,3)*6*5*5)
2. Cases where all 4 elements map to same value (6)
Total favorable cases = 4*6*25 + 6 = 600 + 6 = 606
Probability = 606/1296 = 101/216 ≈ 0.4676 (still not matching)

Wait, even this intermediate calculation doesn't match 7/72. There seems to be confusion in counting. The ground truth 7/72 (≈0.0972) suggests we might be looking for exactly 3 mappings (not "at least 3"), but the problem statement says "at least 3".

Given this confusion and the clear mismatch between the proposed answer and ground truth, I conclude:

<<<False>>>
