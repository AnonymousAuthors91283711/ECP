Ground Truth Answer: 2/3
Proposed Answer: 5 / 9
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. First, let's solve the equation from the hypothesis hx:
   4x + 20 + 140 = 360
   => 4x + 160 = 360
   => 4x = 200
   => x = 50

2. Now plug x=50 into the expression we need to evaluate:
   (4 * x) / 360 = (4 * 50) / 360 = 200 / 360 = 5/9

3. The ground truth answer is 2/3, but the correct calculation shows 5/9.

4. The proposed answer matches exactly with our calculation.
