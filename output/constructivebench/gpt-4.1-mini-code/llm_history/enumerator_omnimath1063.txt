The problem is to find all real numbers \( x \) such that

\[
(2x + 1)(3x + 1)(5x + 1)(30x + 1) = 10.
\]

We will enumerate roots by numeric approximation since it's a quartic polynomial equation. We'll scan \(x\) in a range around 0 (and a bit beyond) with fine step sizes, print \(x\) values for which the polynomial is very close to 10. This helps identify candidate roots to conjecture the exact answers.

```python
# Enumerate x where (2x+1)(3x+1)(5x+1)(30x+1) = 10 approximately
def poly(x):
    return (2*x+1)*(3*x+1)*(5*x+1)*(30*x+1)

epsilon = 1e-5
# Search over a reasonable range from -1 to 1 with fine step
start, end, steps = -1.0, 1.0, 200000

print("Candidates for roots of (2x+1)(3x+1)(5x+1)(30x+1) = 10:")

last_val = None
for i in range(steps+1):
    x = start + (end - start) * i / steps
    val = poly(x)
    if abs(val - 10) < epsilon:
        print(f"x ≈ {x:.7f}, polynomial ≈ {val:.7f}")

# Also check exact simple rational candidates involving reciprocal of coefficients
candidates = [x/den for den in [2,3,5,30] for x in [-1,0,1]]
print("\nRational candidates from zeros and simple values:")
for x in candidates:
    val = poly(x)
    print(f"x = {x}, polynomial = {val}")

# Conjecture from numeric data can be used to find exact roots manually later.
```
