[write_program]
The problem constrains positive integers \(a, b, c, d\) with:

- \(a^3 = b^2\) (so \(a\) is a perfect square and \(b\) is a perfect cube)
- \(c^5 = d^4\) (so \(c\) is a perfect fourth power and \(d\) is a perfect fifth power)
- \(c - a = 77\)

We want to find \(d - b\).

I will write a Python program to enumerate small positive values for \(a\) and \(c\) satisfying the conditions (via their perfect power forms), then compute \(b\), \(d\), confirm \(c - a = 77\), and print possible \(d - b\) values immediately.

Because the exponents are relatively large, we keep \(a, c\) small to limit search.

```python
# Enumerate integer quadruples (a,b,c,d) with:
# a,b,c,d >0,
# a^3 = b^2, c^5 = d^4,
# and c - a = 77,
# then print d - b.

def is_perfect_power(n, exp):
    # Check if n is a perfect power of given exponent
    root = int(round(n**(1/exp)))
    return root**exp == n

def main():
    # Because a^3 = b^2 => a=m^2 and b=m^3 for some m>0
    # Similarly, c^5=d^4 => c = n^4, d=n^5 for some n>0
    # So rewrite:
    # a = m^2
    # b = m^3
    # c = n^4
    # d = n^5
    # c - a = n^4 - m^2 = 77
    # We want d - b = n^5 - m^3

    # Enumerate small m,n to find all possible answers
    # Since c = n^4 and a = m^2, and difference = 77, range m,n in [1..20]

    for m in range(1, 100):
        a = m**2
        b = m**3
        for n in range(1, 50):
            c = n**4
            d = n**5
            if c - a == 77:
                diff = d - b
                print(f"m={m} n={n} a={a} b={b} c={c} d={d} d-b={diff}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
