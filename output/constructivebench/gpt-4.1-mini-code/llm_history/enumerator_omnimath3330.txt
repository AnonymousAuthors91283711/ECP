The problem is about counting lattice paths from (-400, -400) to (400, 400) that only move right or up, and then counting how many such paths avoid the square region |x| ≤ 10 and |y| ≤ 10 entirely. We want the ratio of these two counts.

We will:
- Enumerate parameters for smaller cases to conjecture the ratio.
- Count all lattice paths from (a,a) to (b,b) with only steps right or up.
- Count how many avoid the "forbidden square" near the origin.
- Print the parameters and two counts, then the ratio.

Since the exact problem size is huge, we'll try smaller symmetric ranges like from (-n,-n) to (n,n) with small n and forbidden square size as ±m.

    # Total steps = (b - a)*2, choose which are rights (or ups)
