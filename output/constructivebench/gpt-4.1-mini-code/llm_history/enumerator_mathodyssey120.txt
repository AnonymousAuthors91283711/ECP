The problem asks for the smallest number \( n \) such that there exists a set \( S \) of \( n \) permutations of \(\text{Fin }100\) (i.e., permutations on 100 elements) with the property that for every permutation \( f \), there is some permutation \(\sigma \in S\) and an index \( i \) such that \(\sigma(i) = f(i)\).

In essence, for every permutation \(f\), there is a permutation \(\sigma\) in the set \(S\) such that these two permutations agree on at least one element (matching value at some index).

This is related to a combinatorial covering property on permutations and can be viewed as covering the symmetric group by "pointwise intersecting" subsets.

Enumerating this exactly for \(100\) is huge, so let's sample smaller \(n\) values for permutations on smaller sets, say \( k=3,4,5 \), and check minimal set cardinalities achieving the property.

Because \(|S_n|=n!\) grows very fast, we test \(k=3\), to find minimal \(n\) for which a subset \(S\), \(|S|=n\), of permutations of \(\{0,1,2\}\) satisfies: for every permutation \(f\), there exists \(\sigma\in S\) and \(i\) such that \(\sigma(i)=f(i)\).

We enumerate subsets up to a certain size efficiently and print those that satisfy the property.

```python
from itertools import permutations, combinations

def test_covering(k, n_max=5):
    elems = list(range(k))
    all_perms = list(permutations(elems))
    total = len(all_perms)
    print(f"Testing k={k}, {total} permutations.")

    for size in range(1, n_max+1):
        # Enumerate candidate sets S of size `size` to test coverage:
        # because number of subsets grows combinatorially, limit k small (3,4)
        for subset in combinations(all_perms, size):
            # Build a lookup table of values for each sigma in subset for quick check
            # For each f, check if there exists sigma in subset and i with sigma[i]==f[i]
            # For each f:
            covers_all = True
            for f in all_perms:
                # Check if any sigma in subset has overlap at some i
                found = False
                for sigma in subset:
                    for i in range(k):
                        if sigma[i] == f[i]:
                            found = True
                            break
                    if found:
                        break
                if not found:
                    covers_all = False
                    break
            if covers_all:
                print(f"Size {size} covers all permutations for k={k}: {subset}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Sample small k values
    test_covering(k=3, n_max=4)
    test_covering(k=4, n_max=5)
```

This script tests small \(k\), enumerates permutations, and prints all subsets covering all permutations by agreeing on some position, helping conjecture minimal \(n\).
