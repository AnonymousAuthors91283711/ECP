The problem describes a functional equation: find all functions \( f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) satisfying
\[
f(x) + f\big(y f(x) + f(y)\big) = f\big(x + 2 f(y)\big) + x y
\]
for all real \( x, y \).

To assist in conjecturing the solution, we can try simple candidate functions like linear functions \( f(x) = ax + b \), constants, or others, and verify the equation numerically for a grid of values. This helps identify potential forms of \( f \) such as linear or quadratic.

The code below:
- Tests linear \( f(x) = a x + b \) with integer \( a, b \in \{-3, \dots, 3\} \).
- For each candidate \( f \), checks the equation for sample \( (x, y) \) values from \(-3\) to \(3\).
- Prints all candidate functions that satisfy the equation exactly for these test points.
- Attempts a few simple nonlinear functions as well.

This enumeration helps to conjecture that solutions are possibly linear or simple polynomials and guides proving the theorem.

# Enumerate candidate functions f: R->R satisfying
# f(x) + f(y*f(x) + f(y)) = f(x + 2*f(y)) + x*y
# for many sample points (x,y).
# We test linear f(x)=a*x+b with small integer (a,b).

            rhs = f(x + 2 * f(y)) + x * y
            if abs(lhs - rhs) > 1e-12:
