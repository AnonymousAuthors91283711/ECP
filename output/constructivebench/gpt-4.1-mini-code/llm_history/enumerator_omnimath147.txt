The problem considers natural numbers \( k \) and asks about the existence of infinitely many \( n \) such that the number of divisors of \( a + n k \) is divisible by 2018 for some \( a \). Since 2018 is fixed and 2018 = 2 * 1009, we investigate divisor counts modulo 2018.

We enumerate for small \( k \) (e.g., 1 to 10), \( a \) up to 20, and \( n \) up to 100, counting divisors of \( a + n k \), checking divisibility by 2018, and tracking if infinitely many \( n \) might exist by observing frequency patterns.

```python
# Enumerate small k, a, n to find many n with divisor count divisible by 2018
# We print whenever we find such n and track counts to conjecture for omnimath147_answer(k).

from math import isqrt

def divisors_count(x):
    # Efficient divisor counting
    count = 0
    root = isqrt(x)
    for d in range(1, root + 1):
        if x % d == 0:
            count += 2 if d * d != x else 1
    return count

def process_k(k):
    print(f"k = {k}")
    threshold = 2018  # divisor count must be divisible by 2018
    a_limit = 20
    n_limit = 100
    
    for a in range(1, a_limit + 1):
        hits = []
        for n in range(n_limit + 1):
            val = a + n * k
            dc = divisors_count(val)
            if dc % threshold == 0:
                print(f"  a = {a} n = {n} val = {val} divisors_count = {dc}")
                hits.append(n)
        # Heuristic: if many hits with difference patterns appear, possibly infinite
        # Print summary for this a
        if len(hits) > 3:
            diffs = [hits[i+1]-hits[i] for i in range(len(hits)-1)]
            print(f"    > hits count = {len(hits)} diffs = {diffs}")

def main():
    for k in range(1, 11):
        process_k(k)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
