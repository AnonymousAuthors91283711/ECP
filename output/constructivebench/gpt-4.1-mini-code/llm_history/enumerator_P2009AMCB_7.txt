The problem involves a real number \(x\) between 0 and 100, and a real \(P\) satisfying the equation:
\[
(P \cdot 1.2) \cdot 0.8 \cdot 1.25 \cdot (1 - \frac{x}{100}) = P,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
P \cdot (1.2 \times 0.8 \times 1.25) \cdot \left(1 - \frac{x}{100}\right) = P.
\]

We want to find possible values of \(x\) (more precisely, its rounded value) that satisfy this. Since the product \(1.2 \times 0.8 \times 1.25 = 1.2\), the equation reduces to:
\[
P \cdot 1.2 \cdot \left(1 - \frac{x}{100}\right) = P.
\]

If \(P \neq 0\), dividing both sides by \(P\):
\[
1.2 \left(1 - \frac{x}{100}\right) = 1 \implies 1 - \frac{x}{100} = \frac{1}{1.2} = \frac{5}{6},
\]
thus:
\[
\frac{x}{100} = 1 - \frac{5}{6} = \frac{1}{6} \implies x = \frac{100}{6} \approx 16.666\ldots
\]

So possible \(x\) values cluster around \(16.666\ldots\).

The rounding of \(x\) can be 16 or 17 depending on rounding method. Let's enumerate rounded integers for \(x\) values around 16.\(6\) and confirm the equation with some numerical checks.

```python
# Enumerate possible rounded x between 0 and 100
# Check the defining equation:
# (P * 1.2) * 0.8 * 1.25 * (1 - x/100) = P
# => P * 1.2 * (1 - x/100) = P => 1.2 * (1 - x/100) = 1 if P != 0
# => 1 - x/100 = 1/1.2 = 5/6 => x = 100*(1 - 5/6) = 100/6 = 16.6666...
# We'll print x rounded and check the left side to see if close to 1

def check_equation(x):
    left = 1.2 * (1 - x / 100)
    return abs(left - 1) < 1e-9

print("Enumerating x and their rounded values where equation holds:")

# To illustrate, check integers near 16.5 to 17.5
for x_int in range(10, 25):
    # Since x must be real, also check float around x_int with small deltas
    for delta in [-0.1, 0, 0.1]:
        x = x_int + delta
        val = 1.2 * (1 - x / 100)
        if abs(val - 1) < 1e-6:
            print(f"x={x:.3f}, rounded={round(x)}, 1.2*(1 - x/100)={val:.6f}")

print("\nConclusion: the x value is approximately 16.6667, rounding to 17.")
```
