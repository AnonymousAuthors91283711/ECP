[write_program]
The problem asks to find an integer \( n \) such that \( n^2 \) equals one of several powers like \( 2^3, 3^5, 4^7, 5^9, 6^{11} \), or equivalently, to find which of these numbers are perfect squares.

We will write a Python program to check for each given number if it is a perfect square, and print the number along with its square root if it exists. Since the bases and exponents are not too large, direct computation and integer root checking will be efficient.

```python
import math

def is_perfect_square(x):
    r = int(math.isqrt(x))
    return r * r == x, r

cases = [
    (2, 3),
    (3, 5),
    (4, 7),
    (5, 9),
    (6, 11),
]

print("Checking if base^exponent is a perfect square:")
for base, exp in cases:
    val = pow(base, exp)
    perfect, root = is_perfect_square(val)
    if perfect:
        print(f"{base}^{exp} = {val} is a perfect square: {root}^2")
    else:
        print(f"{base}^{exp} = {val} is NOT a perfect square")

# Also print the "omnimath3422_answer" candidates (perfect squares found)
print("\nCandidates for omnimath3422_answer (n^2 found):")
for base, exp in cases:
    val = pow(base, exp)
    perfect, root = is_perfect_square(val)
    if perfect:
        print(val)

# If there are any perfect squares, print the minimal one (extremal answer)
perfect_squares = [pow(base, exp) for base, exp in cases if is_perfect_square(pow(base, exp))[0]]
if perfect_squares:
    minimum = min(perfect_squares)
    print("\nMinimum perfect square among candidates:")
    print(minimum)
```
