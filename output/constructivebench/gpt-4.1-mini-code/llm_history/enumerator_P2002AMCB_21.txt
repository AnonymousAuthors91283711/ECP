The problem defines a function a(n) based on divisibility by 11, 13, and 14, with different values for overlaps and singles. We want to sum a(n) for n from 0 to 2001 and find that sum.

We will enumerate a(n) for n in 0..2001 and print each a(n) along with n, then print the total sum.

```python
def divisible(n, d): 
    return n % d == 0

def a(n):
    div11 = divisible(n, 11)
    div13 = divisible(n, 13)
    div14 = divisible(n, 14)
    if div11 and div13 and div14:
        return 6
    if div11 and div13:
        return 4
    if div11 and div14:
        return 3
    if div13 and div14:
        return 2
    if div11 or div13 or div14:
        return 1
    return 0

total = 0
for n in range(2002):
    val = a(n)
    print(f"a({n}) = {val}")
    total += val

print("Sum of a(n) for n=0..2001 =", total)
```
