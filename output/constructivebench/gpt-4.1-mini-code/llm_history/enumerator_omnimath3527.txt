The problem defines a special natural number `omnimath3527_answer` that is not factorizable into two factors both greater than 1 (i.e., prime or 1), but each of 6, 27, 39, and 77 is factorizable with such factors. The first condition says the `omnimath3527_answer` is a number greater than 1 and is not composite (so it must be prime or 1). The second says 6, 27, 39, and 77 all are composite with factorizations into factors strictly greater than 1 (which they are).

The question is: find a number `N` that cannot be expressed as the product of two natural numbers > 1 whose product equals `N`, but 6, 27, 39, and 77 can be. Basic theory says any prime number > 1 cannot be factored as such, but those specific numbers can.

So the "omnimath3527_answer" is a prime number that is *not* any of 6, 27, 39, 77. The theorem states a number satisfying all those formulas.

We want to enumerate candidates for `omnimath3527_answer`, verifying it meets the condition of no factorization with factors both >1, but 6,27,39,39 are all factorizable. Since 6,27,39,77 all factorize easily into two factors >1, the second part is trivial and always true.

We only need to confirm the first big negation on numbers.

To assist:

Let's enumerate candidate numbers `N` from 2 up to say 100, and check if `N` has any two factors > 1 whose product is N.

Print each `N` where this is false (i.e., no such factorization). Those are primes.

And print if 6,27,39,77 all factorize as requested.

We'll cap enumeration up to 100 to keep output short and manageable.

```python
# enumerator.py
def has_nontrivial_factor_pair(n):
    # Check if n can be factored into two factors >1: a,b>1 with a*b = n
    for a in range(2, int(n**0.5) +1):
        if n % a == 0:
            b = n // a
            if b > 1:
                return True
    return False

def can_factor(n):
    # existence of factors a,b >1 with a*b = n
    return has_nontrivial_factor_pair(n)

def main():
    targets = [6,27,39,77]
    print("Check if target numbers factor into two factors >1:")
    for t in targets:
        f = can_factor(t)
        print(f"{t}: {f}")
    print()

    print("Candidate omnimath3527_answer numbers with no factors >1 except 1 and itself (i.e. primes):")
    for n in range(2,101):
        if not has_nontrivial_factor_pair(n):
            print(f"Candidate: {n}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This prints factors found in targets and candidate primes up to 100. From there you can conjecture the answer is prime. The targets all factorize, the candidate does not. The problem's `omnimath3527_answer` then is any prime number not equal to 6,27,39,77 that satisfies the conditions.
