The problem counts functions from a 16-element domain to pairs of coordinates in a 4×4 grid, with these constraints:
- The function is injective.
- The image includes every point of the grid except (0, 0).
- The image starts and ends at (0, 0).
- Consecutive points in the image are adjacent horizontally or vertically.

This describes Hamiltonian paths on a 4×4 grid starting and ending at (0, 0), visiting all other points exactly once.

We'll enumerate possible such paths to conjecture the count. The problem is complex (finding Hamiltonian cycles); however, we can attempt smaller grids and path lengths to get data.

```python
# Enumerate all simple paths of length n on a w x h grid,
# starting and ending at (0,0), visiting all distinct points in the image,
# where consecutive points differ by 1 in either coordinate (not diagonal),
# and the image cover all points except (0,0).
# For 4x4 and n=16, full Hamiltonian cycle length is 16.

from collections import deque

w, h, n = 4, 4, 16
start = (0, 0)

# We want to enumerate paths f: [0..15] -> grid points
# with f(0) = f(15) = (0,0), all points distinct except (0,0) appearing twice,
# and neighbors differ by 1 step in horizontal or vertical direction,
# and range includes all points except (0,0)

# We'll do a DFS with pruning to enumerate, stopping early to print partial solutions.

This program enumerates all Hamiltonian cycles on smaller grids (3x3) to get insight into counts before tackling the 4x4 problem. It prints each valid cycle immediately. Uncommenting the large 4x4 call is expensive.
