This problem involves positive real numbers \(a, b\) satisfying a nonlinear equation \(3a^2 + 2b^2 = 3a + 2b\). We want to find the minimum value of 
\[
A = \sqrt{\frac{a}{b(3a+2)}} + \sqrt{\frac{b}{a(2b+3)}}.
\]

To explore this, we'll take small positive rational approximations for \(a, b\), verify the equation approximately, and enumerate values of \(A\), printing candidates that nearly satisfy the constraint. This will help conjecture the minimum.

```python
from math import sqrt, isclose

# Enumerate rational pairs (a,b) with a,b in (0.1,3) sampled finely.
# Check the equation 3a^2 + 2b^2 = 3a + 2b up to a tolerance.
# Print candidate values A when constraint is approximately satisfied.

def approx_equal(x, y, tol=1e-4):
    return abs(x - y) < tol

def candidates():
    step = 0.05
    for i in range(2, 61):       # a from 0.1 to 3.0
        a = i * step
        for j in range(2, 61):   # b from 0.1 to 3.0
            b = j * step
            lhs = 3*a*a + 2*b*b
            rhs = 3*a + 2*b
            if approx_equal(lhs, rhs):
                A = sqrt(a / (b * (3*a + 2))) + sqrt(b / (a * (2*b + 3)))
                print(f"a={a:.3f}, b={b:.3f}, A={A:.6f}")

# Run enumeration and print candidates immediately
candidates()
```
This prints many near-solutions with their corresponding \(A\) values on the fly, useful for conjecturing the minimal value.
