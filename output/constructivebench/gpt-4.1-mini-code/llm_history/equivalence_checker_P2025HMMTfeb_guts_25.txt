Ground Truth Answer: fun initial_blue initial_purple steps => 
    let initial_total := initial_blue + initial_purple
    let blue_ratio := initial_blue / (initial_total : ℚ)
    initial_blue + steps * (1 - blue_ratio)
Proposed Answer: fun b p s => ((2 * (b + p) + s) : ℚ) / 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves calculating some value based on initial counts of blue and purple items and a number of steps. The specific case given is when b=20, p=25, s=44, and the result should be 173/4.

2. Ground Truth Answer:
   - Calculates initial_total = b + p
   - Calculates blue_ratio = b/(b+p)
   - Returns b + s*(1 - blue_ratio)
   - For b=20,p=25,s=44: 
     initial_total = 45
     blue_ratio = 20/45 = 4/9
     1 - blue_ratio = 5/9
     Result = 20 + 44*(5/9) = 20 + 220/9 = 380/9 ≈ 42.22

3. Proposed Answer:
   - Returns (2*(b+p) + s)/4
   - For b=20,p=25,s=44:
     (2*45 + 44)/4 = (90+44)/4 = 134/4 = 33.5

The results are clearly different (380/9 vs 134/4), and the formulas are structurally different. The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth in either the general case or the specific example given.
