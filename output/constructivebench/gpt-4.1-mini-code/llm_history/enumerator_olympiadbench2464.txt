[write_program]
The problem involves enumerating multisets of natural numbers whose product is 1000, grouped by size. We'll write a Python program to enumerate all such factorizations of 1000 into natural factors greater than 1, print each factorization immediately, and finally print the total count. This will help conjecture if the provided list is complete.

```python
def backtrack(n, start=2, factors=[]):
    if n == 1:
        print(f"Factorization: {factors}")
        yield 1
        return
    count = 0
    for i in range(start, n+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            count += sum(backtrack(n // i, i, factors + [i]))
    return count

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Enumerating factorizations of 1000 into factors >= 2:")
    total = backtrack(1000)
    print(f"Total factorizations count: {total}")
```
