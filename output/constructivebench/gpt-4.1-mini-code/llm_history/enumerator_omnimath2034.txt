The problem involves analyzing the length of the decimal representation of the primorial of a prime number \( p \). Specifically, for the prime \( p = 843301 \), we want to find the number of digits in the primorial \( p\# = \prod_{q \leq p, q \text{ prime}} q \).

Since directly computing such a large primorial is infeasible, we can approximate or analyze smaller cases and seek a pattern or method. The Python program below enumerates primes up to some smaller primes, computes the decimal digits of their primorials, and prints the lengths. This might help conjecture the behavior or understand the relation for very large primes.

```python
# Enumerate primes, compute primorial, and print digit lengths
# For large primes direct computation is impossible, so we use small samples

from sympy import primerange, primepi

def primorial(primes):
    from math import prod
    return prod(primes)

def digit_length(n):
    return len(str(n))

print("Enumerating primorial digit lengths for primes up to small thresholds:")

small_primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]
for p in small_primes:
    primes_list = list(primerange(1, p+1))
    prim = primorial(primes_list)
    length = digit_length(prim)
    print(f"p={p}, #primes={len(primes_list)}, primorial digits={length}")

# Also print count of primes up to 843301 for context
count_843301 = primepi(843301)
print(f"Number of primes up to 843301: {count_843301}")

# Output an approximation of the number of digits for large p using log10(sum log10 primes)
# Since direct multiplication is impossible, approximate digit length by sum of logs

import math

def approx_primorial_digit_length(primes):
    total_log10 = sum(math.log10(p) for p in primes)
    return int(total_log10) + 1

print("\nApproximations of primorial digit lengths:")
for p in [29, 100, 1000, 10000]:
    primes_list = list(primerange(1, p+1))
    approx_len = approx_primorial_digit_length(primes_list)
    print(f"p={p}, approx primorial digits={approx_len}")
```

This script systematically enumerates primorial digit lengths for smaller prime \( p \), prints exact lengths where feasible, and uses logarithmic approximations for larger \( p \) values. It also prints the count of primes up to 843301 (for reference). This can guide conjectures for the original problem.
