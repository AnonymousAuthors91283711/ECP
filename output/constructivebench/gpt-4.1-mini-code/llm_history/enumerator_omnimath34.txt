The problem appears to relate to finding the minimal natural number d that cannot be represented as a sum of terms of the form (-1)^a * 2^b, where a and b are functions on [1,n] with values in ℕ, possibly with constraints like a(i) ∈ {0,1} for the exponent of -1 due to parity, and b(i) ∈ ℕ. We want to identify the minimal d (positive integer) for which no such representation exists.

We will enumerate:
- For small values of n (e.g., 1 to 4),
- All possible combinations of (a(i), b(i)) where a(i) ∈ {0,1} and b(i) ∈ [0,max_power],
- Calculate sums for all possible multisets of size n, over the index set i = 1..n,
- Find which natural numbers are representable,
- Enumerate missing positive integers d and print them,
- Then report the minimal missing d for that n.

To keep runtime manageable, restrict b(i) to a small max_power (e.g. up to 4 or 5).

The program will print for each n the missing sums d, then the minimal missing sum.

```python
# Enumerate minimal natural number d > 0 not representable as sum_i (-1)^a(i)*2^(b(i)) with a,b: [1..n]->Nat; a(i) mod 2 defines sign
# We assume a(i) in {0,1} controlling sign, b(i) in [0,max_power], size of index set = n
# For n=1..4, max_power=5, find missing representable sums d.

from itertools import product

def representable_sums(n, max_power=5):
    # For each position i in 1..n, a_i in {0,1} (sign), b_i in [0,max_power]
    # enumerate all possible tuples (a,b)
    values = []
    for a_b_tuple in product(product((0,1), repeat=n), product(range(max_power+1), repeat=n)):
        a_vals, b_vals = a_b_tuple
        s = 0
        for i in range(n):
            sign = (-1)**a_vals[i]
            power = 2**b_vals[i]
            s += sign * power
        values.append(s)
    return set(values)

def find_missing_positive_numbers(repr_set, limit=100):
    # find missing positive integers up to limit not in repr_set
    missing = []
    for d in range(1, limit+1):
        if d not in repr_set:
            missing.append(d)
    return missing

def main():
    for n in range(1,5):
        print(f"n={n}")
        R = representable_sums(n)
        missing = find_missing_positive_numbers(R)
        for d in missing:
            print(f"Missing d: {d}")
        if missing:
            print(f"Minimal missing d for n={n}: {missing[0]}")
        else:
            print(f"No missing positive d up to limit for n={n}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
