The problem is to find a natural number `omnimath3474_answer` that cannot be represented as \( 3k + 2k = 5k \) for any natural number \( k \). This essentially means finding a natural number that is not divisible by 5.

To explore this, we can enumerate natural numbers and check if they can be written as \( 5k \) for some \( k \). The numbers not divisible by 5 will be our candidates.

```python
# Enumerate natural numbers up to a limit and check divisibility by 5
def main():
    max_n = 30  # limit to keep output small
    for n in range(max_n + 1):
        if n % 5 != 0:
            print(f"{n} cannot be expressed as 5*k for any k")
    # The smallest such number is 1
    print("Smallest natural number not representable as 5*k is 1")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
