abbrev omnimath957_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath957 :
  IsLeast {b : ℕ | 0 < b ∧ 
    let total := 6 + b;
    let sameColor := 3 + choose b 2;
    sameColor / choose total 2 = 1/5} 
  omnimath957_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: b=1, ratio=1/7
b=2, ratio=1/7
b=3, ratio=1/6
b=4, ratio=1/5
Candidate b with ratio 1/5 found: 4. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
