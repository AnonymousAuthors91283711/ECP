open Real

abbrev omnimath1380_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath1380 (e f : ℝ) 
  (h1 : e / f = 3 / 4) 
  (h2 : sqrt (e^2 + f^2) = 15) 
  : e * f = omnimath1380_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating integer multiples of ratio 3:4 and checking norm = 15
Found e=9, f=12, norm=15.000000000, e*f=108
Conjectured answer: 108. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<108>>>
