The problem defines a sequence \(a_n\) with conditions \(a_1 = x\), \(a_3 = y\), and a recurrence \(a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n+1} - 1\) for \(n > 1\). We need to find the sum \(\sum_{k=1}^{2018} a_k\) in terms of \(x\) and \(y\).

The key step is to rewrite the recurrence to solve for \(a_{n+1}\):
\[
a_{n+1} = a_n - a_{n-1} + 1
\]
which is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence. We enumerate possible values for \(x,y\) in a small range, compute the sequence up to \(n=2018\), and sum it, printing intermediate results to identify a closed form.

```python
# Enumerate sums of a_n with given x,y and recurrence a_{n+1}=a_n - a_{n-1} +1 for n>1
def sequence_sum(x, y, N=2018):
    a = [0]*(N+2)
    a[1] = x
    a[3] = y
    # Back-calculate a[2] using recurrence for n=2: a_2 = a_1 + a_3 - 1
    a[2] = a[1] + a[3] - 1
    # Generate sequence using a_{n+1} = a_n - a_{n-1} + 1 (from given recurrence form)
    for n in range(3, N+1):
        a[n+1] = a[n] - a[n-1] + 1
    return sum(a[1:N+1])

print("Enumerating sums for sample (x,y):")
for x in range(1,4):
    for y in range(1,4):
        s = sequence_sum(x,y)
        print(f"x={x}, y={y} => sum a_k = {s}")

# Check sums for linearly increasing x,y
print("\nTesting x=y from 1 to 5:")
for v in range(1,6):
    s = sequence_sum(v,v)
    print(f"x={v}, y={v} => sum a_k = {s}")
```
This will print sums for various (x,y) so we can conjecture a closed form for the required sum.
