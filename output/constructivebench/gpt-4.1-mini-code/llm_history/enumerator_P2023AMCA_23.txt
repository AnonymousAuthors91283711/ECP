The problem appears to be counting the number of positive real solutions \((a,b)\) to the equation \((1 + 2a)(1 + b)(2a + b) = 16ab\) with \(a,b > 0\). To explore this, I will enumerate values of \(a\) on a fine grid over positive reals (say from 0.01 to 2 with step 0.01), and for each fixed \(a\), try to solve for \(b\) in positive reals satisfying the equation exactly or approximately.

Since the equation is polynomial in \(b\), I will rearrange the equation for fixed \(a\) to find \(b\). The equation is cubic in \(b\):
\[
(1 + 2a)(1 + b)(2a + b) = 16ab
\]
Expand:
\[
(1+2a)(1+b)(2a+b) = (1+2a)(2a + b + 2ab + b^2) = 16ab
\]
But better to treat the left side as a quadratic in \(b\):
\[
(1+b)(2a + b) = 2a + b + 2ab + b^2 = 2a + b(1+2a) + b^2
\]
Multiply by \((1+2a)\):
\[
(1+2a)(2a + b(1+2a) + b^2) = 16ab
\]
Let \(c = 1+2a\). Then:
\[
c \cdot 2a + c b (1+2a) + c b^2 = 16 a b
\]
Rewrite as:
\[
c b^2 + b (c (1+2a) - 16 a) + 2 a c = 0
\]
Quadratic in \(b\):
\[
c b^2 + b (c (1+2a) - 16 a) + 2 a c = 0
\]
For each \(a\), solve this quadratic for \(b > 0\).

I will enumerate \(a \in \{0.01, 0.02, \ldots, 2\}\), solve for \(b\), print solutions where \(b > 0\). This will allow conjecturing the number of solutions.

```python
# Enumerate positive solutions (a,b) to (1+2a)(1+b)(2a+b)=16ab with a,b>0
# For fixed a>0, solve quadratic in b: c b^2 + b (c(1+2a) -16 a) + 2 a c=0 where c=1+2a

def enumerate_solutions():
    eps = 1e-12
    step = 0.01
    results = []
    a = step
    while a <= 2.0 + step/2:
        c = 1 + 2*a
        A = c
        B = c*(1 + 2*a) - 16*a
        C = 2*a*c
        D = B*B - 4*A*C
        if D >= -eps:
            # Avoid negative sqrt by tolerance
            D = max(D, 0.0)
            sqrtD = D**0.5
            for sign in [-1,1]:
                b = (-B + sign*sqrtD)/(2*A)
                if b > 0:
                    print(f"a={a:.2f}, b={b:.6f}")
                    results.append((round(a,2), round(b,6)))
        a += step
    print(f"Total positive real solutions found (approx): {len(results)}")
    
if __name__=="__main__":
    enumerate_solutions()
