The problem involves the polynomial \( P(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 - 4x^2 + 16x - 8 \) and asks for the sum of the absolute values of its roots. We write a Python program to numerically find the roots, compute and print their absolute values, and sum them up. This helps conjecture the exact sum.

```python
import numpy as np

# Define the polynomial coefficients
# P(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 - 4x^2 + 16x - 8
coeffs = [1, -4, -4, 16, -8]

# Find roots using numpy's roots function
roots = np.roots(coeffs)

# Stream output: print each root and |root|
for r in roots:
    print(f"Root: {r}, |root| = {abs(r)}")

# Sum the absolute values of all roots
abs_sum = sum(abs(r) for r in roots)
print(f"Sum of |roots| = {abs_sum}")
```
