[write_program]
The problem states that \(2 + x = x + y\) and \(x + y = y + 5\). We want to find \(x - y\). By examining the equalities, we can deduce the relationship between \(x\) and \(y\). The Python program enumerates values for \(x, y\) that satisfy the constraints approximately and prints the resulting \(x - y\) values.

```python
# Enumerate (x, y) satisfying constraints 2 + x = x + y and x + y = y + 5
# The goal is to find x - y for such pairs
# Since the equations are linear, try small integer values for x,y and check if equations hold.

def approx_equal(a, b, eps=1e-9):
    return abs(a - b) < eps

print("Enumerating (x,y) and corresponding x - y values that satisfy:")
print("  2 + x = x + y and x + y = y + 5")
print()

for x in range(-10, 11):
    for y in range(-10, 11):
        if approx_equal(2 + x, x + y) and approx_equal(x + y, y + 5):
            diff = x - y
            print(f"x={x}, y={y} => x - y = {diff}")

# Given the constraints, explicitly compute x - y
# From 2 + x = x + y => 2 = y
# From x + y = y + 5 => x = 5
# So (x, y) = (5, 2) and x - y = 3
print()
print("From algebraic deduction:")
print("x - y =", 5 - 2)  # exact answer is 3
```
