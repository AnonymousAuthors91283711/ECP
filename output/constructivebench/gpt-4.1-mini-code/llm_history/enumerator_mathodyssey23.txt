The problem defines a sequence transformation starting from S(1) = [1, 1], and each next step expands the previous list by inserting sums of adjacent elements. We want to count how many times 1988 appears in S(1988). Direct computation is costly, so I'll enumerate S(k) for small k and count occurrences of 1988, printing immediate results. This helps conjecture the answer.

```python
# Enumerate the sequence S(k) where
# S(1) = [1,1]
# S(k+1) = expand(S(k)) with expand defined as:
# expand([])=[], expand([x])=[x], expand([x,y,...])=x, x+y, expand(y,...)
# Count occurrences of 1988 in S(1988)
# We'll print counts for small k to detect patterns.

def expand(lst):
    if not lst or len(lst) == 1:
        return lst[:]
    res = []
    for i in range(len(lst)-1):
        res.append(lst[i])
        res.append(lst[i]+lst[i+1])
    res.append(lst[-1])
    return res

target = 1988
S = [[], [1,1]]  # S[0]=[], S[1]=[1,1]

print("k count_1988")
for k in range(2, 25):  # compute up to 24, small enough to observe
    prev = S[-1]
    curr = expand(prev)
    S.append(curr)
    count = curr.count(target)
    if count > 0:
        print(f"{k} {count}")

# Also print counts at k=1988 by simulating much more efficiently:
# Not feasible directly; so this enumeration up to k=24 helps conjecture counts.
```
