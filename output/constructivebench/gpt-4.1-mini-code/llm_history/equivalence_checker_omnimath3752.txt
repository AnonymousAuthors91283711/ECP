Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: { n : ℕ | 30 ∣ n ∧ Finset.card (Nat.divisors n) = 30 }
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is close but not exactly equivalent to the ground truth. The key difference is that `Set.encard` (which counts the cardinality of a possibly infinite set) is being replaced with `Finset.card` (which counts finite sets). While `Nat.divisors n` is indeed finite, the use of `Finset.card` instead of `Set.encard` makes them technically different expressions, though they would evaluate to the same result in this context. The equivalence would hold if we could prove that `Set.encard {d | d ∣ n} = Finset.card (Nat.divisors n)` for all `n`, which is true but not stated.
