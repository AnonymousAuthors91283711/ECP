The problem involves solving an equation with logarithms and absolute values and identifying specific solutions for x. To assist, we enumerate values of x > 0 and check the given condition for equality, printing approximate numeric values and exact cases when recognized.

```python
import math

# We want to find x > 0 such that:
# |(log x / log 6) - (log 9 / log 6)| = 2 * |(log 10 / log 6) - 1|
# Since log 9 / log 6 and (log10 / log6) - 1 are constants, precompute them
log6 = math.log(6)
const1 = math.log(9) / log6
const2 = abs(math.log(10) / log6 - 1)
target = 2 * const2

print(f"Constants:\nlog9/log6 = {const1}\n2 * |log10/log6 - 1| = {target}")

# Since x > 0, try x ranging around 1 and some special values like 6^k
# We'll test x = 6^t for t in linspace around const1 +- target
import numpy as np

# x = 6^t => log(x)/log(6) = t
# The equation reduces to |t - const1| = target
# so t = const1 Â± target
candidates_t = [const1 - target, const1 + target]

# compute candidate x = 6^t
for t in candidates_t:
    x = 6**t
    # Verify the equation numerically
    lhs = abs(math.log(x)/log6 - const1)
    if abs(lhs - target) < 1e-12:
        print(f"Candidate x = 6^{t:.12f} = {x} satisfies: LHS = {lhs}, RHS = {target}")

# Also check x = 1 (given) explicitly
x = 1
lhs = abs(math.log(x)/log6 - const1)
print(f"x=1, LHS = {lhs}, RHS = {target}")

# Try integer x from 1 to 20 and print any close matches
for x_int in range(1,21):
    lhs = abs(math.log(x_int)/log6 - const1)
    if abs(lhs - target) < 1e-6:
        print(f"x = {x_int} approx satisfies with LHS={lhs:.8f}")

```
