The problem defines a family of functions \( a_n(i) \) with \( a_n(i+1) = 2^{a_n(i)} \), for \( n, i \in \mathbb{N} \), and we're interested in counting those \( n \in [1,1000] \) such that \( 100 \mid a_n(1000) - a_n(1) \). The values \( a_n(1) \) are arbitrary natural numbers that determine the sequence for each fixed \( n \).

We want to enumerate these \( n \) with \( n \in [1,1000] \). We are given no direct formula for \( a_n(1) \), but the natural way is to consider \( a_n(1) = n \), so that we can evaluate the divisibility condition for those \( n \). 

The main issue is that \( a_n(1000) \) is an enormously large tower of powers of 2, making direct computation impossible. However, modular arithmetic, especially modulo 100, will simplify this.

Key idea:
- Calculate \( a_n(1000) \mod 100 \).
- We have: \( a_n(i+1) = 2^{a_n(i)} \), so \( a_n(1000) = 2^{a_n(999)} \).
- We only need \( a_n(1000) - a_n(1) \equiv 0 \pmod{100} \).

The problem reduces to:
\[ 2^{a_n(999)} \equiv a_n(1) \pmod{100} \]

Given \( a_n(1) = n \), for \( n \in [1,1000] \), count \( n \) satisfying
\[ 2^{a_n(999)} \equiv n \pmod{100} \]

Because \( a_n(999) = \) tower of exponents of 2 of height 998, starting from \( a_n(1) \).
Hence, it is a huge power tower modulo some modulus, which can be computed using the properties of modular exponentiation and the Carmichael function or Euler's phi function to reduce exponents step by step modulo the corresponding orders.

Below is a Python program to compute and enumerate such \( n \) using modular arithmetic with efficient handling of tower modulo computations. It uses the fact that \(\varphi(100) = 40\) for Euler's totient and manages the tower of exponents modulo order to compute \(2^{a_n(999)} \mod 100\).

```python
# Problem: For n in 1..1000, define a_n(1)=n
# a_n(i+1) = 2^{a_n(i)}
# Count n with (a_n(1000) - a_n(1)) divisible by 100
# i.e. 2^{a_n(999)} â‰¡ n mod 100

def euler_phi(m):
    # phi(100) = 40 is known, but we compute for generality
    result = m
    p = 2
    while p * p <= m:
        if m % p == 0:
            while m % p == 0:
                m //= p
            result -= result // p
        p += 1 if p == 2 else 2
    if m > 1:
        result -= result // m
    return result

        # To avoid exponent 0 case (which means exponent divisible by phi), add phi_mod
        exp_mod = exp if exp != 0 else phi_mod

def main():
    # As we want a_n(999) exponent: a tower of height 999 starting from n is:

    # but when computing exponent modulo phi, we need recursive modular exponentiation with reduced mod at each level.

    # But the base isn't always 2, it's n at bottom level for each n.
    # Actually, a_n(1) = n, so tower from bottom is:

    # So we do tower_mod with base=2, height=998, replacing the bottom n instead of 2:

This program enumerates all \( n \in [1,1000] \), computing the tower modulo \( 40 \) for exponents, then computing \( 2^{a_n(999)} \mod 100 \), checking if it equals \( n \) modulo 100, and printing the matching \( n \).

You can run `python enumerator.py` directly. The outputs stream as they are found. The final count is printed too. Adjustments are made for modular arithmetic cycles to handle the tower of exponents efficiently.

This will help discover which \( n \) satisfy the divisibility condition and assist in conjecturing the exact answer.
