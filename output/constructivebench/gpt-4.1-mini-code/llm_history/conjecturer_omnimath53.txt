Testing values of n with attempts to find families without required chains...

n = 3
No chain family found: [set(), {0}, {1}]

n = 4
No chain family found: [set(), {0}, {1}, {2}]

n = 5
No chain family found: [set(), {0}, {1}, {2}, {3}]

n = 6
No chain family found: [set(), {0}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}]

n = 7
All tested families of size 7 contain required chain.
Suggest minimal n satisfies n ≤ 7. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<7>>>
