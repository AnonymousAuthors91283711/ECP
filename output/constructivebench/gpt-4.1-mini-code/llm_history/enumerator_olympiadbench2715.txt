The problem involves finding all real numbers \( x \) such that
\[
\lfloor \frac{x}{2} \rfloor - \lfloor \frac{x}{3} \rfloor = \frac{x}{7}.
\]
Since floor functions complicate direct algebraic solution, we will enumerate candidate \( x \) values. Notice that the right hand side is \( x/7 \), so if \( x \) must satisfy this exactly, \( x/7 \) must be an integer (because the left side is an integer).

Thus, the candidates are \( x = 7k \) for integers \( k \). For each integer \( k \), check if:
\[
\lfloor \frac{7k}{2} \rfloor - \lfloor \frac{7k}{3} \rfloor = k.
\]

We search over a reasonable range \( k \in [-20:20] \), print all solutions, and then output their sum.

```python
# Enumerate x = 7k with k in small integer range
# Check if floor(x/2) - floor(x/3) == x/7; x/7 = k
# Print each x found and after all print sum

def main():
    solutions = []
    print("Searching for real x with floor(x/2)-floor(x/3) = x/7")
    # Since x/7 must be integer, x=7*k with k integer
    for k in range(-20, 21):
        x = 7 * k
        left = (x // 2) - (x // 3)
        right = k
        if left == right:
            print(f"x = {x}")
            solutions.append(x)
    total = sum(solutions)
    print(f"Sum of all such x: {total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
