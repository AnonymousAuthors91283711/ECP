theorem P2006AIMEI_13 :
  IsGreatest {n : ℕ | n < 1000 ∧ ∃ m : ℕ, (∑ k in Finset.range (2^(n-1)), padicValNat 2 (2*k)) = m^2} P2006AIMEI_13_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating n with sum over k in range(2^(n-1)) of v2(2k) a perfect square
n=1 sum=0 (perfect square)
n=2 sum=1 (perfect square)
n=3 sum=4 (perfect square)
Maximum n with perfect square sum under 3: n=3 sum=4. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
