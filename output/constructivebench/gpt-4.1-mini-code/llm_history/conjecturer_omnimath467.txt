abbrev omnimath467_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath467 : 
  {n : ℕ | ∃ (s : Finset (ℝ × ℝ → Prop)), s.card = n ∧ 
  (∀ f ∈ s, ∃ (a b : ℝ), ∀ (x y : ℝ), f (x, y) ↔ a * x + b * y = 0) ∧
  (∀ (x y : ℝ), x^4 = x^2 * y^2 ↔ ∃ f ∈ s, f (x, y))} = {omnimath467_answer} := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Candidate lines covering x^4 = x^2 y^2 solutions:
Lines (a,b) = ((1, 0), (1, -1), (1, 1)) cover the set. Size = 3
Minimal number of lines needed is 3, lines: [(1, 0), (1, -1), (1, 1)]. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
