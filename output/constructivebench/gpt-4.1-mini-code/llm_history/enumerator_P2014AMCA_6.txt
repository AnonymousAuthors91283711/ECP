The problem involves finding two-digit numbers \( x = 10a + b \) with digits \( a \in [1,9] \) and \( b \in [0,9] \) satisfying the equation:

\[
(10a + b) - (10b + a) = 5(a + b)
\]

To assist, we'll enumerate all digit pairs \((a,b)\), check the condition, and print the number and the sum as stipulated. This will help conjecture the value of the sum \( x + (10b + a) \).

```python
# Enumerate two-digit numbers x = 10*a + b with a in 1..9, b in 0..9,
# check (10a + b) - (10b + a) == 5*(a + b),
# then print x and sum = x + reverse(x).

for a in range(1, 10):
    for b in range(0, 10):
        x = 10 * a + b
        y = 10 * b + a
        if (x - y) == 5 * (a + b):
            total = x + y
            print(f"x = {x}, a = {a}, b = {b}, x - y = {x - y}, 5(a+b) = {5*(a+b)}, sum = {total}")
```
