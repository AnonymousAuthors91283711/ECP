The problem appears to concern two graph-coloring parameters: the minimum number of colors needed so that adjacent nodes are differently colored (first coordinate), and similarly for corner-adjacent nodes (second coordinate). Since adjacency relations and the domain are ℕ (natural numbers), let's sample small finite subsets and try brute force coloring using small number of colors to find lower bounds and candidates. We'll print colorings that satisfy adjacency constraints for each tested number of colors.

```python
# Enumerate minimal coloring numbers for two adjacency types on small finite sets.
# We simulate adjacency and corner adjacency on [0..N-1] with sample definitions.
# For demonstration, adjacency: difference 1; corner adjacency: difference in {1,2}.
# Enumerate k-colorings for k=1..max_colors to find feasible k.

def Adjacent(r1, r2):
    return abs(r1 - r2) == 1

def CornerAdjacent(r1, r2):
    return abs(r1 - r2) in (1, 2)

N = 6  # Size of domain
max_colors = 4

def valid_coloring_adj(colors, adjacency_func):
    for r1 in range(N):
        for r2 in range(r1 + 1, N):
            if adjacency_func(r1, r2) and colors[r1] == colors[r2]:
                return False
    return True

print("Testing adjacency coloring")
for k in range(1, max_colors + 1):
    from itertools import product
    found = False
    for coloring in product(range(k), repeat=N):
        if valid_coloring_adj(coloring, Adjacent):
            print(f"Colors={k} feasible coloring: {coloring}")
            found = True
            break
    if found:
        print(f"Minimal Adjacent colors ≤ {k}")
        break

print("\nTesting corner adjacency coloring")
for k in range(1, max_colors + 1):
    from itertools import product
    found = False
    for coloring in product(range(k), repeat=N):
        if valid_coloring_adj(coloring, CornerAdjacent):
            print(f"Colors={k} feasible coloring: {coloring}")
            found = True
            break
    if found:
        print(f"Minimal CornerAdjacent colors ≤ {k}")
        break
```
