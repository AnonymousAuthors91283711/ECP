The problem involves finding a positive real number \(v\) such that two expressions for running/jumping times are equal. We want to find \(v\) satisfying:

\[
\frac{50}{v} + 5 \times (50 - 1) = \frac{50}{0.75v} + 5 \times \left(\frac{50}{2} - 1\right).
\]

Let's write a program that enumerates possible positive values of \(v\) over a reasonable range and checks the equality (within a small tolerance), printing candidate values of \(v\).

```python
# Enumerate possible values of v > 0 that satisfy the equality:
# 50/v + 5*(50-1) == 50/(0.75*v) + 5*(50/2-1)

def f(v):
    return 50/v + 5*(50 - 1)

def g(v):
    return 50/(0.75*v) + 5*(50/2 - 1)

tolerance = 1e-8

print("Enumerating possible values of v (speed) where running time equals jumping time:")

# We'll try values of v from 0.1 to 20 in small increments to find approximate matches.
for i in range(1, 2000):
    v = i * 0.01  # step size 0.01
    fv = f(v)
    gv = g(v)
    diff = fv - gv
    if abs(diff) < tolerance:
        # Print exact v (fraction) if possible, else float
        print(f"v = {v:.8f} gives running_time = jumping_time = {fv:.8f}")

# Since the problem involves rational expressions,
# let's do exact calculation symbolically to find v explicitly:
#
# 50/v + 5*49 = 50/(0.75*v) + 5*(25 - 1)
# 50/v + 245 = 50/(0.75 v) + 120
# Rearranging leads to:
# (50/v) - (50/(0.75 v)) = 120 - 245 = -125
# 50/v - (200/(3 v)) = -125
# (50 - 200/3)/v = -125
# (150/3 - 200/3)/v = -125
# (-50/3)/v = -125
# -50/(3 v) = -125
# 50/(3 v) = 125
# 1/v = 125 * 3 / 50 = 7.5
# v = 1/7.5 = 0.1333333...

v_exact = 1 / 7.5
running_time = f(v_exact)
jumping_time = g(v_exact)
print(f"\nExact solution v = 1/7.5 = {v_exact:.8f}")
print(f"Running time = {running_time:.8f}")
print(f"Jumping time = {jumping_time:.8f}")
```
