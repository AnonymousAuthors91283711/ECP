[write_program]
We want to find all real functions \(f:\mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}\) such that for all real \(x,y\):

\[
f(f(x)-y) \cdot f(x+f(y)) = x^2 - y^2.
\]

The problem is challenging algebraically; so, to assist, we will enumerate candidate functions from simple families (e.g., linear, affine, odd, even) and test the functional equation on a grid of sample values.

This program will:

- Test linear functions \(f(x)=ax+b\) for small integer \(a,b\).
- Print candidates that satisfy the relation for a small set of sample inputs \((x,y)\).
- Print the parameters and function expression when a candidate is found.

The testing points are small integers to keep computations manageable and cover some variety.

```python
import math

def test_func(f, samples):
    # Test all (x,y) in samples whether f satisfies f(f(x)-y)*f(x+f(y)) == x**2 - y**2 (within tolerance)
    tol = 1e-8
    for x in samples:
        for y in samples:
            lhs = f(f(x) - y)*f(x + f(y))
            rhs = x**2 - y**2
            if abs(lhs - rhs) > tol:
                return False
    return True

def linear_candidates():
    # Try small integers for a,b in f(x)=a*x + b
    for a in range(-3,4):
        for b in range(-3,4):
            # Skip zero function to avoid trivial
            if a==0 and b==0:
                continue
            def f(x, a=a, b=b):
                return a*x + b
            # Sample points
            samples = [-2,-1,0,1,2]
            if test_func(f, samples):
                print(f"Candidate linear f(x) = {a}*x + {b}")

def try_parity():
    # Try odd functions: f(-x) = -f(x)
    # For f(x) = a*x (odd and linear), test
    for a in range(-3,4):
        if a == 0:
            continue
        def f(x, a=a):
            return a*x
        samples = [-2,-1,0,1,2]
        if test_func(f, samples):
            print(f"Candidate odd linear f(x) = {a}*x")

def main():
    linear_candidates()
    try_parity()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This will print candidate linear functions that satisfy the equation on the tested sample points. This may guide conjectures about the solution set.
