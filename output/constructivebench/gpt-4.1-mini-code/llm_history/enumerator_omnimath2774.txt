The problem involves multisets of elements from the set {0,1,2,3} with strict upper bounds on the counts of each element and a fixed total size n, and asks for the least n such that every such multiset has at least 3 occurrences of some element.

We want to find the minimal n such that for every multiset s of size n with:
- count 0 ≤ 13,
- count 1 ≤ 5,
- count 2 ≤ 1,
- count 3 ≤ 9,

it holds that s.count of at least one element is ≥ 3.

This means: find the minimal n such that no multiset of size n with these count upper bounds falls entirely below 3 occurrences in every element.

Approach:
- Check multisets with counts of each element less than 3 (0,1,2),
- respecting the upper bounds given,
- find maximum possible sum n=max count 0 + count 1 + count 2 + count 3 with all counts <3 and respecting upper bounds,
- the minimal n where this fails (forces at least count ≥3 in one element) is minimal n above that maximum sum.

We enumerate all quadruples (c0,c1,c2,c3) with each c_i in {0,1,2} (because counts <3), respecting the upper bounds,
record the max c0+c1+c2+c3, then minimal n is that value +1.

We also check if any counts are restrained further (like max c0=13, but <3 means max 2 for the purpose), so upper bounds are not restrictive here for counts<3.

Let's code this enumeration.

```python
# Enumerate possible multisets with counts < 3 and not exceeding given upper bounds
# Find max total size, minimal n is max+1

max_n = 0
for c0 in range(3):
    if c0 > 13:
        continue
    for c1 in range(3):
        if c1 > 5:
            continue
        for c2 in range(3):
            if c2 > 1:
                continue
            for c3 in range(3):
                if c3 > 9:
                    continue
                total = c0 + c1 + c2 + c3
                if total > max_n:
                    max_n = total
                    print(f"Possible size {total} with counts: 0->{c0},1->{c1},2->{c2},3->{c3}")

print(f"Minimal n forcing a count >=3: {max_n + 1}")
```
