The problem involves summing over all permutations σ of a 7-element set, the value (7 - number_of_cycles_in_σ). We enumerate permutations of S_7, find their cycle counts, and sum 7 - cycle_count. We'll print every partial sum as we find it, and finally print the total sum.

```python
import math
from itertools import permutations

def cycle_count(perm):
    n = len(perm)
    visited = [False]*n
    cycles = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            cycles += 1
            current = i
            while not visited[current]:
                visited[current] = True
                current = perm[current]-1
    return cycles

def main():
    n = 7
    total_sum = 0
    # Permutations of [1..7] (1-based indexing)
    elems = list(range(1, n+1))
    for idx, p in enumerate(permutations(elems)):
        c = cycle_count(p)
        val = n - c
        total_sum += val
        # Print partial result immediately
        print(f"Permutation #{idx+1}: cycles={c}, value={val}, partial_sum={total_sum}")
    # After enumerating all:
    print(f"omnimath1290_answer = {total_sum}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
