Ground Truth Answer: {10^(100 : ℝ), 10^(1/100)}
Proposed Answer: {x : ℝ | x = Real.exp 20.797947 ∨ x = Real.exp 0.048082}
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

1. The ground truth gives two solutions:
   - 10^100
   - 10^(1/100)

2. The proposed answer gives two solutions in terms of exp:
   - exp(20.797947)
   - exp(0.048082)

Now let's compare the numerical values:
- exp(20.797947) ≈ 1.0715e9 (which is not equal to 10^100 ≈ 1e100)
- exp(0.048082) ≈ 1.0493 (which is not equal to 10^(1/100) ≈ 1.0233)

The proposed answer gives completely different numerical values from the ground truth. The expressions are also not equivalent mathematically, as exp(x) is not the same as 10^x.
