Ground Truth Answer: fun n => 8 * n
Proposed Answer: fun n => 2 * n
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a function f(n) that satisfies:
   - f(n) is even
   - 9n is not even
   - n+8 is not even
   - n² is not even
   - n(n-2) is not even
   - All these must hold when n=7

2. Ground truth answer (8*n):
   - 8*7=56 (even) ✔
   - 9*7=63 (not even) ✔
   - 7+8=15 (not even) ✔
   - 7²=49 (not even) ✔
   - 7*5=35 (not even) ✔

3. Proposed answer (2*n):
   - 2*7=14 (even) ✔
   - 9*7=63 (not even) ✔
   - 7+8=15 (not even) ✔
   - 7²=49 (not even) ✔
   - 7*5=35 (not even) ✔

Both answers satisfy all conditions when n=7. The problem only specifies that these conditions must hold when n=7, and both functions satisfy this. While 8*n would be even for all n, and 2*n would be even for all n, the problem only requires it to hold at n=7.
