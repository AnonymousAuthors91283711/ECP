The original candidate tries to mix quantifiers and logical connectives incorrectly, leading to a parsing error. Also, the expression uses an invalid syntax around the lambda and equality in Lean.

From the enumerated sequences, the sum over n of (a n)^m = m for all positive integers m seems impossible to achieve with a nontrivial sequence (since for typical powers we see sums approaching values less than or greater than m). The problem likely wants to state that there does not exist such a sequence a : ℕ → ℝ satisfying ∀ m > 0, ∑' n, (a n)^m = m.

Hence the final answer (omnimath3162_answer) should be the proposition that no such sequence exists.

In Lean, this can be expressed simply as:

¬ ∃ (a : ℕ → ℝ), ∀ (m : ℕ), m > 0 → ∑' (n : ℕ), (a n)^m = m

This avoids all syntactical issues and matches the intuition from the enumerated data.

<<<¬ ∃ a : ℕ → ℝ, ∀ m : ℕ, m > 0 → ∑' n, (a n)^m = m>>>
