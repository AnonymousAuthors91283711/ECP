The problem asks to describe or characterize all real numbers y that can be written in the form y = (a*b + b²) / (a² + b²) with positive real numbers a,b. To gain intuition and form conjectures, we will enumerate values of y for sample positive pairs (a,b). We output each y exactly as a reduced fraction if possible or as a float. This helps conjecture the image set.

```python
from fractions import Fraction
import math

print("Enumerating values of y = (a*b + b^2)/(a^2 + b^2) for positive integers a,b up to 20:")

def approx_equal(f, tol=1e-12):
    # To avoid duplicate close approximations
    return round(f, 12)

seen = set()
for a in range(1, 21):
    for b in range(1, 21):
        numerator = a*b + b*b
        denominator = a*a + b*b
        # Try to create fraction when possible
        f = Fraction(numerator, denominator)
        # Normalize fraction (for distinctness)
        # Also convert to float for filtering duplicates
        val = float(f)
        key = approx_equal(val)
        if key not in seen:
            seen.add(key)
            print(f"a={a} b={b} y={f} ≈ {val:.6f}")

print("\nCandidates are between 0 and 1 since (a*b + b^2) <= (a^2 + b^2) for all positive a,b is not universally true, let's check extremes:")

# Check boundary by fixing a=1 and varying b continuously
print("\nChecking y when a=1 and b varies from 0.1 to 5.0:")
for b in [0.1 * i for i in range(1, 51)]:
    y = (1*b + b*b)/(1 + b*b)
    print(f"b={b:.1f} y={y:.6f}")

print("\nCheck y for a=b from 1 to 20 (a=b):")
for x in range(1, 21):
    y = (x*x + x*x)/(x*x + x*x)  # reduces to 1
    print(f"a=b={x} y=1")

print("\nCheck y for b very small relative to a (b=1, a large):")
for a in range(1, 21):
    y = (a*1 + 1*1)/(a*a + 1)
    print(f"a={a} b=1 y={y:.6f}")

print("\nCheck y for a very small relative to b (a=1, b large):")
for b in range(1, 21):
    y = (1*b + b*b)/(1 + b*b)
    print(f"a=1 b={b} y={y:.6f}")
