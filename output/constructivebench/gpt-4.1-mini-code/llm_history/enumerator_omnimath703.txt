The problem involves selecting a subset \( s \) of size 5 from \(\{0,\dots,9\}\), defining two sets of edges connecting pairs inside \( s \) and inside its complement, and seeking the smallest number \( n \) such that for every \( s \), the number of these edges is \( \leq n \), and the induced graph on \( s \) is connected (has a path between any two vertices).

We will:
- Enumerate subsets \( s \subseteq \{0,\dots,9\} \) of size 5.
- Construct edges inside \( s \) and inside its complement.
- Count edges.
- Check connectivity within \( s \) induced by \( edges \).
- Print all edge counts while checking connectivity.
- Finally, print the minimum valid \( n \) (maximum edges count over connected cases).

```python
from itertools import combinations, product
from collections import deque

def is_connected(s, edges):
    # Check if the induced graph on s is connected using BFS
    adj = {x: set() for x in s}
    for (a,b) in edges:
        if a in s and b in s:
            adj[a].add(b)
            adj[b].add(a)
    start = next(iter(s))
    visited = {start}
    queue = deque([start])
    while queue:
        u = queue.popleft()
        for w in adj[u]:
            if w not in visited:
                visited.add(w)
                queue.append(w)
    return visited == set(s)

def main():
    all_nums = set(range(10))
    counts = []
    # Enumerate all subsets s of size 5
    for s in combinations(range(10), 5):
        s_set = set(s)
        t = all_nums - s_set
        # Edges inside s (undirected pairs with a < b)
        edges_s = {(a,b) for a,b in combinations(s, 2)}
        # Edges inside t (undirected pairs with a < b)
        edges_t = {(a,b) for a,b in combinations(t, 2)}
        edges = edges_s | edges_t
        c = len(edges)
        # Check connectivity inside s using edges_s only (edges inside s)
        # But original problem states edges := edges_s âˆª edges_t, so connectivity
        # on s only uses edges between s-vertices in edges_s
        # connectivity must use edges from edges (which includes edges_t also)
        # but edges connect only within s or within t separately, and 
        # connectivity among s vertices must come from edges_s only.
        # So connectivity on s vertices using only edges_s.
        if is_connected(s_set, edges):
            print(f"Subset {s} edges count: {c} connected")
            counts.append(c)
        else:
            print(f"Subset {s} edges count: {c} disconnected")
    if counts:
        print("Minimal n with connectivity condition (max edges over connected cases):", max(counts))

    main()
