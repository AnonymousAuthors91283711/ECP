The problem involves ticket prices for adults and children, with the child price half the adult price, and given a total for some number of tickets. We want to find the total cost for a different number of tickets.

Let's enumerate to find the adult and child ticket prices satisfying the conditions, then compute the total for the second scenario.

```python
# Enumerate possible adult and child prices using the conditions:
# child_price = adult_price / 2
# 5 * adult_price + 4 * child_price = 24.50
# Then compute 8 * adult_price + 6 * child_price.

# Since the prices are positive and reasonable, we try adult_price from 1 to 10 with small increments.

def frange(start, stop, step):
    x = start
    while x <= stop:
        yield round(x, 2)
        x += step

for adult_price in frange(1, 10, 0.01):
    child_price = adult_price / 2
    total = 5 * adult_price + 4 * child_price
    # Check if total is 24.50 with a small tolerance
    if abs(total - 24.50) < 0.001:
        answer = 8 * adult_price + 6 * child_price
        print(f"Adult price: {adult_price}, Child price: {child_price}, Answer: {answer}")
```

This will reveal the exact adult and child ticket prices and the requested total.
