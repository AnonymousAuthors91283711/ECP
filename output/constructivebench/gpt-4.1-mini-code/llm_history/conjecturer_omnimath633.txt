abbrev omnimath633_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath633 : 
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ ∃ (P Q : ℤ[X]), (X + 1)^n - 1 = (X^2 + 1) * P + 3 * Q} omnimath633_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Checking powers of (X+1) in F3[X]/(X^2+1):
n=1: (X+1)^1 = 1 + 1*X mod 3 and X^2+1
n=2: (X+1)^2 = 0 + 2*X mod 3 and X^2+1
n=3: (X+1)^3 = 1 + 2*X mod 3 and X^2+1
n=4: (X+1)^4 = 2 + 0*X mod 3 and X^2+1
n=5: (X+1)^5 = 2 + 2*X mod 3 and X^2+1
n=6: (X+1)^6 = 0 + 1*X mod 3 and X^2+1
n=7: (X+1)^7 = 2 + 1*X mod 3 and X^2+1
n=8: (X+1)^8 = 1 + 0*X mod 3 and X^2+1
Smallest n > 0 with (X+1)^n = 1 is 8. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<8>>>
