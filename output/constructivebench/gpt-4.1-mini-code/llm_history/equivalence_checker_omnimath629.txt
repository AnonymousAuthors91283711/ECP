Ground Truth Answer: fun n => 2^(2 * n)
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => 4 ^ n
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer `fun n : ℕ => 4 ^ n` is equivalent to the ground truth answer `fun n => 2^(2 * n)` because:
1. By exponent rules, 4^n = (2^2)^n = 2^(2*n)
2. Both expressions represent the same function that counts the number of possible ordered triples (A, B, C) where A ⊆ B and (Sn \ A) ⊆ C
3. For each of the n elements, there are 4 independent choices (whether to be in A and B, or not in A but in C, etc.), leading to 4^n possibilities
