The problem involves finding the maximum size \( n \) of an injective function \( f: \text{Fin } n \to \text{Fin } 8 \times \text{Fin } 8 \) with a certain oddness condition on the counts of row and column attackers. To assist in conjecturing the maximum \( n \), we'll enumerate all possible injective functions of small sizes \( n \) and check the condition. Due to complexity, we'll test for small \( n \) up to some limit, printing feasible \( n \) whenever found.

```python
# Enumerate all injective functions f: Fin n -> Fin 8 x Fin 8 satisfying the oddness condition.
# For each n from 1 to max_n, check possible f's.
# Due to combinatorial explosion, restrict to small n (<=5).
# Print n whenever a function satisfying conditions is found.

    n = len(f)
    # f: list of pairs (x,y) with x,y in 0..7 (Fin 8)
    # Condition for each k in 0..n-1:
    # row_attackers = {i<k | f[i].x == f[k].x and for all j: i<j<k => f[j].x != f[k].x}
    # Similarly for col_attackers.
    # The parity of len(row_attackers) + len(col_attackers) must be odd for all k.
    for k in range(n):
        xk, yk = f[k]
        # Find row_attackers
        row_att = []
        for i in range(k):
            if f[i][0] == xk:
