The problem counts the number of functions \(f: \{0,1,\ldots,2001\} \to \mathbb{Z}\) with values in \([1,2002]\) such that consecutive values differ by at most 2 (circularly). To conjecture a pattern, I'll enumerate smaller cases \(n\)-length sequences with values in \([1,n]\) satisfying the same condition, and print counts.

```python
# Enumerate the number of sequences of length n, values in [1,n], 
# with consecutive differences ≤ 2 (circular), and print counts.
# This is a circular condition: |f[i]-f[(i+1) mod n]| ≤ 2.

def count_sequences(n):
    # dp[i][v]: number of sequences of length i, ending at value v
    # We'll keep track of sequences for the first n-1 elements,
    # then check the circle condition on the last element and first element.
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    if n == 1:
        # Only sequences of length 1 with values 1..1, difference condition trivial.
        print(f"n=1, count=1")
        return 1

    vals = range(1,n+1)
    dp = [defaultdict(int) for _ in range(n)]
    # Base case, sequences of length 1
    for v in vals:
        dp[0][v] = 1

    for i in range(1,n):
        for v in vals:
            # v can follow any u where |u - v| ≤ 2
            total = 0
            for u in range(max(1, v - 2), min(n, v + 2) + 1):
                total += dp[i-1][u]
            dp[i][v] = total

    # Now sum dp[n-1][v] where final v completes circle: |v - first| ≤ 2
    total_count = 0
    # First element candidates
    for first in vals:
        for last in vals:
            if abs(last - first) <= 2:
                total_count += dp[n-1][last] if n == 1 else dp[n-1][last]

    print(f"n={n}, count={total_count}")
    return total_count

# Test small values and print counts to conjecture formula
for n in range(1,7):
    count_sequences(n)
```
