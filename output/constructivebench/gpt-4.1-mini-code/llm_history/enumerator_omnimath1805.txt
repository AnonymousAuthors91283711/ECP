The problem is about counting the number of perfect squares k that divide \(10^{10}\). Because \(10^{10} = (2 \cdot 5)^{10} = 2^{10} \cdot 5^{10}\), any divisor k is of the form \(2^a 5^b\) where \(0 \leq a,b \leq 10\).

For k to be a perfect square, both \(a\) and \(b\) must be even integers in the range [0,10]. So, enumerate even exponents a,b in this range and count such divisors.

We'll write a Python program enumerating all such k and print them along with count.

```python
# Enumerate all perfect square divisors k of 10^10, where k = 2^a * 5^b with even a,b <= 10

def main():
    limit_exp = 10
    results = []
    count = 0
    print("Enumerating perfect square divisors k of 10^10:")
    for a in range(0, limit_exp+1, 2):  # even exponents for 2
        for b in range(0, limit_exp+1, 2):  # even exponents for 5
            k = (2 ** a) * (5 ** b)
            print(f"k = 2^{a} * 5^{b} = {k}")
            count += 1
    print(f"Total perfect square divisors of 10^10: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
