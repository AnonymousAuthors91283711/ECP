This appears to be a problem about primes \( p \) for which the set
\[
\{(x,y) \in (\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^2 : y^2 \equiv x^3 + 4x \pmod p \}
\]
has exactly \( p \) elements. In other words, the number of solutions to \( y^2 = x^3 + 4x \) over the finite field \( \mathbb{F}_p \) is \( p \).

We want to check primes \( p \) (small ones for enumeration) and count the number of solutions \((x,y)\) modulo \(p\) satisfying the curve equation.

The code below tries small primes \( p \), counts solutions, prints those \( p \) with solution count equal to \( p \) as candidates.

```python
# Enumerate primes p, count solutions (x,y) mod p to y^2 = x^3 + 4x (mod p), check when count == p

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2: return False
    if n in (2,3): return True
    if n%2==0: return False
    r = int(n**0.5)
    for i in range(3,r+1,2):
        if n%i==0:
            return False
    return True

def count_solutions(p):
    count = 0
    # Precompute squares mod p for fast check
    squares = { (y*y)%p for y in range(p) }
    for x in range(p):
        val = (x*x*x + 4*x) % p
        if val in squares:
            # y^2 = val has solutions, possibly 0,1 or 2 solutions
            # We count number of y with y^2 == val
            # Count how many y satisfy y^2 = val
            # y^2 == val means y in {val's square roots}
            # Since we have set of squares, we must count duplicates
            # Actually, to count exact solutions, iterate y and count matches
            solutions_y = sum(1 for y in range(p) if (y*y)%p == val)
            count += solutions_y
    return count

def main():
    print("Enumerating primes p where #solutions to y^2 = x^3 + 4x (mod p) equals p")
    limit = 100  # limit primes up to 100 for speed and brevity
    for p in range(2, limit+1):
        if is_prime(p):
            sol_count = count_solutions(p)
            # Print info
            print(f"p={p}, solutions={sol_count}")
            if sol_count == p:
                print(f"Candidate prime with #solutions = p: {p}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
