The problem involves finding triples \((a,b,c)\) such that there exist integers \(x,y,z\) with \(|x|,|y|,|z| \leq 2n\), not all zero, satisfying \(a x + b y + c z = 0\). For fixed \(n\), we want to enumerate such triples \((a,b,c)\) and show the equivalence.

To explore and conjecture, we can:
- Fix small \(n\).
- Enumerate all \((x,y,z)\) with \(|x,y,z| \leq 2n\), at least one nonzero.
- For each \((x,y,z)\), consider all \((a,b,c)\) with coefficients small enough, e.g., from -threshold to threshold.
- Check if \(a x + b y + c z=0\).
- Print all \((a,b,c)\) found, as candidates.
- For efficiency, limit \(|a|, |b|, |c|\) to some small range.

This approach can help us identify the set of such triples \((a,b,c)\) for given \(n\).

```python
# Enumerate triples (a,b,c) that satisfy ∃ (x,y,z) ≠ (0,0,0) with |x|,|y|,|z| ≤ 2n and a x + b y + c z = 0
# For a fixed n and bounded ranges for (a,b,c), print all such (a,b,c).

    return range(-m, m+1)

def main():
    # Sample values for n
    for n in [1, 2]:
        print(f"n = {n}")
        bound_xyz = 2*n
        # build list of (x,y,z) with |x,y,z| ≤ 2n and not all zero
        xyz_list = [(x,y,z) for x in range(-bound_xyz, bound_xyz+1)
                              for y in range(-bound_xyz, bound_xyz+1)
                              for z in range(-bound_xyz, bound_xyz+1)
                              if not (x == 0 and y == 0 and z == 0)]
        # limit for (a,b,c) coefficients, motivated by observing solutions
        bound_abc = 5
        found = set()
        for a in sign_range(bound_abc):
            for b in sign_range(bound_abc):
                for c in sign_range(bound_abc):
                    if a == 0 and b == 0 and c == 0:
                        continue
                    # check if there exists (x,y,z) in xyz_list with a x + b y + c z = 0
                    if any(a*x + b*y + c*z == 0 for (x,y,z) in xyz_list):
                        triple = (a,b,c)
                        if triple not in found:
                            found.add(triple)
                            print(f"a={a} b={b} c={c}")
