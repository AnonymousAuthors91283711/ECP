The problem statement is minimal and abstract, involving rational arithmetic in Lean or a formal math library: specifically evaluating (20 + 16*20) / (20*16) and relating it to some rational number omnimath2698_answer. 

To assist in conjecturing about the value of the expression, let's write a Python program that calculates and prints the rational number (20 + 16*20) / (20*16) exactly, then enumerates simpler forms or approximations if needed.

We won't hardcode the final value but simply compute and print it. Since this is straightforward rational arithmetic, no parameters need to be varied here. I'll print the exact fraction and its float approximation.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Compute the expression (20 + 16 * 20) / (20 * 16)
num = 20 + 16 * 20
den = 20 * 16
expr = Fraction(num, den)

print(f"Exact value: {expr}")

# Show numerator and denominator separately
print(f"Numerator: {expr.numerator}")
print(f"Denominator: {expr.denominator}")

# Approximate decimal value
print(f"Decimal approx: {float(expr):.6f}")

# Enumerate fractions with small denominators that might match expr
print("Simplifications or equal fractions with small denominators:")
for d in range(1, 21):
    n = round(float(expr) * d)
    candidate = Fraction(n, d)
    if candidate == expr:
        print(f"{candidate} == {expr}")
```

This will print the exact fraction, its numerator and denominator, decimal value, and any equivalent fractions with denominator up to 20. This assists in conjecturing the simplified exact value of the expression.
