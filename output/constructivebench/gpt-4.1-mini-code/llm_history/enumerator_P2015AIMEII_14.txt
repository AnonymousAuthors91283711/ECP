The problem involves real numbers \(x, y\) satisfying two symmetric polynomial equations, and asks for the value of a specific symmetric expression \(2x^3 + (xy)^3 + 2y^3\).

We can try small positive rational values, or use substitution to explore possible values, but to assist in conjecturing, let's enumerate solutions \(x, y\) over some grid (e.g., rational values with denominators up to 5), check which pairs satisfy the equations approximately, then print the corresponding target expression value.

We prioritize exact values when possible, but here we accept near-equality within a small tolerance.

```python
from fractions import Fraction
from math import isclose

# Enumerate candidates for x,y as fractions with denominator up to 5 in range 1/5..5
# Only consider positive x,y (since powers are even/odd and given sums positive)
denoms = [1,2,3,4,5]
nums = list(range(1,26))  # numerator up to 25 for range up to 5 (25/5=5)
tolerance = 1e-6

def val(frac):
    return float(frac)

def check_eq(a, b):
    return isclose(a, b, abs_tol=tolerance)

found_values = set()

print("Enumerating candidates for x,y in rational numbers with small denominators...")

for dx in denoms:
    for nx in nums:
        x = Fraction(nx, dx)
        xv = val(x)
        for dy in denoms:
            for ny in nums:
                y = Fraction(ny, dy)
                yv = val(y)
                lhs1 = (xv**4)*(yv**5) + (yv**4)*(xv**5)
                lhs2 = (xv**3)*(yv**6) + (yv**3)*(xv**6)
                if check_eq(lhs1, 810) and check_eq(lhs2, 945):
                    val_expr = 2*(xv**3) + (xv*yv)**3 + 2*(yv**3)
                    # Round to 6 decimals for grouping candidates
                    val_r = round(val_expr,6)
                    if val_r not in found_values:
                        found_values.add(val_r)
                        print(f"x={x} ({xv:.4f}), y={y} ({yv:.4f}), 2x^3+(xy)^3+2y^3 â‰ˆ {val_r}")

print("\nEnumerating complete. Candidates above.")
```
This code tries to find approximate rational \(x,y\) solutions and prints the corresponding expression value, aiding conjecture of the exact answer.
