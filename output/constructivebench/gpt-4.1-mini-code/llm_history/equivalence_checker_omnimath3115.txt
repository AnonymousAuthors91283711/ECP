sorry

Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: 60
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem asks for a natural number `omnimath3115_answer` such that:
   - 2 raised to this power equals 8 raised to 20
   - This is the unique natural number solution

2. We can rewrite 8^20 as (2^3)^20 = 2^(3*20) = 2^60

3. Therefore, 2^n = 8^20 is equivalent to 2^n = 2^60, which implies n = 60

4. The proposed answer is 60, which correctly satisfies both conditions:
   - 2^60 = 8^20 (as shown above)
   - It's the unique solution since exponential functions are injective
