Ground Truth Answer: 134
Proposed Answer: 81
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer.

The problem is asking for the smallest positive integer n such that:
1. There exists a distribution of votes among 27 candidates totaling n votes
2. For each candidate, (100 * votes_i)/n < votes_i - 1

This can be interpreted as finding the minimal n where for each candidate, their percentage of votes (100*votes_i/n) is less than one percentage point below their actual vote count (votes_i - 1).

The ground truth answer is 134, while the proposed answer is 81.

To check if 81 could be correct:
- For n=81, the condition requires (100*votes_i)/81 < votes_i - 1
- This simplifies to votes_i > 100*votes_i/81 + 1
- For votes_i=1: 1 > 100/81 + 1 ≈ 2.23 → False
- Even for higher votes_i, the inequality is hard to satisfy for all 27 candidates with total 81 votes

The proposed answer 81 is too small to satisfy the conditions for all candidates. The correct minimal n is indeed 134, as this allows for a distribution where each candidate's percentage is properly bounded.
