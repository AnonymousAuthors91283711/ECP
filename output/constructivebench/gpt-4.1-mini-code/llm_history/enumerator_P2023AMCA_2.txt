[write_program]
The problem appears to involve finding a rational number \( w \) satisfying the linear equation 
\[
\frac{1}{3} w + \frac{7}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} w + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{4}.
\]
I will write a Python program to compute \( w \) exactly as a rational number and print it immediately, using the fractions module for exact rational arithmetic.

```python
# Python program to solve (1/3)*w + (7/2)*(1/4) = (3/4)*w + (1/2)*(1/4)
from fractions import Fraction

# Coefficients
a_left = Fraction(1, 3)
a_right = Fraction(3, 4)
const_left = Fraction(7, 2) * Fraction(1, 4)
const_right = Fraction(1, 2) * Fraction(1, 4)

# Solve for w: a_left * w + const_left = a_right * w + const_right
# (a_left - a_right) * w = const_right - const_left
denom = a_left - a_right
numer = const_right - const_left

if denom != 0:
    w = numer / denom
    print("w =", w)
else:
    print("No unique solution.")

```
