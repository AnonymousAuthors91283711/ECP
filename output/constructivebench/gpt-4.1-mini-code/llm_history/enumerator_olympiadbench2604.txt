The problem is about finding the smallest number \( n > 20 \) such that:
- The base-20 representation of \( n \) is a palindrome.
- The base-14 representation of \( n \) is also a palindrome.

We will enumerate \( n \) starting from 21 upwards, convert it to base 20 and base 14, check if both representations are palindromes, and print all such numbers found up to some limit for thoroughness. Finally, we will identify the smallest such \( n \).

```python
def to_base(n, base):
    digits = []
    while n > 0:
        digits.append(n % base)
        n //= base
    return digits[::-1] if digits else [0]

def is_palindrome(lst):
    return lst == lst[::-1]

def main():
    print("Searching for n > 20 with palindromic base-20 and base-14 representations...")
    limit = 100_000  # search range sufficiently large
    found = []
    for n in range(21, limit):
        b20 = to_base(n, 20)
        b14 = to_base(n, 14)
        if is_palindrome(b20) and is_palindrome(b14):
            print(n)
            found.append(n)
            if len(found) == 5:
                # Print only first 5 such numbers to avoid too long output
                break
    if found:
        print("Minimum such n:", min(found))
    else:
        print("No such number found up to", limit)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
