abbrev P2015AMCB_2_answer : ℕ × ℕ → ℕ × ℕ := sorry
theorem P2015AMCB_2 : P2015AMCB_2_answer (13, 0) = (15, 30) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun (startHour, startMin) => 
    let startTime := startHour * 60 + startMin
    let endSecondTask := 14 * 60 + 40
    let duration := (endSecondTask - startTime) / 2
    let totalDuration := 3 * duration
    let finishTime := startTime + totalDuration
    (finishTime / 60, finishTime % 60)
Proposed Answer: fun p : ℕ × ℕ => let (a, b) := p; (a + 2 * b, 15 * b)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem appears to be about calculating the finish time of tasks based on start time and durations.

2. Ground Truth Answer:
   - Takes (startHour, startMin)
   - Calculates start time in minutes
   - Sets end of second task at 14:40 (14*60 + 40)
   - Calculates duration as half the time between start and 14:40
   - Total duration is 3 times this duration
   - Calculates finish time and converts back to (hours, minutes)

3. Proposed Answer:
   - Simply takes a pair (a,b) and returns (a + 2*b, 15*b)
   - For input (13,0) it would return (13 + 0, 0) = (13,0)
   - But the theorem states it should return (15,30) for (13,0)

The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth logic at all. It's a completely different computation that doesn't account for:
- The fixed end time of 14:40
- The duration calculations
- The time arithmetic

For the specific case in the theorem (13,0):
- Ground truth would calculate correctly to (15,30)
- Proposed answer gives (13,0)
