The problem involves finding all real numbers \(a\) such that there exists a function \(f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}\) with:
- \(f\) not the identity (exists \(x\) with \(f(x) \neq x\)),
- \(f(ax) = a^2 f(x)\) for all real \(x\),
- \(f(f(x)) = a f(x)\) for all real \(x\).

We want to enumerate possible values of \(a\) and check if the conditions can hold for some \(f\).

Key observations:
- Trying small integer values of \(a\).
- For each \(a\), we try simple plausible functions \(f\) (e.g., linear \(f(x) = kx\)) and check the conditions.
- The functional equations are algebraic; linear functions are a starting point.
- We print values \(a\) where such \(f\) is constructible.

```python
# Enumerate candidate real values a and check possible f satisfying the conditions.
# We'll limit to small integers and rational fractions for demonstration.
# Check linear functions f(x) = kx, which lend themselves to easy algebraic checks.

def test_a(a):
    # f(x) = kx
    # Condition 1: exists x with f(x)!=x => k != 1
    # Condition 2: f(a x) = a^2 f(x) => k a x = a^2 k x => k a = a^2 k => k a = a^2 k
    # Trivially holds for all x (if k=0 or a=0), but let's solve precisely:
    # Actually this simplifies to no condition since both sides equal k a x.
    # Wait, careful:
    # f(a x) = k a x
    # a^2 f(x) = a^2 k x
    # So k a x = a^2 k x => k a = a^2 k => k a - a^2 k = 0 => k a (1 - a) = 0
    # So either k=0 or a=1  (Note: if a=0 then both sides zero)
    # Condition 3: f(f(x)) = a f(x)
    # f(f(x)) = f(k x) = k k x = k^2 x
    # a f(x) = a k x
    # So for all x: k^2 x = a k x => k^2 = a k => k^2 - a k = 0 => k(k - a) = 0
    # So k=0 or k=a

    # Combine:
    # From cond 2: k=0 or a=1
    # From cond 3: k=0 or k=a
    # Also k != 1 (to avoid f(x)=x)
    # Explore cases:

    results = []

    # Case a=0
    if abs(a) < 1e-12:
        # cond 2: k a = a^2 k always true as all zero
        # cond 3: k^2 = a k => k^2 = 0 => k=0
        # k=0 trivial f(x)=0, f(f(x))=0 = a f(x)=0, holds
        # But k=0 means f(x)=0. Is f(x)=x? No, unless x=0
        # So f differs from identity whenever x != 0
        # Thus a=0 works with f=0
        results.append((a, 0))
    else:
        # a !=0
        if abs(a - 1.0) < 1e-12:
            # a=1
            # cond2: k a (1 - a) = 0 -> always true (a=1)
            # cond3: k(k - a)=0 -> k=0 or k=1
            # k=1 ruled out since f(x)=x disallowed
            # So k=0 possible
            # f=0
            results.append((a,0))
        else:
            # a !=0 and a !=1
            # cond2: k a (1 - a) =0 => either k=0 or a=1(not)
            # So k=0
            # cond3 k=0 or k=a, so k=0
            # k=0 allowed, f(x)=0
            results.append((a,0))

    # Analyze k values found and print viable a and k !=1 cases
    # To be "not identity", k !=1
    valid = []
