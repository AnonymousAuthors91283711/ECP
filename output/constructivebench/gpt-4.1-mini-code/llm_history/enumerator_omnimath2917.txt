The problem is to find all integers \(a\) such that the polynomial \(X^2 + aX + 1\) has 1 as a root. We express "1 is a root" by plugging \(X=1\) into the polynomial and setting it to zero:
\[ 1^2 + a \cdot 1 + 1 = 0 \implies 1 + a + 1 = 0 \implies a + 2 = 0 \implies a = -2. \]

This is straightforward, but we will enumerate over a small range of integer a values, checking the polynomial root condition, and print all \(a\) that satisfy the condition to confirm uniqueness.

```python
# Enumerate integer a values to find those where 1 is a root of X^2 + aX + 1

def is_root(a):
    # Check if 1 is root of X^2 + aX + 1
    return 1**2 + a*1 + 1 == 0

# Enumerate a in range -10 to 10
for a in range(-10, 11):
    if is_root(a):
        print(f"a = {a} satisfies (1)^2 + {a}*1 +1 = 0")

print("Unique solution is a = -2")
```
