The problem is asking for the least positive integer \( k \) such that there exists a function \( f : \mathbb{Z} \to \{1, \dots, k\} \) assigning sets (intervals) of integers from 1 to \( k \) to each integer \( x \), with the property that for all integers \( x, y \), if \( |x - y| \in \{5, 7, 12\} \), then \( f(x) \neq f(y) \).

This is a coloring problem on the integers with forbidden distances 5, 7, and 12. The smallest number of colors \( k \) for which such a coloring exists is required.

The program below enumerates \( k \) from 1 to a small threshold (e.g., 10), and for each \( k \), tries to color a finite segment of integers (e.g., 0 to 20) with \( k \) colors so that no two points at distance 5, 7, or 12 share the same color. It prints all \( k \) for which such a coloring is found, then outputs the minimal such \( k \).

```python
# Enumerate minimal k for coloring integers with forbidden distances 5,7,12

def is_valid_coloring(colors, dists):
    n = len(colors)
    for i in range(n):
        for dist in dists:
            j = i + dist
            if j < n and colors[i] == colors[j]:
                return False
    return True

def backtrack(colors, pos, k, n, dists):
    if pos == n:
        return True
    for color in range(1, k+1):
        colors[pos] = color
        # check only distances back (pos - dist)
        valid = True
        for dist in dists:
            prev = pos - dist
            if prev >= 0 and colors[prev] == color:
                valid = False
                break
        if valid and backtrack(colors, pos+1, k, n, dists):
            return True
    return False

def find_min_k(max_k=10, segment_length=20):
    dists = [5,7,12]
    valid_ks = []
    for k in range(1, max_k+1):
        colors = [0]*segment_length
        if backtrack(colors, 0, k, segment_length, dists):
            print(f"Possible k: {k}")
            valid_ks.append(k)
    if valid_ks:
        print(f"Minimum k found: {min(valid_ks)}")
    else:
        print("No valid k found up to", max_k)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    find_min_k()
