theorem omnimath745 :
  (∑ a in range 81, ∑ b in range 81, if b ≤ a then (choose a b : ZMod 3).val else 0) / (81 * 81) = omnimath745_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 1816 / 6561
Proposed Answer: 1816 / (81 * 81)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves summing over pairs (a,b) where b ≤ a, evaluating binomial coefficients modulo 3, and then taking an average by dividing by 81×81.

2. The ground truth answer is 1816/6561.

3. The proposed answer is 1816/(81×81).

Now let's compute 81×81 = 6561, which matches the denominator in the ground truth answer. Therefore, the two answers are mathematically identical since 81×81 = 6561.

<<<True>>>
