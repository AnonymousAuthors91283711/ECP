theorem omnimath4336 (r : ℕ) :
  (∀ (a : ℕ) (m : ℕ) (s : Finset ℕ), (∀ x ∈ s, ∃ k, x = 2^k) → 
    ∃ (bus : ℕ), (∃ (stations : Finset ℕ), (∀ x ∈ stations, ∃ k, x = 2^k) ∧ bus = stations.sum id) ∧ 
    bus ≡ a [MOD r] ∧ s ⊆ stations) ↔ r ∈ omnimath4336_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing possible r values (1 to 20):
r=1 belongs to omnimath4336_answer
r=3 belongs to omnimath4336_answer
r=5 belongs to omnimath4336_answer
r=7 belongs to omnimath4336_answer. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
<<<{r : ℕ | r % 2 = 1}>>>
