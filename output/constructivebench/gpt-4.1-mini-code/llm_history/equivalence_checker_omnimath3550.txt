Ground Truth Answer: {m : ℤ | ∃ k : ℤ, k^2 = m ∨ 2*k^2 = m}
Proposed Answer: {m : ℤ | ∃ k : ℤ, m = k^2 ∨ m = 2*k^2}
<<<True>>>

The proposed answer is logically equivalent to the ground truth answer. Both expressions describe the set of integers m that can be written either as a perfect square (k²) or twice a perfect square (2k²) for some integer k. The only difference is the order of the terms in the equalities, which doesn't affect the meaning. The conditions "k² = m ∨ 2k² = m" and "m = k² ∨ m = 2k²" are identical in logic.
