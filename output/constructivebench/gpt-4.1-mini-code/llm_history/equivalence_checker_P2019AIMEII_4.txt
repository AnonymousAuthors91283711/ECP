Ground Truth Answer: (37, 216)
Proposed Answer: (7*7, 36*36)
Let's analyze the equivalence:

1. The ground truth answer is (37, 216)
2. The proposed answer is (7*7, 36*36) which simplifies to (49, 1296)

Now let's compare:
- 37/216 ≈ 0.1713
- 49/1296 ≈ 0.0378

These fractions are not equivalent (0.1713 ≠ 0.0378), and they don't simplify to the same reduced form. The proposed answer gives a completely different probability.

<<<False>>>
