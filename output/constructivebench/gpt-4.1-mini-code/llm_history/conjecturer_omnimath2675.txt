abbrev omnimath2675_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2675 (x : ℝ) : x + sqrt 81 = 25 ↔ x = omnimath2675_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: sqrt(81) = 9
x = 25 - sqrt(81) = 16
Testing x = 14: x + sqrt(81) = 23.0
Testing x = 15: x + sqrt(81) = 24.0
Testing x = 16: x + sqrt(81) = 25.0
Testing x = 17: x + sqrt(81) = 26.0
Testing x = 18: x + sqrt(81) = 27.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<16>>>
