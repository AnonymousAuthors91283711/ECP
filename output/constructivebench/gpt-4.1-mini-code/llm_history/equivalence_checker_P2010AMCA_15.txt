Ground Truth Answer: (3 - sqrt 3) / 6
Proposed Answer: (1 - Real.sqrt 2 / 2) / 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find the value of p (between 0 and 1/2) that satisfies the equation:
   C(4,2) * p² * (1-p)² = 1/6

2. Simplifying:
   C(4,2) = 6, so the equation becomes:
   6 * p² * (1-p)² = 1/6
   => p² * (1-p)² = 1/36
   => [p(1-p)]² = (1/6)²
   => p(1-p) = 1/6 (since p ∈ (0,1/2))

3. Solving p - p² = 1/6:
   p² - p + 1/6 = 0
   Using quadratic formula: p = [1 ± √(1 - 4*(1/6))]/2
   p = [1 ± √(1/3)]/2 = [1 ± (√3)/3]/2 = (3 ± √3)/6

4. Since p < 1/2, we take the smaller root: (3 - √3)/6

The ground truth answer matches this solution exactly. The proposed answer gives a different expression involving √2 instead of √3, which is incorrect.
