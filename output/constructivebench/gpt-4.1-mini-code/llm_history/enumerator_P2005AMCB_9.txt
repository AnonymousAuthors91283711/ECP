The problem involves finding the difference between the weighted mean and the median of a given dataset. We have 5 scores and their corresponding weights. Let's write a Python program to calculate the weighted mean, the median, and then print their difference for the provided inputs.

```python
# Scores and weights from the problem
scores = [70, 80, 85, 90, 95]
weights = [0.1, 0.25, 0.2, 0.15, 0.3]

# Calculate the weighted mean: sum of weights[i] * scores[i]
weighted_mean = sum(w * s for w, s in zip(weights, scores))

# Median is given as 85, but let's verify by explicit calculation:
# Sort scores (already sorted)
sorted_scores = sorted(scores)

# Since number of scores is odd (5), median is middle element
median = sorted_scores[len(scores)//2]

# Calculate difference
difference = weighted_mean - median

# Output
print(f"Weighted Mean: {weighted_mean}")
print(f"Median: {median}")
print(f"Difference (mean - median): {difference}")
```
This code computes and prints the required difference directly.
