[write_program]
The problem seems to be about finding all positive integers \( m \) such that there exists a prime \( p \) dividing \( n^m - m \) for no integer \( n \). To explore this, I'll write a Python program that tries small values of \( m \) and checks for primes \( p \) whether \( p \mid n^m - m \) for some \( n \). We seek primes \( p \) dividing no \( n^m - m \), so we'll try to find \( p \) for which \( n^m \equiv m \pmod p \) has no solution \( n \).

We'll iterate over small \( m \), and for each \( m \), check primes \( p \) up to some limit, and for each \( p \), check if there exists \( n \) such that \( n^m \equiv m \pmod p \). If no such \( n \) exists, we print \( m \) and \( p \).

This enumeration assists in conjecturing the set of such \( m \).

```python
from sympy import isprime

MAX_M = 10  # small sample of m values
MAX_P = 50  # check primes up to this limit

def has_solution(m, p):
    # Check if there's n with n^m congruent to m mod p
    residues = {pow(n, m, p) for n in range(p)}
    return (m % p) in residues

def enumerate_answers():
    for m in range(1, MAX_M + 1):
        # We want a prime p such that no n satisfies n^m == m mod p
        for p in range(2, MAX_P + 1):
            if not isprime(p):
                continue
            if not has_solution(m, p):
                print(f"m={m}, p={p} has no n with n^{m} ≡ {m} (mod {p})")
                break  # found at least one p for this m
        else:
            # no prime p was found for this m
            # print to confirm absence
            print(f"m={m}: no prime p up to {MAX_P} without n^m ≡ m mod p")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    enumerate_answers()
```
