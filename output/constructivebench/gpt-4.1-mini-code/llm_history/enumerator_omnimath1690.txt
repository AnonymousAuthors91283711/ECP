The problem asks for the greatest natural number \(n\) such that \(2^n\) divides \(7^{2048} - 1\). This involves finding the highest power of 2 dividing \(7^{2048} - 1\).

We will enumerate values of \(n\) and check divisibility by \(2^n\). To speed up, note that for large \(n\), \(2^n\) might exceed the value, but \(7^{2048} - 1\) is extremely large, so direct computation is not possible. Instead, use modular arithmetic properties: test divisibility of \(7^{2048}-1\) modulo increasing powers of two.

Since \(7^{2048}-1\) is huge, we can use modular exponentiation modulo powers of 2, checking when \(7^{2048} \equiv 1 \pmod{2^n}\).

We increment \(n\) until the congruence fails. The largest \(n\) where it holds is the exponent of 2 dividing the number.

The program will:
- Iterate \(n\) from 1 upwards,
- For each \(n\), check if \(7^{2048} \equiv 1 \pmod{2^n}\),
- Stop when the congruence fails, report the previous \(n\) as the highest.

```python
# Enumerate maximum n with 2^n | 7^2048 - 1
def mod_exp(base, exp, mod):
    result = 1
    b = base % mod
    e = exp
    while e > 0:
        if e & 1:
            result = (result * b) % mod
        b = (b * b) % mod
        e >>= 1
    return result

def main():
    base = 7
    exponent = 2048
    n = 1
    max_n = 0
    print(f"Checking divisibility by increasing powers of 2 for {base}^{exponent} - 1")
    while True:
        mod = 2 ** n
        val = mod_exp(base, exponent, mod)
        if val == 1:
            print(f"2^{n} divides {base}^{exponent} - 1")
            max_n = n
            n += 1
        else:
            print(f"2^{n} does NOT divide {base}^{exponent} - 1, stopping.")
            break
    print(f"Greatest n with 2^n dividing {base}^{exponent}-1 is {max_n}")

    main()
