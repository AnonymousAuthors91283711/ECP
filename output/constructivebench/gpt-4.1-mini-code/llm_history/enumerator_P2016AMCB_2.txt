This problem is about finding a natural number \( n \) that is the closest integer (i.e., a best integer approximation) to the value \(\frac{2 \cdot 1 \cdot 2016}{1 + 2016}\). We want to find the natural number \( n \) that minimizes the absolute difference from this quotient.

Since this is a direct calculation, we'll compute the exact value of the fraction and enumerate integers nearby to check which one(s) minimize the distance. We print each candidate integer and its distance to the value. At the end, we print the integer that gives the minimal absolute difference.

```python
def main():
    numerator = 2 * 1 * 2016
    denominator = 1 + 2016
    value = numerator / denominator
    print(f"Value to approximate: {value}")

    # We'll check integers around the floor and ceiling of the value.
    candidates = [int(value), int(value) + 1]
    # Sometimes value might be exactly an integer; check one below as well
    candidates.append(int(value) - 1)

    candidates = sorted(set(candidates))

    min_diff = None
    best_n = None

    for n in candidates:
        if n < 0:  # n must be natural number, so skip negative
            continue
        diff = abs(value - n)
        print(f"n = {n}, |value - n| = {diff:.10f}")
        if min_diff is None or diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            best_n = n

    print(f"\nMinimum absolute difference achieved by n = {best_n} with difference = {min_diff:.10f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
