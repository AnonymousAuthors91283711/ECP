Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: { x | 0 < x ∧ x ≤ 1 } ∪ { x | 2 < x }
<<<None>>>
Since the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's intentionally left undefined in the Lean proof assistant), we cannot verify whether the proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth. The proposed answer suggests two intervals where the sequence would be strictly increasing, but without knowing the actual ground truth, we cannot confirm its correctness.
