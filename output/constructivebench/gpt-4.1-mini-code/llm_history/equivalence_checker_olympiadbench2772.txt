Ground Truth Answer: 2069
Proposed Answer: 2026
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n > 2023 where the sum of its digits equals 17.

2. Ground truth answer is 2069:
   - 2069 > 2023
   - Sum of digits: 2 + 0 + 6 + 9 = 17
   - It's indeed the smallest such number above 2023

3. Proposed answer is 2026:
   - 2026 > 2023
   - Sum of digits: 2 + 0 + 2 + 6 = 10 ≠ 17
   - Doesn't satisfy the digit sum condition

The proposed answer fails to meet the digit sum requirement, while the ground truth answer satisfies all conditions.
