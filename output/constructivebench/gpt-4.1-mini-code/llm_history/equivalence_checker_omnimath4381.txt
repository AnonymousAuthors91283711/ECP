Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {(a, b, c) | ∃ n : ℤ, a = n + 1 ∧ b = n ∧ c = n - 1}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer suggests that the solution set consists of triples where (a, b, c) are consecutive integers. While this is indeed a valid subset of solutions that satisfy the given conditions (as they would make f(n*a) + f(n*b) + f(n*c) = n for all n), it might not cover all possible solutions. The problem's conditions could potentially allow for other rational triples that satisfy the functional equation, particularly when considering the behavior of f at half-integer points. Therefore, the proposed answer is mostly correct but might be incomplete, making "Close" the most appropriate response.
