The sum involves alternating signs and terms of the form (k+1)(k+2) for k from 0 to 2000. Let's enumerate partial sums and look for a pattern to conjecture the closed form or the final exact sum.

```python
# Enumerate partial sums of the series:
# sum_{k=0}^{n} (-1)^{k+1} * (k+1)*(k+2)
# for n from 0 up to 20 to detect a pattern.

def series_term(k):
    return (-1)**(k+1) * (k+1) * (k+2)

def main():
    partial_sum = 0
    print("n, term, partial_sum")
    for n in range(20):
        t = series_term(n)
        partial_sum += t
        print(n, t, partial_sum)

    # Then output the sum for n=2000
    total = 0
    for k in range(2001):
        total += series_term(k)
    print("\nSum for n=2000:", total)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
