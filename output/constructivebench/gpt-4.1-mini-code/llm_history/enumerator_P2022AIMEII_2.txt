[write_program]
We want to find the simplified fraction form p/q of the total probability expression given by the average of three similar terms with rational components. The program will enumerate the three cases, compute exact fractions, sum, average, simplify, and output the resulting fraction p and q.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def main():
    # Define cases as per problem statement using Fraction for exact rational arithmetic
    two_thirds = Fraction(2,3)
    one_third = Fraction(1,3)
    three_fourths = Fraction(3,4)
    one_fourth = Fraction(1,4)

    # Case 1: (2/3)*(3/4)*(3/4) + (1/3)*(3/4)*(1/4)
    case1 = two_thirds * three_fourths * three_fourths + one_third * three_fourths * one_fourth
    print(f"Case 1 probability: {case1} = {float(case1):.6f}")

    # Case 2: (3/4)*(3/4)*(2/3) + (1/4)*(3/4)*(3/4)
    case2 = three_fourths * three_fourths * two_thirds + one_fourth * three_fourths * three_fourths
    print(f"Case 2 probability: {case2} = {float(case2):.6f}")

    # Case 3: same as case 2
    case3 = case2
    print(f"Case 3 probability: {case3} = {float(case3):.6f}")

    total = case1 + case2 + case3
    average = total / 3
    print(f"Sum of cases: {total} = {float(total):.6f}")
    print(f"Average probability: {average} = {float(average):.6f}")

    # Simplify fraction:
    p, q = average.numerator, average.denominator
    print(f"Simplified fraction = {p}/{q}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
