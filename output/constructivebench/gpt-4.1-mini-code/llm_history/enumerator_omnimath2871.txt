The problem states a condition \( \frac{N}{2} = 16 \) for \( N \in \mathbb{Q} \), and we want to find the value of \( \frac{3N}{4} \).

We can enumerate \( N \) values from the condition and compute \( \frac{3N}{4} \) exactly as a rational number. Since \( \frac{N}{2} = 16 \Rightarrow N = 32 \), this is straightforward but let's demonstrate enumeration and exact rational arithmetic.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Enumerate possible N's satisfying N/2 = 16
# Since N must be exactly 32, we demonstrate this with fraction.

N = Fraction(32)  # N/2 = 16 so N = 32
print(f"N = {N} satisfies N/2 = 16")

value = Fraction(3 * N, 4)  # (3*N)/4 exact rational
print(f"(3*N)/4 = {value} = {float(value)}")

# Now print the answer for omnimath2871_answer
omnimath2871_answer = value.numerator // value.denominator if value.denominator == 1 else value
print(f"omnimath2871_answer = {omnimath2871_answer}")
```
