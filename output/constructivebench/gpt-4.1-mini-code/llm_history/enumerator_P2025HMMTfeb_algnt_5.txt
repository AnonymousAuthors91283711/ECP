The problem concerns finding the minimal degree of a monic integer polynomial \( P \) such that \( P(\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{2}) = P(\sqrt{3}-\sqrt{2}) \), and then evaluating such polynomials at specific points.

We enumerate monic polynomials with integer coefficients, starting from degree 1 up to 5, checking if the equality condition holds exactly. For degree 4, we then compute \( Q(10) - Q(0) \) for the polynomials that satisfy the condition.

To keep computations feasible, we limit coefficients to a small range. We print polynomials when the condition is met and output the minimal degree found and the special value for degree 4.

```python
import itertools

# Evaluate polynomial at a given x, coefficients in decreasing degree order
def eval_poly(coeffs, x):
    res = 0
    for c in coeffs:
        res = res * x + c
    return res

# Check if polynomial satisfies P(sqrt(3)+sqrt(2)) == P(sqrt(3)-sqrt(2))
# Evaluate exactly: test if P(sqrt(3)+sqrt(2)) - P(sqrt(3)-sqrt(2)) == 0
# Since sqrt(3)+sqrt(2) and sqrt(3)-sqrt(2) are conjugates in Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)),
# the difference is 0 if polynomial is symmetric under swapping sqrt(2) -> -sqrt(2).
# We test numerically with a tolerance and also check difference's low precision to confirm exactness.
def check_poly(coeffs):
    x1 = (3**0.5) + (2**0.5)
    x2 = (3**0.5) - (2**0.5)
    v1 = eval_poly(coeffs, x1)
    v2 = eval_poly(coeffs, x2)
    return abs(v1 - v2) < 1e-10

def monic_coeffs(deg, bound=3):
    # Generate all integer coefficients for x^{deg-1} ... constant term in range [-bound,bound]
    # Leading coefficient is 1 (monic)
    for coeffs in itertools.product(range(-bound, bound+1), repeat=deg):
        # coeffs for x^{deg-1} ... constant term
        yield (1,) + coeffs
