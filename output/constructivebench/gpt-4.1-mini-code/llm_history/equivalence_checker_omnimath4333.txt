Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {(a, b) | ∃ x y : ℕ, a = (x + y)^2 ∧ b = (x - y)^2 ∧ 2 * x * y = 1989}
<<<Close>>>

The proposed answer is close but not entirely equivalent to the problem's requirements. The problem asks for pairs (S1, S2) where S1 and S2 are perfect squares and their difference is 1989. The proposed answer correctly captures the form of perfect squares (as (x+y)² and (x-y)²) and their difference (which would be 4xy), but it incorrectly states the condition as 2xy = 1989 instead of 4xy = 1989 (since (x+y)² - (x-y)² = 4xy). The structure is correct but the final condition is off by a factor of 2.
