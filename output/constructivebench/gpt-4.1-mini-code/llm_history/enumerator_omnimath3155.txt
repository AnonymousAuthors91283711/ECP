The problem relates to counting certain sets S of integers within [1..n] closed under the operation "if (a+b) is even, (a+b)/2 âˆˆ S". We want to understand the sequence A(n) = number of such sets for each n and verify when the discrete second difference A(n+2)-2*A(n+1)+A(n) = 1. We'll enumerate A(n) for small n, then check the condition.

```python
# Enumerate sets S within [1..n] closed under midpoint operation
# For each n, compute A(n) = count of such sets.
# Then output values of n where A(n+2)-2*A(n+1)+A(n) == 1.

from itertools import combinations

def is_mediocre(S, n):
    S_set = set(S)
    # Check closure: for all a,b in S, if (a+b) even => (a+b)//2 in S
    for a in S_set:
        for b in S_set:
            if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
                m = (a + b) // 2
                if m < 1 or m > n or m not in S_set:
                    return False
    return True

def generate_mediocre_sets(n):
    # Candidates are subsets of [1..n] (including empty)
    # Only consider subsets closed under midpoint
    # To speed up: start from empty set, add elements and check closure incrementally
    # But here, direct check for small n.
    A_n = 0
    for r in range(n+1):
        for S in combinations(range(1,n+1), r):
            if is_mediocre(S,n):
                A_n += 1
    return A_n

max_n = 10
A = dict()
print("n, A(n)")
for n in range(1,max_n+1):
    A[n] = generate_mediocre_sets(n)
    print(n, A[n])

print("\nn and second difference results for n=1..max_n-2")
for n in range(1, max_n - 1):
    # ensure A[n], A[n+1], A[n+2] exist
    if n+2 in A:
        val = A[n+2] - 2*A[n+1] + A[n]
        print(f"n={n}: A(n+2)-2*A(n+1)+A(n) = {val}")
        if val == 1:
            print(f"--> Condition holds at n = {n}")
```
