The problem involves counting integers \( n \) between 1 and 10,000 satisfying:
\[
\lfloor \sqrt{\lceil \sqrt{n} \rceil} \rfloor = \lceil \sqrt{\lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor} \rceil.
\]
We will enumerate all \( n \) from 1 to 10,000, compute the two expressions exactly, print \( n \) when the condition holds, and finally print the count. No approximations; use integer arithmetic carefully.

```python
import math

# We will enumerate n = 1 to 10000
count = 0
for n in range(1, 10001):
    sqrt_n = math.sqrt(n)
    floor_sqrt_n = math.floor(sqrt_n)
    ceil_sqrt_n = math.ceil(sqrt_n)

    inner_floor = math.floor(math.sqrt(ceil_sqrt_n))
    inner_ceil = math.ceil(math.sqrt(floor_sqrt_n))

    if inner_floor == inner_ceil:
        print(n)  # Print each n satisfying the condition immediately
        count += 1

print("Count =", count)  # Print total count, the cardinality
```
