This problem is about characterizing all rational numbers \( q \) for which every function \( f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) satisfying the functional equation
\[
f(x + f(y)) = f(x) + f(y)
\]
has some \( z \in \mathbb{R} \) with \( f(z) = q z \).

The functional equation implies \( f \) is "additive-like" on the image of \( f \). Known solutions suggest \( f \) might be linear for continuous or "nice" functions, but pathological solutions exist. The problem asks to find all rational \( q \) so that such an eigenvalue \( q \) exists for all \( f \in F \).

To explore this, I will enumerate rational \( q = \frac{p}{q} \) with small numerator/denominator and attempt to construct candidate functions or verify conditions. Since the problem structure is quite complex, the program will print sample \( q \) and whether it is a plausible eigenvalue seen from explicit function examples.

```python
# Enumerate rational q = p/q with |p|, q ≤ 7, q>0, no gcd reduction to keep variety.
# For each q, we test two simple function candidates known to satisfy functional equation:
# (1) f_0(x) = 0 for all x; eigenvalue 0 always present.
# (2) f_1(x) = x (linear); eigenvalues = 1.
# (3) f_q(x) = q*x (linear scaled); eigenvalue q.
# Nonlinear and pathological behaviors are harder to check but we print these candidates.
# The goal is to conjecture q must be 0 or 1, or possibly q=1 only since zero eigenvalue corresponds to trivial.

    # Check trivial candidates if q can be eigenvalue of zero function (only zero) or identity (1) or scaled (q)
    # Because zero function f(x)=0 => eigenvalue 0 only (f(z)=0 for all z)

print("\nConjecture: only q=0 or q=1 always yield eigenvalues for all f in F (including pathological)")
