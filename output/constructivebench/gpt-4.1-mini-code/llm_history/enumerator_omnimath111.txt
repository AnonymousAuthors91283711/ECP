The problem defines a property on natural numbers \( n \), where for all integers \( k \) between 1 and 9, the fractional part of \( \frac{n}{10^k} \) is greater than \( \frac{n}{10^{10}} \). We need to count such \( n \).

Approach:  
- To enumerate candidates, try \( n \) up to a reasonable maximum (like \( 10^{10} \)) but to keep output concise, start smaller and print all \( n \) that satisfy the property.  
- For each \( n \), check for \( k \in [1..9] \):  
  - Calculate fractional part of \( n / 10^k \) = decimal part after dividing.  
  - Check if this is > \( n / 10^{10} \).  
- Print all such \( n \), then print their count.

Given the strict inequality and the denominator powers, the eligible \( n \) might be small or have a pattern. To keep code and output concise, limit \( n \) up to e.g. \( 10^6 \) or less, print results streaming, and conclude with the total count.

```python
# Enumerate natural numbers n with 0 < n <= LIMIT
# For each n, check isInteresting: for all k in 1..9,
# fractional part of n/10^k > n/10^{10}.

LIMIT = 10**6  # arbitrary limit to keep output short
from math import floor

def frac(x):
    return x - floor(x)

count = 0
for n in range(1, LIMIT+1):
    n_over_1e10 = n / 1e10
    # Check all k in 1..9
    is_interesting = True
    for k in range(1,10):
        val = n / (10**k)
        if frac(val) <= n_over_1e10:
            is_interesting = False
            break
    if is_interesting:
        count += 1
        print(n)
print("Count of interesting n up to", LIMIT, ":", count)
```
