The problem appears to ask about finding the maximum size \( k \) of a subset \( s \) of pairs \((i,j)\) with \( i<j \), such that for a given permutation \(\pi\) of \(\{0,...,n-1\}\), the inequality \(\pi(i) \times \pi(j) > i \times j\) holds for all pairs in the subset. Our task is to enumerate possible values of \( k \) for small values of \( n \) and permutations \(\pi\).

We will:
- Try small values of \( n \) (e.g., 2 to 5).
- For each \( n \), enumerate permutations \(\pi\).
- For each \(\pi\), find the maximum size \( k \) of subsets \( s \) as described.
- Print \( n \), the permutation \(\pi\) (in tuple form), and the maximum \(k\) found.

To keep computation feasible, for each \(\pi\) we will:
- Generate all pairs \((i,j)\) with \( i < j\).
- Filter pairs where \(\pi(i)\pi(j) > i j\).
- Use a backtracking or bitmask approach to find the maximum \( k \) such that a subset \( s \) of these pairs with condition holds. Here the condition on \( s \) is just the pairs themselves. Since all pairs in \( s \) already satisfy the inequality individually, the only other condition is \( s.card = k \). So the problem reduces to the size \( k \) equals cardinality of these pairs.
- So the maximum \( k \) for \(\pi\) equals the number of pairs \((i,j)\) with \(i<j\) for which the inequality holds.
- Hence, for each \(\pi\), \(k\) is just the number of such pairs.

We will print all such \( k \) for all permutations, and then also print the maximum \( k \) for each \( n \).

```python
import math
from itertools import permutations, combinations

def main():
    max_n = 5
    for n in range(2, max_n+1):
        pairs = [(i,j) for i in range(n) for j in range(i+1,n)]
        max_k_for_n = 0
        print(f"n = {n}")
        perms = list(permutations(range(n)))
        for pi in perms:
            count = sum(1 for (i,j) in pairs if pi[i]*pi[j] > i*j)
            print(f"  pi = {pi}, k = {count}")
            if count > max_k_for_n:
                max_k_for_n = count
        print(f"Maximum k for n={n}: {max_k_for_n}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
