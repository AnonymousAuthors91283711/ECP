The problem is to count triples (a,b,c) of positive integers with a ≤ b ≤ c, gcd(a,b,c) = 1, and a*b*c = 6^2020. We want the count modulo 1000.

Key points:
- 6 = 2 * 3, so 6^2020 = 2^{2020} * 3^{2020}.
- Each of a,b,c factors into powers of 2 and 3 only.
- gcd(a,b,c) = 1 means that for each prime, at least one of (a,b,c) has exponent zero in that prime.
- We want to count ordered triples with ordering a ≤ b ≤ c.
- The exponent triples sum to 2020 for primes 2 and 3.

The number of triples (a,b,c) with a*b*c = 6^{2020} corresponds to distributing exponents of prime 2 and 3 among a,b,c so exponents sum to 2020 each. GCD=1 means min exponent for each prime among a,b,c is zero.

We can iterate possible splits of exponents (for primes 2 and 3), filter those meeting gcd=1 and ordering conditions, and count.

We'll try small exponent values to conjecture the pattern; printing counts for smaller exponents to guess the formula for larger ones.

Output all results and then summarize with the last result modulo 1000 as 'answer_mod_1000'.

#  - For each prime, a_exp + b_exp + c_exp = E
#  - min of (a_exp,b_exp,c_exp) = 0 for gcd=1 condition (because gcd(a,b,c)=1).
#  - a<=b<=c, order by the numeric value (2^{a_exp2} * 3^{a_exp3}).
