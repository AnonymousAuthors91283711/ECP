The problem appears to involve evaluating the expression \((x + 2 - x) \times (2 - x - 2)\) for \(x = 2\) and verifying its value. Let's enumerate possible values for \(x\) near 2 to understand the expression and then compute for \(x=2\).

```python
# Enumerate values of the expression (x + 2 - x) * (2 - x - 2) for x near 2
def expr(x):
    return (x + 2 - x) * (2 - x - 2)

print("Evaluating (x + 2 - x) * (2 - x - 2) for x near 2:")
for x in [1.9, 2.0, 2.1]:
    val = expr(x)
    print(f"x = {x}: value = {val}")

# Since terms cancel, the expression simplifies:
# (x + 2 - x) = 2
# (2 - x - 2) = -x
# So expression is 2 * (-x) = -2x
print("\nExpression simplifies to -2 * x.")
print("At x = 2, value =", expr(2))
```
