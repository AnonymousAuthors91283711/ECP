The problem involves a prime \( p \) between 100 and 500, an exponent \( e \equiv 2016 \pmod {p-1} \), and a condition on \( e - \frac{p-1}{2} = 21 \). We want to find the prime \( p \) satisfying these conditions. The program enumerates primes \( p \) in the range, computes \( e = 2016 \mod (p-1) \), checks if \( e - \frac{p-1}{2} = 21 \), and prints all candidates and the unique solution if any.

```python
from sympy import primerange

# Enumerate prime p between 101 and 499
# For each p, compute e = 2016 % (p-1)
# Check e - (p-1)/2 == 21
# Print all primes satisfying the condition and the values of e
# Finally, print the unique candidate if found

print("Enumerating primes p with 100 < p < 500:")

candidates = []
for p in primerange(101, 500):
    e = 2016 % (p - 1)
    half = (p - 1) / 2
    diff = e - half
    if diff == 21:
        print(f"p={p}, e={e}, e - (p-1)/2 = {diff}")
        candidates.append(p)

if candidates:
    print("\nCandidates found:")
    for c in candidates:
        print(f"p = {c}")
    print(f"\nUnique solution (assuming uniqueness): p = {candidates[0]}")
else:
    print("No candidates found.")
```
