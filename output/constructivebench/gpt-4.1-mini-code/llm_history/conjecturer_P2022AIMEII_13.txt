. Expected Answer Type: ℤ
<<<(-1)^(2022) * (2023)^(2022)>>>
Explanation: The polynomial with roots k/(n+1), k=1..n is (x - 1/(n+1))...(x - n/(n+1)), scaled by (n+1)^n for integer coefficients. The leading coefficient is (n+1)^n, and the sign alternates leading to (-1)^n (n+1)^n. For n=2022, P_{2022,2022} = (-1)^2022 * 2023^{2022}.
