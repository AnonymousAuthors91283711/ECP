[write_program]
The problem involves finding pairs \((a,b)\) of natural numbers that satisfy either \(2a + 3b = 100\) or \(3a + 2b = 100\), with the additional constraint that either \(a=28\) or \(b=28\). The goal is to evaluate some function \(P2015AMCB_3\_answer(a,b)\) which presumably should equal 8 for these valid pairs.

Since the exact definition of \(P2015AMCB_3\_answer\) is not given, I'll write a Python program to enumerate all \((a,b)\) with \(a,b \in \mathbb{N}\) (say up to 50 - since 28 is given, and equations involve sums to 100) satisfying the conditions. Then, for these pairs, we will print them out and check that the conditions hold.

This enumerator will hopefully help in conjecturing the value of the function.

```python
# Enumerate (a,b) with a,b â‰¤ 50 such that either 2a+3b=100 or 3a+2b=100,
# and either a=28 or b=28.
# Print all such pairs immediately.

def check_conditions():
    max_val = 50
    for a in range(max_val + 1):
        for b in range(max_val + 1):
            cond1 = (2 * a + 3 * b == 100)
            cond2 = (3 * a + 2 * b == 100)
            cond3 = (a == 28 or b == 28)
            if (cond1 or cond2) and cond3:
                print(f"a={a}, b={b}, 2a+3b={2*a+3*b}, 3a+2b={3*a+2*b}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    check_conditions()
```
This program prints all pairs \((a,b)\) up to 50 satisfying the problem constraints. This aids in conjecturing about the nature of \(P2015AMCB_3\_answer\).
