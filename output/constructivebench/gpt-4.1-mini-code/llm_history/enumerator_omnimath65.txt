[write_program]
This is a difficult inequality problem with three positive variables \(x, y, z\) bound by \(x + y + z = xyz\), and the goal is to find the minimum value of the expression 
\[
x^7(yz - 1) + y^7(zx - 1) + z^7(xy - 1).
\]
We will enumerate triples \((x, y, z)\) with \(x,y,z>0\) and test the constraint \(x+y+z = xyz\). Since exact solutions are urged, we select rational values and check the equality with some tolerance.

By symmetry, start from triples with \(x \leq y \leq z\) and sample over a small grid of rationals between 1 and 5 (to keep \(xyz\) sizable). Print each value found and keep track of minimum found.

```python
# Enumerate triples (x,y,z) with x,y,z >0, x+y+z=xyz and evaluate expr.
# Use small rationals with denominator 10 for better exactness.
# Print tuples and their expression values immediately upon finding constraint nearly satisfied.

                if zi < yi:

                lhs = float(xi + yi + zi)
                rhs = float(xi * yi * zi)
                if math.isclose(lhs, rhs, rel_tol=1e-9):
                    # compute expression exactly using floats since powers can be large
