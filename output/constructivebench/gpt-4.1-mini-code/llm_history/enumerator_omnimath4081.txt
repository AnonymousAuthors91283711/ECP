The problem is about finding natural numbers \( n > 0 \) such that if 
\[ e = \sum_{k=0}^n \frac{1}{k!} = \frac{f}{g} \]
in lowest terms, then 
\[ g > n^{0.999 n} \]
with \( f = e.num \) and \( g = e.den \).

To explore this, we will compute the partial sums of the series for \( n=1,2,\ldots \) and extract the reduced numerator and denominator of the sum, then check if the denominator exceeds \( n^{0.999 n} \).

We will print every denominator and corresponding \( n^{0.999 n} \) and indicate when the denominator surpasses this threshold. Because factorial denominators grow very quickly but the sum's rational is always reduced, its denominator can be tricky to analyze, hence enumerating values is useful.

We will try up to some modest \( n \) like 20 to keep output brief and computational reasonable, printing results as found.

```python
from math import factorial
from fractions import Fraction
from math import pow

def main():
    print("n, denominator of sum_{k=0}^n 1/k!, n^{0.999*n}, exceeds?")
    for n in range(1, 21):
        # sum of reciprocals of factorials up to n
        s = Fraction(0,1)
        for k in range(n+1):
            s += Fraction(1, factorial(k))

        den = s.denominator
        threshold = pow(n, 0.999 * n)

        exceeds = den > threshold
        print(f"{n}, {den}, {threshold:.3e}, {exceeds}")

if __name__=="__main__":
    main()
```
