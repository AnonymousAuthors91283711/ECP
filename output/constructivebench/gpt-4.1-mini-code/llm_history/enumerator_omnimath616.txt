This problem involves real numbers \(x, y\) satisfying conditions involving sine and cosine, and asks for the value of \(x + y\). The constraints:

\[
\begin{cases}
x + \sin y = 2008 \\
x + 2008 \cos y = 2007 \\
0 \leq y \leq \pi/2
\end{cases}
\]

We need to find possible values of \(x + y\).

To assist, we can numerically enumerate candidates for \(y\) in \([0, \pi/2]\) in small steps, solve the system for \(x\), and verify the constraints. Then, we can print candidate values of \(x + y\).

Since the problem hints at a specific answer, we can also attempt to isolate exact values by algebraic rearrangement:

From the two equations:

\[
x = 2008 - \sin y \\
x = 2007 - 2008 \cos y
\]

Equating:

\[
2008 - \sin y = 2007 - 2008 \cos y \implies 1 = \sin y - 2008 \cos y
\]

We can try to find \(y\) satisfying this trigonometric equation in \([0, \pi/2]\). Then find \(x\) and compute \(x + y\).

We'll enumerate \(y\) values finely, check for values close to satisfying the equation, print candidate pairs \((x,y)\), and their sums. This may help conjecture the exact answer.

```python
from math import sin, cos, pi

# We'll discretize y from 0 to pi/2 to find approximate roots of sin y - 2008 cos y = 1
EPS = 1e-10
y_values = []
print("Enumerating candidate solutions (x, y, x+y):")
for i in range(0, 90001):  # step = pi/2 / 90000 ~ 1.75e-5 - fine for float precision
    y = (pi/2) * i / 90000
    val = sin(y) - 2008 * cos(y) - 1
    if abs(val) < 1e-6:  # close to zero, candidate root
        x1 = 2008 - sin(y)
        x2 = 2007 - 2008 * cos(y)
        # Sanity check difference between x1 and x2
        if abs(x1 - x2) < 1e-6:
            print(f"x={x1:.12f}, y={y:.12f}, x+y={x1 + y:.12f}")
            y_values.append(y)
# Print distinct candidates for x+y
print("Distinct candidate values for x+y:")
for y in y_values:
    x = 2008 - sin(y)
    print(f"{x + y:.12f}")
```
