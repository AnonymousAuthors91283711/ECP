Ground Truth Answer: fun ⟨x, y⟩ => 15 - y / x
Proposed Answer: fun p : ℝ × ℝ => (p.1 - 2) * 0.5 + (p.2 - 10) * 0.1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers carefully.

Problem Analysis:
- We need to find a function z = f(x,y) where:
  - 2 ≤ x ≤ 5
  - 10 ≤ y ≤ 20
- The maximum value of z in this domain should be 13

Ground Truth Answer:
- z = 15 - y/x
- To find maximum: minimize y/x
- Minimum y/x occurs at x=5, y=10 → z = 15 - 10/5 = 13
- This satisfies the condition that the maximum z is 13

Proposed Answer:
- z = (x-2)*0.5 + (y-10)*0.1
- This is linear in both x and y
- Maximum occurs at x=5, y=20 → z = (3)*0.5 + (10)*0.1 = 1.5 + 1 = 2.5
- This gives maximum z=2.5 ≠ 13

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the condition that the maximum z should be 13, while the ground truth does. The functions are clearly different and produce different results.
