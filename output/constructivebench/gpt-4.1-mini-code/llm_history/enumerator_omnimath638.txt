This problem asks for the sum of terms \((k + 1)^{25 - k}\) for \(k\) from 0 to 24. Let's enumerate all terms and print each exactly, then print their sum to help conjecture the closed form or exact value.

```python
# Enumerate the sum of (k+1)^(25-k) for k in [0..24]
# Print each term and finally the total sum.

def main():
    total = 0
    for k in range(25):
        base = k + 1
        exponent = 25 - k
        term = pow(base, exponent)  # exact integer power
        print(f"Term for k={k}: {base}^{exponent} = {term}")
        total += term
    print(f"Sum of all terms: {total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
