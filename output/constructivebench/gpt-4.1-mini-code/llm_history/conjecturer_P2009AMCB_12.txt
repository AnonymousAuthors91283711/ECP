Explanation:  
Given geometric n = a * r^n with geometric 5 = 7! = 5040 and geometric 8 = 8! = 40320,  
we have r^3 = geometric 8 / geometric 5 = 40320 / 5040 = 8, so r = 2.  
Then a = geometric 5 / r^5 = 5040 / 2^5 = 5040 / 32 = 157.5 = 315 / 2.

We must mark the answer as noncomputable to avoid Lean’s computation warnings for division in ℝ.

The error is due to the incorrect placement and usage of the `noncomputable` keyword and re-declaring the same abbreviation. We only need to define the abbreviation `P2009AMCB_12_answer` once, and it should be a valid Lean term representing the real number 315/2.

Since 315/2 is a rational number and can be expressed as a real number, we just write it as `315 / 2`. The type annotation `: ℝ` requires us to have a real-valued literal. In Lean, we can write `(315 : ℝ) / 2` to coerce the numerator to a real and then divide.

Hence, correct Lean code for the final answer expression is:

The problem gives a geometric sequence defined by geometric n = a * r^n, and the conditions geometric 5 = 7! and geometric 8 = 8!. From these we have:

a * r^5 = 7! = 5040  
a * r^8 = 8! = 40320  

Dividing the second by the first:  
r^3 = (8!) / (7!) = 40320 / 5040 = 8  
So r = 2 (positive root).

Then from the first:  
a = 7! / r^5 = 5040 / (2^5) = 5040 / 32 = 157.5 = 315/2.

The Lean error is caused by direct division with noncomputable real numbers: division on real is noncomputable because it depends on classical choice to invert real numbers. Marking `P2009AMCB_12_answer` as `noncomputable` fixes the problem.

Alternatively, writing the answer as a rational literal coerced to real also helps.

Hence, use:

noncomputable abbrev P2009AMCB_12_answer : ℝ := (315 : ℝ) / 2

Or write it as:

noncomputable abbrev P2009AMCB_12_answer : ℝ := Real.mkRat (315 / 2)

But the simplest fix is to mark the abbrev as noncomputable.

The error in the code is that `noncomputable` is a declaration modifier and cannot be used inside an expression (like the right-hand side of an abbreviation). You should declare the abbreviation as `noncomputable abbrev ...` rather than putting `noncomputable` inside the definition.

Since `315 / 2` is a rational number and can be represented as a real in Lean by `(315 : ℝ) / 2`, this is a valid closed form.

Thus, the fixed version is just the expression `(315 : ℝ) / 2` without the `noncomputable` keyword.

Explanation:

- From the given conditions, \(r^3 = \frac{8!}{5!} = \frac{40320}{5040} = 8\), so \(r = 2\).
- Then \(a = \frac{g_5}{r^5} = \frac{5040}{2^5} = \frac{5040}{32} = 157.5 = \frac{315}{2}\).

Hence, the answer \(a = \frac{315}{2}\) is correct.
