Ground Truth Answer: 25
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us two distinct triples (x₁,y₁,z₁) and (x₂,y₂,z₂) with identical sums, sum of squares, and sum of cubes. We need to find y₁ + y₂.

2. The ground truth answer is 25, which comes from recognizing that the triples must be roots of the same cubic equation and using symmetric polynomial relationships.

3. The proposed answer is 4, which is significantly different from 25 and doesn't match the expected result from the symmetric polynomial analysis.

4. The answer 4 would only make sense if we were looking at something like the sum of two individual y values from the same triple, not from two different triples.

Since the proposed answer (4) is completely different from and inconsistent with the ground truth answer (25), and doesn't follow from the problem's conditions:

<<<False>>>
