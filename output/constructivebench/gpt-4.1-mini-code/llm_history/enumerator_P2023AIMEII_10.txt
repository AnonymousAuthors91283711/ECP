The problem is to enumerate injective functions from a 2×6 grid to {0,...,11} such that adjacent cells don't differ by a multiple of 3. We'll enumerate these functions and count how many satisfy the condition, then print the count and some divisors to guess the cardinality's behavior.

```python
from itertools import permutations

# Domain grid size: 2 rows × 6 columns = 12 cells
rows, cols = 2, 6
cells = [(r, c) for r in range(rows) for c in range(cols)]

def adjacent(a, b):
    r1, c1 = a
    r2, c2 = b
    # Adjacent if same row and columns differ by 1 or
    # same column and rows differ by 1
    return (r1 == r2 and abs(c1 - c2) == 1) or (c1 == c2 and abs(r1 - r2) == 1)

# Precompute adjacency pairs (as unordered pairs)
adj_pairs = []
for i in range(len(cells)):
    for j in range(i+1, len(cells)):
        if adjacent(cells[i], cells[j]):
            adj_pairs.append((i, j))

values = list(range(12))

count = 0
for perm in permutations(values, 12):
    # perm[i] is value assigned to cells[i]
    # Check all adjacency pairs for difference divisible by 3
    if any((abs(perm[i] - perm[j]) % 3 == 0) for i, j in adj_pairs):
        continue
    count += 1
    if count <= 10:  # print first 10 as they are found
        print(f"Valid #{count} assignment: {perm}")
print(f"Total valid assignments: {count}")

# Print divisors of count as candidates
def divisors(n):
    divs = []
    for d in range(1, int(n**0.5)+1):
        if n % d == 0:
            divs.append(d)
            if d*d != n:
                divs.append(n//d)
    return sorted(divs)

print("Divisors of total count:", divisors(count))
```
