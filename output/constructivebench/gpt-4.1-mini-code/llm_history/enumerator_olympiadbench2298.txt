The problem describes the set of real numbers \(x\) such that 
\[
0 < \frac{x^2 - 11}{x + 1} < 7 \quad \text{and} \quad x \neq -1.
\]
We want to enumerate values of \(x\) that satisfy this double inequality, especially focusing on rational or integer \(x\).

The program below:
- Loops over integer \(x\) in a reasonable range (e.g., from -15 to 15 excluding -1).
- Computes the value \(\frac{x^2-11}{x+1}\).
- Checks if it lies strictly between 0 and 7.
- Prints \(x\) along with the exact fraction value.
This will help conjecture what the solution set looks like.

```python
# Enumerate integers x (excluding -1) and check if (x^2 - 11)/(x+1) in (0,7)
def main():
    print("Enumerating integer x with 0 < (x^2 - 11)/(x + 1) < 7 and x != -1:")
    for x in range(-15, 16):
        if x == -1:
            continue
        numerator = x**2 - 11
        denominator = x + 1
        # denominator cannot be zero guaranteed by x != -1
        val = numerator / denominator
        if 0 < val < 7:
            # Print exact fraction and value
            print(f"x = {x}, fraction = ({numerator}/{denominator}) = {val}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This is an effective way to enumerate candidates for the solution set and observe patterns.
