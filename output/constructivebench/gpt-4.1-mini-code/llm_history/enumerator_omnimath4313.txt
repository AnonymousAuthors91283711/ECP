[write_program]
The problem asks whether there exists a sequence visiting all cells of an n×n grid exactly once, where each consecutive pair is adjacent (grid neighbors), and any two indices i,j with the same remainder mod n are mapped to positions with differing row and column values. The last condition forbids certain alignments based on index modulo.

We want to explore small n, and print candidates for f along with verification if the conditions hold.

We'll:
- Enumerate all permutations of the n² grid cells (for small n) to find sequences f: [0..n²-1]→grid cells.
- Check adjacency condition for consecutive cells.
- Check for all pairs i,j with i% n == j % n, that rows and cols differ.
- Print sequences (or partial info) when found.

To keep output short, limit to n=2 or 3 and print sequences found.

```python
from itertools import permutations

def adjacent(p, q):
    # p, q are (row, col)
    r1, c1 = p
    r2, c2 = q
    return (r1 == r2 and abs(c1 - c2) == 1) or (c1 == c2 and abs(r1 - r2) == 1)

def check_condition(n, seq):
    # seq: list of (r,c), length n^2
    # Check consecutive adjacency
    for i in range(len(seq) - 1):
        if not adjacent(seq[i], seq[i+1]):
            return False
    # Check for all i,j with i% n == j% n, rows and cols differ.
    for i in range(len(seq)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(seq)):
            if i % n == j % n:
                r_i, c_i = seq[i]
                r_j, c_j = seq[j]
                if r_i == r_j or c_i == c_j:
                    return False
    return True

def main():
    for n in [2,3]:
        print(f"n = {n}")
        cells = [(r,c) for r in range(n) for c in range(n)]
        count = 0
        # Permutations of size n^2 can be huge, limit enumeration for n=3
        limit = 100000 if n==3 else 10000
        for seq in permutations(cells):
            if check_condition(n, seq):
                print("Found sequence:")
                print(seq)
                count += 1
                if count >= 3:
                    break
        if count == 0:
            print("No sequence found.")
        print()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This program attempts to find sequences f fulfilling all conditions, printing up to 3 for each n=2,3.
