abbrev omnimath4066_answer : Set (ℕ × ℕ) := sorry
theorem omnimath4066 (n k : ℕ) (h : n ≥ k) :
    (n, k) ∈ omnimath4066_answer ↔ k!! * (n - k)!! ∣ n!! := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(n, k) | k = 0 ∨ k = n ∨ (Even n ∧ Even k) ∨ (n, k) = (2, 1)}
Proposed Answer: { p : ℕ × ℕ | p.2 ≤ p.1 ∧ (p.2 % 2 = 0 ∨ (p.1 - p.2) % 2 = 0) }
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding pairs (n,k) where k!! * (n-k)!! divides n!!.

2. Ground Truth Answer:
   - k=0 (trivial case, 0!!=1 divides anything)
   - k=n (trivial case, n!! divides itself)
   - Both n and k even (this ensures the double factorials preserve parity)
   - Special case (2,1) (2!!=2, 1!!=1, (2-1)!!=1, and 2 divides 2)

3. Proposed Answer:
   - Requires k ≤ n
   - Either k is even or (n-k) is even

Comparison:
- The proposed answer correctly captures the cases where both n and k are even (since if k is even, that satisfies the condition)
- It also captures the case where n-k is even (which would make n and k have the same parity)
- However, it misses:
  - The trivial cases k=0 and k=n (when k=0, k≤n is true but the second condition might not hold)
  - The special case (2,1) (where k=1 is odd and n-k=1 is odd, but 1!!*1!!=1 divides 2!!=2)

The proposed answer is mostly correct but misses some edge cases.
