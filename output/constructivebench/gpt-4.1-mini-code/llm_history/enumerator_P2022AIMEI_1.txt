The problem involves two quadratic polynomials \(P\) and \(Q\) with leading coefficients 2 and -2 respectively, both satisfying \(P(16) = Q(16) = 54\) and \(P(20) = Q(20) = 53\). We want to find \(P(0) + Q(0)\).

Given the symmetry and constraints, let's enumerate all quadratics \(P\) with leading coefficient 2 passing through the points (16, 54) and (20, 53), and similarly for \(Q\) with leading coefficient -2. Then compute \(P(0)+Q(0)\).

```python
# We have P(x) = 2x^2 + a*x + b, Q(x) = -2x^2 + c*x + d
# Constraints:
# P(16)=54 -> 2*16^2 +16*a + b =54
# P(20)=53 -> 2*20^2 +20*a + b =53
# Q(16)=54 -> -2*16^2 +16*c + d =54
# Q(20)=53 -> -2*20^2 +20*c + d =53
# We want P(0)+Q(0) = b + d

def find_coeffs(fixed_coeff, x1, y1, x2, y2):
    # fixed_coeff is leading coeff of quadratic
    # Solves for a,b in f(x) = fixed_coeff * x^2 + a * x + b
    # Given f(x1) = y1, f(x2) = y2
    A = [[x1, 1], [x2, 1]]
    B = [y1 - fixed_coeff * x1**2, y2 - fixed_coeff * x2**2]
    # Solve linear system A*[a,b] = B
    det = A[0][0]*A[1][1] - A[0][1]*A[1][0]
    a = (B[0]*A[1][1] - B[1]*A[0][1]) / det
    b = (A[0][0]*B[1] - A[1][0]*B[0]) / det
    return a,b

# Compute P coefficients
a_p, b_p = find_coeffs(2,16,54,20,53)
print(f"P(x) = 2x^2 + {a_p} x + {b_p}")

# Compute Q coefficients
a_q, b_q = find_coeffs(-2,16,54,20,53)
print(f"Q(x) = -2x^2 + {a_q} x + {b_q}")

# Compute P(0) + Q(0)
sum_at_0 = b_p + b_q
print(f"P(0) + Q(0) = {sum_at_0}")
```
