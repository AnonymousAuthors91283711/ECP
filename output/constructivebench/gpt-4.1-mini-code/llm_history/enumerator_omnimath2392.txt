[write_program]
The problem seems to involve computing the sum of floor divisions: \(\sum_{d=1}^{2012} \lfloor \frac{2012}{d} \rfloor\). The program will enumerate exact values for smaller ranges (to keep output manageable) and confirm the sum for the full range. Since the sum is large, we will exhibit partial sums for smaller n and finally print the sum for n=2012.

```python
# Enumerate and sum floor(2012/d) for d=1..n, for small n to detect patterns and for n=2012 full answer.

def floor_div_sum(n):
    s = 0
    for d in range(1, n+1):
        v = 2012 // d
        print(f"d={d}, floor(2012/{d})={v}")
        s += v
    print(f"Sum of floor(2012/d) for d=1 to {n} = {s}\n")
    return s

print("Partial sums for n=10, 20, 50:")
for n in [10, 20, 50]:
    floor_div_sum(n)

print("Final sum for n=2012:")
floor_div_sum(2012)
```
