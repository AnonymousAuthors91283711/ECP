The given problem involves counting certain permutations related to the 2011 AIME II problem 12, likely involving circular permutations and a count of valid arrangements. We want to enumerate all possible candidates for (valid, total) fractions representing the probability, by trying some potential values for the count of valid arrangements under reasonable assumptions.

We assume total = (9-1)!/2 to represent the number of circular permutations of 9 elements up to reflection (a common counting technique). Then we try various factorizations for valid (the numerator) to see if we can get a fraction that looks like 3^3 * 6 * 4 * 2 as given in the "valid" estimate. We'll enumerate divisors near this number and output fractions. This might help identify the exact valid count by finding integer values that fit.

```python
import math

# Total number of circular permutations of 9 elements up to reflection:
total = math.factorial(8) // 2

print(f"Total permutations (circular, up to reflection): {total}")

# target factorization suggests valid = 3^3 * 6 * 4 * 2 = 27*6*4*2
# Let's compute that:
valid_target = (3**3) * 6 * 4 * 2

print(f"Target valid count from factorization: {valid_target}")

# Enumerate divisors of total near valid_target to find candidates for valid
# Because valid must be <= total, and probability = valid/total is simplified (coprime),
# enumerate all divisors near valid_target, or factors that could combine to valid_target.

# Because total is large (20160), we'll try a range around valid_target
start = max(1, valid_target - 20)
end = valid_target + 20

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

print("Enumerating candidates for valid count near target:")
for candidate in range(start, end + 1):
    if candidate > total:
        break
    if gcd(candidate, total) == 1:
        print(f"Valid = {candidate}, Probability = {candidate}/{total} (coprime)")

print("\nExtremal candidates:")
print(f"Minimum candidate near target: {start}")
print(f"Maximum candidate near target: {min(end,total)}")
```
