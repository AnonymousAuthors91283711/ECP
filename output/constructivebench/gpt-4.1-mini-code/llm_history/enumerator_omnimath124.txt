This problem involves exploring integer pairs \((m,n)\) under certain divisibility and inequality constraints with a fixed parameter \(a=2001\). We want to enumerate values \(k = f(m,n)\) for all such pairs \(p=(m,n)\) in the set \(A\).

Since \(f\) is unspecified, to assist we will enumerate possible \((m,n)\) in \(A\) given \(a=2001\) and compute the expression inside the divisibility and inequality to help conjecture \(f\). We will print valid \((m,n)\) and the value \(2an - m^2 + n^2\) (left hand side of divisibility) or other relevant values to assist in formulating \(f\).

We will limit the search by \(m < 2a\), \(n \neq 0\) and reasonably small \(|n|\) (like up to 50 to keep output-sized bounded). We print partial results while enumerating to assist analysis.

```python
a = 2001

def gcd(x, y):
    while y != 0:
        x, y = y, x % y
    return abs(x)

print(f"a = {a}")
print("Enumerating (m,n) with n != 0, m < 2a, |n| <= 50 satisfying conditions:")

count = 0
for n in range(-50, 51):
    if n == 0:
        continue
    for m in range(-1, 2*a):
        lhs = 2*a*m - m**2 + n**2
        rhs = 2*a*(n - m)
        cond_div = (lhs % (2*n) == 0)
        cond_ineq = (n**2 - m**2 + 2*m*n <= rhs)
        cond_m = (m < 2*a)
        if cond_div and cond_ineq and cond_m:
            k_val = lhs // (2*n)  # value such that 2n*k = lhs
            print(f"m={m}, n={n}, k={k_val}, lhs={lhs}, rhs={rhs}")
            count += 1
            if count >= 50:  # limit output to 50 lines
                break
    if count >= 50:
        break
```
This code prints \((m,n,k)\) triples for the first 50 points \(p\in A\), with \(k=(2am - m^2 + n^2)/(2n)\), which seems central in the given divisibility condition. This will provide concrete data to conjecture \(f\) and the extremal values mentioned (max 3750, min 2).
