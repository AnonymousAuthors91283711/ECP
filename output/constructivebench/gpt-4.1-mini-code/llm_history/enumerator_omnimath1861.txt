[write_program]
The problem seems to involve summations over some "multiples" set and comparisons of sums related to pairs formed by 36 students grouped in 8 categories with sizes 1 through 8. We want to analyze and guess the value of the ratio samePersonPairs / sameMultiplePairs.

I will write a program that, for small parameter values of students and multiples, enumerates the sums and computes the ratio, printing intermediate values to help conjecture the answer.

```python
# Enumerate sums for given numbers of students and groups ("multiples"),
# and compute ratio of sums involved in problem omnimath1861.
# Print intermediate sums and ratios to assist conjecturing.

def main():
    # Small sample parameters similar to problem statement
    students = 36
    multiples = list(range(1, 9))  # 1 to 8

    # Calculate sums as per problem statement
    totalPairs = students * students
    # sameMultiplePairs = sum of k * k over multiples
    sameMultiplePairs = sum(k * k for k in multiples)
    # samePersonPairs = sum of k over multiples
    samePersonPairs = sum(multiples)

    print(f"students = {students}")
    print(f"multiples = {multiples}")
    print(f"totalPairs = {totalPairs}")
    print(f"sameMultiplePairs = {sameMultiplePairs}")
    print(f"samePersonPairs = {samePersonPairs}")
    ratio = samePersonPairs / sameMultiplePairs
    print(f"ratio = samePersonPairs / sameMultiplePairs = {ratio}")

    # Additional enumeration for smaller multiples for insight
    print("\nEnumeration for smaller multiples sets:")
    for n in range(1, 9):
        ms = list(range(1, n + 1))
        smp = sum(k * k for k in ms)
        ssp = sum(ms)
        r = ssp / smp
        print(f"multiples = {ms}, ratio = {r}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
