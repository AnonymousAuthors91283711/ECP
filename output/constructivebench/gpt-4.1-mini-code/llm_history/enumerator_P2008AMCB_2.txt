The problem involves a 4x4 matrix M with entries defined by a formula depending on indices i, j. The rows 1 and 3 are reversed in a new matrix M'. We want to find the absolute difference between the sums of the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal of M'.

Given M i j = a + j + 7 * i (where a = M 0 0), a and M 0 0 range over natural numbers (0, 1, 2,...). I'll enumerate for small values of a (e.g. 0 to 5) and compute the difference |diag1 - diag2| for each case, printing all results found.

```python
# Enumerate possible values of 'a' (the base M 0 0) and compute |diag1 - diag2| as defined
for a in range(6):
    # Construct M
    # M[i][j] = a + j + 7*i
    M = [[a + j + 7*i for j in range(4)] for i in range(4)]

    # Construct M' per problem: rows 1 and 3 reversed, others unchanged
    M_prime = []
    for i in range(4):
        if i == 1 or i == 3:
            # reversed row
            row = [M[i][3 - j] for j in range(4)]
        else:
            # unchanged row
            row = M[i][:]
        M_prime.append(row)

    # Compute diag1 = sum M'[i][i]
    diag1 = sum(M_prime[i][i] for i in range(4))
    # Compute diag2 = sum M'[i][3 - i]
    diag2 = sum(M_prime[i][3 - i] for i in range(4))

    diff = abs(diag1 - diag2)
    print(f"a={a}: |diag1 - diag2| = {diff}")
```
