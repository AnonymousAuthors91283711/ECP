[write_program]
The problem asks to characterize the solution set of the equation \((x - a)(x - b) = (x - c)(x - d)\) under the constraints \(a + d = 2015\), \(b + c = 2015\), and \(a \neq c\). Reformulating and analyzing the equation for various sample parameter values can help guess the form of the solutions.

The Python program enumerates sample values \(a, b, c, d\) that satisfy the two sum conditions, then finds roots of the equation \((x-a)(x-b) - (x-c)(x-d) = 0\), printing them exactly (if rational), as decimals otherwise. This enumeration aids in conjecturing the possible values of \(x\).

```python
from fractions import Fraction
from math import isclose

def try_fraction(x):
    # Try to represent x as a fraction with small denominator for exactness
    for denom in range(1, 21):
        numer = round(x * denom)
        if isclose(x, numer / denom, rel_tol=1e-9):
            return Fraction(numer, denom)
    return None
