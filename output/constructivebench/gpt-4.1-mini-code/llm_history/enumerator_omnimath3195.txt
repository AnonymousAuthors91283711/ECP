The problem is to find a number \( k+1 \) corresponding to some integer \( c \) in the range \([5,10]\) satisfying the equation \((c-1)k + (k+1) = 100\), and such that this \(k+1\) is unique for all \(c'\) in \([5,10]\) with the same equation. The program will enumerate all \(c\) and \(k\) pairs within sensible bounds, print all \(k+1\) values found, and identify if one is common to all solutions.

```python
print("Enumerating (c,k,k+1) with 5 ≤ c ≤10 and (c-1)*k + (k+1)=100:")
c_range = range(5, 11)
c_k_plus1_pairs = []
for c in c_range:
    # Solve for k in (c-1)*k + k+1 = 100 => (c)*k + 1 = 100 => c*k = 99 => k = 99//c if divides
    if (100 - 1) % c == 0:
        k = (100 - 1)//c
        k_plus_1 = k + 1
        print(f"c={c}, k={k}, k+1={k_plus_1}")
        c_k_plus1_pairs.append((c, k_plus_1))

print("\nUnique k+1 values found:")
unique_values = set(k_plus_1 for _, k_plus_1 in c_k_plus1_pairs)
for val in unique_values:
    count = sum(1 for _, v in c_k_plus1_pairs if v == val)
    print(f"k+1 = {val}, occurs for {count} c-value(s)")

# Check if a k+1 occurs for all c in [5..10]
for val in unique_values:
    # Check if for every c in range there is a pair (c,val)
    if all(any(c == c_ and k_v == val for c_, k_v in c_k_plus1_pairs) for c in c_range):
        print(f"\nValue k+1={val} satisfies the equation for all c in [5..10].")
        print(f"omnimath3195_answer = {val}")
        break
else:
    print("\nNo single k+1 satisfies the equation for all c in [5..10].")
