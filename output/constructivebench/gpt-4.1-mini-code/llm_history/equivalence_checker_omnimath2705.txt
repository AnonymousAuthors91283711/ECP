abbrev omnimath2705_answer : ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2705 : 
  ∀ (x : ℝ), omnimath2705_answer x = 3 * (x - 2) + 5 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun x => 3 * x - 1
Proposed Answer: fun x : ℝ => 3 * (x - 2) + 5
Let's analyze the two answers:

Ground Truth: fun x => 3 * x - 1
Proposed: fun x : ℝ => 3 * (x - 2) + 5

Let's simplify the proposed answer:
3 * (x - 2) + 5 = 3x - 6 + 5 = 3x - 1

This is exactly equal to the ground truth answer. The different forms are just algebraic rearrangements of the same expression.
