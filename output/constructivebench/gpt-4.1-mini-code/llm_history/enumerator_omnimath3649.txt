The problem involves real numbers \(x, y\) satisfying the equation \(x^2 y^2 + xy + 1 = 3 y^2\). We define \(F = \frac{y - x}{x + 4y}\) and want to determine the set of possible values of \(F\) lying between 0 and 4.

I'll write a Python program to enumerate possible \((x, y)\) pairs over some sampled range, check the equation approximately, and output the corresponding \(F\) values that satisfy the equation within a small tolerance. We will print these values immediately and observe the range \(F\) can take.

```python
# enumerate possible (x,y) pairs, test the condition, print F values

import math

# small tolerance for floating point equality
TOL = 1e-6

print("Enumerating F = (y - x)/(x + 4y) for (x,y) satisfying x^2*y^2 + xy + 1 = 3*y^2")

# sample x, y in a reasonable range to find solutions
# avoid denominator zero: x + 4y != 0
# choose y in [-2,2], x in [-4,4] with step 0.1 for speed and compactness

ys = [i * 0.1 for i in range(-20, 21)]
xs = [i * 0.1 for i in range(-40, 41)]

found_Fs = set()

for y in ys:
    for x in xs:
        denom = x + 4*y
        if abs(denom) < 1e-8:
            continue
        lhs = x*x*y*y + x*y + 1
        rhs = 3*y*y
        if abs(lhs - rhs) < TOL:
            F = (y - x)/denom
            if 0 <= F <= 4:
                # round to avoid duplicates
                Fr = round(F, 4)
                if Fr not in found_Fs:
                    found_Fs.add(Fr)
                    print(f"F = {Fr} for x={round(x,3)} y={round(y,3)}")

print("\nEnumerated candidate F values lie between 0 and 4 inclusive.")
```
