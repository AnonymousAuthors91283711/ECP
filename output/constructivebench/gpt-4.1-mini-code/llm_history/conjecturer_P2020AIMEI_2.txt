Enumerated candidates with m + n = 17 that satisfy the condition above.. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Let's analyze the problem conditions:

Given:
- a = log₈(2x)
- b = log₄(x)
- c = log₂(x)
- b/a = c/b > 0
- x = m/n with m, n ∈ ℕ coprime, m + n = 17

From the logs:
a = log base 8 of 2x = (log₂(2x))/3 = (1 + log₂x)/3
b = log base 4 of x = (log₂ x)/2
c = log base 2 of x = log₂ x

Let log₂ x = t. Then:
a = (1 + t)/3
b = t/2
c = t

Condition b/a = c/b > 0:
b/a = (t/2) / ((1 + t)/3) = (3t)/(2(1 + t))
c/b = t / (t/2) = 2

Set equal:
(3t)/(2(1 + t)) = 2
3t = 4(1 + t)
3t = 4 + 4t
4 + 4t - 3t = 0
4 + t = 0
t = -4

Check positivity:
b/a = 2 > 0 correct

Then x = 2^t = 2^{-4} = 1/16

Check m+n=17, m/n=1/16 → m=1, n=16 coprime, sum 17

Hence answer = 1/16

The error is about computability; we can mark the abbreviation as noncomputable and write x as the division 1/16 in ℝ.

The original error arises because Lean cannot evaluate the division of two natural numbers as a real number directly in a computable definition. To make the expression accepted, we should mark it as `noncomputable` and write the division explicitly as a real number division using `/ (17 : ℝ)` notation, which Lean accepts for real number division.

From the enumerated answers and problem statement, x = 1/16 satisfies all given conditions, including x = m/n with m + n = 17 and gcd(m, n) = 1. Indeed, 1 + 16 = 17 and gcd(1,16) = 1.

Thus, the final answer in Lean should be:

```lean
noncomputable abbrev P2020AIMEI_2_answer : ℝ := 1 / 16
```

or, equivalently, expressing explicitly as `1 / 16` with denominator as real number:

```lean
noncomputable abbrev P2020AIMEI_2_answer : ℝ := 1 / 16
```

Since it is a single definition, wrapping it as `noncomputable` will solve the compile error.
