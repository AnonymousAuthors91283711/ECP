The problem asks for the maximum size of a subset \( s \subseteq \{(x,y) \mid x,y \in \{0,\dots,7\}\} \) such that for every integer \( d \), the number of elements in \( s \) with \( x - y = d \) is at most 3, and the number of elements with \( x + y = d \) is also at most 3.

To explore this, we enumerate all subsets \( s \) with these constraints and find large ones. Enumerating all subsets is infeasible, so we proceed by constructing approximate large sets and verifying the constraints. We print all sizes encountered and their example sets.

```python
from itertools import product
# The grid points
points = list(product(range(8), repeat=2))

# To help enumeration, collect points by difference and sum
diff_groups = {}
sum_groups = {}
for p in points:
    diff_groups.setdefault(p[0]-p[1], []).append(p)
    sum_groups.setdefault(p[0]+p[1], []).append(p)

# We want to select subsets s of points such that for each diff d, count ≤ 3 in s,
# and for each sum d, count ≤ 3 in s.

# This is a constraint satisfaction problem.
# We try a backtracking search:
best_size = 0
best_s = []

def can_add(p, selected, diff_count, sum_count):
    d = p[0]-p[1]
    s = p[0]+p[1]
    if diff_count.get(d,0) >= 3:
        return False
    if sum_count.get(s,0) >=3:
        return False
    return True

def backtrack(i, selected, diff_count, sum_count):
    global best_size, best_s
    if i == len(points):
        if len(selected) > best_size:
            best_size = len(selected)
            best_s = selected[:]
            print(f"Found subset of size {best_size}: {best_s}")
        return
    p = points[i]
    # Option 1: skip p
    backtrack(i+1, selected, diff_count, sum_count)
    # Option 2: add p if allowed
    d = p[0]-p[1]
    s = p[0]+p[1]
    if diff_count.get(d,0) < 3 and sum_count.get(s,0) < 3:
        diff_count[d] = diff_count.get(d,0)+1
        sum_count[s] = sum_count.get(s,0)+1
        selected.append(p)
        backtrack(i+1, selected, diff_count, sum_count)
        selected.pop()
        diff_count[d] -= 1
        sum_count[s] -= 1

# Limited backtracking due to combinatorial explosion
# We only search starting with first 20 points and prune after large sets found
import sys
sys.setrecursionlimit(10000)

print("Starting enumeration on 8x8 grid with constraints: max 3 on each diagonal difference and sum.")
backtrack(0, [], {}, {})
print(f"Maximum subset size found: {best_size}")
```
