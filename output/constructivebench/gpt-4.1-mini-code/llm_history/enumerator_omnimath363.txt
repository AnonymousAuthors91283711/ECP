The problem involves sequences \(a:\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{N}\) such that \(a(1)=1\) and \(a(i+1) \leq a(i)+1\) for \(i < n\), and the sum
\[
S = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \prod_{j=0}^i a(j+1)
\]
with an unknown closed form "omnimath363_answer n".

To assist, we will enumerate some valid sequences \(a\) for small \(n\) (e.g. up to 5), generate all sequences satisfying the constraints, compute the sum \(S\) for each, and print the sequences and sums. This will help conjecture the exact form of omnimath363_answer.

The key constraint is:
- \(a(1) = 1\)
- For each \(i\), \(a(i+1) \leq a(i)+1\)
Since \(a:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}\), all values are natural numbers (≥0). Actually given \(a(1)=1\), and the increasing constraint "≤ previous + 1", all values grow slowly.

We will generate sequences by incrementing values by 0 or 1 compared to the previous element, starting from 1 at index 1.

We will:
- for n=1..5
- generate sequences \(a\) with \(a(1)=1\), and \(a(i+1) \in \{a(i), a(i)+1\}\)
- compute the sum \(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \prod_{j=0}^i a(j+1)\)
- print the sequence and the sum

Print immediately each sum found (streaming).

Limit:
- at most two choices per step implies at most \(2^{n-1}\) sequences, which is manageable for n=5 (up to 16 sequences each).

This program will clearly print sums for sequences and help detect patterns.

```python
from itertools import product

def compute_sum(a):
    # compute sum_{i=0}^{n-1} prod_{j=0}^i a(j+1)
    total = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        p = 1
        for j in range(i+1):
            p *= a[j]
        total += p
    return total

def generate_sequences(n):
    # Generate all sequences a of length n with:
    # a[0] = 1
    # a[i] in {a[i-1], a[i-1]+1} for i>0
    if n == 0:
        return []
    results = []
    def backtrack(i, seq):
        if i == n:
            results.append(seq[:])
            return
        last = seq[-1]
        for next_val in (last, last+1):
            seq.append(next_val)
            backtrack(i+1, seq)
            seq.pop()
    backtrack(1, [1])
    return results

def main():
    for n in range(1,6):
        print(f"n = {n}")
        sequences = generate_sequences(n)
        for a in sequences:
            s = compute_sum(a)
            # print sequence and sum
            print(f"a = {a}, sum = {s}")
        print()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
