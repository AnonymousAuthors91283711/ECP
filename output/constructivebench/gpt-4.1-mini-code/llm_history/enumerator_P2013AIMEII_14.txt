[write_program]
The problem appears to involve summing Fibonacci numbers from n=20 to n=100 and finding the last three digits of that sum. To assist with conjecturing the last three digits, I will write a Python program that efficiently computes Fibonacci numbers modulo 1000 and accumulates the sum, printing partial sums along the way. The program also prints the parameters used.

```python
# Enumerate sums of Fibonacci numbers F(n) from n=20 to n=100 modulo 1000,
# printing each partial sum immediately to observe the pattern and final result.

def fibonacci_mod(n, mod):
    # Efficient Fibonacci modulo calculation using iterative approach
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(2, n + 1):
        a, b = b, (a + b) % mod
    return b

def main():
    mod = 1000
    start, end = 20, 100
    print(f"Computing sum of Fibonacci numbers from F({start}) to F({end}) modulo {mod}:")
    total = 0
    for n in range(start, end + 1):
        f = fibonacci_mod(n, mod)
        total = (total + f) % mod
        print(f"n={n}, F({n}) mod {mod} = {f}, partial sum mod {mod} = {total}")
    print(f"Final sum modulo {mod} = {total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
