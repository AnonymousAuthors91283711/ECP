theorem omnimath2486
  (a : ℕ → ℝ) 
  (hpos : ∀ n, 0 < a n)
  (hsum : ∀ k, ∑' n, Nat.choose n k * a n = (1/5)^k)
  : ∑' n, (-1)^(n+1) * a n = omnimath2486_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating solutions for small N with sums matching (1/5)^k:
N=3, a_n approx = ['0.83200', '0.14400', '0.01600', '0.00800']
Sum S = sum (-1)^(n+1) * a_n approx = -0.69600000
