Ground Truth Answer: {π/6, 5*π/6, π/4, 3*π/4}
Proposed Answer: {θ | θ ∈ Icc 0 (2 * π) ∧ (θ = Real.arcsin (Real.sqrt (1/2)) ∨ θ = π - Real.arcsin (Real.sqrt (1/2)) ∨ θ = Real.arcsin (1/2) ∨ θ = π - Real.arcsin (1/2))}
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

1. The ground truth provides explicit values: π/6, 5π/6, π/4, 3π/4
2. The proposed answer expresses the solution in terms of arcsin:
   - Real.arcsin(Real.sqrt(1/2)) = π/4
   - π - Real.arcsin(Real.sqrt(1/2)) = 3π/4
   - Real.arcsin(1/2) = π/6
   - π - Real.arcsin(1/2) = 5π/6

The proposed answer is exactly equivalent to the ground truth, just expressed in a different form using inverse trigonometric functions. All the solutions match exactly when evaluated.
