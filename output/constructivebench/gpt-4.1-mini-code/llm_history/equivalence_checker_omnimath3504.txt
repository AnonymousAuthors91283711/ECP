abbrev omnimath3504_answer : Set ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3504 (x : ℝ) : 
  x / 2 < x^2 ∧ x^2 < x ↔ x ∈ omnimath3504_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {x | x / 2 < x^2 ∧ x^2 < x}
Proposed Answer: {x : ℝ | 1/2 < x ∧ x < 1}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find all real numbers x where both x/2 < x² and x² < x hold simultaneously.

2. Ground truth answer is the direct set definition of all x satisfying both inequalities.

3. Proposed answer claims the solution is all x between 1/2 and 1.

Analysis:
- For x > 0:
  - x² < x simplifies to x < 1
  - x/2 < x² simplifies to x > 1/2
- For x < 0:
  - x² < x has no solutions (since x² is always positive while x is negative)
  - x = 0 doesn't satisfy x/2 < x² (0 < 0 is false)

Therefore, the only solutions are indeed x values between 1/2 and 1. The proposed answer is correct and equivalent to the ground truth, though expressed in simplified form.
