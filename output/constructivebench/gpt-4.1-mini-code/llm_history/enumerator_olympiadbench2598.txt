The problem is: given a birth year `charliebirthyear` between 1900 and 1999, such that 

    2014 - charliebirthyear = 2 * (charliebirthyear % 100),

find the value of `charliebirthyear`.

We want to enumerate possible birth years in the given range that satisfy the condition. When we find answers, we print them immediately.

```python
# Enumerate charliebirthyear in [1900,1999]
# Check if 2014 - y == 2 * (y % 100)
# Print all candidates immediately
# Then print the unique answer or all answers if multiple

def main():
    candidates = []
    for y in range(1900, 2000):
        last_two = y % 100
        if 2014 - y == 2 * last_two:
            print(f"Candidate charliebirthyear: {y}")
            candidates.append(y)
    if candidates:
        answer = min(candidates)
        print(f"Answer (min candidate): {answer}")
    else:
        print("No candidates found")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
