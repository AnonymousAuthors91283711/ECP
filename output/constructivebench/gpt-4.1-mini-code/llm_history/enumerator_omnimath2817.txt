The problem is to find real numbers \( x \) such that:
\[
10^x \cdot 10^5 = 100^4.
\]
Rearranging:
\[
10^{x+5} = (100)^4 = (10^2)^4 = 10^{8}.
\]
So we want to find all real \( x \) such that:
\[
10^{x+5} = 10^8 \implies x + 5 = 8 \implies x = 3.
\]
The only solution is \( x = 3 \).

Let's write a Python program to enumerate this by checking \( x \) in a small range with exact values (integers and rationals) to confirm the equality \( 10^{x+5} = 100^{4} \).

```python
from fractions import Fraction
import math

# Constants
target = 100 ** 4  # exact integer
# We'll check integer and rational x values around the solution

def is_equal_approx(a, b, tol=1e-9):
    return abs(a - b) < tol

print("Checking integer values of x in range [-5, 10]:")
for x in range(-5, 11):
    val = 10**(x + 5)
    if val == target:
        print(f"x = {x} gives 10^(x+5) = {val} == 100^4 = {target}")

print("Checking some rational x values near 3:")
# test rational numbers around x=3 with denominator <=10
for denominator in range(1, 11):
    for numerator in range(3*denominator - 5, 3*denominator + 6):
        x = Fraction(numerator, denominator)
        val = 10**float(x + 5)
        if is_equal_approx(val, target):
            print(f"x = {x} (~={float(x):.5f}) gives 10^(x+5) = {val} â‰ˆ {target}")

print("Conclusion: x = 3 is the unique solution.")
```
