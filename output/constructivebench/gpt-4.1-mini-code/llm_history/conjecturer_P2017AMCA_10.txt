. Enumerated answers: Enumerating ratios area(P)/area(rectangle) for rectangles with H=2*W:
W=1, H=2 => ratio = 3/4 = 0.75000
W=2, H=4 => ratio = 3/4 = 0.75000
W=3, H=6 => ratio = 3/4 = 0.75000
W=4, H=8 => ratio = 3/4 = 0.75000
W=5, H=10 => ratio = 3/4 = 0.75000
For W=2017, H=4034 => ratio = 3/4 = 0.75000

Answer: 3/4 = 0.75000. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
