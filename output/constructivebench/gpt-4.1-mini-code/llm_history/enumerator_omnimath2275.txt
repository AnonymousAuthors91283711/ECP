The problem asks for the number of integers \( n \) in the range 1 to 1000 that can be expressed as a sum of distinct powers of 3 (with distinct exponents less than \( n \)).

This is essentially counting how many numbers from 1 to 1000 can be represented as sums of distinct powers of 3, i.e., numbers whose ternary representation consists only of 0s and 1s (no digit 2).

The program below enumerates these numbers by generating sums of distinct powers of 3 up to 1000, prints each number found immediately, and finally prints the count of such numbers.

```python
def main():
    max_n = 1000
    # Generate powers of 3 up to max_n
    powers = []
    p = 1
    while p <= max_n:
        powers.append(p)
        p *= 3

    results = set()
    # Use bitmask to generate all sums of distinct powers of 3
    # Number of powers is small (<=7), so brute force is efficient
    from itertools import combinations

    for r in range(1, len(powers) + 1):
        for combo in combinations(powers, r):
            s = sum(combo)
            if s <= max_n and s not in results:
                results.add(s)
                print(s)

    print("Count:", len(results))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
