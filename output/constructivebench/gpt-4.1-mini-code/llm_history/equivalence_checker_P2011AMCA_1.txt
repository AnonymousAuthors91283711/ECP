Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: 20 + 0.05 * 100 + 0.1 * max 0 (30.5 * 60 - 1800)
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer exactly matches the expression given in the problem statement for calculating the cost. It correctly substitutes the given values of T (100) and M (30.5 * 60) into the cost formula, including the max function that handles the case when M - 1800 might be negative. Since the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's not provided), we can only verify that the proposed answer correctly implements the given formula, which it does.
