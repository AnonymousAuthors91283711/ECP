abbrev omnimath2768_answer : ℤ × ℤ → ℤ := sorry
theorem omnimath2768 (x y : ℤ) (hx : x = -2) (hy : y = -1) : 
    (3 * x + 2 * y) - (3 * x - 2 * y) = omnimath2768_answer (x, y) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun (x, y) => (3 * x + 2 * y) - (3 * x - 2 * y)
Proposed Answer: fun p : ℤ × ℤ => 4 * p.2
Let's analyze the problem and both answers:

1. The problem is asking to simplify the expression (3*x + 2*y) - (3*x - 2*y)
2. Let's simplify it step by step:
   (3x + 2y) - (3x - 2y) = 3x + 2y - 3x + 2y = (3x - 3x) + (2y + 2y) = 0 + 4y = 4y
3. The ground truth answer shows the unsimplified form of the expression
4. The proposed answer shows the simplified form: 4 * p.2 (which is 4 times the second element of the pair, i.e., 4y)

The proposed answer is mathematically equivalent to the ground truth answer, just in a simplified form. Both would produce the same result for any integer inputs x and y.
