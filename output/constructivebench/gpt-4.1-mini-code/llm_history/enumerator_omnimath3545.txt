This looks like a simple algebraic equation: \((-1) \times 2 \times x \times 4 = 24\). We want to find all real \(x\) such that this holds, then identify the unique solution \(x = \text{omnimath3545_answer}\).

I'll write a Python program to solve for \(x\) by enumerating rational candidates and then print the exact solution. Since it's a straightforward linear equation, the unique solution can be printed immediately. The enumeration for small integer values can serve as a check.

```python
# Enumerate integer candidates for x in a small range and check the equation
# (-1)*2*x*4 = 24  =>  -8x = 24  =>  x = -3 exactly

def check_solution(x):
    return (-1)*2*x*4 == 24

print("Enumerating integer candidates for x from -10 to 10:")
for x in range(-10, 11):
    if check_solution(x):
        print(f"x = {x} satisfies (-1)*2*x*4 = 24")

# Direct exact solution
from fractions import Fraction
x_sol = Fraction(24, -8)  # -8x = 24 => x = 24/-8
print(f"Exact solution: x = {x_sol} ({float(x_sol)})")
```
This program first tests integers from -10 to 10 to identify any integer solutions, then prints the exact rational solution as a fraction and its float value.
