[write_program]
The problem concerns finding the smallest natural number \( b \geq 2 \) such that for some \( a \), every number in the interval \([a+1, a+b]\) has a partner \( l \neq k \) in the same interval making \(\gcd(k^2 + k + 1, l^2 + l + 1) \neq 1\).

To explore this, I'll write a Python program to check for small \(b\) and \(a\) values. The program will:
- Try \( b \) from 2 up to a small threshold.
- For each \( b \), try \( a \) from 0 to some limit.
- For each \( k \in [a+1, a+b] \), check if there is \( l \neq k \) in the same range such that \(\gcd(k^2+k+1, l^2+l+1) > 1\).
- Print \((a,b)\) whenever the condition holds for all \(k\).
- Print the minimal \(b\) for which this happens.

This should help conjecture the minimal \(b\).

```python
from math import gcd

def is_good_interval(a, b):
    vals = [k*k + k + 1 for k in range(a+1, a+b+1)]
    n = len(vals)
    for i in range(n):
        found = False
        for j in range(n):
            if i != j and gcd(vals[i], vals[j]) > 1:
                found = True
                break
        if not found:
            return False
    return True

max_b = 20
max_a = 20

minimal_b = None

for b in range(2, max_b + 1):
    found_for_b = False
    for a in range(max_a + 1):
        if is_good_interval(a, b):
            print(f"a={a}, b={b} satisfies condition")
            found_for_b = True
            break  # no need to try larger a for this b
    if found_for_b:
        minimal_b = b
        print(f"Minimal b found so far: {minimal_b}")
        break  # minimal b found, stop searching

if minimal_b is None:
    print(f"No b â‰¤ {max_b} found satisfying condition")
else:
    print(f"Conjectured minimal b is {minimal_b}")
```
