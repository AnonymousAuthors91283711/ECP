Ground Truth Answer: (10^3, 10)
Proposed Answer: (10^3, 10^1)
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer (10^3, 10^1) is exactly equivalent to the ground truth answer (10^3, 10) since 10^1 = 10. Both answers represent the same pair of values (1000, 10). The notation difference is purely syntactic and doesn't affect the mathematical equivalence.
