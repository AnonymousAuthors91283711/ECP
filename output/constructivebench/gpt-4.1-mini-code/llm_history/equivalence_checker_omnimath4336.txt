theorem omnimath4336 (r : ℕ) :
  (∀ (a : ℕ) (m : ℕ) (s : Finset ℕ), (∀ x ∈ s, ∃ k, x = 2^k) → 
    ∃ (bus : ℕ), (∃ (stations : Finset ℕ), (∀ x ∈ stations, ∃ k, x = 2^k) ∧ bus = stations.sum id) ∧ 
    bus ≡ a [MOD r] ∧ s ⊆ stations) ↔ r ∈ omnimath4336_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {r : ℕ | Odd r}
Proposed Answer: {r : ℕ | r % 2 = 1}
