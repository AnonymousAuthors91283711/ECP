<<<72>>> 
(Explanation: The problem involves injective functions from a 2x6 grid to Fin 12 with the condition that adjacent outputs differ by a value not divisible by 3. The count of such functions is 72, which matches the enumerated results and respects the divisibility constraints on adjacent values.)
