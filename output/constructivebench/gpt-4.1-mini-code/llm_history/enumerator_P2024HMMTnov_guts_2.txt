The problem is to find the smallest natural number \( n > 72 \) whose prime factors match those of 72. Since \(72 = 2^3 \cdot 3^2\), \(n\) must have only 2 and 3 as prime factors, with multiplicities that can be less than or equal to those of 72. We enumerate all such numbers greater than 72 by varying the exponents of 2 and 3, print each candidate immediately, and finally print the smallest qualifying \(n\).

```python
# Enumerate numbers n > 72 with prime factors only 2 and 3 (matching prime factors of 72=2^3*3^2)
# 2 exponents from 0 up to 5 (somewhat above 3), 3 exponents up to 5 (above 2)
print("Searching for n > 72 with prime factors only 2 and 3 (like 72=2^3*3^2):")
candidates = []
for e2 in range(6):
    for e3 in range(6):
        val = (2 ** e2) * (3 ** e3)
        if val > 72:
            # Print each candidate immediately
            print(val)
            candidates.append(val)
# Find minimum among candidates
if candidates:
    answer = min(candidates)
    print("Smallest n > 72 with same prime factors as 72 is:", answer)
else:
    print("No candidate found")
```
