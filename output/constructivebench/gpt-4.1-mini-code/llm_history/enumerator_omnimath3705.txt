The problem describes a set of natural numbers \( n \) such that:

- \( n = k^3 \) for some positive integer \( k \),
- \( 10 \nmid n \) (i.e., \( n \) is not divisible by 10),
- and \( \frac{n}{1000} = m^3 \) for some integer \( m \).

This implies \( n = k^3 = 1000 m^3 = (10m)^3 \), so \( k = 10m \).

The condition \( 10 \nmid n \) contradicts \( n = (10m)^3 \) because \( n \) must be divisible by 10Â³.

Thus, no \( n \) satisfy these conditions simultaneously.

However, to confirm and assist conjecture, we'll enumerate cubes \( n = k^3 \) for small \( k \), check the conditions, and print all such numbers found.

```python
# Enumerate cubes n=k^3 for k in range(1, 100) and check the conditions:
# 1) k > 0
# 2) 10 does not divide n
# 3) n/1000 is a perfect cube (integer cube)

def is_perfect_cube(x: int) -> bool:
    if x < 0:
        return False
    r = round(x ** (1/3))
    return r**3 == x

def main():
    print("Enumerating cubes n=k^3 with k in 1..99:")
    for k in range(1, 100):
        n = k**3
        if n % 10 == 0:
            # divisible by 10, skip
            continue
        if n % 1000 != 0:
            # n/1000 not integer, skip
            continue
        quotient = n // 1000
        if is_perfect_cube(quotient):
            print(f"Found n={n} (k={k}), n/1000={quotient} is a perfect cube")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
