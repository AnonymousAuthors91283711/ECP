The problem involves 12th roots of unity \(z, w\) satisfying the equation \(z - w = (4 + 4i)(z + w)\), and we're interested in the least possible value of \(|zw|^2\) (which should be 1 since they lie on the unit circle, but let's enumerate to explore any nuance).

We'll enumerate all pairs \((z, w)\) where \(z, w\) are 12th roots of unity (i.e., \(z = e^{2\pi i k/12}\), \(w = e^{2\pi i m/12}\) for integers \(k,m\in [0,11]\)) and check which satisfy \(z - w = (4 + 4i)(z + w)\). For those satisfying pairs, we output \(|zw|^2\), which is always 1 if \(z,w\) are on the unit circle, but checking all will confirm the possible solutions and show us if any interesting structure or contradiction arises.

This exhaustive enumeration helps conjecture the minimal norm-squared value or verify the problem conditions.

```python
import cmath

def is_close(a, b, tol=1e-9):
    return abs(a - b) < tol

def main():
    n = 12
    factor = 2 * cmath.pi / n
    scale = 4 + 4j
    roots = [cmath.exp(1j * factor * k) for k in range(n)]
    found_rs = set()
    for k, z in enumerate(roots):
        for m, w in enumerate(roots):
            lhs = z - w
            rhs = scale * (z + w)
            if is_close(lhs, rhs):
                r = abs(z * w) ** 2
                if r not in found_rs:
                    found_rs.add(r)
                    print(f"z=exp(2πi*{k}/12), w=exp(2πi*{m}/12), r=|z*w|^2={r}")
    if found_rs:
        min_r = min(found_rs)
        print(f"Minimum |z*w|^2 found: {min_r}")
    else:
        print("No pairs (z,w) satisfy the equation.")
