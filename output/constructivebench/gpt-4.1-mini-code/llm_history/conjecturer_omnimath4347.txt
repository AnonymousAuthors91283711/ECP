theorem omnimath4347 (n : ℕ) (h : 10 < n ∧ n < 20) :
    (∃ k : ℕ, 4 * k + 5 * k = n^2 ∧ n^2 % 9 = 0) ↔ n ∈ omnimath4347_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n=12, k=16, since 4k+5k=9k=n^2=144
n=15, k=25, since 4k+5k=9k=n^2=225
n=18, k=36, since 4k+5k=9k=n^2=324. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
<<<{ n | 10 < n ∧ n < 20 ∧ 9 ∣ n^2 }>>>
