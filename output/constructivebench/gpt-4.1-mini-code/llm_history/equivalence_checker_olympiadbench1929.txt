Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: { (m, n) | (n = 1 ∧ m = 1) ∨ (n = 2 ∧ m = 3) }
<<<None>>>
Since the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's not provided), we cannot verify whether the proposed answer matches the ground truth. The proposed answer provides specific cases (n=1, m=1) and (n=2, m=3), but without knowing the complete solution set, we cannot determine equivalence.
