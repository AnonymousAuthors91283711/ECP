Proposed Answer: fun odometerReading => Nat.ofDigits 9 (Nat.digits 10 odometerReading |>.map fun d => if d < 4 then d else d - 1)
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

1. Both answers:
   - Take an odometer reading as input
   - Process the digits of the number
   - Adjust digits ≥5 by subtracting 1 (ground truth does this explicitly, proposed does via mapping)
   - Convert the adjusted digits to a number

2. Key differences:
   - Ground truth uses reverse digits and builds the number recursively with powers of 9
   - Proposed answer uses Nat.ofDigits directly on the digits (without reverse) with base 9
   - The digit adjustment condition differs slightly (ground truth checks ≥5, proposed checks <4)

3. The proposed answer has two issues:
   - It doesn't reverse the digits, which means it processes them in the wrong order
   - The digit adjustment condition is slightly different (though mathematically equivalent for digits 0-9)

The main problem is the digit order - since odometer digits are processed left-to-right (most significant to least significant), the proposed answer's failure to reverse the digits makes it incorrect.
