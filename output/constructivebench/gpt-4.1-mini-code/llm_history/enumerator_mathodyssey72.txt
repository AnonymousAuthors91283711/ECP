The problem counts the number of involutions \(f\) on \(\{0,\ldots,9\}\) such that for every \(i\), \(|f(i)-i|=2\). Such \(f\) satisfy \(f(f(i))=i\), so \(f\) is an involution; and each output differs from its input by exactly 2.

We enumerate all such functions \(f\), checking involution and distance conditions.

```python
# Enumerate involutions f: {0,...,9} -> {0,...,9} with |f(i)-i|=2 and f(f(i))=i

def main():
    n = 10
    candidates = []
    # Each i can map only to i+2 or i-2 (if they are in range)
    # Let's denote possible images for each point
    possible = []
    for i in range(n):
        opts = []
        if i - 2 >= 0:
            opts.append(i - 2)
        if i + 2 < n:
            opts.append(i + 2)
        possible.append(opts)

    # We'll build f as a list of length n
    # Backtracking to assign f[i], keeping involution constraints
    # We'll keep track of assigned f and require f[f[i]] = i

    f = [-1]*n
    used = [False]*n  # to avoid conflicting mappings

    def backtrack(i):
        if i == n:
            # Check involution: already guaranteed by construction, print f
            candidates.append(f[:])
            print(f)
            return
        if f[i] != -1:
            backtrack(i+1)
            return
        for x in possible[i]:
            # f[i] = x implies f[x] = i for involution
            # Check if f[x] is consistent
            if 0 <= x < n:
                if f[x] == -1:
                    # assign f[i]=x and f[x]=i
                    f[i] = x
                    f[x] = i
                    backtrack(i+1)
                    f[i] = -1
                    f[x] = -1
                elif f[x] == i:
                    # consistent with previously assigned, assign f[i]=x
                    f[i] = x
                    backtrack(i+1)
                    f[i] = -1

    backtrack(0)
    print(f"Total involutions found: {len(candidates)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
