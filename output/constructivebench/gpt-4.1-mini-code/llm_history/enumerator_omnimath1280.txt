The problem involves counting positive integers k in [1..2000] co-prime with 2001. We enumerate such k and print them immediately, then print the count as the answer candidate.

```python
# Enumerate k in [1..2000] co-prime with 2001, print each and count them
def gcd(a,b):
    while b:
        a,b=b,a%b
    return a

def main():
    n=2001
    count=0
    for k in range(1,2001):
        if gcd(k,n)==1:
            print(k)
            count+=1
    print('Answer candidate:', count)

if __name__=='__main__':
    main()
```
