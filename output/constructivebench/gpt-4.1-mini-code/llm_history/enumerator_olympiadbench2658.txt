The problem involves finding real numbers \( d \) and \( s \) satisfying:
\[
d = s (T + 30), \quad d = (s + 1.5) T
\]
for a given \( T \). We want to find all such \( (d, s) \) pairs for different values of \( T \). The program will select a few sample \( T \) values, solve for \( s \) and \( d \), and print the results.

```python
# Enumerate solutions for d, s given d = s(T+30) and d = (s+1.5)T
# for sample values of T.
def main():
    print("Enumerate (T, s, d) solving d = s(T+30) = (s+1.5)T")
    # Sample T values
    for T in [10, 50, 100, 150]:
        # Solve for s:
        # s*(T+30) = (s+1.5)*T
        # sT + 30s = sT + 1.5 T
        # 30 s = 1.5 T => s = (1.5 T)/30 = T/20
        s = T / 20
        d = s * (T + 30)
        print(f"T={T:.1f}, s={s:.3f}, d={d:.3f}")

    main()
```
