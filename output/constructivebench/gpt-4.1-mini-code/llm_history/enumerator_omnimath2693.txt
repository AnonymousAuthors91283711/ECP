The problem asks to find a unique natural number \(N\) such that:
- \(400 < N < 600\),
- \(N\) is odd,
- divisible by 5,
- divisible by 11,
- and the sum of digits of \(N\) equals a certain answer `omnimath2693_answer`.

We do not know `omnimath2693_answer` initially. The goal is to enumerate all such numbers and print their sums of digits. This may help conjecture the correct sum and the unique number satisfying all conditions.

To solve this:
- Iterate \(N\) over \((401, 600)\),
- Check if \(N\) is odd,
- Check divisibility by 5 and 11,
- Calculate digits sum,
- Print \(N\) and sum immediately.

```python
def digit_sum(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

def main():
    # Range and conditions
    for N in range(401, 600):
        if N % 2 == 1 and N % 5 == 0 and N % 11 == 0:
            s = digit_sum(N)
            print(f"N={N}, sum_of_digits={s}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
