The problem considers the set \( S = \{(i,j) \mid 1 \leq i \leq 6, 1 \leq j \leq 6, ij = 12 \} \) and asks to evaluate the ratio \(|S| / 36\), where 36 is the total number of pairs \((i,j)\) with \(i,j \in \{1,\dots,6\}\).

To assist in conjecturing the value, we enumerate all pairs \((i,j)\) in the 6x6 grid, select those for which \(i \times j = 12\), count them, and then output the ratio.

```python
# Enumerate pairs (i,j) with 1<=i,j<=6 and i*j=12, then print count and ratio over 36
def main():
    count = 0
    total = 36
    print("Pairs (i,j) with 1<=i,j<=6 and i*j=12:")
    for i in range(1, 7):
        for j in range(1, 7):
            if i * j == 12:
                print(f"({i},{j})")
                count += 1
    print(f"Count = {count}")
    ratio = count / total
    print(f"Ratio = count/36 = {ratio}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
