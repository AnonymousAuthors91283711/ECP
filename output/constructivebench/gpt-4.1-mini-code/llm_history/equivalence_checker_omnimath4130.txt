Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: { (a,b,c) | a = b ∧ b = c ∧ a > 0 ∧ a * a - a = 2 } ∪
({(2, 2, 3), (2, 3, 2), (3, 2, 2)} : Set (ℕ × ℕ × ℕ)) ∪
({(2, 6, 11), (2, 11, 6), (6, 2, 11), (6, 11, 2), (11, 2, 6), (11, 6, 2)} : Set (ℕ × ℕ × ℕ)) ∪

The proposed answer includes several valid solutions that satisfy the given conditions, but it appears to be incomplete. The first part (a = b = c) only considers the case where a*a - a = 2 (which gives a=2), but there might be other cases where a*a - a equals other powers of 2. The other cases listed (permutations of (2,2,3), (2,6,11), and (3,5,7)) are correct solutions, but there might be additional solutions not included in the proposed answer. Therefore, while the proposed answer contains correct elements, it may not represent the complete solution set.
