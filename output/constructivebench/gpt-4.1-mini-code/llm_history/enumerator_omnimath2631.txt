We want to explore values of real numbers x, y, z, w (with w ≠ 0) satisfying the given system:
(x + 6y - 3z)/(-3x + 4w) = (-2y + z)/(x - w) = 2/3

From these equalities, we will attempt to enumerate some rational sample values for (x, y, z, w), ensuring w ≠ 0, that satisfy the equalities, and print the resulting x/w values. This may help conjecture the exact value of x/w.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Enumerate candidates for w (nonzero), x, y, z as small integers
# Check the conditions without floating point errors
for w in range(1, 6):
    for x in range(-10, 11):
        for y in range(-10, 11):
            for z in range(-10, 11):
                # denominators must not be zero
                denom1 = -3*x + 4*w
                denom2 = x - w
                if denom1 == 0 or denom2 == 0:
                    continue
                # compute fractions exactly
                left = Fraction(x + 6*y - 3*z, denom1)
                right = Fraction(-2*y + z, denom2)
                # check both equal and equal to 2/3
                if left == right == Fraction(2,3):
                    val = Fraction(x, w)
                    print(f"x={x}, y={y}, z={z}, w={w} => x/w={val}")
# From outputs, we can identify possible values of x/w.
```
[refine_program]
The original program logically follows the problem's requirements by enumerating small integer candidates for the variables and checking the given equalities with exact fractions. It also correctly handles denominators to avoid division by zero.

However, it restricts w to positive integers only, ignoring negative values of w (only from 1 to 5), thus potentially missing valid solutions. Also, the ranges for x, y, z are symmetric, but w should include negative values as well because w ≠ 0 but can be negative. Extending w to negative values will provide more candidates.

Furthermore, the program prints the solutions directly once found, as required.

Hence, the original program is rejected due to incomplete search space for w.

<<<False>>>
```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Enumerate candidates for w (nonzero), x, y, z as small integers
# Check the conditions exactly with fractions, considering negative w as well
for w in range(-5, 6):
    if w == 0:
        continue
    for x in range(-10, 11):
        for y in range(-10, 11):
            for z in range(-10, 11):
                denom1 = -3*x + 4*w
                denom2 = x - w
                if denom1 == 0 or denom2 == 0:
                    continue
                left = Fraction(x + 6*y - 3*z, denom1)
                right = Fraction(-2*y + z, denom2)
                if left == right == Fraction(2, 3):
                    val = Fraction(x, w)
                    print(f"x={x}, y={y}, z={z}, w={w} => x/w={val}")
```
[refine_program]
The original program exhaustively enumerates integer values for x,y,z,w and checks the given equalities exactly using fractions. However, the search range is limited to x,y,z ∈ [-10,10], w ∈ [-5,5]\{0}. It outputs nothing, implying no solutions in that range.

Given the problem only states the conditions and asks to find x/w under those conditions, and the known value of the fraction as 2/3, solutions may lie outside these ranges, or the parameter range is too small.

To fix:
- Increase the search range to find solutions.
- Because the problem is algebraic, it is better to solve the equations symbolically or reduce the parameter search.
- But since only enumeration is permitted here, increase ranges moderately but keep the output concise as per instructions.
- Print all answers found and then print the distinct values of x/w.

I will extend ranges and add a set to collect unique x/w values.

Also, we better output found solutions immediately.

This should find at least one solution or confirm none exist up to a bigger range.

Because the output token limit is 400 tokens max, be sure to print minimal outputs.

Here is the corrected program.

<<<False>>>
```python
from fractions import Fraction

found_vals = set()
# Extend ranges moderately for w,x,y,z
for w in range(-10, 11):
    if w == 0:
        continue
    for x in range(-20, 21):
        for y in range(-20, 21):
            for z in range(-20, 21):
                denom1 = -3*x + 4*w
                denom2 = x - w
                if denom1 == 0 or denom2 == 0:
                    continue
                left = Fraction(x + 6*y - 3*z, denom1)
                right = Fraction(-2*y + z, denom2)
                if left == right == Fraction(2, 3):
                    val = Fraction(x, w)
                    if val not in found_vals:
                        print(f"x={x}, y={y}, z={z}, w={w} => x/w={val}")
                        found_vals.add(val)
# Print all distinct x/w values found
print("Distinct x/w values found:")
for v in sorted(found_vals):
    print(v)
```
