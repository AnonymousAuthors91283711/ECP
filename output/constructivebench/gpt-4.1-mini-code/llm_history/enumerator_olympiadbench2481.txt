The problem asks for the sum of binomial probabilities for k = 4, 5, 6 with n = 6 and p = 1/2. The exact value is the sum of (6 choose k) * (1/2)^6 for k=4..6. We enumerate these terms and sum them. Then print each term and the total sum exactly using fractions for exactness.

```python
from math import comb
from fractions import Fraction

n = 6
p = Fraction(1, 2)

total = Fraction(0, 1)
print(f"Parameters: n={n}, p=1/2")
for k in range(4, 7):
    term = Fraction(comb(n, k)) * p**n
    print(f"k={k}: (6 choose {k})*(1/2)^6 = {term}")
    total += term

print(f"Sum for k=4..6: {total} â‰ˆ {float(total):.6f}")
```
