Explanation:
The Lean error suggests that the current definition is trying to form a set of functions `f` as those satisfying an existential property involving a disjunction of two equalities. However, the disjunction `f = fun n => c * n0 ^ n ∨ f = fun n => c * rad n ^ n0` is a proposition valued function `ℕ → Prop` rather than a value of type `ℕ → ℕ`, causing a type mismatch.

To fix this, the correct approach is to express that `f` is either exactly the function `fun n => c * n0 ^ n` for some constants `c,n0`, or exactly the function `fun n => c * (rad n) ^ n0`. So this is a union of two sets expressed as a single set defined by a disjunction at the top level, not within the function expression.

Hence, we rewrite as:
```lean
{ f : ℕ → ℕ | ∃ c n0 : ℕ, (f = fun n => c * n0 ^ n) ∨ (f = fun n => c * (rad n) ^ n0) }
```
Note the parentheses around each equality proposition, separating the two alternatives clearly.

This now defines the set of functions `f` such that there exist constants `c, n0` for which either `f` equals the exponential function with constant base `n0`, or equals the exponential function with base `rad n`.

This matches the enumerated solutions which are constant times a power of `n` or a power of `rad(n)`.

Final answer, enclosed in `<<< >>>`:

<<<
{ f : ℕ → ℕ | ∃ c n0 : ℕ, (f = fun n => c * n0 ^ n) ∨ (f = fun n => c * (rad n) ^ n0) }
