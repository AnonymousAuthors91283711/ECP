theorem omnimath3445 :
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | 100 * 2^n > 10000 * (1/2)^n} omnimath3445_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n = 0, 100*2^0 = 100, 10000*(1/2)^0 = 10000.0
n = 1, 100*2^1 = 200, 10000*(1/2)^1 = 5000.0
n = 2, 100*2^2 = 400, 10000*(1/2)^2 = 2500.0
n = 3, 100*2^3 = 800, 10000*(1/2)^3 = 1250.0
n = 4, 100*2^4 = 1600, 10000*(1/2)^4 = 625.0
Smallest n with 100*2^n > 10000*(1/2)^n: 4. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
