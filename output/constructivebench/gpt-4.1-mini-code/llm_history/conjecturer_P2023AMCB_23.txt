theorem P2023AMCB_23 : 
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | card (image (fun (d : Fin n → Fin 6) => 
    ∏ i, (d i).val + 1) univ) = 936} P2023AMCB_23_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating n and number of distinct products:
n = 1, distinct product count = 6
n = 2, distinct product count = 18
n = 3, distinct product count = 40
n = 4, distinct product count = 75
n = 5, distinct product count = 126
n = 6, distinct product count = 196
n = 7, distinct product count = 288
n = 8, distinct product count = 405
n = 9, distinct product count = 550
n = 10, distinct product count = 726
No n with distinct product count 936 found for n in 1..10. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
