  (paddle_speed swim_speed : ℝ) (hps : paddle_speed = 7) (hss : swim_speed = 2)
  (total_time : ℝ) (ht : total_time = 1.5) :
  ∃ (t₁ t₂ : ℝ), 
    0 ≤ t₁ ∧ t₁ ≤ total_time ∧
    0 ≤ t₂ ∧ t₂ ≤ total_time ∧
    -- Amrita paddles for t₁, then swims
    -- Zhang swims until t₂, then paddles
    paddle_speed * t₁ + swim_speed * (total_time - t₁) = 
    swim_speed * t₂ + paddle_speed * (total_time - t₂) ∧
    -- Zhang reaches kayak at t₂
    paddle_speed * t₁ = swim_speed * t₂ ∧
    -- Kayak idle time is total_time - (t₁ + (total_time - t₂))
