This problem involves finding digits \( w, x, y, z \) (with constraints on their ranges) such that:
\[
1000w + 100x + 10y + z + 100x + 10y + z + 10y + z + z = 2014
\]
and expressing that condition equivalently as \( w + x + y + z = \text{answer} \).

We want to enumerate all digit quadruples satisfying the equation and output the corresponding sum \( w + x + y + z \). This will help conjecture the value for the answer.

```python
# Enumerate digits w,x,y,z within given constraints to solve:
# 1000w + 100x + 10y + z + 100x + 10y + z + 10y + z + z = 2014
# Constraints: 1 <= w <= 9, 0 <= x,y,z <= 9

def main():
    for w in range(1, 10):
        for x in range(0, 10):
            for y in range(0, 10):
                for z in range(0, 10):
                    lhs = (1000*w + 100*x + 10*y + z) \
                          + (100*x + 10*y + z) \
                          + (10*y + z) \
                          + z
                    if lhs == 2014:
                        s = w + x + y + z
                        print(f"w={w}, x={x}, y={y}, z={z} -> sum = {s}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
