Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: 2 + 3 + 6 + 5
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer 2+3+6+5=16 satisfies the conditions:
1. All numbers are positive (2,3,6,5 > 0)
2. gcd(2,6)=2≠1, gcd(3,5)=1 (but this violates the condition gcd(b,d)=1)
3. gcd(2,3)=1 (violates gcd(a,b)≠1)
4. gcd(3,6)=3≠1
5. gcd(6,5)=1 (violates gcd(c,d)≠1)
6. gcd(5,2)=1 (violates gcd(d,a)≠1)

While the sum 16 might be correct for some configuration, this particular combination violates several gcd conditions. The answer is close but not fully correct.
