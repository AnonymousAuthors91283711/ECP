[write_program]
The problem deals with sequences \(a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\) (arithmetic) and \(b_n = b_1 r^{n-1}\) (geometric), with given product constraints for the first four terms. We want to find the greatest possible value of \((a_1 + 3d)(b_1 r^3)\).

We'll write a Python program to enumerate possible exact values (or close rational approximations) of \(a_1, d, b_1, r\) satisfying the first three product constraints, then compute the fourth product and print it.

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, simplify, Rational

# Define variables
a1, d, b1, r = symbols('a1 d b1 r', real=True)

# Given equations from products
eq1 = Eq(a1 * b1, 20)
eq2 = Eq((a1 + d) * (b1 * r), 19)
eq3 = Eq((a1 + 2*d) * (b1 * r**2), 14)

# Solve eq1 for b1
b1_expr = solve(eq1, b1)[0]

# Substitute b1 in eq2 and eq3
eq2_sub = eq2.subs(b1, b1_expr)
eq3_sub = eq3.subs(b1, b1_expr)

# Solve eq2_sub and eq3_sub for d and r
sols = solve([eq2_sub, eq3_sub], (d, r), dict=True)

print("Possible values of (a1, d, b1, r) and the 4th product:")
for s in sols:
    d_val = s[d]
    r_val = s[r]
    b1_val = b1_expr.subs(a1, a1)
    # from eq1: b1 = 20 / a1, assign to variable after choosing a1
    # We can pick numerical a1 values from a short range and solve for 4th product
    # To get exact symbolic, solve for a1 as well. Use eq1, eq2_sub, eq3_sub
    
# Since we have 3 equations, solve for a1, d, r:
sol_all = solve([eq1, eq2, eq3], (a1, d, b1, r), dict=True)

for s in sol_all:
    a1_val = s[a1].evalf()
    d_val = s[d].evalf()
    b1_val = s[b1].evalf()
    r_val = s[r].evalf()
    prod4 = (s[a1] + 3*s[d])*(s[b1] * s[r]**3)
    prod4 = simplify(prod4)
    print(f"a1 = {s[a1]}, d = {s[d]}, b1 = {s[b1]}, r = {s[r]}, 4th product = {prod4} â‰ˆ {prod4.evalf()}")

# Output suggests the possible 4th product values, printing them immediately
```
