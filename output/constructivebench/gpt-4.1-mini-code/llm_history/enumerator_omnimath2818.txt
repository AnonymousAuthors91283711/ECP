The problem is to find the smallest natural number \( N \) such that there exists an interval \([k, k+N-1]\) within natural numbers starting at some \( k \geq 1000 \), where every prefix product from \( k \) up to any \( m \in [k, k+N-1] \) is divisible by \(2010^2\).

We want to examine prefix products of consecutive integers from \(k\) up to \(m\) and find the minimal length \(N\) so that for some \(k \geq 1000\), all these prefix products are divisible by \(2010^2\).

The approach involves:
1. Fix candidates for \(k \geq 1000\), consider the product of integers from \(k\) up to \(m\), for \(m = k, k+1, \ldots, k+N-1\).
2. For each \(m\), check if \(2010^2\) divides the product \(\prod_{i=k}^m i\).
3. If for all \(m\) in this range the divisibility holds, record \(N\).
4. Enumerate to find minimal such \(N\).

We will test various \(k\) starting values to find if, for a given \(N\), any \(k \ge 1000\) satisfies the condition.

Since \(2010 = 2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 67\), we analyze prime factorization and check if the product contains prime factors of \(2010^2 = 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \times 67^2\).
