The problem involves finding values \( d \) such that there exist nonnegative integers \( n, q \) satisfying:
\[
n + d + q = 100, \quad 5n + 10d + 25q = 835
\]
We want to find the set \( s = \{ d \mid d \in \text{coins} \} \), where "coins" are values \( d \) for which such integers \( n, q \) exist. Then, the question asks about the difference between the supremum and infimum of \( s \).

To assist, we enumerate all \( d \) from 0 to 100 and check if there exist \( n, q \geq 0 \) such that the equations hold. We print all possible \( d \) immediately and then print their minimum and maximum and the difference.

```python
# Enumerate all d from 0 to 100 and find all valid d where integers n,q >=0 satisfy:
# n + d + q = 100 and 5n + 10d + 25q = 835.

def main():
    candidates = []
    for d in range(101):
        # From n + d + q = 100 => n = 100 - d - q
        # Substitute in 5n + 10d + 25q = 835:
        # 5(100 - d - q) + 10d + 25q = 835
        # 500 - 5d - 5q + 10d + 25q = 835
        # 500 + 5d + 20q = 835
        # 5d + 20q = 335
        # 20q = 335 - 5d
        # q = (335 - 5d)/20
        rem = 335 - 5*d
        if rem < 0:
            continue
        if rem % 20 != 0:
            continue
        q = rem // 20
        n = 100 - d - q
        if n < 0:
            continue
        # n,q,d all >= 0
        print(f"Valid d = {d}, n = {n}, q = {q}")
        candidates.append(d)
    if candidates:
        inf = min(candidates)
        sup = max(candidates)
        diff = sup - inf
        print(f"Minimum d: {inf}")
        print(f"Maximum d: {sup}")
        print(f"Difference (sup - inf): {diff}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
