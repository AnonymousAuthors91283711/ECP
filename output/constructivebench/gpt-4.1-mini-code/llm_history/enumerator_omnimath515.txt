[write_program]
The problem suggests a relation between real numbers \(x, y\) involving linear combinations equal to expressions with \(\frac{x}{x^2+y^2}\) and \(\frac{y}{x^2+y^2}\). We want to find \(|x|+|y|\).

I'll write a Python program to enumerate over rational approximations of \(x, y\) to find values satisfying the system (within a small numerical tolerance) and print \(|x|+|y|\) for those pairs.

```python
import math

def close(a, b, tol=1e-8):
    return abs(a - b) < tol

print("Enumerating candidates for (x, y) with denominators up to 10")
values_found = set()
for nx in range(-20, 21):
    for dx in range(1, 11):
        x = nx / dx
        for ny in range(-20, 21):
            for dy in range(1, 11):
                y = ny / dy
                denom = x**2 + y**2
                if denom == 0:  # avoid division by zero
                    continue
                lhs1 = 56 * x + 33 * y
                rhs1 = -y / denom
                lhs2 = 33 * x - 56 * y
                rhs2 = x / denom
                if close(lhs1, rhs1) and close(lhs2, rhs2):
                    res = abs(x) + abs(y)
                    if res not in values_found:
                        values_found.add(res)
                        print(f"x={x:.6f}, y={y:.6f}, |x|+|y|={res:.6f}")
if values_found:
    print("Minimum |x|+|y| found =", min(values_found))
else:
    print("No solutions found with denominators up to 10")
```
This enumerates rational \(x,y\) values with small denominators to find solutions numerically, then prints the sum of their absolute values. This might help identify the true answer or conjecture it.
