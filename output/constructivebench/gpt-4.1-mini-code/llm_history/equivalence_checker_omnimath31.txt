Ground Truth Answer: {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ Nat.Coprime n (factorial 101)}
Proposed Answer: {n | n = 1 ∨ (101 < n ∧ Nat.Prime n)}
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem is about finding natural numbers n where:
1. n > 0
2. There exists a bijective function g on ZMod n such that for all k from 0 to 100, the function x ↦ g(x) + k*x is also bijective

The ground truth answer says this is equivalent to n being positive and coprime with 101! (factorial of 101).

The proposed answer suggests n must be either 1 or a prime number greater than 101.

Analysis:
1. For n=1: Both answers agree it's valid (trivially bijective)
2. For prime n > 101: Such numbers are indeed coprime with 101! (since they're larger than all prime factors of 101!), so this matches the ground truth
3. However, the ground truth includes other numbers coprime with 101! that aren't prime >101 (like products of distinct primes all >101), which the proposed answer excludes
4. The proposed answer also incorrectly excludes numbers like 103*107 (coprime with 101! but composite)

Conclusion: The proposed answer is too restrictive - it captures some correct cases but misses others that should be included according to the ground truth.
