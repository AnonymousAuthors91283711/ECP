The problem considers the equation \(x^2 = 2^x\) for \(x > 0\). We want to find the sum of all roots of this equation in the positive reals. I'll enumerate possible roots by evaluating the difference \(x^2 - 2^x\) over a grid and locate where it crosses zero, then print these roots and their sum. This will help conjecture the sum of solutions.

```python
# Enumerate positive solutions to x^2 = 2^x by scanning intervals for sign changes
# Then find roots using binary search and print each root and partial sum

def f(x):
    return x**2 - 2**x

def binary_search_zero(a, b, eps=1e-10):
    fa, fb = f(a), f(b)
    if fa * fb > 0:
        return None
    for _ in range(100):
        mid = (a+b)/2
        fm = f(mid)
        if abs(fm) < eps:
            return mid
        if fa*fm < 0:
            b, fb = mid, fm
        else:
            a, fa = mid, fm
    return (a+b)/2

def main():
    # Search roots in x in (0,10)
    roots = []
    step = 0.01
    x = 0.01
    prev = f(x)
    x += step
    while x <= 10:
        curr = f(x)
        if prev*curr < 0:
            root = binary_search_zero(x - step, x)
            if root is not None:
                # Avoid duplicates within tolerance
                if not roots or abs(root - roots[-1]) > 1e-7:
                    roots.append(root)
                    print(f"Found root: {root:.10f}")
                    print(f"Partial sum of roots: {sum(roots):.10f}")
        prev = curr
        x += step
    print(f"Sum of all roots found: {sum(roots):.10f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
