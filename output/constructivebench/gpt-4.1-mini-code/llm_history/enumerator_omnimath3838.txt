This problem resembles a combinatorial game or path problem involving strategies and responses that affect movement on the real line. The task seems to be to find some sequence `strategy` such that for all response functions `catherine`, there is a time `n` when the position's absolute value is at least 100.

To assist, we enumerate possible strategy sequences and simulate possible Catherine functions for small parameters, printing when the position reaches or exceeds a threshold (like 10 to keep output manageable). This helps conjecture existence and minimal time.

We'll consider small lengths and print paths showing position growth to help understand. Since the function `catherine` depends on both index and strategy bit, we simulate all possible functions for small length to enumerate all behaviours. The output is limited to avoid explosion.

```python
# Enumerate strategies of length L and check against all possible response functions for same length.
# For each strategy s (sequence of bits), and each catherine (functions from positions and bits to bool),
# we compute position and check if abs(position) >= threshold (10 for brevity).
# Print strategies and results to offer insight.

from itertools import product

L = 5  # length to limit combinational explosion
threshold = 10

# Catherine function: receives k and strategy[k], returns bool.
# We'll parametrize by the truth table of size 2*L (since for each k, input is (k, bit), but k varies)
# For simplicity, we treat catherine as a function controlled by a bit vector of length L*2 (for each k, two bits: input strategy bit 0 or 1).

def position_at_n(strategy, catherine):
    pos = 0
    for k in range(len(strategy)):
        s_bit = strategy[k]
        c_value = catherine[k*2 + s_bit]
        pos += 1 if c_value else -1
        if abs(pos) >= threshold:
            return k+1, pos
    return None, pos

print(f"Enumerating strategies and responses with length = {L} and threshold = {threshold}\n")

total_found = 0

for strat in product([False, True], repeat=L):  # strategies length L
    # For each strategy, enumerate all catherine (2*L bits)
    # We'll limit to first few catherine to avoid explosion
    catherine_space = product([False, True], repeat=2*L)
    for cat in catherine_space:
        n_pos = position_at_n(strat, cat)
        if n_pos[0] is not None:
            total_found += 1
            print(f"Strategy={['1' if b else '0' for b in strat]}, Catherine={['1' if b else '0' for b in cat]}, "
                  f"n={n_pos[0]}, position={n_pos[1]}")
            break  # For "∀ Catherine, ∃ n," if one catherine leads to pos ≥ threshold, print one example and break

print(f"\nTotal strategies with some Catherine achieving abs(pos)>= {threshold}: {total_found}")
```
