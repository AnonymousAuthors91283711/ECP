The error occurs because the scope of the logical "∧" is misplaced inside the lambda expression for f, making Lean confuse the types. The "+ b ∧ a = 1 ∧ b = 1" is parsed as part of the function's return expression, which should be ℝ but got a Prop.

We should separate the conditions "a = 1 ∧ b = 1" outside the function definition, so that f is defined as "fun x => a * x ^ 2 + b" and then we state that a = 1 and b = 1. Also, from the enumerated candidates, it's f(x) = x^2 + 1, i.e., a=1, b=0, c=1, but the current answer misses the linear term b x. The problem's form and computations suggest f is quadratic and the constant term is 1, but "b" should be 0 because the enumerated answer fixed "b=0".

Hence, let's let f = a * x^2 + b * x + c with a=1, b=0, c=1, to match "f(x) = x^2 + 1".

So the set should be:

{ f | ∃ a b c : ℝ, f = fun x => a * x^2 + b * x + c ∧ a = 1 ∧ b = 0 ∧ c = 1 }

And written properly:

{ f | ∃ a b c : ℝ, f = (fun x => a * x^2 + b * x + c) ∧ a = 1 ∧ b = 0 ∧ c = 1 }

This will type check and provide the unique solution set.

The error occurs because the conjunction of equalities is included inside the function definition body, turning the function expression into a predicate (ℝ → Prop) instead of (ℝ → ℝ). To fix this, we must separate the condition on the coefficients from the function itself. Also, since we concluded from the problem and candidate enumeration that the solution is a quadratic polynomial with a=1, b=0, c=1, the set of such functions is the singleton set containing the function x ↦ x^2 + 1.

Thus, the corrected answer set should be:

{ f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ a b c : ℝ, f = fun x => a * x^2 + b * x + c ∧ a = 1 ∧ b = 0 ∧ c = 1 }

But since a,b,c are fixed, this is equivalent to the singleton set {fun x => x^2 + 1}.

Therefore, writing it as:

{f | f = fun x => x^2 + 1}

which Lean accepts as a Set (ℝ → ℝ).

Hence, the fixed Lean expression is:

<<<{f : ℝ → ℝ | f = fun x => x^2 + 1}>>>
