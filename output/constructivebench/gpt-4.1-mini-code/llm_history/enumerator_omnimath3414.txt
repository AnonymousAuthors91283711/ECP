The problem suggests finding a natural number `omnimath3414_answer < 23` such that `23 - omnimath3414_answer` is not divisible by 3. To assist with this, the program enumerates all such candidates in `[0, 22]` where `23 - candidate` is not divisible by 3, printing each candidate and finally all candidates that satisfy the condition.

```python
# Enumerate natural numbers less than 23 where (23 - n) is NOT divisible by 3
# Output each candidate immediately, then print all such candidates.

candidates = []
N = 23
print(f"Enumerating n in [0, {N-1}] with (23 - n) not divisible by 3:")
for n in range(N):
    diff = N - n
    if diff % 3 != 0:
        print(n)
        candidates.append(n)
print(f"\nTotal candidates: {len(candidates)}")
print(f"All candidates where (23 - n) not divisible by 3:\n{candidates}")
```
