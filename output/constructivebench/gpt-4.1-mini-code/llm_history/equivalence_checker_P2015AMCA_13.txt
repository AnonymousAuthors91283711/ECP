abbrev P2015AMCA_13_answer : Fin 5 → Prop := sorry
theorem P2015AMCA_13 (n : Fin 5) :
  (∀ (scores : Multiset ℕ), 
    scores.card = 12 ∧ 
    (∀ s ∈ scores, ∃ k ≤ 11, s = 2 * k ∨ s = 2 * k + 1) ∧ 
    Multiset.sum scores = 11 * 12) → 
  ¬P2015AMCA_13_answer n ↔ n = 4 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun | 0 => True  -- (A) There must be an even number of odd scores
      | 1 => True  -- (B) There must be an even number of even scores
      | 2 => True  -- (C) There cannot be two scores of 0
      | 3 => True  -- (D) The sum of the scores must be at least 100
      | 4 => False -- (E) The highest score must be at least 12
Proposed Answer: fun n : Fin 5 => n = 4
<<<False>>>
