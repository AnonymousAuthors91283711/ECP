[write_program]
The problem involves checking for polynomials \( P \) with positive degree such that the product of their compositions at powers \( X^{i+1} \) for \( i \in [0, n-1] \) equals the composition at \( X^{n(n+1)/2} \). We want to explore possible \( P \) for small values of \( n \), and try to identify candidate polynomials \( P \) that satisfy the given identity.

We'll:
- Pick small \( n > 1 \) (e.g., 2, 3)
- Enumerate simple polynomials (e.g., monomials \( X^k \), sums of monomials with small degrees)
- Compose them as in the problem statement to check if the polynomial identity holds
- Print out each successful candidate polynomial \( P \)

To match the condition exactly, we will:
- Define polynomial multiplication and composition symbolically
- Check equality of the resulting polynomials exactly
- Print satisfying \( P \) immediately
