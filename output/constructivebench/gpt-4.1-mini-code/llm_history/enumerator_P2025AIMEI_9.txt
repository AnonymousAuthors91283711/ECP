The problem involves finding a unique point \( p = (x,y) \) such that \( y = x^2 - 4 \) and after rotating \( p \) by \(\theta = \pi/3 \), the rotated point \( (x', y') \) also lies on the parabola \( y' = x'^2 - 4 \). Additionally, \( x > 0 \) and \( y < 0 \). We want to enumerate possible solutions for \( p = (x,y) \).

This program will:
- Sample \( x \) values > 0,
- Compute \( y = x^2 - 4 \),
- Rotate \( (x,y) \) by \(\pi/3\),
- Check if \( y' \approx x'^2 - 4 \) (within a small tolerance),
- Check \( y < 0 \),
- Print \( (x,y) \) when conditions hold.

We use floating point approximations and small steps for \( x \) to find candidates and conjecture the answer.

```python
import math

def rotate(x, y, theta):
    c, s = math.cos(theta), math.sin(theta)
    x_prime = x * c - y * s
    y_prime = x * s + y * c
    return x_prime, y_prime

theta = math.pi / 3
tol = 1e-6

print("Searching points p = (x,y) with y = x^2 - 4, x>0, y<0,")
print("such that rotated p by pi/3 also lies on y = x^2 - 4 within tolerance.")

x = 0.1
end = 4.0
step = 0.001

found = []
while x <= end:
    y = x**2 - 4
    if y >= 0:  # require y < 0
        x += step
        continue
    x_p, y_p = rotate(x, y, theta)
    # check if y_p approx equals x_p^2 -4
    if abs(y_p - (x_p**2 - 4)) < tol:
        print(f"Candidate: x = {x:.6f}, y = {y:.6f}")
        found.append((x, y))
    x += step

if found:
    # Find the point with minimal x > 0 (as uniqueness constraint)
    answer = min(found, key=lambda p: p[0])
    print("\nConjectured unique solution:")
    print(f"x = {answer[0]:.6f}, y = {answer[1]:.6f}")
else:
    print("No candidates found")
```
