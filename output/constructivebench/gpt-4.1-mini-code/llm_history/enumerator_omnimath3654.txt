The problem is about finding, for a given n, the greatest cardinality k of a set C of pairs of natural numbers such that there exists a unique subset T of size n inside C consisting of pairs with distinct first and second components pairwise (i.e., T is a size-n matching with distinct row and column indices).

We want to enumerate possible values for k = |C| for small n, and try to understand the pattern.

We will:
- For some small n (1 to 4),
- Generate candidate sets C of pairs from a small grid (e.g., pairs with coordinates â‰¤ m),
- For increasing k = |C|,
- Check if there is a unique n-subset T in C satisfying the distance conditions: elements have distinct first and second coordinates and form a 'matching',
- Print such k and parameters,
- Then focus on the maximum such k.

This is computationally heavy, so we will keep the coordinate grid and n small.

```python
# Enumerate sets C of pairs (i,j) and subsets T to examine uniqueness of n-sized matchings.

from itertools import combinations, product

def is_matching(subset):
    # Check distinct first and second coordinates
    rows = set()
    cols = set()
    for (r,c) in subset:
        if r in rows or c in cols:
            return False
        rows.add(r)
        cols.add(c)
    return True

def unique_matching(C, n):
    # Among n-subsets of C, find those that form matchings
    found = []
    for T in combinations(C, n):
        if is_matching(T):
            found.append(T)
            if len(found) > 1:
                return False  # More than one matching found
    return len(found) == 1

def enumerator():
    print("Enumerating for small n:")
    for n in range(1, 5):
        print(f"n = {n}")
        max_k = 0
        # Try grid size m=n to n+1 (to have enough coords)
        m = n + 1
        universe = [(i,j) for i in range(m) for j in range(m)]
        # We try increasing k from n up to maximum possible (m*m)
        max_possible = m*m
        for k in range(n, max_possible+1):
            # Check all subsets C of universe with size k
            # to keep runtime sane, break early after first found
            found_any = False
            # Instead of all subsets, sample some subsets by combinations sorted by sum indices
            for C in combinations(universe, k):
                if unique_matching(C, n):
                    print(f"  Found k={k} with C sample starting at {C[0]} and unique matching T")
                    found_any = True
                    if k > max_k:
                        max_k = k
                    break
            if k - n > 3 and not found_any:
                # No larger sets found beyond n+3, stop for this n to save time
                break
        print(f"Max k found for n={n}: {max_k}")
