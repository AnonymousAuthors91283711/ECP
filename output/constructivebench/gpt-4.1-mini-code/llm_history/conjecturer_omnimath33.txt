The error arises because you wrote an equality of sets in the definition for `omnimath33_answer`, which is a term (type `Set (ℕ → ℕ)`), but that equality itself is a proposition (`Prop`), not a set. You need to provide `omnimath33_answer` as a set, not an equality.

Additionally, the problem's condition implies that `f` is constant with some positive value `c`, since for all `x,y`:

f(f x + y) ∣ x + f y and f x > 0.

For the divisibility condition to hold for arbitrary `x, y`, `f` must be constant.

Your condition reduces to:

∃ c > 0, ∀ x, f x = c.

So the answer set is:

{ f : ℕ → ℕ | ∃ c > 0, ∀ x, f x = c }

This matches candidate #1 and #13 pattern from enumeration for constant functions.

Fix:

Define omnimath33_answer exactly as this set.

<<<{ f : ℕ → ℕ | ∃ c : ℕ, c > 0 ∧ ∀ x : ℕ, f x = c }>>>
