Ground Truth Answer: 11 / 65
Proposed Answer: sqrt 65
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives two equations involving x and y, and asks to find |x| + |y|.

2. The ground truth answer is 11/65 ≈ 0.1692

3. The proposed answer is √65 ≈ 8.0623

These two answers are clearly very different numerically. The proposed answer is much larger than the ground truth answer and doesn't make sense in this context since |x| + |y| should be a relatively small value given the equations.

The correct approach would involve:
- Recognizing the equations can be written in complex form
- Solving for the magnitude of the complex number
- Deriving that |x| + |y| = 11/65

The proposed answer of √65 is incorrect.

<<<False>>>
