The problem is to find the greatest natural number \( n \) such that there exists an injective function \( f: \text{Fin } n \to \text{Fin } 55 \) with no pair of distinct indices \( i \neq j \) where the difference between the images \( f(i) \) and \( f(j) \) is exactly 4 (in either direction).

This is equivalent to finding the largest subset \( S \subseteq \{0, \dots, 54\} \) with no two elements differing by exactly 4, and \( n = |S| \).

We enumerate subsets by using a backtracking-like approach and verify the difference condition, aiming to find large subsets. To keep complexity reasonable, we'll use a greedy-style enumeration.

```python
# Enumerate large subsets of {0,...,54} with no two elements differing by 4
# Print subsets sizes found and try to maximize size

def valid_add(s, x):
    # Check no existing element in s differs from x by 4
    for y in s:
        if abs(x - y) == 4:
            return False
    return True

# We'll try a backtracking with a forward check to build large subsets
# To control output, we only print subsets of large size as candidates

max_n = 0
max_s = set()

def backtrack(start, s):
    global max_n, max_s
    if len(s) > max_n:
        max_n = len(s)
        max_s = s.copy()
        print(f"Found subset of size {max_n}: {sorted(max_s)}")
    if start > 54:
        return
    # Try adding elements from start to 54
    for x in range(start, 55):
        if valid_add(s, x):
            s.add(x)
            backtrack(x + 1, s)
            s.remove(x)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Run backtracking starting empty
    backtrack(0, set())
    print(f"Maximum subset size with no difference 4 is {max_n}.")
```
This will print each larger subset found immediately. The largest subset size printed at the end is the candidate answer.
