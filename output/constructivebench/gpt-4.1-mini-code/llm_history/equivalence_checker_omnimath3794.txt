Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {(1, 1, 4, 2), (1, 4, 1, 2)}
<<<None>>>
Since both the ground truth answer and the proposed answer are marked as "sorry" (which typically means they're undefined or incomplete in proof assistants like Lean), we cannot determine their equivalence. The proposed answer provides two specific tuples, but without knowing the complete ground truth solution set, we can't verify if these are the only solutions or if there are more. Therefore, we must return "None" for uncertainty.
