The problem appears related to rates and distances with time t > 0, involving Josh and Mike traveling with speeds related to t, where total distances are given. To conjecture about t and speeds, let's enumerate some positive rational values for t and compute the corresponding expressions. We print values of t, Josh's speed, Mike's speed, and verify the distance relations.

```python
# Enumerate positive rational t and print speeds and distance checks
from fractions import Fraction

print("t\tJosh_speed\tMike_speed\tCheck_sum")

for denom in range(1, 11):  # denominators from 1 to 10
    for numer in range(1, 11):  # numerators from 1 to 10
        t = Fraction(numer, denom)
        josh_speed = Fraction(4, 5) * Fraction(13, 1) / t
        mike_speed = Fraction(13, 1) / t
        # compute distances covered
        dist_josh = josh_speed * 2 * t  # Josh runs 2*t duration
        dist_mike = mike_speed * t  # Mike runs t duration
        total_dist = dist_josh + dist_mike
        check_mike_dist = mike_speed * t
        # print values to check if sum equals 13 and mike dist matches
        # All values exact Fractions
        print(f"{t}\t{josh_speed}\t{mike_speed}\t{total_dist} (sum), Mike dist: {check_mike_dist}")
```
