Ground Truth Answer: fun n => 2 * n^2 - 2 * n + 1
Proposed Answer: fun n => 2 * n * n - 3 * n + 5
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive function F with base cases:
   - F(0) = 1
   - F(1) = 1
   - F(2) = 5
   And recursive case: F(n+3) = F(n+2) + 4*(n+2)

2. The ground truth answer is a closed-form solution: 2n² - 2n + 1

3. The proposed answer is: 2n*n - 3n + 5

Let's test both answers against the base cases:

For n=0:
- Ground truth: 2*0 - 0 + 1 = 1 ✔ matches F(0)
- Proposed: 0 - 0 + 5 = 5 ✖ should be 1

For n=1:
- Ground truth: 2 - 2 + 1 = 1 ✔ matches F(1)
- Proposed: 2 - 3 + 5 = 4 ✖ should be 1

For n=2:
- Ground truth: 8 - 4 + 1 = 5 ✔ matches F(2)
- Proposed: 8 - 6 + 5 = 7 ✖ should be 5

The proposed answer fails all base cases and doesn't match the ground truth formula. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
