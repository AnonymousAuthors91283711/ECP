abbrev omnimath330_answer : Set (ℕ × ℕ) := sorry
theorem omnimath330 (p q : ℕ) :
  p.Prime ∧ q.Prime ∧ IsSquare (p - q) ∧ IsSquare (p * q - q) ↔ (p, q) ∈ omnimath330_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(3, 2)}
Proposed Answer: {(p, q) | p.Prime ∧ q.Prime ∧ p = q + 1 ∧ IsSquare q}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for pairs of prime numbers (p, q) where:
   - Both p and q are prime
   - p - q is a perfect square
   - p*q - q is a perfect square

2. Ground truth answer gives exactly one pair: (3, 2)
   - Check: 3-2=1 (square), 3*2-2=4 (square)

3. Proposed answer gives pairs where:
   - p and q are prime
   - p = q + 1 (so p - q = 1, which is square)
   - q itself is a square

Now let's evaluate:
- The proposed answer would include pairs where q is a square prime. But the only square prime is 4 (2²), which isn't prime. So it would give empty set.
- The condition p = q + 1 is correct for (3,2), but the additional condition IsSquare q makes it too restrictive.
- The proposed answer misses that p*q - q must also be square.
