[write_program]
The problem references the format `201 - 53 + 1`, which suggests counting integers from 53 to 201 inclusive, typically the number of integers in an interval. The expression equals 149, which might be the count of integers from 53 through 201.

I'll write a Python program that enumerates integers from 53 to 201 and prints them immediately, then prints the count as the final extremal answer.

```python
# Enumerate integers from 53 to 201 inclusive, print each, then print the count.

start, end = 53, 201
count = 0
for n in range(start, end + 1):
    print(n)
    count += 1
print("Count:", count)
```
