The problem appears to define a set of pairs of real-valued functions (f, g) satisfying the functional equation âˆ€x,y, f(x + y * g(x)) = g(x) + x * f(y). We want to explore possible function pairs (f, g) to conjecture solutions.

We will enumerate simple candidate functions for f and g from a small function family (e.g., constant, identity, linear with small integer coefficients), check the functional equation for small integer x and y values, and print any that satisfy it exactly.

```python
import math

# Sample candidate functions: constant zero, identity, linear functions with coefficients -1, 0, 1
def candidates():
    coeffs = [-1, 0, 1]
    # constant functions
    for c in coeffs:
        yield (lambda x, c=c: c, lambda x: 0)
        yield (lambda x: 0, lambda x, c=c: c)
    # linear functions f(x) = a*x + b
    for a in coeffs:
        for b in coeffs:
            f = lambda x, a=a, b=b: a*x + b
            for c in coeffs:
                for d in coeffs:
                    g = lambda x, c=c, d=d: c*x + d
                    yield f, g

def check_fg(f, g):
    # Check equation f(x + y*g(x)) == g(x) + x*f(y) for x,y in small integer sets
    for x in range(-3,4):
        for y in range(-3,4):
            lhs = f(x + y * g(x))
            rhs = g(x) + x * f(y)
            if abs(lhs - rhs) > 1e-12:  # Exact float equality
                return False
    return True

def repr_func(f):
    # Try to identify linear functions or constants for nice printing
    xs = [-1,0,1,2]
    vals = [f(x) for x in xs]
    # Check constant
    if all(abs(v - vals[0]) < 1e-12 for v in vals):
        return f"const {vals[0]:.0f}"
    # Check linear a*x + b
    try:
        # Use two points to find a,b: f(0) = b, f(1) = a + b
        b = f(0)
        a = f(1) - b
        for x in xs:
            if abs((a*x + b) - f(x)) > 1e-12:
                return "unknown"
        return f"{a:.0f}*x + {b:.0f}"
    except Exception:
        return "unknown"

print("Trying candidate function pairs (f,g):")
count = 0
for f, g in candidates():
    if check_fg(f, g):
        ff = repr_func(f)
        gg = repr_func(g)
        print(f"Found solution pair #{count+1}: f(x) = {ff}, g(x) = {gg}")
        count += 1
        if count >= 10:  # limit output tokens
            break
if count == 0:
    print("No solutions found in sampled candidates.")
