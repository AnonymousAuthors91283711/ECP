. Enumerated answers: Enumerating for different p0 (positive rationals):
p0 = 1: ratio = 8/15 = 0.533333
p0 = 1/2: ratio = 8/15 = 0.533333
p0 = 1/3: ratio = 8/15 = 0.533333
p0 = 1/4: ratio = 8/15 = 0.533333
p0 = 2: ratio = 8/15 = 0.533333
p0 = 1: ratio = 8/15 = 0.533333
p0 = 2/3: ratio = 8/15 = 0.533333
p0 = 1/2: ratio = 8/15 = 0.533333
p0 = 3: ratio = 8/15 = 0.533333
p0 = 3/2: ratio = 8/15 = 0.533333
p0 = 1: ratio = 8/15 = 0.533333
p0 = 3/4: ratio = 8/15 = 0.533333
p0 = 4: ratio = 8/15 = 0.533333
p0 = 2: ratio = 8/15 = 0.533333
p0 = 4/3: ratio = 8/15 = 0.533333
p0 = 1: ratio = 8/15 = 0.533333

All ratios match 8/15 exactly.
Extremal ratio (only choice) = 8/15. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
<<<(8 : ℚ) / 15>>>
