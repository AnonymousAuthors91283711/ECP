theorem omnimath3933 (f : ℝ → ℝ) :
  (∀ x y, f (f x - f y) = f (f x + f y) - 4 * f x * f y) ↔ f ∈ omnimath3933_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {f | f = (fun _ => 0) ∨ ∃ a, f = fun x => x^2 + a}
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ c : ℝ, f = 0 ∨ f = (fun x => c * x ^ 2)}
Let's analyze the equivalence:

1. The ground truth answer includes:
   - The zero function (f = 0)
   - All quadratic functions of form f(x) = x² + a (for any constant a)

2. The proposed answer includes:
   - The zero function (f = 0)
   - All quadratic functions of form f(x) = c*x² (for any constant c)

The differences are:
- The ground truth allows any vertical shift (x² + a) while the proposed answer only allows scaling (c*x²)
- The proposed answer misses cases like f(x) = x² + 5 which should be valid
- The proposed answer's "f = 0" is redundant since it's covered by c=0 in the second case

The answers are not equivalent because the proposed answer is missing the shifted quadratic functions.
