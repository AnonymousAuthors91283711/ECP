This problem involves enumerating numbers with exactly two 1's in their binary representation within a certain range, then checking divisibility by 9 and calculating the probability that a randomly chosen such number is divisible by 9. The goal is to confirm the fraction p/q = 83/830 and p+q = 913.

We can:
- Enumerate all 40-bit numbers with exactly two 1's.
- Check divisibility by 9.
- Output counts for total and divisible numbers.
- Print the fraction in lowest terms for evidence.

We'll print intermediate results streaming as found, but since total is large, we'll directly count efficiently using combinatorics and modular arithmetic instead of explicitly iterating all 2^40 numbers.

```python
# Enumerate numbers with exactly two 1's among 40 positions
# Count how many are divisible by 9 to confirm probability = 83/830.

from math import gcd

def mod9_of_num(bits):
    # number = 2^i + 2^j, mod 9 = (2^i mod 9 + 2^j mod 9) mod 9
    # precompute 2^k mod 9 for k in [0..39]
    pow2_mod9 = [1]
    for _ in range(39):
        pow2_mod9.append((pow2_mod9[-1]*2) % 9)
    return bits, pow2_mod9

def main():
    pow2_mod9 = [1]
    for _ in range(39):
        pow2_mod9.append((pow2_mod9[-1]*2) % 9)
    total = 0
    divisible = 0
    # i < j, positions of 1-bits in 40-bit number
    for i in range(40):
        for j in range(i+1,40):
            rem = (pow2_mod9[i] + pow2_mod9[j]) % 9
            total += 1
            if rem == 0:
                divisible += 1
                print(f"Divisible: bits at positions {i}, {j}; number mod 9=0")
    print(f"Total numbers with exactly two 1's in 40 bits: {total}")
    print(f"Count divisible by 9: {divisible}")
    g = gcd(divisible, total)
    p, q = divisible // g, total // g
    print(f"Probability = {p}/{q} with sum p+q={p+q}")
