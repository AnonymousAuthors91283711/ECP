The problem involves a linear function \( y = mx + b \) with fixed parameters \( m = -5 \) and \( b = -3 \). The theorem states that there exists \( m, b \) satisfying the conditions such that \( y = mx + b \) if and only if \( y = \text{mathodyssey179_answer}(x) \). This means mathodyssey179_answer(x) should represent \(-5x - 3\).

I'll write a Python program that takes some sample \( x \) values, computes \( y = -5x - 3 \), and prints the pairs \((x,y)\). This directly corresponds to the function and gives concrete enumerations of outputs verifying the theorem. This aligns with enumerating candidates from the form and confirming the linear relationship.

```python
# Enumerate y = -5x -3 for sample x values, showing the functional relation
def mathodyssey179_answer(x):
    return -5 * x - 3

# Sample x values for enumeration
x_values = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]

for x in x_values:
    y = mathodyssey179_answer(x)
    print(f"x = {x}, y = {y}")

# Additionally print the explicit function formula as a string for clarity
print("mathodyssey179_answer(x) = -5 * x - 3")
```
