[write_program]
The problem seems to involve finding natural numbers \( n \) such that \( 10^n \leq 2014 \leq 10^{n+1} \). We want to enumerate all such \( n \). To assist in conjecturing the correct set, I will write a Python program that tests values of \( n \) within a reasonable range and print all \( n \) satisfying the inequalities.

```python
# Enumerate n in natural numbers to find all n with 10^n <= 2014 <= 10^(n+1)

def main():
    # We'll try n from 0 up to some small upper bound
    # Since 10^4 = 10000 > 2014, n up to 4 is enough
    for n in range(10):
        lower = 10**n
        upper = 10**(n+1)
        if lower <= 2014 <= upper:
            print(f"n = {n}: 10^{n} = {lower} <= 2014 <= 10^{n+1} = {upper}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
