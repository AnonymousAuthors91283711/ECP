The given expression is (x² + 2x + 3) ^ ((x² + 2x + 3) ^ (x² + 2x + 3)) = 2012. Set y = x² + 2x + 3.

Since x² + 2x + 3 = (x+1)² + 2 > 0 for all real x, y > 0 always.

The equation becomes y^(y^y) = 2012.

We want to find all real x such that y^(y^y) = 2012.

Observe that y^(y^y) = 2012, and since y > 0, y^(y^y) is strictly increasing for y > 0 because the function f(y) = y^(y^y) grows rapidly.

Therefore, there is exactly one positive y satisfying y^(y^y) = 2012.

Now, since y = x² + 2x + 3, define z = x+1, so y = z² + 2.

Set y0 such that y0^(y0^y0) = 2012.

Then z² + 2 = y0 ⇒ z² = y0 - 2

Therefore, x+1 = ± sqrt(y0 - 2).

So, the solution set s = { -1 + sqrt(y0 - 2), -1 - sqrt(y0 - 2) }.

The sum of elements of s is (-1 + sqrt(y0 - 2)) + (-1 - sqrt(y0 - 2)) = -2.

Therefore, the answer sum is -2.

Hence, omnimath2535_answer = -2.

This matches the uniqueness and the sum of solutions. The candidate answer "∅" is invalid since the solution set is not empty.
