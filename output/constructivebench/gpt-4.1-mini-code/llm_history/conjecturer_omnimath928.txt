theorem omnimath928 : 
  IsGreatest {d : ℕ | ∃ (x : ℕ), 0 < x ∧ d = ((digits 10 (x + 2019)).sum - (digits 10 x).sum)} omnimath928_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: d = 3 at x = 1
d = 12 at x = 10
d = -6 at x = 81
d = -15 at x = 981
d = -24 at x = 7981
Maximum d found: 12. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
