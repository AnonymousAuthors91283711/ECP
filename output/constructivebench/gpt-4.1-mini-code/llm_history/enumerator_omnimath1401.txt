The problem is to find the number of 9-element subsets of the set Fin 10 × Fin 2 such that no two elements are adjacent according to a grid adjacency relation (adjacency in rows or columns with steps of 1).

We will:
- Enumerate subsets of size 9 within the 10×2 grid,
- Check the adjacency condition,
- Print each valid subset size or representation found (here, just count),
- Finally print the number of such subsets.

However, enumerating all C(20, 9) ≈ 167,960 subsets is too large for a short program, so we try to conjecture by sampling or simplifying.

A known combinatorial interpretation: the problem describes the 2×10 grid graph's independent sets of size 9.

We can try to enumerate 9-subsets that are independent sets by rows or columns patterns, or by generating all subsets of row patterns.

We can enumerate over binary 10-bit masks for each row indicating selected columns, then combine them with the second row considering adjacency constraints between rows.

We proceed by:
- Enumerate all subsets of size k in 10 elements for the first row (0 ≤ k ≤ 9),
- For each such subset, find subsets in the second row with size 9-k, no adjacency inside row and no adjacency with first row subset,
- Count solutions and sum when total size is 9,
- Print intermediary configurations and final count.

We will implement this logic efficiently.

```python
from itertools import combinations

# Grid dimensions
rows, cols = 2, 10
target_size = 9

# Generate all subsets of [0..9] with no two adjacent elements
def no_adjacent_subsets(n, size):
    # Using bitmasks for subsets
    # We'll generate combinations and check adjacency manually
    for comb in combinations(range(n), size):
        if all((j - i) > 1 for i, j in zip(comb, comb[1:])):
            yield set(comb)

# Check no adjacency between two rows subsets
def no_adj_between_rows(setA, setB):
    # adjacency is column difference 0 and row difference 1
    # So if same columns chosen in both rows -> adjacent vertically
    return setA.isdisjoint(setB)

total_count = 0
# Precompute all no-adj subsets by sizes to reuse
no_adj_subsets_cache = {k:list(no_adjacent_subsets(cols, k)) for k in range(cols+1)}

print("Enumerating independent 9-subsets in 2x10 grid:")

for k in range(target_size+1):
    # k from 0 to 9, sizes for row 0
    row0_subsets = no_adj_subsets_cache.get(k, [])
    row1_subsets = no_adj_subsets_cache.get(target_size - k, [])
    count_k = 0
    for r0 in row0_subsets:
        for r1 in row1_subsets:
            if no_adj_between_rows(r0, r1):
                count_k += 1
    if count_k > 0:
        print(f"Row0 size {k}, Row1 size {target_size - k}: found {count_k} subsets")
    total_count += count_k

print("Total independent subsets of size 9 =", total_count)
```
