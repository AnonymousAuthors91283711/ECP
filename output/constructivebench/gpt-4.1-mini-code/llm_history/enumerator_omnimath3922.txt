[write_program]
The problem asks whether there exists an integer-valued function \(m\) on the finite set \(\{0, \ldots, 14\}\) such that the sum over \(k\) of \(m_k \cdot \arctan(k+1)\) equals \(\arctan(16)\).  
I'll write a program to enumerate integer coefficient vectors \(m\) with small entries to find such relations. The program prints any found exact integer combinations giving \(\arctan(16)\) up to a small numerical tolerance.

```python
import math

# We try integer vectors m = (m0,...,m14) with each m_i in [-limit, limit]
# and sum m_i * arctan(i+1) approx arctan(16).
# Small limits for efficiency.
limit = 3
arctans = [math.atan(i+1) for i in range(15)]
target = math.atan(16)
eps = 1e-9

def approx_equal(a,b,eps=1e-9):
    return abs(a-b) < eps

print(f"Trying integer vectors m_i in [-{limit},{limit}] for i=0..14")
print(f"Target = arctan(16) â‰ˆ {target:.12f}")

# To speed up: only enumerate vectors with most coefficients zero or small sum abs.
# We limit the number of nonzero coefficients to 3 for tractability.

from itertools import combinations, product

max_nonzero = 3

for nz in range(1, max_nonzero+1):
    print(f"Trying vectors with {nz} nonzero coefficients...")
    for indices in combinations(range(15), nz):
        # enumerate all integer assignments for chosen indices
        for values in product(range(-limit,limit+1), repeat=nz):
            if all(v == 0 for v in values):
                continue
            val = 0.0
            for idx,v in zip(indices, values):
                val += v * arctans[idx]
            if approx_equal(val, target, eps):
                # Print exact vector found:
                m = [0]*15
                for idx,v in zip(indices, values):
                    m[idx] = v
                print("Found approximation with m =", m)
```
This program tries integer combinations with up to 3 nonzero coefficients in [-3,3] and prints approximations of \(\arctan(16)\).  
Running this may indicate whether such integer linear combinations exist. Increasing limit or number of nonzeros is possible but costly.
