abbrev omnimath514_answer : Set (ℝ × ℝ) := sorry
theorem omnimath514 (x y : ℝ) : 
    (x + y)^2 = (x + 1) * (y - 1) ↔ (x, y) ∈ omnimath514_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating solutions (x,y) with integer x in [-10,10]:
x=-1, y=1.0 exact match. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ × ℝ)
<<<{(x, y) | y = (x + 1)^2 / (x + 1) + 1 ∧ x ≠ -1} ∪ {( -1, 1 )}>>>
