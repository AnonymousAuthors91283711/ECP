noncomputable def qmark (a : ℝ) (h : a ≠ -1) : ℝ := (a - 1) / (a + 1)
Proposed Answer: -2
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem involves a function qmark defined as qmark(a) = (a-1)/(a+1), with the constraint that a ≠ -1. The theorem states that applying qmark twice to N (with appropriate constraints) equals tan(π/12) if and only if N equals some answer.

First, let's compute tan(π/12):
tan(π/12) = tan(15°) = 2 - √3

Now, let's solve qmark(qmark(N)) = 2 - √3:
1. First application: qmark(N) = (N-1)/(N+1)
2. Second application: qmark(qmark(N)) = ((N-1)/(N+1) - 1)/((N-1)/(N+1) + 1) = (-2)/(2N) = -1/N

Set this equal to 2 - √3:
-1/N = 2 - √3
=> N = -1/(2 - √3) = -(2 + √3)/((2 - √3)(2 + √3)) = -(2 + √3)/(4 - 3) = -2 - √3

The ground truth answer is indeed -2 - √3, while the proposed answer is just -2. These are clearly different values.
