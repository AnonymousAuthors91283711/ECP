The problem asks for the number of functions \( f: \{0, \ldots, 8\} \to \{0, \ldots, 8\} \) such that applying \( f \) five times returns to the original element (\( f^{[5]}(x) = x \) for all \( x \)). This means \( f \) is an endofunction on a 9-element set whose 5th iterate is the identity.

Such a function's decomposition into cycles can only have cycle lengths dividing 5 (i.e., 1 or 5), because the 5th iterate must be the identity function.

We want to enumerate all functions whose cycles are of length either 1 or 5 and count them.

Steps:
- Partition the 9 elements into fixed points (cycles of length 1) and 5-cycles.
- Since 5-cycles cover 5 elements, and 1-cycles cover 1 element, the number of 5-cycles can be 0 or 1 (since 2*5=10 > 9).
- Hence, possible cycle structures:
  - 9 fixed points
  - 4 fixed points + 1 five-cycle

For each structure:
- Choose which elements form the 5-cycles (if any).
- Count the number of distinct 5-cycles on those elements ((5-1)! = 24 permutations).
- The fixed points each map to themselves.

Total number of such functions = sum over possible partitions: combinations * number of 5-cycles.

Below is a Python program enumerating such functions and printing the count.

```python
from math import comb, factorial

# Number of elements
n = 9
cycle_length = 5

# Print the count of functions f: [9]->[9] with f^[5] = id
# Since cycles must have length dividing 5, allowed cycle lengths: 1 or 5.
# 9 elements = sum of 1-cycles and one 5-cycle at most (since 2*5=10 >9)
# Cases:
# 1) All fixed points (9 cycles of length 1)
# 2) One 5-cycle and remaining fixed points (4 fixed points)

count = 0

# Case 1: all fixed points
# Just identity function: 1 function
print("Number of functions with all fixed points:", 1)
count += 1

# Case 2: one 5-cycle + 4 fixed points
# Choose 5 elements for the cycle, number of 5-cycles = (5-1)! = 24
choose_5 = comb(n, 5)
num_5_cycles = factorial(5 - 1)  # 24
functions_case2 = choose_5 * num_5_cycles
print(f"Number of functions with one 5-cycle and 4 fixed points: {functions_case2}")
count += functions_case2

print("Total number of functions f with f^[5] = identity:", count)
```
