The error in your Lean code arises because ∞ is not a predefined symbol in Lean; you should use `real.Icc_univ` or use `Set.Icc (-∞) ∞` where `∞` is not directly usable as a Lean expression. To represent the entire real line, you can just use `Set.univ`.

Next, the inequality describes a property that is equivalent to the function f being concave. The given inequality, rearranged, expresses concavity of f in a specific form involving midpoint convexity plus a weighted mean inequality.

Thus, the answer set is the set of all concave functions ℝ → ℝ on the whole real line, i.e.,

{ f : ℝ → ℝ | ConvexOn ℝ Set.univ (-f) }

because -f being convex means f is concave.

Hence, the corrected and properly compiling Lean expression is:

<<<{ f : ℝ → ℝ | ConvexOn ℝ Set.univ (-f) }>>>
