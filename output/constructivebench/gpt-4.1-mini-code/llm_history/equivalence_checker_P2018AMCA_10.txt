Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: 1
Since the problem involves solving a system of linear equations \(x + y = 1\) and \(x - y = 1\) to determine the cardinality of the solution set \(S\), we can analyze it as follows:

1. Solving the system:
   - Adding the two equations: \(2x = 2 \Rightarrow x = 1\).
   - Substituting \(x = 1\) into the first equation: \(1 + y = 1 \Rightarrow y = 0\).
   
2. The solution is unique: \((x, y) = (1, 0)\). Thus, the set \(S\) has exactly one element.

The proposed answer is \(1\), which matches the ground truth that the solution set has cardinality \(1\).
