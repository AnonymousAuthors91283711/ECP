abbrev P2003AMCB_2_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2003AMCB_2 (g p : ℝ) :
  g = p + 1 ∧ 14 * (g + p) = 546 ↔ g = P2003AMCB_2_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating p and g values satisfying the system:
Found solution: p = 19, g = 20

Therefore, the answer g is 20. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<20>>>
