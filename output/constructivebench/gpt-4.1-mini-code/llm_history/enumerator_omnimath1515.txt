The problem asks for the least natural number \(k = m + n\) such that there exist complex numbers \(x_j\) for \(j = 0, \ldots, n-1\) meeting these constraints:

- \(m > n > 1\)
- For each \(i = 1, \ldots, n-1\), \(\sum_j x_j^{i} = 1\)
- \(\sum_j x_j^n = 2\)
- \(\sum_j x_j^m = 4\)

We want to find the minimum of \(m + n\).

This looks like a problem involving power sums of roots \(x_j\). It's akin to finding sequences of complex values whose power sums match given values (Newton sums), which is quite difficult in general.

We'll enumerate small \(n\) and \(m > n\), try to find \(x_j\) (with \(j=0,\ldots,n-1\)) such that the power sums constraints hold. Since the problem is hard analytically, we try a numeric approximate approach assuming the \(x_j\) are roots of unity or from small sets of complex numbers to check if sums match the conditions approximately. 

We will:
- Enumerate small \(n\) (2 to 5).
- For each \(n\), enumerate \(m\) from \(n+1\) to some small threshold (e.g. \(n+5\)).
- Assume the \(x_j\) are \(n\)-th roots of unity scaled/rotated by some root of unity powers multiplied by a scale constant \(r\).
- For small \(n\), try \(r = 1, \sqrt[\,n]{\cdot}, \sqrt[\,m]{\cdot}\) to try to satisfy sums.
- Print any candidate sums found that come close.

Due to the complexity, we check for approximations within a tolerance and print candidates.
