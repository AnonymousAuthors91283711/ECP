The problem asks to find the least natural number \(K'\) such that the distance between the complex numbers \(15 + 5i\) and \(1 + K'i\) is at least \(15 \times \frac{8}{5}\).

Denote \(K'\) as a natural number greater than 0. We want to find the minimal \(K'\) with:

\[
| (15 + 5i) - (1 + K'i) | \geq 24
\]

Since the complex numbers are \(15 + 5i\) and \(1 + K'i\), the difference is:

\[
(15 - 1) + (5 - K')i = 14 + (5 - K')i
\]

The norm squared is:

\[
14^2 + (5 - K')^2
\]

We want:

\[
\sqrt{14^2 + (5 - K')^2} \geq 24 \implies 196 + (5 - K')^2 \geq 576 \implies (5 - K')^2 \geq 380
\]

So either:

\[
5 - K' \leq -\sqrt{380} \quad \text{or} \quad 5 - K' \geq \sqrt{380}
\]

Since \(K' > 0\), we must find minimal \(K'\) with \(|5 - K'| \geq \sqrt{380}\).

\(\sqrt{380} \approx 19.4935\).

Therefore:

- If \(5 - K' \leq -19.4935\), then \(K' \geq 24.4935\),
- Or if \(5 - K' \geq 19.4935\), then \(K' \leq -14.4935\) (impossible since \(K'>0\)).

So the minimal \(K'\) satisfying the inequality is \(\lceil 24.4935 \rceil = 25\).

I'll write a Python program enumerating \(K'\) from 1 to 30 and print those satisfying the inequality, and the minimal one. This matches the problem conditions.

```python
# Program to enumerate natural numbers K' > 0 satisfying:
# |(15 + 5i) - (1 + K'i)| >= 15*(8/5) = 24

import math

threshold = 15 * (8 / 5)
threshold_sq = threshold ** 2

min_K = None

for K in range(1, 31):
    diff_real = 15 - 1
    diff_imag = 5 - K
    dist_sq = diff_real**2 + diff_imag**2
    if dist_sq >= threshold_sq:
        print(f"K' = {K}, distance = {math.sqrt(dist_sq):.4f} >= {threshold}")
        if min_K is None:
            min_K = K

if min_K is not None:
    print(f"Minimal K' satisfying the condition: {min_K}")
else:
    print("No K' found satisfying the condition up to 30")
```
