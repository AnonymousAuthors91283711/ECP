Ground Truth Answer: 7 + (13 * π) / 3
Proposed Answer: 4 * (4 / 3 * Real.pi)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about calculating the average number of integer grid cells intersecting a unit sphere centered at a random point in the unit cube [0,1]³.

2. The ground truth answer is 7 + (13π)/3 ≈ 20.61

3. The proposed answer is 4*(4π/3) ≈ 16.76 (which is just 4 times the volume of a unit sphere)

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
- It's simply multiplying the sphere's volume by 4, which doesn't correspond to the counting problem described
- The correct answer involves both the sphere's volume and additional boundary effects (hence the "+7" term in the correct answer)
- The coefficient of π is wrong (13/3 vs 16/3)
