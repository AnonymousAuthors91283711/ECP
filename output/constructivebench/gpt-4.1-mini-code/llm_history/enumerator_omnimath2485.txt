This problem involves solving a system of 5 equations with 4 variables \(w, x, y, z\), but the last equation's right side is unknown (the answer to find). The first 4 equations fix \((w,x,y,z)\) uniquely, so we can solve them first, then compute the left side of the 5th equation to find the answer.

We enumerate rational candidates for \(w,x,y,z\) by solving the 4 equations (linear system) and then compute the 5th. The problem suggests real numbers; using exact fractions is ideal.

```python
# Solve the first 4 equations for w,x,y,z exactly and compute the 5th value.

    # Equations:
    # 1) w + x + y + z = 5
    # 2) 2w + 4x + 8y + 16z = 7
    # 3) 3w + 9x + 27y + 81z = 11
    # 4) 4w + 16x + 64y + 256z = 1
