The error occurs because in the second set, you reference `a` and `b` which are not in scope — they were introduced only inside the first set's existential quantifier. You cannot refer to those variables outside that scope.

From the enumerated answers and the problem structure, it seems the solution set is all linear functions \( f(n) = a n + b \) satisfying \( 2b=0 \) and \( a=0 \), which forces \( f(n) = 0 \) OR just the zero function separately.

This indicates the only solution functions are the zero function. So final answer is just the zero function set.

You can express this neatly as the set containing only the zero function:

```lean
{f | ∀ n, f n = 0}
```

This is well-formed and matches your problem's condition.

<<<{f : ℤ → ℤ | ∀ n : ℤ, f n = 0}>>>
