[write_program]
The problem is to find, for a given \( n \geq 4 \), the greatest natural number \( m \) such that there exists a family \( (A_i)_{i=0}^{m-1} \) of subsets of \(\{0,\dots,n-1\}\) where:

- Each \( A_i \) has cardinality \( i+1 \).
- For \( i \neq j \), \( A_i \not\subseteq A_j \).

I will write a Python script that, for \( n=4,5 \), enumerates possible values of \( m \) by constructing such families, trying to maximize \( m \), and prints candidates for \( m \). This can help conjecture the function `omnimath4357_answer(n)`.

```python
from itertools import combinations

# For given n, find the maximum m for which there exists a family A_i of subsets of [n]
# with |A_i|=i+1 and A_i not subset of A_j for i!=j.
def check_family(n, m):
    # Generate all subsets of size i+1 for i in [0,..,m-1]
    sizes = list(range(1, m+1))
    sets_by_size = [list(combinations(range(n), size)) for size in sizes]
    
    # We'll try to pick one subset of size i+1 for each i, and test incomparability
    # Backtracking approach
    chosen = [None]*m
    
    def is_not_subset(i):
        # Check if chosen[i] is not subset of any chosen[j] with j != i
        set_i = set(chosen[i])
        for j in range(m):
            if j != i and chosen[j] is not None:
                set_j = set(chosen[j])
                if set_i.issubset(set_j):
                    return False
        return True
    
    def backtrack(pos=0):
        if pos == m:
            # Check that for all i!=j, A_i not subset of A_j
            for i in range(m):
                if not is_not_subset(i):
                    return False
            return True
        
        for subset in sets_by_size[pos]:
            chosen[pos] = subset
            # As a shortcut, check incomparability of chosen[pos] immediately
            if all(not set(chosen[pos]).issubset(set(chosen[j])) for j in range(pos)):
                if backtrack(pos+1):
                    return True
        chosen[pos] = None
        return False

    return backtrack()

def main():
    for n in [4,5]:
        print(f"n = {n}")
        # Max m can be at most n (since max subset size = n)
        # Check m from n down to 1 (trying max first)
        for m in range(n, 0, -1):
            if check_family(n,m):
                print(f"  Possible m = {m}")
                break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This prints the maximal \( m \) found for \( n=4 \) and \( n=5 \) where such a family exists, helping to conjecture the sequence `omnimath4357_answer(n)`.
