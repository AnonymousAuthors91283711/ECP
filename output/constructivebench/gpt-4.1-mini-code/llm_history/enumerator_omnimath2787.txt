[write_program]
The problem states an equality: 1/9 + 1/18 = 1 / omnimath2787_answer, where omnimath2787_answer is a rational number to find. The goal is to find a rational number q such that:

1/9 + 1/18 = 1/q

Firstly, compute 1/9 + 1/18 exactly and express it as 1/q, and print q.

I will write a program that computes the fraction 1/9 + 1/18, then inverts it to get q, and print the value of q as a fraction. Since 1/9 + 1/18 = 2/18 + 1/18 = 3/18 = 1/6, so 1/(1/6) = 6, so q=6.

But the program will do this calculation systematically.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Compute sum of 1/9 + 1/18
a = Fraction(1,9)
b = Fraction(1,18)
sum_frac = a + b
# sum_frac = 1/q => q = 1 / sum_frac
q = 1 / sum_frac

print(f"1/9 + 1/18 = {sum_frac} = 1/{q}")
print(f"Therefore, omnimath2787_answer = {q}")
```
