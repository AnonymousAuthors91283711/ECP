[write_program]
The problem concerns finding the greatest natural number \( n \) such that for every monic polynomial \( P \in \mathbb{Z}[X] \) of degree at most \( n \), there exists an injective function \( x \) from a set of size \( k+1 \leq n+1 \) into integers with a certain property on sums of evaluations. 

We will test small values of \( n \) and small choices of polynomials \( P \) to find values of \( n \) that satisfy or fail the condition. We fix small degrees and enumerate injective integer sequences \( x \) of length \( k+1 \), with \( k \leq n \), verifying whether for given polynomials the equality holds. For feasibility, we test:
- Monic polynomials \( P \) with integer coefficients and degree \(\leq n\),
- Small integer domains for \( x \).

This program outputs candidates \( n \) for which the condition holds for a list of test polynomials and candidate sequences \( x \).
