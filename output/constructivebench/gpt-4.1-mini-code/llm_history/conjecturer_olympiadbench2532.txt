. Enumerated answers: Enumerating candidates for b in range [-5,5], excluding 0:
Found solution: a = -2, b = -2
Found solution: a = -2, b = -2
Found solution: a = -2, b = -2
Found solution: a = -2, b = -2
Found solution: a = -2, b = -2
Unique solution satisfying both equations:
a = -2
b = -2. Expected Answer Type: ℝ × ℝ
<<<(-2, -2)>>>
