The problem involves choosing 5 integers a_i from 1 to 5, all positive and ≤ 5, such that all a_i are distinct and no three distinct a_i form an arithmetic progression of length 3 (no i,j,k distinct with a_i, a_j, a_k in arithmetic progression). The task is to count the number of such 5-tuples. 

We will enumerate all 5-tuples (with values in {1,...,5}), check the distinctness and no 3-term arithmetic progression conditions, and print out the valid tuples immediately. This will help conjecture the count of such tuples.

```python
from itertools import product, permutations

def has_3term_ap(a):
    # Check all triples of distinct indices for 3-term arithmetic progression
    for i in range(5):
        for j in range(i+1,5):
            for k in range(j+1,5):
                x, y, z = a[i], a[j], a[k]
                # Check if any permutation of indices forms an arithmetic progression
                triples = [(x,y,z),(x,z,y),(y,x,z),(y,z,x),(z,x,y),(z,y,x)]
                for (p,q,r) in triples:
                    if p + r == 2*q:
                        return True
    return False

def main():
    count = 0
    # Values are from 1 to 5, map Fin 5 → ℤ means indices 0..4
    # a_i should be distinct and in [1..5]
    # Enumerate permutations of [1..5] (since distinct and range fixed)
    for a in permutations(range(1,6)):
        # Check no 3-term arithmetic progression condition
        if not has_3term_ap(a):
            print("Valid tuple:", a)
            count += 1
    print("Total valid tuples:", count)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
