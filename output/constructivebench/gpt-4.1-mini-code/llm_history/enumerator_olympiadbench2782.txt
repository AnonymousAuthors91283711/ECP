The problem appears to analyze when \(( -1 + i )^k = \frac{1}{2^T}\) given \(T = -8\) and \(k > 0\) for complex numbers (with \(i\) as the imaginary unit). I'll enumerate values of \(k\) and compute \(( -1 + i )^k\), checking if it equals \(\frac{1}{2^T}\) exactly or approximately (since exact equality of complex numbers is strict). Given \(T = -8\), the right side is \(2^8 = 256\).

The number \(-1 + i\) has modulus \(\sqrt{2}\) and argument \(3\pi/4\), so \(( -1 + i )^k = (\sqrt{2})^k \cdot e^{i k 3\pi/4}\).
Its magnitude grows as \(2^{k/2}\). To equal 256, which is \(2^8\), the magnitude condition gives \(k/2 = 8 \implies k = 16\).

So likely answer is \(k=16\), but I'll enumerate \(k\) from 1 to 20 to confirm.

```python
# Enumerate k and compute (-1 + i)^k and compare to 2^8=256

def main():
    import cmath

    base = complex(-1,1)
    T = -8
    target = 2 ** (-T)  # 2^8 = 256

    print(f"T = {T}, target = {target}")
    for k in range(1, 21):
        val = base ** k
        mag = abs(val)
        # print magnitude and full complex number with high precision
        print(f"k = {k}: (-1 + i)^k = {val} with magnitude = {mag}")

        # check if magnitude close to target within a small epsilon
        if abs(mag - target) < 1e-10:
            # check if complex val is real and positive (since right side is real positive)
            if abs(val.imag) < 1e-10 and abs(val.real - target) < 1e-10:
                print(f"Exact equality at k={k}: {val}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
