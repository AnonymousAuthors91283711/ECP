This problem involves determining a positive real number \( d \) meeting a certain equation related to velocities and times. We have:
- \( v_1 = 35 \)
- \( v_2 = v_1 + 15 = 50 \)
- \( d_1 = v_1 \times 1 = 35 \)
- \( d_2 = d - d_1 = d - 35 \)
- \( t_2 = \frac{d_2}{v_2} = \frac{d - 35}{50} \)
- \( \text{total_time} = 1 + t_2 = 1 + \frac{d - 35}{50} \)
- \( \text{scheduled_time} = \frac{d}{v_1} - 1 = \frac{d}{35} - 1 \)
- Given: \( \text{total_time} = \text{scheduled_time} - 0.5 \)

Rearranging gives:
\[
1 + \frac{d - 35}{50} = \frac{d}{35} - 1 - 0.5 = \frac{d}{35} - 1.5
\]

Multiplying both sides by 350 (common multiple of 50 and 35) to clear denominators:
\[
350 + 7(d - 35) = 10d - 525
\]
\[
350 + 7d - 245 = 10d - 525
\]
\[
105 + 7d = 10d - 525
\]
\[
105 + 7d + 525 = 10d
\]
\[
630 + 7d = 10d
\]
\[
630 = 3d \implies d = 210
\]

We can verify this computationally for confidence and to illustrate outputs as requested.

```python
# enumerator.py
# Enumerate candidate values for d in a reasonable range and check equation correctness

v1 = 35
v2 = v1 + 15  # 50
d1 = v1 * 1   # 35

# We want to find d > 0 such that:
# 1 + (d - 35)/50 == d/35 - 1.5

# To enumerate efficiently, we solve symbolically but also check candidates near solution

def check_d(d):
    total_time = 1 + (d - d1) / v2
    scheduled_time = d / v1 - 1
    lhs = total_time
    rhs = scheduled_time - 0.5
    # Check if lhs and rhs are close enough to be considered equal
    if abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-12:
        print(f"d = {d} satisfies the equation (exact within tolerance)")

# Because the problem is linear, solve for d directly, then verify
d_exact = 210  # from manual derivation

print(f"Testing exact candidate d = {d_exact}")
check_d(d_exact)

# Also test integers around the value to see if any other candidates hold
for d_candidate in range(200, 221):
    check_d(d_candidate)
```
