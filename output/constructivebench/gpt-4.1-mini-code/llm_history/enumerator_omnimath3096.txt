The problem appears to involve positive integers \(a, b, c\) with linear constraints:
- \(a + b = 998\)
- \(a + c = 1050\)
- \(b + c = 1234\)

We want to find the value of some function \(\text{omnimath3096\_answer}(a, b, c)\) that equals 236. Since this function is unknown, let's explore and print possible triples \((a,b,c)\) satisfying the constraints. From these, we might identify the value or the pattern of the function.

We will:
- Enumerate possible positive integer triples \((a,b,c)\) satisfying the given equalities.
- Print the triples found.
- Calculate \(a,b,c\) directly from the system and print the candidate solution.
- Optionally print the sum \(a+b+c\) or differences to help conjecture the function.

```python
# We solve the system:
# a + b = 998
# a + c = 1050
# b + c = 1234

# Let's solve the system:
# From (1) and (2):
# (a + b) + (a + c) = 998 + 1050 => 2a + b + c = 2048
# But b + c = 1234 from (3)
# So 2a + 1234 = 2048 => 2a = 814 => a = 407
# Then b = 998 - a = 998 - 407 = 591
# c = 1050 - a = 1050 - 407 = 643

# Check b + c = 591 + 643 = 1234 correct.

# Let's print these values and some simple combinations.

print("Parameters used: a + b = 998, a + c = 1050, b + c = 1234")
a = 407
b = 591
c = 643

print("Found solution (a,b,c):", (a, b, c))

# Print some associated values:
print("Sum a+b+c:", a + b + c)
print("max(a,b,c):", max(a,b,c))
print("min(a,b,c):", min(a,b,c))
print("a*b*c:", a*b*c)
print("a^2 + b^2 + c^2:", a*a + b*b + c*c)
print("Checking a+b, a+c, b+c:", a+b, a+c, b+c)
```
