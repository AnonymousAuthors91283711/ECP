The problem essentially involves analyzing the set \( S = \{ y \in \mathbb{R} \mid \exists x,z \in \mathbb{R}: x + y = 7, \quad xz = -180, \quad (x + y + z)^2 = 4 \} \).

We want to find the two values \( y_1 \neq y_2 \) in \( S \), and verify that \( -(y_1 + y_2) \) equals some value (to be discovered). To assist in conjecturing the answer, we enumerate possible \( y \) values by scanning over \( y \) and attempting to find \( x,z \) satisfying the equations.

We'll:

- For each candidate \( y \), compute \( x = 7 - y \).
- From \( xz = -180 \), solve for \( z = -180/x \) when \( x \neq 0 \).
- Check if \( (x + y + z)^2 = 4 \).
- Print such \( y \) values immediately.

Since \( y \) is real, we'll sample rational and integer \( y \) values in a reasonable range, e.g. from -20 to 20 with step 0.1 to avoid missing values. Then print all candidates found, then print the sum of opposite.

```python
# Enumerate candidate y values with parameters
print("Enumerating possible y values for the set S:")
candidates = []
for ytenth in range(-200,201):
    y = ytenth/10
    x = 7 - y
    if x == 0:
        continue
    z = -180 / x
    val = (x + y + z)**2
    # Check exact equality with 4 is rare numerically; use close tolerance and fractions?
    # But use exact fractions for more precision
    # Instead do exact float check with tolerance
    if abs(val - 4) < 1e-9:
        candidates.append(y)
        print(f"y = {y:.3f}, with x = {x:.3f}, z = {z:.3f}, (x+y+z)^2 = {val:.9f}")

# After collection of candidates, print them and their sum
if len(candidates) == 2:
    y1, y2 = candidates
    print(f"\nFound two distinct y values: {y1:.3f}, {y2:.3f}")
    print(f"Sum y1 + y2 = {y1 + y2:.9f}")
    print(f"-(y1 + y2) = {- (y1 + y2):.9f}")
else:
    print(f"\nFound {len(candidates)} candidates (need 2). Candidates found: {candidates}")
```
