The problem seems to ask for a natural number that does not belong to the set \(\{3n + 1 \mid 1 \leq n \leq 400 \}\). Our code will enumerate all numbers of the form \(3n+1\) for \(n=1\) to 400, and find numbers outside this set within a reasonable range.

Let's print all such values and also print values that are *not* in the set from 1 to a threshold, e.g., 1210 which is \(3 \times 400 + 1\).

```python
# Enumerate values of 3n+1 for n = 1 to 400 and print them,
# then show natural numbers in the range [1 .. 1210] that are NOT of this form.

def main():
    max_n = 400
    values = set()
    print("Values of form 3n+1 for n=1..400:")
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        val = 3 * n + 1
        values.add(val)
        print(val)
    
    print("\nNumbers in [1..1210] NOT of the form 3n+1 for n=1..400:")
    for y in range(1, 3 * max_n + 2):  # up to 3*400+1
        if y not in values:
            print(y)
    
    # Example: candidate answer could be the smallest number not in the set
    for y in range(1, 3 * max_n + 2):
        if y not in values:
            print(f"\nCandidate answer (smallest y not in set): {y}")
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
