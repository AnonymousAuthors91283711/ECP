The given Lean theorem states: 2020 - 25 = omnimath3393_answer, where omnimath3393_answer is a natural number (â„•) to be found.

This is straightforward subtraction of natural numbers. The answer should be 2020 minus 25.

Below is a Python program enumerating the subtraction and printing the result. It will print the answer immediately.

```python
# Enumerate 2020 - 25 and print the answer immediately.
def main():
    a = 2020
    b = 25
    answer = a - b
    print(f"Parameters: a={a}, b={b}")
    print(f"Answer (a - b): {answer}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
