The problem considers integers s of the form s = a³ + b³ − 60 a b (a + b), and asks for the smallest s ≥ 2012 for some integers a, b.

We write a Python script to enumerate integer pairs (a, b) within a reasonable range (e.g. -20 to 20), compute each s, and print those s ≥ 2012. We keep track of the minimal such s produced.

```python
# Enumerate s = a^3 + b^3 - 60*a*b*(a + b) for integer a,b in [-20..20]
# Print every s ≥ 2012 found, then print the minimal such s.

def main():
    min_s = None
    RANGE = 20
    print("Enumerating s = a^3 + b^3 - 60*a*b*(a + b) for a,b in [-20..20] with s >= 2012")
    for a in range(-RANGE, RANGE+1):
        for b in range(-RANGE, RANGE+1):
            s = a**3 + b**3 - 60*a*b*(a + b)
            if s >= 2012:
                print(f"s={s} for a={a}, b={b}")
                if min_s is None or s < min_s:
                    min_s = s
    if min_s is not None:
        print(f"\nMinimum s >= 2012 found: {min_s}")
    else:
        print("No s >= 2012 found in range.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
