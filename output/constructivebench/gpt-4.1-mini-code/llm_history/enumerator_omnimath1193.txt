The problem concerns conditional probabilities when drawing balls from two urns. We verify and enumerate all probabilities involved, then compute the exact conditional probability that the first ball drawn is red given the second ball drawn is black.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def prob_first_red_given_second_black():
    urnA_white = 4
    urnA_red = 2
    urnB_red = 3
    urnB_black = 3
    totalA = urnA_white + urnA_red
    totalB = urnB_red + urnB_black

    p_half = Fraction(1, 2)  # Probability to choose each urn first

    # Compute numerator components:
    # Case 1: First urn A, first ball red; second urn B, second ball black
    case1_num = p_half * Fraction(urnA_red, totalA) * p_half * Fraction(urnB_black, totalB)
    print(f"Case 1 numerator: {case1_num}")

    # Case 2: First urn B, first ball red; second urn B, second ball black (dependent draw)
    case2_num = p_half * Fraction(urnB_red, totalB) * p_half * Fraction(urnB_black, totalB - 1)
    print(f"Case 2 numerator: {case2_num}")

    numerator = case1_num + case2_num
    print(f"Numerator: {numerator}")

    # Compute denominator components (all cases where second ball is black):

    # Case 1: First urn A, first ball red; second urn B, second ball black
    case1_den = p_half * Fraction(urnA_red, totalA) * p_half * Fraction(urnB_black, totalB)
    print(f"Case 1 denominator: {case1_den}")

    # Case 2: First urn A, first ball white; second urn B, second ball black
    case2_den = p_half * Fraction(urnA_white, totalA) * p_half * Fraction(urnB_black, totalB)
    print(f"Case 2 denominator: {case2_den}")

    # Case 3: First urn B, first ball red; second urn B, second ball black (dependent)
    case3_den = p_half * Fraction(urnB_red, totalB) * p_half * Fraction(urnB_black, totalB - 1)
    print(f"Case 3 denominator: {case3_den}")

    # Case 4: First urn B, first ball black; second urn B, second ball black (dependent)
    case4_den = p_half * Fraction(urnB_black, totalB) * p_half * Fraction(urnB_black - 1, totalB - 1)
    print(f"Case 4 denominator: {case4_den}")

    denominator = case1_den + case2_den + case3_den + case4_den
    print(f"Denominator: {denominator}")

    # Compute final conditional probability:
    conditional_prob = numerator / denominator
    print(f"Probability(first ball red | second ball black) = {conditional_prob} â‰ˆ {float(conditional_prob)}")

    prob_first_red_given_second_black()
