The problem describes triples \((x,y,z)\) of positive real numbers satisfying a symmetric system of equations:
\[
x + \frac{y}{z} = 2, \quad y + \frac{z}{x} = 2, \quad z + \frac{x}{y} = 2,
\]
and looks at the set of possible values of \( s = x + y + z \).

We want to enumerate triples \((x,y,z)\) with \(x,y,z >0\) that satisfy these equations approximately, to conjecture possible sums \(s\).

A natural approach is to iterate over rational triples in a small range, check the equations up to some tolerance, print the sums.

```python
# Enumerate approximate positive triples (x,y,z) with rational increments
# satisfying the system approximately and print sums x+y+z

def approx_eq(a,b,tol=1e-6):
    return abs(a-b) <= tol

def check_system(x,y,z):
    return (approx_eq(x + y/z, 2) and
            approx_eq(y + z/x, 2) and
            approx_eq(z + x/y, 2))

step = 0.1
max_val = 3.0

found_sums = set()

print("Enumerating triples (x,y,z) with x,y,z in (0,3] step 0.1 satisfying:")
print("x + y/z = y + z/x = z + x/y = 2 approximately")
for i in range(1,int(max_val/step)+1):
    x = i*step
    for j in range(1,int(max_val/step)+1):
        y = j*step
        for k in range(1,int(max_val/step)+1):
            z = k*step
            if check_system(x,y,z):
                s = round(x+y+z,6)
                if s not in found_sums:
                    found_sums.add(s)
                    print(f"x={x:.1f}, y={y:.1f}, z={z:.1f} => sum = {s}")

# We expect symmetric solutions, possibly only a few sums
```
