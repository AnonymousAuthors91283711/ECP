[write_program]
The problem defines a minimal value \(M\) related to sums of functions and conditions involving parameters \(a,b,c,p,q,r\), with constraints \(p,q,r \geq 2\). 

To support conjecturing, I will enumerate values of \(M\) for small parameters \(a,b,c,p,q,r\) (e.g. from 1 to 2 or 3), and for each tuple try all functions \(f\) from the finite domain \((x,y,z) \in [0,a] \times [0,b] \times [0,c]\) with values summing to \(M\). For each \(f\), I will check if the given property holds for some \(g\). Since \(g\) is also unknown, I will enumerate candidate \(g\), and check the inequality.

Due to computational complexity, I will limit \(a,b,c\) to 1 or 2, \(p,q,r\) to 2, and limit to small values of sums \(M\) up to a threshold. The program will print candidates \(M\) as they are found, for each parameter set.

Because directly checking all functions \(f\) and \(g\) is too large, I will only look at some simple functions \(f\), e.g. \(f\) identically zero except at one point, or uniform, to get some candidate values to conjecture about.
