The problem involves a double product over m and n from 0 to 99 of a rational expression in powers of x. To assist in conjecturing the closed-form or behavior of the product, we'll enumerate the value of the product for some sample values of real x not equal to zero.

We will:

- Define the function f(m,n,x) = numerator/denominator as in the problem.
- Compute the double product P(x) = ∏_{m=0}^{99} ∏_{n=0}^{99} f(m,n,x).
- Try for a few sample values of x (e.g., 0.5, 1, 2).
- Print the intermediate steps for the first few terms to check patterns.
- Print the final product for each sampled x.

Since the exponent range is large (100x100=10000 terms), to keep it under 400 tokens and runtime reasonable, we will:
- Use smaller ranges (e.g., 5 or 10) for initial enumeration.
- Print intermediate partial results (e.g., after each m) to show streaming.
- For exact values, note that the expression involves powers of x and can be exact if x is rational or integer > 0.

The code outputs products for x in [0.5, 1, 2], and for ranges m,n from 0 to 10.

```python
# Enumerate partial products of the given double product for sample x values
def f(m, n, x):
    # numerator and denominator of the term
    num = x**(n+m) + x**(n+m+2) + x**(2*n+1) + x**(2*m+1)
    den = x**(2*n) + 2*x**(n+m) + x**(2*m)
    return num/den

def product_range(x, max_m, max_n):
    prod = 1.0
    for m in range(max_m+1):
        for n in range(max_n+1):
            val = f(m, n, x)
            prod *= val
        # Print product after completing each m (streaming partial results)
        print(f"Partial product up to m={m} for x={x}: {prod}")
    print(f"Final product for x={x}, m,n=0..{max_m}: {prod}")

def main():
    xs = [0.5, 1.0, 2.0]
    max_m, max_n = 10, 10  # smaller range for enumeration
    for x in xs:
        print(f"Computing product for x={x}")
        product_range(x, max_m, max_n)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
