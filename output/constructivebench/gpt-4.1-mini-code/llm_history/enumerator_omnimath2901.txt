The problem provides conditions on real numbers \( x, y \) with a known average \(\frac{x+y}{2} = 7\) and \( x=5 \), asking for \( y \).

We want to enumerate possible \(y\) that satisfy the average condition given various \(x\) values and check the implied \(y\).

```python
# Enumerate values of x around 5, compute y to satisfy (x+y)/2=7
# Print exact y values found.

print("Enumerating x and corresponding y where (x+y)/2=7:")
for x_int in range(0, 15):
    x = float(x_int)  # integer values from 0 to 14
    y = 14 - x  # from (x + y)/2=7 => y=14 - x
    print(f"x={x}, y={y}")

# Special case x=5 as given in problem; print exact y
x = 5
y = 14 - x
print(f"Given x=5, y={y}")

# The answer is y=9 when x=5.
print("Answer: y=9 when x=5")
```
