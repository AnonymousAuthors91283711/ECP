The problem involves determining an integer \(m\) that minimizes the absolute difference \(|\text{distance} - m|\) where:
- totalSteps = 44 * 100000 + 50000 = 4,400,000 + 50,000 = 4,450,000
- stepsPerMile = 1800
- distance = totalSteps / stepsPerMile = 4,450,000 / 1800

We want to find the integer \(m\) closest to this distance. The task is to enumerate integers around the computed distance, print candidates and finally print the integer that yields the minimal absolute difference.

```python
# Enumerate possible integer candidates m near the distance
def main():
    totalSteps = 44 * 100000 + 50000  # 4,450,000 steps
    stepsPerMile = 1800
    # Compute distance (float)
    distance = totalSteps / stepsPerMile  # Around 2472.2222...
    print(f"Computed distance = {distance}")

    # We'll consider integers around distance: floor, ceil, and neighbors
    from math import floor, ceil

    flo = floor(distance)
    cei = ceil(distance)
    candidates = range(flo - 2, cei + 3)  # check a small neighborhood

    min_diff = None
    best_m = None

    for m in candidates:
        diff = abs(distance - m)
        print(f"m = {m}, abs(distance - m) = {diff}")
        if (min_diff is None) or (diff < min_diff):
            min_diff = diff
            best_m = m

    print(f"Minimum absolute difference found for m = {best_m}")
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
