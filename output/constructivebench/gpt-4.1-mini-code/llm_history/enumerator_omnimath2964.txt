The problem involves selecting 9 distinct numbers from the set {1, 5, 6, 7, 13, 14, 17, 22, 26} to assign to circles indexed 0 to 8, with the conditions that the numbers 13 and 17 appear, and the averages of the numbers in circles 0-2, 3-5, and 6-8 are equal. We want to find a specific circle's value satisfying these conditions.

We will:

- Enumerate all permutations of the given 9 numbers (since we must assign all of them).
- Check if 13 and 17 are included (they always are since we use all numbers).
- Verify the averages of the three groups are equal.
- Upon finding valid assignments, print the assignments and circle values.
- Enumerate all solutions, then possibly conjecture the k-th value.

```python
import itertools

numbers = [1, 5, 6, 7, 13, 14, 17, 22, 26]

# Because the circles mapping is injective and from Fin 9, we must assign all numbers exactly once.
# Also, conditions: 13 and 17 must appear (always true here).
# Check if avg(circles 0,1,2)=avg(3,4,5)=avg(6,7,8)

count = 0
for perm in itertools.permutations(numbers):
    group1 = perm[0] + perm[1] + perm[2]
    group2 = perm[3] + perm[4] + perm[5]
    group3 = perm[6] + perm[7] + perm[8]
    
    # Check average equality without float:
    if group1 * 3 == group2 *3 and group2 *3 == group3*3:
        count +=1
        print(f"Solution {count}:")
        print(f" Circles 0-2: {perm[0:3]}, sum={group1}")
        print(f" Circles 3-5: {perm[3:6]}, sum={group2}")
        print(f" Circles 6-8: {perm[6:9]}, sum={group3}")
        # Print full circle mapping
        print(" Circles mapping:")
        for i in range(9):
            print(f"  circles {i} = {perm[i]}")
        print("---")
```
