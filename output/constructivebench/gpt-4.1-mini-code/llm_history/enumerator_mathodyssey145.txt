The problem involves finite sets of natural numbers \( S \), and the property \( P(S) \) states that there exists an element \( k \in S \) such that \( k \) divides the product of the other elements in \( S \). The goal is to find the smallest size \( m \) of such sets \( S \).

We enumerate finite sets \( S \) of natural numbers (say, from 1 to a small maximum) for increasing cardinalities, checking if \( P(S) \) holds. We print \( m \) and all sets \( S \) with this property as soon as they are found. After a threshold for \( m \) (e.g., 6), we stop and print the smallest \( m \) for which some \( S \) with property \( P \) is found.

```python
from itertools import combinations
from math import prod

# Check property P(S): ∃ k∈S, k divides product of S\{k}
def has_property(S):
    for k in S:
        others = [x for x in S if x != k]
        if not others:
            continue
        p = prod(others)
        if p % k == 0:
            return True
    return False

max_element = 10  # Limit elements to 1..10 for efficiency
found_sizes = []
min_size_found = None

for size in range(2, 7):  # Check cardinalities from 2 to 6
    print(f"Checking sets of size {size}...")
    sets_with_p = []
    for S in combinations(range(1, max_element + 1), size):
        if has_property(S):
            print(f"Set with property P found (size={size}): {S}")
            sets_with_p.append(S)
    if sets_with_p:
        min_size_found = size
        print(f"Minimum size with property P at most: {min_size_found}")
        break

if min_size_found is None:
    print("No sets found up to size 6 with property P.")
else:
    print(f"Conjectured minimal cardinality: {min_size_found}")
```
