[write_program]
The problem describes the set S of pairs (x,y) satisfying the system of equations:
- y^4 - y^2 = 0
- x*y^3 - x*y = 0
- x^3*y - x*y = 0
- x^4 - x^2 = 0

We want to find the number of elements in S (the cardinality of S).

Strategy:
- Find all real solutions (x,y).
- Each equation is a polynomial equation with factors, so factor and find roots.
- The program will enumerate possible x, y values that satisfy these polynomial constraints exactly.
- The first and last equations factor as y^2(y^2 -1)=0 and x^2(x^2 -1)=0, so y in {0,-1,1} and x in {0,-1,1}.
- Check the other 2 equations to filter solutions.

We'll enumerate all these candidates and print them as found, then print the total count.

```python
# Enumerate solutions (x,y) in R^2 satisfying:
# y^4 - y^2 = 0 => y^2(y^2 -1)=0 => y in {0, ±1}
# x^4 - x^2 = 0 => x^2(x^2 -1)=0 => x in {0, ±1}
# plus the middle two equations:
# x*y^3 - x*y = x*y(y^2 -1)=0
# x^3*y - x*y = x*y(x^2 -1)=0

def satisfies_system(x,y):
    # check each equation exactly
    eq1 = y**4 - y**2 == 0
    eq4 = x**4 - x**2 == 0
    eq2 = x*y**3 - x*y == 0
    eq3 = x**3*y - x*y == 0
    return eq1 and eq2 and eq3 and eq4

def main():
    # Possible x and y candidates from first and last eq:
    candidates = [-1,0,1]
    found = []
    for x in candidates:
        for y in candidates:
            if satisfies_system(x,y):
                print(f"Solution found: (x,y)=({x},{y})")
                found.append((x,y))
    print(f"Total number of solutions: {len(found)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
