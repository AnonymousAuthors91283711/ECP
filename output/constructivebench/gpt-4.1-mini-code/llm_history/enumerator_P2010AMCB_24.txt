The problem involves the function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x+1} + \frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{x-1} \), and the set \( S = \{ x \mid x \neq -1, x \neq 0, x \neq 1, \text{ and } f(x) > 1 \} \). It claims that three intervals \( I_1, I_2, I_3 \) are subsets of \( S \), and also calculates the sum of their lengths. The problem essentially wants us to understand for which \( x \) values \( f(x) > 1 \), and to identify these intervals, then sum their lengths.

To assist conjecturing the true answer, I will write a Python program that:

- Defines the function \( f(x) \).
- Enumerates rational points \( x \) on small intervals, avoiding singularities at -1, 0, and 1.
- Prints \( x \) values where \( f(x) > 1 \).
- Prints intervals (or subintervals) showing where \( f(x) > 1 \) appears.
- Prints the computed sum of the interval lengths as defined.

We will also compute the length sum of the three given intervals numerically, and print it as a candidate for \( \text{P2010AMCB\_24\_answer} \).

The program will print streaming results as it finds points that satisfy \( f(x) > 1 \).

```python
# enumerator.py
import math

def f(x):
    # f(x) = 1/(x+1) + 1/x + 1/(x-1)
    # Avoid division by zero by checking x not in {-1,0,1}
    if x == -1 or x == 0 or x == 1:
        return None
    return 1/(x+1) + 1/x + 1/(x-1)

def test_intervals():
    # Intervals as given in problem
    sqrt2 = math.sqrt(2)
    intervals = [
        (-1, 1 - sqrt2),
        (0, 0.5),
        (1, 1 + sqrt2)
    ]

    print(f"Given intervals (I1, I2, I3):")
    for i,(a,b) in enumerate(intervals,1):
        print(f" I{i} = ({a}, {b}) length = {b - a}")

    # Sum of lengths
    length_sum = sum(b - a for (a,b) in intervals)
    print(f"Sum of lengths: {length_sum}")

    # Enumerate points inside intervals to confirm f(x) > 1
    # Use few sample points per interval for brevity
    for i,(a,b) in enumerate(intervals,1):
        print(f"Testing points in I{i}:")
        # Choose 5 sample points in interval, avoiding endpoints (open interval)
        for k in range(1,6):
            x = a + k*(b - a)/6
            val = f(x)
            if val is None:
                continue
            if val > 1:
                print(f" f({x:.6f}) = {val:.6f} > 1")

    # Also test points outside intervals near singularities
    # to check f(x) <= 1 behavior
    outside_points = [-1.1, -0.9, 0.6, 0.9, 2.5]
    print("Testing points outside given intervals:")
    for x in outside_points:
        val = f(x)
        if val is None:
            continue
        print(f" f({x:.6f}) = {val:.6f} {'>' if val > 1 else '<='} 1")
