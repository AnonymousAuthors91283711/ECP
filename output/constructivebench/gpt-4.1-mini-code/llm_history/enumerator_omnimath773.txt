The problem involves four real numbers \(a, b, c, d\) with two given constraints involving the sums of absolute differences:
\[
|a - b| + |c - d| = 99, \quad |a - c| + |b - d| = 1,
\]
and asks to determine the value of
\[
|a - d| + |b - c|.
\]

To assist in forming a conjecture and a possible proof, we can enumerate possible quadruples \((a,b,c,d)\) satisfying the constraints (or approximations close to them) for small integer values, and compute the target expression. We'll try a few integer values \(a,b,c,d\) within a range and print those quadruples where the two sums are close to the given values. This will help observe patterns in the possible values of \(|a-d| + |b-c|\).

Because this is a complex absolute value equation system, exploring a grid is reasonable. We'll sample integers from 0 to 100 and print quadruples meeting the constraints within a small tolerance, printing values for the target expression immediately to track possible results.

```python
# Python program to explore quadruples (a,b,c,d) with two sum constraints,
# printing the resulting value of |a-d| + |b-c|.

def abs_sum(x, y):
    return abs(x) + abs(y)

def main():
    # We'll try integer values in this range.
    # Since |a-b| + |c-d|=99, differences may be large
    # We'll limit search to a,b,c,d in [0, 100].
    tol = 1e-6
    printed_values = set()

    print("Exploring quadruples (a,b,c,d) in [0,100]^4 with constraints:")
    print("|a - b| + |c - d| = 99, |a - c| + |b - d| = 1")
    print("Printing |a - d| + |b - c| when constraints nearly hold (within 0.01).")

    for a in range(0, 101, 10):
        for b in range(0, 101, 10):
            for c in range(0, 101, 10):
                for d in range(0, 101, 10):
                    s1 = abs_sum(a - b, c - d)
                    s2 = abs_sum(a - c, b - d)
                    if abs(s1 - 99) < 0.01 and abs(s2 - 1) < 0.01:
                        val = abs_sum(a - d, b - c)
                        # Print unique values immediately
                        if val not in printed_values:
                            printed_values.add(val)
                            print(f"(a,b,c,d)=({a},{b},{c},{d}): |a-d|+|b-c| = {val}")
