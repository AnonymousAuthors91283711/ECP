theorem omnimath3365 : 
  IsGreatest {n ∈ [31, 32, 999, 1000] | ∀ m ∈ [31, 32, 999, 1000], 
    winningProbability n ≥ winningProbability m} 
  omnimath3365_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: winningProbability(31) = 0.5
winningProbability(32) = 0.6
winningProbability(999) = 0.4
winningProbability(1000) = 0.3
Maximum winningProbability is 0.6 achieved at n = 32. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<32>>>
