Ground Truth Answer: fun t_walk t_move => (t_walk * t_move) / (t_walk - t_move)
Proposed Answer: fun t_walk t_move => (t_walk + t_move) / 2 - 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers.

The problem is asking for a function of t_walk and t_move that equals 40 when t_walk = 60 and t_move = 24.

Ground Truth Answer:
(fun t_walk t_move => (t_walk * t_move) / (t_walk - t_move))
When we plug in t_walk=60, t_move=24:
(60*24)/(60-24) = 1440/36 = 40

Proposed Answer:
(fun t_walk t_move => (t_walk + t_move) / 2 - 2)
When we plug in t_walk=60, t_move=24:
(60+24)/2 - 2 = 84/2 - 2 = 42 - 2 = 40

While both answers give 40 for the specific values given in the problem, they are completely different functions that only coincide at this single point. For example, if we test with t_walk=30, t_move=15:
Ground Truth: (30*15)/(30-15) = 450/15 = 30
Proposed: (30+15)/2 - 2 = 45/2 - 2 = 20.5

The answers are not equivalent functions, they just happen to give the same result for the specific values in the problem statement.
