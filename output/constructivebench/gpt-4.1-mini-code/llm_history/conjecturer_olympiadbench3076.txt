theorem olympiadbench3076 : 
  coeff ((X + X^2 + X^4 + X^8 + X^16 + X^32).comp (X + X^2 + X^4 + X^8 + X^16 + X^32)) 10 = olympiadbench3076_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating coefficients of X^10 in Q(X)^k:
k=1 -> coefficient=0
k=2 -> coefficient=2
k=4 -> coefficient=10
k=8 -> coefficient=28
k=16 -> coefficient=0 (degree too high)
k=32 -> coefficient=0 (degree too high)
Sum of coefficients = 40. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
