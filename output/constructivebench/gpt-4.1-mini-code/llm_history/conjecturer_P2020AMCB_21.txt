The problem is to find the set of natural numbers \( n > 0 \) such that \( \frac{n}{n+1} = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{n+1} \right\rfloor \).

Since for all \( n > 0 \),
\[
0 < \frac{n}{n+1} < 1,
\]
this fraction is always strictly between 0 and 1, and never an integer. Hence
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{n+1} \right\rfloor = 0,
\]
and equality would require
\[
\frac{n}{n+1} = 0,
\]
which is impossible for \( n > 0 \).

Therefore, no positive natural number \( n \) satisfies the condition, and the set is empty.

In Lean, to express this as the set of those \( n \) such that \( 0 < n \) and \( n/(n+1) \) is an integer (equal to its floor), we can write

```lean
{ n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ (n : ℝ) / (n + 1) = ⌊(n : ℝ) / (n + 1)⌋ }
```

and this set is equal to the empty set \( \emptyset \), which in Lean is `∅`.

Hence the proposed answer should be simply `∅`.

The error in your original code likely was due to incorrect syntax in how the answer was given (e.g., `abbrev P2020AMCB_21_answer : Set ℕ := ∅` or similar).

The final correct expression for the answer set in Lean syntax is:

The problem asks for natural numbers \(n > 0\) such that \(\frac{n}{n+1}\) equals its floor. Since \( \frac{n}{n+1} \) is always strictly less than 1 for positive \(n\), its floor is always 0. Therefore, the equality holds only when \(\frac{n}{n+1} = 0\), but this is impossible for positive \(n\). Hence, no such \(n > 0\) exist.

Thus the answer set is empty.
