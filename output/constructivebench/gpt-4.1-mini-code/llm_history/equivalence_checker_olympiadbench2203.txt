Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: { (a, b, c) | (a = b ∧ c = 0) ∨ (a = c ∧ b = 0) ∨ (b = c ∧ a = 0) ∨ (a = b ∧ b = c ∧ c = 1/3) }

The proposed answer captures some correct solutions but is incomplete. It correctly identifies the symmetric cases where two variables are equal and the third is zero, and the case where all three variables are equal to 1/3. However, it misses other possible solutions to the system of equations. The ground truth answer would likely include all solutions, not just these specific cases. Therefore, the proposed answer is partially correct but not fully equivalent to the ground truth.
