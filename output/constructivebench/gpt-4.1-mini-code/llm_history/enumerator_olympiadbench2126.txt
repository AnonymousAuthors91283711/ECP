The problem seems to study pairs of integer points related by a condition involving a parameter k, and k-cliques with more than 200 elements. To investigate, we will enumerate integer points and compute values of k using the formula:

k = (1/2)*(A.1 - C.1)*(B.2 - C.2 - (A.2 - C.2)) - (B.1 - C.1)*(A.2 - C.2)*(1/2)

where A, B, and C are points in ℤ² with A ≠ B.

Since the problem is complicated, let's try small sets of points (like within a 5x5 grid) and try to find cliques for different k values. If a clique exists with > 200 points, output the k.

We prioritize integer k values from the formula with small points. We'll print k and candidate cliques sizes.

```python
from fractions import Fraction
from collections import defaultdict
import itertools

# Enumerate triples A,B,C in a small grid
max_coord = 3  # small grid from -3 to 3 for manageability
points = [(x, y) for x in range(-max_coord, max_coord+1) for y in range(-max_coord, max_coord+1)]

def kfriends(k, A, B):
    # check if the formula equals k, for some C in points, and A != B
    if A == B:
        return False
    A1, A2 = Fraction(A[0]), Fraction(A[1])
    B1, B2 = Fraction(B[0]), Fraction(B[1])
    for Cx, Cy in points:
        C1, C2 = Fraction(Cx), Fraction(Cy)
        val = Fraction(1,2)*(A1 - C1)*(B2 - C2 - (A2 - C2)) - (B1 - C1)*(A2 - C2)*Fraction(1,2)
        if val == k:
            return True
    return False

def kclique(k, T):
    # T is a set of points
    for A in T:
        for B in T:
            if not kfriends(k, A, B):
                return False
    return True

def main():
    # Try k in a small range of fractions with denominator up to 4 to capture halves etc.
    candidate_ks = set()
    for num in range(-10, 11):
        for den in [1,2,4]:
            candidate_ks.add(Fraction(num,den))
    candidate_ks = sorted(candidate_ks)

    # Construct adjacency for each k to find cliques
    for k in candidate_ks:
        # Build graph edges (A,B) where kfriends(k,A,B) true
        adj = defaultdict(set)
        for A, B in itertools.combinations(points, 2):
            if kfriends(k, A, B):
                adj[A].add(B)
                adj[B].add(A)
        # Greedily find large cliques
        # For performance, check degrees and try max degree node neighborhood
        # Because max clique is hard, just try nodes with large degree to get candidates > 5
        for node in adj:
            clique_candidate = {node} | adj[node]
            # verify clique property
            if kclique(k, clique_candidate):
                size = len(clique_candidate)
                if size > 200:
                    print(f"Found k={k} with clique size {size} > 200")
                else:
                    print(f"k={k} has clique size {size}")
    print("Enumeration done.")
