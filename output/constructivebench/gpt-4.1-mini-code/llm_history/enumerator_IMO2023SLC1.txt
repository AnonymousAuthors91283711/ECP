The problem is to find pairs \((m,n)\) with \(m,n>1\) such that there exists a sequence of functions \(f:\mathbb{N} \to (\text{Fin }m \times \text{Fin } n \to \text{Bool})\), starting from all-false at \(f(0)\), and after finitely many steps (say \(k\)), all values at \(f(k)\) are true. Each step toggles values on two pairs related to some \((i,j)\) and a Bool choice as specified.

We want to enumerate some small \((m,n)\), and for each, try some bounded \(k\), to find such a sequence or rule out its existence. The toggling step acts on a \(2\times 2\) block defined by \((i,j)\) and affects four entries via toggling, but the toggling pattern depends on the choice bool and neighboring toggles.

We'll write code that for small \(m,n\) tries to build sequences of functions \(f(l)\), verifying the described toggling condition, to test reachability from all-false to all-true states, and print pairs \((m,n)\) for which the sequence exists.

Because exhaustive checking is huge, we limit to small grids \(m,n \leq 4\) and small \(k \leq 10\), printing candidates as found.

```python
# Enumerate small m,n to test toggling sequences from all-false to all-true
# under the given toggle rules. We represent f(l) as 2D boolean grids
# and each step toggles a 2x2 block with a choice bool affecting toggling pattern.

def toggle_block(grid, i, j, choice):
    # grid: list of list of bools size m x n
    # toggling pattern on 2x2 block at indices i, i+1 and j, j+1 (zero-based)
    # pattern per problem: toggles four positions with choice affecting two toggles
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    # Positions affected:
    # (i, j), (i+1, j+1) toggled always
    # (i, j+1), (i+1, j) toggled depending on choice:
    # If choice == True, toggle (i, j+1), else toggle (i+1, j)
    new_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]
    # toggle (i,j)
    new_grid[i][j] = not new_grid[i][j]
    # toggle (i+1,j+1)
    new_grid[i+1][j+1] = not new_grid[i+1][j+1]
    # toggle one depending on choice
    if choice:
        new_grid[i][j+1] = not new_grid[i][j+1]
    else:
        new_grid[i+1][j] = not new_grid[i+1][j]
    return new_grid
