The problem involves evaluating or approximating the floor of (2002)! divided by the sum of factorials from 1! to 2001!. Direct computation of such huge factorials is not feasible, so let's try smaller values to detect a pattern and conjecture the answer for n=2002. 

We'll consider n from 3 upward, compute floor((n)! / sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i!), and print results. This might highlight a pattern or closed form.

```python
import math

def factorial(n):
    return math.factorial(n)

def sum_factorials(u):
    s = 0
    for i in range(1, u+1):
        s += factorial(i)
    return s

# We try a few sample values of n for the problem:
# floor(n! / sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i!)
print("n, floor(n! / sum(i=1 to n-1) i!)")

for n in range(3, 21): 
    numerator = factorial(n)
    denominator = sum_factorials(n-1)
    val = numerator // denominator
    print(f"{n}, {val}")
```
