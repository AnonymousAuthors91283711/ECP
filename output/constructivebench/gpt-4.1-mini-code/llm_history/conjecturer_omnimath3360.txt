noncomputable abbrev omnimath3360_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3360 : 
  ∃! x, x * ⌊x * ⌊x * ⌊x * ⌊x⌋⌋⌋⌋ = 122 ∧ x = omnimath3360_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Searching rationals x = p/q with denominators <= 20 and numerators roughly in [1..200]
No exact rational solutions found with denominators <= 20. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<(122 : ℝ)^(1/5)>>>

Explanation: The nested floor expression suggests x multiplied repeatedly 5 times, so x^5 ≈122, solving x^5=122 gives x=122^(1/5). This root is unique and real.
