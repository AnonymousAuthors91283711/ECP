The problem involves variables \(a, b, c \geq 0\) with sum 3, and we want to explore the expression:

\[
S = \frac{a}{b^2 + 1} + \frac{b}{c^2 + 1} + \frac{c}{a^2 + 1}.
\]

We want to find the possible minimum value of \(S\).

We will enumerate triples \((a,b,c)\) where \(a,b,c \geq 0\) and \(a+b+c=3\), use a small step since values are continuous, and print values of \(S\). We guess the minimum. Since the problem is symmetric and constrained, likely minimum is at boundary or some special points.

We'll discretize \(a,b\), and find \(c=3-a-b\) when nonnegative. Then compute and print \(S\).

```python
# Enumerate triples (a,b,c) with a,b,c>=0, a+b+c=3, step=0.3 for efficiency
# Print value of S = a/(b^2+1) + b/(c^2+1) + c/(a^2+1)
# Print parameters and S for conjecture

def S(a, b, c):
    return a/(b**2 + 1) + b/(c**2 + 1) + c/(a**2 + 1)

step = 0.3
threshold = 400  # max outputs (should not reach)
count = 0
min_val = None
min_triplet = None

print("Enumerating (a,b,c) with a,b,c>=0, a+b+c=3:")
for i in range(int(3/step)+1):
    a = round(i*step,4)
    for j in range(int((3 - a)/step)+1):
        b = round(j*step,4)
        c = 3 - a - b
        if c < 0:
            continue
        val = S(a,b,c)
        print(f"a={a:.3f}, b={b:.3f}, c={c:.3f} => S={val:.6f}")
        if (min_val is None) or (val < min_val):
            min_val = val
            min_triplet = (a,b,c)
        count += 1
        if count >= threshold:
            break
    if count >= threshold:
        break

print(f"\nMinimum S found: {min_val:.6f} at a,b,c = {min_triplet}")
```
