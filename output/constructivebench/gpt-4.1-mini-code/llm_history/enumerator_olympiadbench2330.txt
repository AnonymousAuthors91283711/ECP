The problem asks to find all triples \((x,y,z) \in \mathbb{R}^3\) satisfying the system:
\[
(x - 1)(y - 2) = 0, \quad (x - 3)(z + 2) = 0, \quad x + yz = 9.
\]

This means either \(x=1\) or \(y=2\), and either \(x=3\) or \(z=-2\).

We'll enumerate all four combinations given by those cases and solve for the remaining variables, printing exact solutions as tuples.

```python
# Enumerate all (x,y,z) satisfying:
# (x-1)(y-2)=0 and (x-3)(z+2)=0 and x + y*z = 9

print("Solutions (x,y,z):")

# Case 1: x=1, x=3 not both possible, so:
# (x=1 OR y=2) and (x=3 OR z=-2)

# We'll check each combo:

# combo 1: x=1 and x=3 => x can't be both 1 and 3, so no
# combo 2: x=1 and z=-2
x = 1
z = -2
# Need (x-1)*(y-2)=0 => (1-1)*(y-2)=0 -> 0*(y-2)=0 always true, so y any real
# x + y*z = 9 => 1 + y*(-2) =9 => 1 - 2y =9 => -2y=8 => y=-4
print((x, -4, z))

# combo 3: y=2 and x=3
y = 2
x = 3
# (x-3)*(z+2)=0 => (3-3)*(z+2)=0 => 0*(z+2)=0 always true, so z any real
# x + y*z =9 => 3 + 2*z =9 => 2*z=6 => z=3
print((x, y, 3))

# combo 4: y=2 and z=-2
y = 2
z = -2
# (x-1)*(y-2)=0 => (x-1)*0=0 always true
# (x-3)*(z+2)=0 => (x-3)*0=0 always true
# x + y*z=9 => x + 2*(-2) =9 => x -4=9 => x=13
print((13, y, z))
```
