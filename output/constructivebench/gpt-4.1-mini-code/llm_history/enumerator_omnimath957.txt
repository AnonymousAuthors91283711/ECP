The problem appears to be about finding the minimal positive integer \( b \) such that the ratio of pairs of the same color to total pairs is exactly \( \frac{1}{5} \), where:

- Total elements: \( 6 + b \)
- Same color pairs: \( 3 + \binom{b}{2} \)
- The ratio: \(\frac{3 + \binom{b}{2}}{\binom{6 + b}{2}} = \frac{1}{5}\)

We need to find the smallest \( b > 0 \) satisfying the equation.

I'll write a Python program that iterates over integer values of \( b \) and checks when the equality holds exactly (using integer arithmetic and fractions to avoid floating-point errors). The program will print each \( b \) tried, and whenever the condition is met, it prints the candidate and stops after printing minimal candidates.

```python
from math import comb
from fractions import Fraction

# Iterate over candidate values for b
for b in range(1, 50):
    total = 6 + b
    same_color_pairs = 3 + comb(b, 2)
    total_pairs = comb(total, 2)
    ratio = Fraction(same_color_pairs, total_pairs)
    print(f"b={b}, ratio={ratio}")
    if ratio == Fraction(1, 5):
        print(f"Candidate b with ratio 1/5 found: {b}")
        # Since looking for minimal, break on first found
        break
```
This enumerates \( b \), prints the ratio as a fraction, and prints the answer(s).
