Ground Truth Answer: Real.sqrt 7
Proposed Answer: (2 : ℝ)
Let me analyze this problem and the answers carefully.

The problem is asking for the least value of t = z.im / z.re where z is a complex number in the first quadrant (since both real and imaginary parts are non-negative) satisfying |z² + 2| ≤ |z|.

The ground truth answer is √7, while the proposed answer is 2.

To check equivalence:
1. First, note that √7 ≈ 2.64575, which is not equal to 2.
2. The correct minimal ratio can be derived by parameterizing z = x + iy (x,y ≥ 0) and solving the inequality constraint, which indeed leads to √7 as the minimal ratio.

The proposed answer of 2 is incorrect as it doesn't satisfy the problem's conditions as the minimal value. The correct minimal ratio is indeed √7.

<<<False>>>
