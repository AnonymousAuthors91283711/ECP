The problem seems to involve counting arrangements related to choosing k=5 fingers out of 4 types with repetition allowed (stars and bars), factorial permutations of those choices, and a power from n=8 choices. Our goal is to enumerate possible values and identify the final count.

```python
from math import comb, factorial

def count_arrangements(n=8, k=5, fingers=4):
    # Number of multisets of size k from fingers types
    multisets = comb(fingers + k - 1, k)
    # Permutations of k elements
    perms = factorial(k)
    # n^k choices (possibly assignments)
    power = n ** k
    total = multisets * perms * power
    print(f"Parameters: n={n}, k={k}, fingers={fingers}")
    print(f"Multisets (C({fingers + k -1},{k})) = {multisets}")
    print(f"Permutations (k!) = {perms}")
    print(f"Power (n^k) = {power}")
    print("Total count =", total)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    count_arrangements()
```
