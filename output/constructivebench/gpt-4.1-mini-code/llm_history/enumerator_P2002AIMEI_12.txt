The problem defines a sequence \( z_n \) in \(\mathbb{C}\) by iterating a MÃ¶bius transformation \( F(z) = \frac{z + i}{z - i} \) starting from \( z_0 = \frac{1}{137} + i \). We want to find the real numbers \( a, b \) such that \( z_{2002} = a + bi \), and compute \( a + b \).

To conjecture \( a + b \), we can:
- Iterate the sequence for several \( n \) values
- Extract the real and imaginary parts of \( z_n \)
- Print \( a + b \) for those \( n \), including \( n=2002 \)

We'll use fractions if possible for exact values, but since the function involves complex division, floating point will be used. We stream all \( a + b \) for \( n = 0,1,2,\ldots,2002 \) by steps (like every 200 steps) for brevity, then output the value at 2002.

```python
# Enumerate values of a + b where z_n = a + b i,
# for iteration n of z_{n+1} = F(z_n), F(z) = (z + i)/(z - i).
# Start from z_0 = 1/137 + i, print partial results and final answer at n=2002.

def main():
    i = complex(0,1)
    z = 1/137 + i

    # Iterate up to 2002
    for n in range(2003):
        a, b = z.real, z.imag
        s = a + b
        # Print every 200 steps and for n=2002
        if n % 200 == 0 or n == 2002:
            print(f"n={n}, a={a:.10f}, b={b:.10f}, a+b={s:.10f}")
        # Compute next
        if n < 2002:
            # Avoid division by zero if z == i
            denom = z - i
            if denom == 0:
                print(f"Division by zero at n={n}")
                break
            z = (z + i) / denom

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
