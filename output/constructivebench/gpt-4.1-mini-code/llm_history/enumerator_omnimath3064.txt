The problem defines a sequence starting with term1 = 3, and each subsequent term is calculated by adding step(m) + 1 to the current term m, where step(m) = m/2 if m is even, else m + 1.

We want to enumerate the terms term2 through term5 and see what term5 equals. This can help conjecture what omnimath3064_answer should be.

```python
def step(m):
    if m % 2 == 0:
        return m // 2
    else:
        return m + 1

def next_term(m):
    return m + step(m) + 1

term1 = 3
print(f"term1 = {term1}")

term2 = next_term(term1)
print(f"term2 = {term2}")

term3 = next_term(term2)
print(f"term3 = {term3}")

term4 = next_term(term3)
print(f"term4 = {term4}")

term5 = next_term(term4)
print(f"term5 = {term5}")
```
