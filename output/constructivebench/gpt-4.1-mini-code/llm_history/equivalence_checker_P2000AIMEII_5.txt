Ground Truth Answer: 376
Proposed Answer: 220200960
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem appears to be about counting certain arrangements (likely related to combinations and permutations) with specific parameters (n=8, k=5, fingers=4).

2. The ground truth answer is 376, which is a 3-digit number.

3. The proposed answer is 220200960, which is a 9-digit number.

4. The theorem statement suggests we're only interested in the last 3 digits of the count (digits.reverse.take 3), but the proposed answer is giving the full count.

5. The proposed answer is clearly much larger than the ground truth answer and doesn't match in any way.
