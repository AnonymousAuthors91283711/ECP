The problem involves polynomials \(f\) and \(g\) with degree 2014 satisfying a condition on their evaluations at integers from 1 to 4030:

\[
f(n) + (-1)^n g(n) = 2^n, \quad n=1,2,\dots,4030.
\]

The goal is to find the coefficient of \(x^{2014}\) in \(g\).

To explore this, I will:

- Enumerate values \(n=1\) to 20 (small sample) to understand the pattern \(f(n) + (-1)^n g(n) = 2^n\).
- Assume \(f\) and \(g\) are degree \(\leq 2014\) polynomials.
- Try linear algebra approach: model coefficient vectors of \(f\) and \(g\) as unknowns.
- Since two polynomials evaluated on alternating sums yield powers of two, decompose sums to system with Vandermonde matrices.
- Enumerate the theoretical constraints and attempt to solve or approximate the leading coefficients.
- We'll try polynomials \(p(n) = f(n) + g(n)\) (for even \(n\)) and \(q(n) = f(n) - g(n)\) (for odd \(n\)), and relate to powers of two.

This program will print candidate leading coefficients of \(g\) based on small samples, to conjecture \(\text{coeff}_{2014}(g)\).

```python
import numpy as np

def vandermonde_matrix(x, deg):
    # Create Vandermonde matrix for x up to degree deg (highest degree term first)
    return np.vander(x, N=deg+1, increasing=False)

def main():
    deg = 2014
    # Use first few values (e.g. n=1..2*deg for enough info)
    Ns = np.arange(1, 2*deg+1)  # 1 to 4028 (close to 4030)
    
    # Build left side matrix for f and g coefficients:
    # Condition: f(n) + (-1)^n g(n) = 2^n
    # f and g have same degree deg
    # Let f_coeffs, g_coeffs be unknown coefficient vectors (length deg+1)
    # Then evaluation f(n) = dot(f_coeffs, n^k), k=deg..0
    # Similarly for g(n)
    
    # Let's build matrix A and vector b where:
    # A @ [f_coeffs; g_coeffs] = b
    # Each row:
    # V_f(n) for f_coeffs + (-1)^n * V_g(n) for g_coeffs = 2^n
    
    V = vandermonde_matrix(Ns, deg)  # shape (len(Ns), deg+1)
    
    # Form combined matrix with columns for f_coeffs then g_coeffs
    A = np.hstack([V, V * np.power(-1, Ns).reshape(-1,1)])
    b = 2**Ns
    
    # Solve least squares since system is large and possibly ill-conditioned
    sol, residuals, rank, s = np.linalg.lstsq(A, b, rcond=None)
    
    f_coeffs = sol[:deg+1]
    g_coeffs = sol[deg+1:]
    
    # Print some leading coefficients for g (highest degree terms)
    print("Sampled leading coefficients of g:")
    for i, c in enumerate(g_coeffs[:5]):
        print(f"g_coeff_{deg - i} = {c}")
        
    # Return the top-degree term conjecture
    print(f"Conjectured g.coeff_{deg} â‰ˆ {g_coeffs[0]}")
