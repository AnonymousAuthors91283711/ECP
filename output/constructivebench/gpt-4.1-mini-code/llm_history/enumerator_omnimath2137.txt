The problem involves summing the length of base-4 representations of numbers from 1 to 2013. Let's write a Python program that enumerates the lengths of base-4 digit representations for these numbers, printing lengths as they are computed, and finally summing them up.

```python
def base4_length(n):
    # Length of n in base 4 is 1 + floor(log4(n)), or count of digits by repeated division
    length = 0
    x = n
    while x > 0:
        x //= 4
        length += 1
    return length

def main():
    total_length = 0
    # Enumerate numbers 1 through 2013
    for i in range(1, 2014):
        length = base4_length(i)
        print(f"Number: {i}, base-4 length: {length}")
        total_length += length
    print(f"Sum of digits lengths (1 to 2013) in base 4 = {total_length}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
