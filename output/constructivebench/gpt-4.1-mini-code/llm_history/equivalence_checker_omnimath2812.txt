abbrev omnimath2812_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2812 :
  (let x : ℝ := 2;
   (x + 2 - x) * (2 - x - 2) = omnimath2812_answer) :=
sorry

Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: -4
<<<True>>>
The problem simplifies to (2 + 2 - 2) * (2 - 2 - 2) = (2) * (-2) = -4, which matches the proposed answer. The ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (a placeholder in Lean), so we can only evaluate the proposed answer's correctness based on the given expression. The proposed answer correctly evaluates the expression.
