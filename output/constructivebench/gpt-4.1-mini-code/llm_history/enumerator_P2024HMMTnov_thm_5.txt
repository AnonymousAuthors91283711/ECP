The problem is to find the greatest sum \( s \) of a subset of numbers \( k \in \{0,1,\ldots,100\} \) selected by a function \( f \) with values in \(\{True, False\}\), subject to:

- If \( f(k) = True \), then \( k \leq 100 \).
- For each \( k \) with \( f(k) = True \), every \( i \in [k+1, 2k) \) satisfies \( f(i) = False \).

We want to find the maximal sum of such a subset.

Observing the constraint, for each chosen number \( k \), the interval from \( k+1 \) up to (but not including) \( 2k \) must not contain any chosen number.

This is a kind of "exclusion" or "gap" condition between chosen numbers.

The problem reduces to finding a subset of \(\{0,...,100\}\) satisfying the above and maximizing the sum.

I will write a Python program that enumerates subsets in a smart way (e.g., backtracking with pruning), printing partial sums as candidates are found.

Because the problem space is large, we limit to choosing numbers up to 100, and prune quickly.

We define a recursive solver that tries to pick or skip each number in increasing order, checking the exclusion condition.

We print each candidate sum found, and finally print the largest sum found.

```python
# Enumerate sums of subsets S of {0,...,100} satisfying:
# For each k in S:
#   all i in [k+1, 2k) not in S.
# Find maximum sum of such subsets.

def main():
    max_k = 100
    max_sum = -1
    # To avoid repeats, we select numbers in increasing order.
    # For each candidate, we keep track of forbidden indices due to previously chosen elements
    
    forbidden = [False]*(max_k+1)
    
    # We use backtracking with current index and current sum and forbidden list.
    # Because 0 leads to an empty range, we should handle it.
    
    # To prune, we can also keep track of the maximal remaining sum - but here we just do a simple approach.
    
    best_sums = []
    
    def backtrack(i, curr_sum, forbidden):
        nonlocal max_sum
        if i > max_k:
            if curr_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = curr_sum
                print(f"New max sum found: {max_sum}")
            return
        # Try skipping i
        backtrack(i+1, curr_sum, forbidden)
        # Try choosing i if allowed
        if not forbidden[i]:
            # Choosing i forbids [i+1, 2i)
            new_forbidden = forbidden[:]
            start = i+1
            end = min(2*i, max_k+1)
            for x in range(start, end):
                new_forbidden[x] = True
            backtrack(i+1, curr_sum + i, new_forbidden)
    
    backtrack(0,0,forbidden)
    print(f"Maximum sum: {max_sum}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
