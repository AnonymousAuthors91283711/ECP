The problem involves finding the greatest finite cardinal \( n \) of a set \( V \) with a relation \( E: V \to V \to \textrm{Prop} \), such that for every distinct triple \((A,B,C)\) in \( V \), exactly one of the three cyclic edge conditions holds. This condition models a tournament with the 3-cycle property on every distinct triple.

We want to enumerate candidate sizes \( n \) for small \( n \), and check if such a relation \( E \) exists that satisfies the condition. The property states: for every distinct triple \((A,B,C)\), exactly one of these patterns on edges holds:

1. \(E(A,B) \wedge \neg E(B,C) \wedge \neg E(C,A)\),
2. \(\neg E(A,B) \wedge E(B,C) \wedge \neg E(C,A)\), or
3. \(\neg E(A,B) \wedge \neg E(B,C) \wedge E(C,A)\).

Intuitively, this ordering is reminiscent of cyclic orders or structures related to tournaments with special constraints.

The program will:
- Iterate over small set sizes \( n \) (e.g., up to 7 or 8).
- Enumerate all edge relations \( E \) (orientations) on \( n \).
- For each \( E \), check the property for all triples.
- Print all \( n \) for which such an \( E \) is found.

Due to complexity, we'll only enumerate sets up to 5 or 6 elements for feasibility and efficiency.

    # Check for every triple (a,b,c) of distinct vertices the condition:
    # Exactly one of:

        # Because the condition cycles through (a,b,c) order, only one of them
        # each must hold, but triples are unordered sets, so must verify all 6 permutations
        # Instead, we can fix order (a,b,c) as is since the problem states A,B,C distinct.

        # with that ordering (A,B,C), exactly one of the three conditions holds:
        # So for the triple (a,b,c) exactly one of the three pattern holds:
        # Compute truth values
        # Use presence or absence of edges in edges_set
