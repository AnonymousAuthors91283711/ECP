[write_program]
The problem involves finding the least natural number \( n \) such that for every function \( f : \text{Fin } n \to \text{Fin } 10 \to \text{Bool} \), there exists a subset \( s \subseteq \text{Fin } n \) with 57 elements and two indices \( i, j \in \text{Fin } 10 \) satisfying either all \( f(x,i) = f(x,j) \) or all \( f(x,i) \neq f(x,j) \).

We will write a Python program to explore small values of \( n \) by enumerating functions \( f: \{0,\dots,n-1\} \times \{0,\dots,9\} \to \{False, True\} \) and checking whether such a subset and indices exist.

Given the huge search space, we will fix small \( n \) values (e.g., \( n=57,58,59 \)) and try random samples or partial enumerations. We'll print the current \( n \) being checked and any discovered subset and indices that satisfy the condition, to aid in conjectures about the minimal \( n \).

```python
# We consider functions f: [n] x [10] -> {False, True}
# For a fixed n, we try to find whether for all such functions, there exists a subset s of size 57
# and i,j in [10] such that either f(x,i)=f(x,j) for all x in s, or f(x,i)!=f(x,j) for all x in s.
# Due to enormous search space, we instead sample functions and try to find counterexamples or supporting examples.

import itertools
import random

def check_condition(n):
    # For random functions f: [n] x [10] -> {False, True}, check if there's s, i, j meeting the conditions.
    # We attempt to find a counterexample function f for which no such s,i,j exist.
    # If we find such f, print it and return False.
    # Otherwise, after many tries, print supporting evidence.

    indices = list(range(10))
    tries = 1000  # number of random functions to test

    for t in range(tries):
        # Generate random f: dict (x,i) -> bool
        f = {(x,i): random.choice([False,True]) for x in range(n) for i in indices}

        # Try all pairs i,j with i < j
        found = False

                # For efficiency, sample several subsets.
