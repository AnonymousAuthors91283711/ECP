[write_program]
The problem statement is very sparse, but it appears to relate to evaluating or conjecturing about an expression involving the absolute value |0 - 2| = 2. To assist, I'll write a Python program that enumerates absolute differences |a - b| for small integer values a,b and prints exact values immediately, helping to observe patterns or conjecture formulas. Since |0 - 2| = 2 is given, let's consider other values around it.

```python
# Enumerate absolute differences |a - b| for small integers a,b in range[-3,3]
# Print results immediately for pattern observation.

def main():
    print("Enumerating |a - b| for a,b in [-3..3]:")
    for a in range(-3, 4):
        for b in range(-3, 4):
            val = abs(a - b)
            print(f"|{a} - {b}| = {val}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
