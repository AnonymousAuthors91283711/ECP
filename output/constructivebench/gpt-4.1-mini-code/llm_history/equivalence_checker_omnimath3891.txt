Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {(a,b,c) | 1 < a ∧ a < b ∧ b < c ∧ c = a * b ∧ (a - 1) * (b - 1) * (c - 1) ∣ a * b * c - 1}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer restricts the solution set to triples where c = a * b, which is a subset of the general condition given in the problem statement. While this subset does satisfy the divisibility condition (as can be verified by substitution), it doesn't cover all possible solutions where c ≠ a * b. Therefore, the proposed answer is partially correct but incomplete.
