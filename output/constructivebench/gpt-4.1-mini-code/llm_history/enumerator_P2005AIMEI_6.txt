The problem is about a quartic polynomial with real coefficients, and we need to find the product of its non-real roots and then the floor of the real part of that product.

We have the polynomial:
p(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x - 2005

To explore this in Python, we can:
- Find roots of the polynomial using numpy's roots function.
- Identify non-real roots, multiply them, and output the floor of the real part of the product.
- Print the product and its floor immediately.

Let's write a script that does the above and prints the results.

```python
import numpy as np
from math import floor

# Define polynomial coefficients for x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 -4x - 2005
coeffs = [1, -4, 6, -4, -2005]

# Find all roots
roots = np.roots(coeffs)

product_nonreal = 1+0j
count_nonreal = 0

print("Polynomial: x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x - 2005")
print("All roots found:")
for r in roots:
    print(f"root: {r}")
    if abs(r.imag) > 1e-12:
        product_nonreal *= r
        count_nonreal += 1
        # Print intermediate product (for streaming results)
        print(f"Non-real root included, current product: {product_nonreal}")

if count_nonreal == 0:
    print("No non-real roots found.")
else:
    print(f"Product of non-real roots: {product_nonreal}")
    real_part_floor = floor(product_nonreal.real)
    print(f"Floor of the real part of the product: {real_part_floor}")
```

This code enumerates all roots, identifies the complex roots, prints each immediately, accumulates their product, and finally prints the floor of the real part of that product. This matches the problem requirements and can help conjecture the exact value.
