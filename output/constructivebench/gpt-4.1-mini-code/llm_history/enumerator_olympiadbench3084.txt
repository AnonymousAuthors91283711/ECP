The problem implicitly defines a function \( f: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{N} \) satisfying the recurrence:
\[
\forall n \in \mathbb{Z},\quad f(n) = f(n-1) \times f(n-2)
\]
with positivity for positive \( n \), and conditions relating \( f(1) \) and \( f(2) \):
\[
f(1) = \frac{f(2)}{512}, \quad \frac{1}{f(1)} = 2 \times f(2).
\]

We want to find possible \( f(1), f(2) \in \mathbb{N} \) that satisfy these rational constraints and then compute \( f(f(4)) \).

Because the function relies on a multiplicative form involving previous two values, it resembles a nonlinear recurrence. The code will test plausible positive integer pairs \( (f(1), f(2)) \) compatible with the given equations, generate the sequence for \( n=3,4 \), and output \( (f(1), f(2), f(f(4))) \) when valid.

```python
# Enumerate candidates for f(1), f(2) satisfying:
# f(1) = f(2)/512 and 1/f(1) = 2*f(2)
# From these:
# f(1) = f(2)/512 => f(2) = 512*f(1)
# 1/f(1) = 2*f(2) => 1/f(1) = 2*512*f(1) => 1/f(1) = 1024*f(1)
# => 1 = 1024*f(1)^2 => f(1)^2 = 1/1024, so f(1) = 1/32 (not integer)
# But f: Z -> N, so possibly we must consider rational f(1), f(2) or re-check assumptions

# The problem says f:Z -> N, so likely no integer f(1) fits exactly.
# Instead, try to find integers f(1), f(2) where
# f(1) = f(2)/512 and 1/f(1) = 2*f(2) approximately hold,
# or sqrt values to rationalize.

# We'll try integer f(2) divisible by 512 and check both equalities.

The original program tries to find integer values f(1), f(2) satisfying the system from the problem. However, from the algebraic manipulations, f(1) must satisfy f(1)^2 = 1/1024, which is 1/32 as a fraction, not an integer. Since f maps integers to natural numbers (positive integers), there can be no integer f(1) that satisfies these equalities exactly. The program attempts to find approximate integer solutions by enumerating multiples of 512 for f(2) but no exact match occurs, so it produces no output.

The problem’s conditions imply f(1), f(2) might not be integers but the problem requires f : ℤ → ℕ, hence f(n) to be natural numbers, so likely there is a different interpretation or a greater structure.

Notably, the recurrence f(n) = f(n-1) * f(n-2) with positive values f(n) resembles the term-wise product sequence. Normally, such a recurrence doesn’t correspond to the standard Fibonacci addition recurrence, but their values may be related by logarithms: perhaps taking logarithms would reduce to the Fibonacci recursion.

Indeed, define g(n) = log f(n), then

g(n) = g(n-1) + g(n-2)

which matches the Fibonacci recurrence. Then g(n) = A F_{n} + B F_{n-1} for some constants A,B with F_n the Fibonacci numbers. Using the initial values conditions on f(1), f(2) should fix A and B.

Hence f(n) = exp(g(n)) = exp(A F_n + B F_{n-1}) = (exp A)^{F_n} * (exp B)^{F_{n-1}} = c^{F_n} d^{F_{n-1}} for c,d >0.

We can rewrite functions of the form f(n) = a^{F_n} * b^{F_{n-1}} for constants a,b >0 and F_n Fibonacci numbers with indices n starting at 1.

Then check the initial conditions to find a,b and see what is f(f(4)).

Since the problem’s domain and codomain are ℤ → ℕ, and the problem asks for f(f(4)) = ?, enumerating all solutions is hard. But we can implement the logarithmic approach to compute f(n) up
[refine_program]
The problem is a nontrivial functional equation over integers with conditions on positivity and specific equalities involving function values and their inverses as rationals. The original submission provides no program and just the problem, so it cannot be accepted.

We need to write a Python program that enumerates possible functions f: ℤ → ℕ satisfying the recurrence and given conditions, or at least attempts to find such f values consistent with constraints.

Observations:
- The function satisfies f(n) = f(n-1) * f(n-2) for all integers n.
- For positive n, f(n) > 0.
- f(1) = f(2) / 512
- (1 / f(1)) = 2 * f(2)
  From this, 1/f(1) = 2*f(2) ⇒ f(1) = 1/(2*f(2))
- Combine with f(1) = f(2)/512 ⇒ f(2)/512 = 1/(2*f(2)) ⇒ Cross multiply: f(2)^2 = 256, so f(2) =16
- Then f(1) = f(2)/512 = 16 / 512 = 1/32. But f(1) ∈ ℕ, so 1/32 is not a natural. There's contradiction unless the function outputs rationals.

But f is defined from ℤ to ℕ. The condition (1/f(1)) = 2*f(2) is rational equality, so f(1) = 1/(2*f(2)) (rational, but must be natural). So contradictions here unless the problem is misunderstood or the function output is ℕ but stored in a different way.

Given the problem is in Lean (Mathlib), but we must write Python program to enumerate possible natural values f(n).

Given the complicated functional equation and the relation between f(1) and f(2), the program will enumerate small values for f(2), compute f(1) from condition, reject if f(1) not integer natural, then build f(3), f(4), ... from recurrence and check that f is positive at positive indices.

To keep token and complexity down, we'll try f(2) from 1 to 100, calculate f(1), check it is natural (integer and > 0), then iterate recurrence forward, print f
