[write_program]
The problem is about expressing 2008 as a signed sum of distinct powers of two, with coefficients ±1, and the sum of the exponents (the ns) being minimal or specific. We want to find all such representations and particularly the sum of the exponents. The program enumerates candidate sets of exponents and sign patterns to find these sums.

```python
# Enumerate representations of 2008 as sum of ± 2^n with distinct n,
# outputting n-lists and signs satisfying sum of coefficients * 2^n = 2008.
# Also output the sum of exponents for each representation found.

def powers_of_two_up_to(n):
    p = []
    i = 0
    while (1 << i) <= n:
        p.append(1 << i)
        i += 1
    return p

target = 2008
p2 = powers_of_two_up_to(target * 2)  # powers of two up to > 2008

max_len = 12  # heuristic limit on size of ns for speed
from itertools import combinations, product

found_sums = set()

print(f"Target: {target}")
print(f"Powers up to 2^{len(p2)-1}: {p2}")

# Enumerate subsets of powers up to max_len elements
for r in range(1, max_len + 1):
    # combinations of indices that choose distinct exponents in descending order
    for ns_indices in combinations(range(len(p2)), r):
        ns = sorted(ns_indices, reverse=True)
        # Try all sign assignments ±1
        for signs in product([1,-1], repeat=r):
            s = sum(sign * (1 << n) for sign, n in zip(signs, ns))
            if s == target:
                sum_ns = sum(ns)
                if sum_ns not in found_sums:
                    found_sums.add(sum_ns)
                    # output the result with exact exponents and signs
                    signs_str = ['+' if x==1 else '-' for x in signs]
                    print(f"r={r}, ns={ns}, signs={signs_str}, sum(ns)={sum_ns}")
# Output minimal sum of exponents found
if found_sums:
    min_sum = min(found_sums)
    print(f"Minimal sum of exponents: {min_sum}")
else:
    print("No representations found")
```
