The problem involves finding the greatest natural number \( n \in [1,6] \) such that for every function \( \text{bob\_moves}: \mathbb{N} \to [1,6] \), there exists a function \( \text{alex\_moves}: \mathbb{N} \to [1,6] \) and an index \( m \in \mathbb{N} \) satisfying certain sum constraints related to the number 30.

We will attempt to enumerate possible \( n \) values from 1 to 6 and try to experimentally determine which values satisfy the property using a brute-force approach on small move sequences to get insight and conjecture the greatest \( n \).

```python
# enumerator.py
# Enumerate n in [1..6], simulate some bob_moves and try to find alex_moves to satisfy the conditions
# Print each n and whether we found satisfying moves for some samples.

from itertools import product

def check_n(n, max_moves=4):
    # bob_moves: map N -> [1..6], we try all bob_moves sequences of length up to max_moves
    # alex_moves similarly. We check if for all bob_moves sequences there exists alex_moves and m 
    # with sums matching the conditions
    values = list(range(1,7))
    # Generate all bob_moves sequences of length up to max_moves
    # For feasibility limit max_moves=3 to keep output compact
    for length in range(1, max_moves+1):
        bob_sequences = product(values, repeat=length)
        for bseq in bob_sequences:
            found_alex = False
            # Try all alex_sequences of same length or one longer (since m can be length or length-1)
            for m in range(length):
                # m is index for summation, so alex_moves needs m+1 moves
                max_a_len = m+1
                alex_sequences = product(values, repeat=max_a_len)
                for aseq in alex_sequences:
                    sum_bob_alex = sum(bseq[:m]) + sum(aseq[:m])
                    total_sum = sum_bob_alex + n
                    cond1 = (total_sum == 30)
                    cond2 = (total_sum + aseq[m] == 30 if m < len(aseq) else False)
                    if cond1 and cond2:
                        # condition met for this sequence and m
                        found_alex = True
                        break
                if found_alex:
                    break
            if not found_alex:
                # for this bob sequence no alex sequence satisfies conditions
                print(f"n={n} fails at bob_moves={bseq!r}")
                return False
    print(f"n={n} passes tested cases.")
    return True

def main():
    candidates = []
    for n in range(1,7):
        print(f"Testing n={n} ...")
        if check_n(n):
            candidates.append(n)

    if candidates:
        max_n = max(candidates)
        print(f"Candidates passing tests: {candidates}")
        print(f"Greatest candidate n = {max_n}")
