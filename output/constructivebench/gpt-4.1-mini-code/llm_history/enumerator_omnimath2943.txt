This problem is about choosing seven values \( p_i \) each either 3.71 or 3.72 such that their sum equals 26, and then finding how many of the seven values are equal to 3.72.

Given that the values are restricted and the sum is fixed, we can enumerate all possible assignments of 3.71 and 3.72 for the 7 positions to check which ones satisfy the sum condition. For each valid assignment, we calculate how many 3.72's it contains and print it out. We then find the common counts among all valid solutions.

We'll enumerate the number of 3.72's from 0 to 7, then check if the sum matches 26 given that number, since sum depends only on the count of 3.72 due to linearity.

```python
# Enumerate possible counts of 3.72 in 7 elements so sum is 26
# Given n = number of 3.72's, (7 - n) number of 3.71's
# sum = n*3.72 + (7 - n)*3.71 = 26
# => n*3.72 + 7*3.71 - n*3.71 = 26
# => n*(3.72 - 3.71) + 7*3.71 = 26
# => n*0.01 + 7*3.71 = 26
# => n*0.01 = 26 - 7*3.71
# => n = (26 - 7*3.71) / 0.01

def main():
    total_elements = 7
    val1 = 3.71
    val2 = 3.72
    target_sum = 26

    # Let's compute n:
    base_sum = total_elements * val1  # 7*3.71
    diff = target_sum - base_sum
    n_possible = diff / (val2 - val1)  # number of 3.72's

    print(f"Parameters: total_elements={total_elements}, val1={val1}, val2={val2}, target_sum={target_sum}")
    print(f"Calculated number of 3.72's: {n_possible}")

    # Since n_possible should be integer between 0 and 7, check that:
    if n_possible.is_integer() and 0 <= n_possible <= total_elements:
        n_int = int(n_possible)
        # Enumerate all placements with n_int times val2 and (7 - n_int) times val1
        # Number of arrangements doesn't affect the count of 3.72's so all valid have this count
        print(f"Number of 3.72's in a valid solution: {n_int}")
    else:
        print("No valid integer number of 3.72's found")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
