Ground Truth Answer: fun (a, b, c) => 37
Proposed Answer: fun p : ℕ × ℕ × ℕ =>
  let (a, b, c) := p;
  -- The process converges to 0 in the minimal coordinate after exactly a + b + c - 42 steps
  a + b + c - 42
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes an iterative process where in each step, we subtract (sum of other two coordinates + 1) from the largest coordinate. This continues until one coordinate becomes zero.

2. For the specific case given (a=15, b=14, c=13), the ground truth answer is 37.

3. The proposed answer suggests a general formula: a + b + c - 42.

For the specific case (15,14,13):
- Ground truth: 37
- Proposed: 15 + 14 + 13 - 42 = 0

These clearly don't match (37 ≠ 0). The proposed answer is incorrect for the given case, and likely incorrect in general as it doesn't match the behavior described in the problem.
