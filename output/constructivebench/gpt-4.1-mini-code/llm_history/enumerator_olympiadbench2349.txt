The problem asks to evaluate the sum of (sin(π(k+1)/180))^6 for k from 0 to 88, i.e., the sum of sin^6 of angles from π/180 to 89π/180 in increments of π/180 (degrees from 1° to 89°).

We want to find a rational number (integer numerator/denominator) equal to this sum. The direct numerical sum could be approximated, but the problem hints for an exact form as a rational.

To assist in conjecturing, we enumerate the sum and print the partial sum and its simplified rational approximation with a limit on denominator to detect patterns.

We print the sum as each term adds, and then print the final approximation. This helps in guessing numerator and denominator.

```python
import math
from fractions import Fraction

def sin6_theta(theta_rad):
    # Compute sin(theta)^6 exactly using math.sin and float power
    return math.sin(theta_rad) ** 6

def approx_fraction(x, max_den=10**6):
    # Approximate float x by fraction with denominator <= max_den
    return Fraction(x).limit_denominator(max_den)

def main():
    n = 89
    total = 0.0
    print("k | angle (deg) | sin^6(angle) | partial sum | approx fraction")
    for k in range(n):
        angle_deg = k + 1
        angle_rad = math.pi * angle_deg / 180
        val = sin6_theta(angle_rad)
        total += val
        approx = approx_fraction(total)
        print(f"{k+1:2d} | {angle_deg:3d}°       | {val:.9f}  | {total:.9f} | {approx} ≈ {float(approx):.9f}")
    # Final output
    final_approx = approx_fraction(total)
    print("\nFinal sum approximation as fraction:")
    print(f"Numerator: {final_approx.numerator}, Denominator: {final_approx.denominator}")
    print(f"Decimal value: {float(final_approx):.12f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
