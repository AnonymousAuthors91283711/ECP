abbrev omnimath3299_answer : Prop := sorry
theorem omnimath3299 : omnimath3299_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating integer pairs (x,y) with x + y = 10 for x,y in [1..10]:
Solution found: x=1, y=9
Solution found: x=2, y=8
Solution found: x=3, y=7
Solution found: x=4, y=6
Solution found: x=5, y=5
Solution found: x=6, y=4
Solution found: x=7, y=3
Solution found: x=8, y=2
Solution found: x=9, y=1
Minimum x value among solutions is 1 with y=9.. Expected Answer Type: Prop
<<<∃ x y : ℕ, x + y = 10 ∧ x ≥ 1 ∧ y ≥ 1>>>
