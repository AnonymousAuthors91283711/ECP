The problem involves solving the equation \(\log_{3x} 4 = \log_{2x} 8\) for \(x > 0\), with \(3x \neq 1\) and \(2x \neq 1\). We want to find the rational value(s) of \(x\) satisfying this.

Rewrite the logs using natural logs:
\[
\frac{\ln 4}{\ln(3x)} = \frac{\ln 8}{\ln(2x)}.
\]

Cross multiply and solve for \(x\).

The Python program below iterates over rational candidates \(x = \frac{p}{q}\) for small \(p, q\), checks the equation, and prints exact rational candidates that satisfy closely (allowing slight floating error, but printing the fraction). This can help conjecture the unique or multiple rational solutions.

```python
from math import log, isclose
from fractions import Fraction

# Logarithmic values
ln4 = log(4)
ln8 = log(8)

# Check candidates with small numerator and denominator
limit = 20  # search space
results = []

for denom in range(1, limit):
    for numer in range(1, 5*denom):  # x up to 5
        x = Fraction(numer, denom)
        xx = float(x)
        # Exclude invalid
        if xx <= 0 or isclose(3*xx,1,abs_tol=1e-12) or isclose(2*xx,1,abs_tol=1e-12):
            continue
        
        lhs = ln4 / log(3*xx)
        rhs = ln8 / log(2*xx)
        
        if isclose(lhs, rhs, rel_tol=1e-12):
            print(f"x = {x} satisfies log_{{3x}}4 = log_{{2x}}8")
            results.append(x)

# Print minimal solution found
if results:
    min_sol = min(results)
    print(f"Minimal candidate solution: x = {min_sol}")
else:
    print("No rational solution found in search range.")
```
This enumerates rational \(x\) values that match the equation and prints them immediately.
