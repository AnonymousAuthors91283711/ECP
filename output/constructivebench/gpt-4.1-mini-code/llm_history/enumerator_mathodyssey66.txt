The problem appears to consider a sequence \((a_n)\) defined by \(a_1 = a\) and the recursion
\[
a_{n+1} = 2\left(a_n + \frac{1}{a_n}\right) - 3,
\]
and seeks to characterize those initial values \(a\) such that the sequence is strictly increasing. We want to enumerate values of \(a\) and check if the sequence \((a_n)\) is increasing for the first several terms.

We'll try some rational or integer values for \(a\) and print the initial values that yield an increasing sequence for a few iterations.

```python
def is_increasing_sequence(a, iterations=10):
    seq = [a]
    for _ in range(iterations - 1):
        an = seq[-1]
        if an == 0:
            return False  # division by zero
        next_an = 2 * (an + 1 / an) - 3
        if next_an <= an:
            return False
        seq.append(next_an)
    return True

print("Checking a values and whether the sequence is strictly increasing ...")
# We'll check a range around 1 because the recursion is symmetric and the sequence is sensitive near zero
for a in [i / 10 for i in range(-50, 51)]:
    if a == 0:
        continue
    if is_increasing_sequence(a):
        print(f"a = {a} yields a strictly increasing sequence for first 10 terms")
```
This program quickly enumerates starting values and prints those that generate increasing sequences for 10 steps, helping conjecture about the set `mathodyssey66_answer`.
