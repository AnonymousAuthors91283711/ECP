Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: 26
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer.

The problem gives us the equation:
2x - 3 = 10

And asks us to find what 4x equals.

Let's solve it step by step:
1. Start with 2x - 3 = 10
2. Add 3 to both sides: 2x = 13
3. Multiply both sides by 2: 4x = 26

The proposed answer is exactly this result: 26.

Since the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (which in Lean typically means it's intentionally left undefined), but the proposed answer correctly follows from the given equation, we can conclude that the proposed answer is correct.
