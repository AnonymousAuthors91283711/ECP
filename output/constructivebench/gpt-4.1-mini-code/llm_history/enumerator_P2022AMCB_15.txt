The problem involves checking divisibility by primes \(p \in \{2,3,5,7\}\) of very large numbers \(2^{606}-1, 2^{606}+1, 2^{607}+1, 2^{607}+3^{607}\). We want to find a number that is not divisible by any of these primes but among these primes, at least one divides one of those four numbers.

We will enumerate mod results for these primes, with a focus on exact modular arithmetic to check divisibility. This might help conjecture about which primes divide which expressions and confirm no prime divides the answer candidate.

```python
# Check divisibility by p in {2,3,5,7} for the numbers:
# 2^606 - 1, 2^606 + 1, 2^607 + 1, 2^607 + 3^607
# Print results immediately, modular arithmetic, no large exponentiation.

primes = [2, 3, 5, 7]

def mod_exp(base, exponent, modulus):
    # Efficient modular exponentiation
    result = 1
    base %= modulus
    e = exponent
    while e > 0:
        if e & 1:
            result = (result * base) % modulus
        base = (base * base) % modulus
        e >>= 1
    return result

print("Check divisibility for p in [2,3,5,7] and expressions:")

for p in primes:
    r1 = (mod_exp(2, 606, p) - 1) % p
    print(f"2^606 - 1 mod {p} = {r1}")
    r2 = (mod_exp(2, 606, p) + 1) % p
    print(f"2^606 + 1 mod {p} = {r2}")
    r3 = (mod_exp(2, 607, p) + 1) % p
    print(f"2^607 + 1 mod {p} = {r3}")
    r4 = (mod_exp(2, 607, p) + mod_exp(3, 607, p)) % p
    print(f"2^607 + 3^607 mod {p} = {r4}")
```
