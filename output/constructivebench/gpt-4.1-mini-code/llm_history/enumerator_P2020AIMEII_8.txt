The problem involves the function f defined on natural numbers and real numbers, where f(0, x) = 0, f(1, x) = |x-1|, and for n+1, f(n+1, x) = f(n, |x-(n+1)|). The set under consideration is {n : ℕ | ∃ s ⊆ ℝ finite, ∀ x ∈ s, f n x = 0, and sum of x in s > 500000}. We want to find the least n such that there exists a finite subset s of real numbers with all f n x = 0 and sum s > 500000.

I will explore the behavior of f, identify zeros for different n, and list sums of their zeros to conjecture and assist in proving the answer. For small n, find zeros and sums, print them, and try to infer the minimum n for large sum constraints.

```python
# Enumerate zeros of f(n,x) for small n and sum of zeros, streaming partial results.
# f(0,x)=0 always, for n=1 zero at x=1, for n>1 zeros come from repeated absolute differences.

def zeros_f1():
    # For n=1, f(1,x)=|x-1|=0 => x=1
    return [1]

def zeros_f2():
    # f(2,x)=f(1, |x-2|)=0 => |x-2|=1 => x=1 or 3
    return [1,3]

def zeros_fn(n):
    # f(0,x)=0 for all x, f(1,x) zeros at 1,
    # f(n+1,x)=f(n, |x-(n+1)|)=0 means |x-(n+1)| in zeros_f(n)
    # So zeros for f(n+1) are values x with |x-(n+1)|=z for z in zeros_f(n), so x=(n+1)+z or (n+1)-z
    prev = zeros_fn(n-1)
    cur = set()
    for z in prev:
        cur.add((n)+z)
        cur.add((n)-z)
    return sorted(cur)

def sum_zeros(n):
    zs = zeros_fn(n)
    return sum(zs), zs

def main():
    print("n, zeros, sum of zeros")
    # Enumerate for n from 1 upwards until sum of zeros exceeds 500000 or up to n=10
    for n in range(1, 11):
        s, zs = sum_zeros(n)
        print(f"n={n}, zeros={zs}, sum={s}")
        if s > 500000:
            print(f"\nMinimum n with sum > 500000 candidates up to n={n}")
            print(f"Answer candidate: {n}")
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
