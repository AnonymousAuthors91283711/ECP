The problem involves a sequence \( a_i > 0 \) for \( i=0,\ldots,2022 \) with conditions:
\[
a_{k+1} = \sum_{i=0}^{2022} |a_{k+1} - a_i|
\]
and we want to find the minimal possible value of \( s = \sum_{i=0}^{2022} a_i \).

The given condition is complicated, but we can try for smaller values of \( n \) (size of the sequence) to observe patterns.

Key observations:
- The problem indexing is in terms of Fin 2023, so indices modulo 2023.
- The condition involves each \( a_{k+1} \) equals the sum of absolute differences between \( a_{k+1} \) and all \( a_i \).
- All \( a_i \) are positive integers.

We will write a Python program enumerating sequences of length \( n \) for small \( n \) (e.g., \( n=3,4,5 \)), checking the condition for all \( k \), and printing sums for valid sequences.

We only enumerate sequences with sorted increasing values to reduce search space.

We will print:
- \( n \), the sequence length
- sequences and their sum if they satisfy conditions approximately (since exact equality is needed, we check for exact integer equality)

This can help conjecture the minimal sums and patterns for larger \( n \).

```python
# Python program to investigate the problem for small n.
# Condition for sequence a: for each k,
# a[k] == sum_{i} |a[k] - a[i]|, all a[i]>0 integers.
# We enumerate increasing sequences a with small max values to find examples.
# For found sequences, print n, sequence, sum.

from itertools import combinations_with_replacement

def check_condition(a):
    n = len(a)
    for k in range(n):
        lhs = a[k]
        rhs = sum(abs(a[k]-a[i]) for i in range(n))
        if lhs != rhs:
            return False
    return True

def enumerate_sequences(n, max_val):
    # Enumerate increasing sequences to avoid duplicates
    for seq in combinations_with_replacement(range(1, max_val+1), n):
        # Strictly increasing (a[i] > 0 and a sorted increasing)
        if all(seq[i] < seq[i+1] for i in range(n-1)):
            if check_condition(seq):
                print(f"n={n}, seq={seq}, sum={sum(seq)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Test for small n and max values
    for n in range(3,6):
        print(f"=== Searching sequences of length {n} ===")
        # Max value chosen reasonably small for performance
        enumerate_sequences(n, max_val=20)
```
