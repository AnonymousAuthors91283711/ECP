Ground Truth Answer: {P | (∃ c : ℝ, P = C c) ∨ 
       (∃ (a : ℤ) (b : ℤ) (ha : a ≠ 0), P = C (a : ℝ) * X + C (b * π))}
Proposed Answer: { P | ∃ a b : ℝ, P = C b + X * C a ∧ ((a = 0 ∧ (b = 0 ∨ b = -1 ∨ b = 1 ∨ b = 2 ∨ b = -2)) ∨ (a ≠ 0 ∧ b = 0 ∧ (a = 1 ∨ a = -1 ∨ a = 2 ∨ a = -2))) }
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

1. Ground Truth Answer:
- Constant polynomials (P = C c)
- Linear polynomials of form P = a*X + b*π where a is non-zero integer and b is integer

2. Proposed Answer:
- Constant polynomials where b is 0, ±1, ±2
- Linear polynomials where b=0 and a is ±1, ±2

Key differences:
- Ground truth allows any real constant c, while proposed restricts to specific constants (0,±1,±2)
- Ground truth allows any non-zero integer slope a with any integer multiple of π intercept, while proposed restricts to specific slopes (±1,±2) and requires intercept b=0
- Proposed answer misses cases like P = 3X + π which should be valid
- Proposed answer includes some unnecessary restrictions on constants

The proposed answer is partially correct but:
1. Too restrictive on constants
2. Too restrictive on linear polynomials
3. Missing many valid cases
