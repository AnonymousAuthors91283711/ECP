The problem involves finding the least natural number \( N \) such that there exists a finite set \( s \subseteq \mathbb{N} \) with \( |s| = 2k+1 \), all positive elements, and for every subset \( t \subseteq s \) of size \( k \), the sum of elements in \( t \) is at most \( N/2 \), but the sum of all elements in \( s \) is greater than \( N \).

To explore this, we will:
- Try small values of \( k \).
- Enumerate possible sets \( s \) of size \( 2k+1 \) with small positive integers.
- Check the constraints.
- Print candidate \( N \) values and corresponding sets \( s \).
- Finally, print the minimal \( N \) found for each \( k \).

```python
from itertools import combinations

def sum_subset(s, indices):
    return sum(s[i] for i in indices)

def check_satisfies(s, k, N):
    # Check all subsets of size k have sum <= N/2
    for subset in combinations(range(len(s)), k):
        if sum_subset(s, subset) > N/2:
            return False
    # Check full sum > N
    if sum(s) <= N:
        return False
    return True

def enumerate_candidates(k, max_elem=20, max_N=200):
    # Sets s have size 2k+1, positive integers <= max_elem
    n = 2*k +1
    min_N = None

    # We'll generate combinations with replacement (sorted) to keep count reasonable
    # Since s is a set, elements distinct and positive
    from itertools import combinations

    # Enumerate all sets s of size n from 1..max_elem
    for s in combinations(range(1, max_elem+1), n):
        s_sum = sum(s)
        # Possible N minimal is greater than s_sum since s.sum > N
        # But to have the k-subset sums <= N/2, N >= 2*k-subset max sum
        max_k_subset_sum = max(sum_subset(s, idxs) for idxs in combinations(range(n), k))
        # Candidate N must satisfy
        # max_k_subset_sum <= N/2 AND s_sum > N
        # => N >= 2* max_k_subset_sum AND N < s_sum
        # So search N in [2*max_k_subset_sum, s_sum-1]
        low = 2*max_k_subset_sum
        high = s_sum - 1
        if low > high:
            continue
        for N in range(low, high+1):
            if check_satisfies(s,k,N):
                print(f"k={k}, N={N}, s={s}")
                if min_N is None or N < min_N:
                    min_N = N
                break  # minimal N for this s found, no need to check larger N
    if min_N is not None:
        print(f"Minimum N found for k={k}: {min_N}")
    else:
        print(f"No N found for k={k} within search limits")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    for k in range(1,4):  # small sample k=1,2,3
