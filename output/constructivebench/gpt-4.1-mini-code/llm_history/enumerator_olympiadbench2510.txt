This problem relates to a sum involving logarithms with base 100, and an equality stating that the sum over x from 81 to 99 of p(x) equals twice p evaluated at some natural number (olympiadbench2510_answer). The goal is to find that number.

To approach this, we can compute p(x) = log base 100 of (1 + 1/x) for x in [81, 99], sum them up, and check for which integer n we have 2 * p(n) approximately equals the sum.

Since exact symbolic log base 100 sums are tricky, we enumerate x in [81..99], compute p(x) numerically (using math.log with base change), sum, then check 2 * p(n) for integers n in a suitable range (say 1 to 100) for near equality.

We print intermediates for sum, p(n), and whenever 2 * p(n) is close to the sum with a small tolerance.

We exactly print log base 100 as log(value)/log(100).

```python
import math

# Precompute p(x) = log base 100 of (1 + 1/x)
def p(x):
    return math.log(1 + 1/x) / math.log(100)

def main():
    S = range(81, 100)
    # Compute sum p(x) for x in [81..99]
    ps = [p(x) for x in S]
    s = sum(ps)
    print(f"Sum of p(x) for x in [81..99]: {s:.12f}")
    
    # Check candidates n in 1..150 for 2 * p(n) close to sum
    tol = 1e-9
    for n in range(1, 151):
        val = 2 * p(n)
        diff = abs(val - s)
        if diff < 1e-8:
            print(f"2 * p({n}) = {val:.12f} close to sum = {s:.12f} with diff = {diff}")
        # Print all 2*p(n) for reference
        print(f"n={n}, 2*p(n)={val:.12f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
