theorem omnimath2963 :
  let ΩS : Finset ℕ := {1, 2, 3, 4}
  let ΩT : Finset ℕ := {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
  let outcomes := Finset.product ΩS ΩT
  let count := Finset.card (Finset.filter (fun (s, t) => s > t) outcomes)
  count * (1 : ℚ) / (Finset.card ΩS * Finset.card ΩT) = omnimath2963_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Pairs (s,t) with s > t:
(2, 1)
(3, 1)
(3, 2)
(4, 1)
(4, 2)
(4, 3)
Count = 6
Probability = 1/4 (exact fraction)
Probability ≈ 0.2500 (approx). Expected Answer Type: ℚ
<<<(6 : ℚ) / (4 * 6)>>>
