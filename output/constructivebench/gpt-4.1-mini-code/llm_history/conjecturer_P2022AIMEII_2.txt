abbrev P2022AIMEII_2_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem P2022AIMEII_2 :
  ∃ (p q : ℕ), Nat.Coprime p q ∧ 
  -- There are 3 possible match pairings in semifinals
  -- Case 1: Azar vs Carl and Jon vs Sergey
  let case1 := (2/3 : ℚ) * (3/4) * (3/4) + (1/3) * (3/4) * (1/4)
  -- Case 2: Azar vs Jon and Carl vs Sergey
  let case2 := (3/4) * (3/4) * (2/3) + (1/4) * (3/4) * (3/4)
  -- Case 3: Azar vs Sergey and Carl vs Jon
  let case3 := (3/4) * (3/4) * (2/3) + (1/4) * (3/4) * (3/4)
  -- Total probability is average of all cases
  (case1 + case2 + case3) / 3 = p / q ∧ q = P2022AIMEII_2_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Case 1 probability: 7/16 = 0.437500
Case 2 probability: 33/64 = 0.515625
Case 3 probability: 33/64 = 0.515625
Sum of cases: 47/32 = 1.468750
Average probability: 47/96 = 0.489583
Simplified fraction = 47/96. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
