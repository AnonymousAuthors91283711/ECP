Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: if 1998 % 2 = 1 then 0 else -1 / (1998 - 1)
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is close but not entirely correct. The pattern for even indices should be -1/(n-1), but the proposed answer incorrectly returns 0 for odd indices. The recurrence relation shows that for odd n ≥ 3, t(n) = 0 because it's multiplied by (n-3)/(n-1) where n-3 becomes 0 when n is odd. However, the proposed answer's condition is reversed - it returns 0 for odd indices when it should return 0 for even indices (specifically, all odd indices after 1 will be 0). The correct answer for t(1998) should be -1/1997 since 1998 is even.
