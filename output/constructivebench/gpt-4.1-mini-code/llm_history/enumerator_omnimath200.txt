The problem asks to find all integer pairs \((m, n)\), both nonzero, satisfying the equation:
\[
(m^2 + n)(m + n^2) = (m - n)^3.
\]
We want to enumerate such pairs \((m, n)\) with small absolute values for \(m\) and \(n\) to conjecture the solution set.

We will try \(m, n\) in \([-10, 10]\setminus \{0\}\) and print all solutions found. This should help identify patterns or solutions for further mathematical reasoning.

```python
# Enumerate integer pairs (m,n) with m,n != 0 and |m|,|n| â‰¤ 10
# Print those satisfying (m^2 + n)*(m + n^2) == (m - n)^3

def main():
    for m in range(-10, 11):
        if m == 0:
            continue
        for n in range(-10, 11):
            if n == 0:
                continue
            left = (m*m + n) * (m + n*n)
            right = (m - n)**3
            if left == right:
                print(f"Solution found: (m, n) = ({m}, {n})  ->  ({left} == {right})")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
