[write_program]
The problem is to find the value of (⌊(3 + √5)^34⌋) mod 100. To assist in conjecturing the answer, I will write a Python program that computes (3 + sqrt(5))^n for n=34, floors it, and prints the last two digits (mod 100). I'll also print some intermediate values for smaller powers to observe any patterns.

```python
import math

def main():
    a = 3 + math.sqrt(5)
    b = 3 - math.sqrt(5)  # conjugate for possible pattern
    # We'll use the formula floor((3+√5)^n + (3-√5)^n) is integer
    # Because (3-√5) < 1, (3-√5)^n is small, so floor((3+√5)^n) = floor(S(n))
    # where S(n) = (3+√5)^n + (3-√5)^n is integer.
    # We'll compute S(n) for n=1..34 and print floor((3+√5)^n) as S(n)-1 or S(n)
    # depending on (3-√5)^n < 1 or > 0.5 etc.
    print("n  floor((3+√5)^n) mod 100")
    for n in range(1, 35):
        val = a**n
        floor_val = int(val)
        val_mod = floor_val % 100
        # Calculate integer S(n)
        s = a**n + b**n
        s_int = round(s)
        # (3-√5)^n is small, so floor_val usually s_int-1 or s_int
        # Let's print to compare
        print(f"{n:2d} {floor_val:12d} {val_mod:3d} S(n)={s_int}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
