The problem asks to find a unique number \(x\) in the set \(\{1,2,\ldots,11\}\) such that the average of the other numbers (excluding \(x\)) is exactly 6.1. We want to check each number \(x\), compute the average of the set without \(x\), and see which \(x\) satisfies that the average is 6.1 uniquely.

```python
# Enumerate the number x in {1,...,11} such that the average of the other numbers is 6.1

S = list(range(1, 12))
target_avg = 6.1
candidates = []

for x in S:
    others = [y for y in S if y != x]
    avg = sum(others) / len(others)
    if abs(avg - target_avg) < 1e-10:  # avoid floating issues
        print(f"Removing {x}, average of others = {avg}")
        candidates.append(x)

print("Candidates:", candidates)
if len(candidates) == 1:
    print("Unique answer:", candidates[0])
else:
    print("No unique answer or multiple answers found.")
```
