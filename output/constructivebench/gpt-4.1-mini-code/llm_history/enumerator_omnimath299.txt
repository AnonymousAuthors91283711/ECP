The problem involves checking if there exists a real bivariate polynomial \(P(x, y)\) such that its positivity region exactly matches the quadrant \(x>0, y>0\). To get insight, I'll enumerate simple bivariate polynomials \(P(x,y)\) with small integer coefficients and check if the positivity of \(P(x,y)\) matches \(x>0, y>0\) over some test points. This enumeration helps conjecture whether such a polynomial can exist.

```python
from sympy import symbols, Poly
from sympy.abc import x, y

# Generate candidate polynomials with degree up to 2 and coefficients in {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}
coeffs = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]

# Test points covering sign conditions of x and y around zero
test_points = [
    (1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (-1,-1), (0.5, 0.5), (0.5, -0.5), (-0.5, 0.5), (-0.5, -0.5),
    (0,1), (1,0), (0,-1), (-1,0), (0,0)
]

def sign_matches(p):
    # Check if positivity of p(x,y) matches exactly x>0 and y>0 for all test points
    for tx, ty in test_points:
        val = p.eval({x: tx, y: ty})
        lhs = val > 0
        rhs = (tx > 0 and ty > 0)
        if lhs != rhs:
            return False
    return True

print("Enumerating candidate polynomials with degree ≤ 2:")
for a in coeffs:
    for b in coeffs:
        for c in coeffs:
            for d in coeffs:
                for e in coeffs:
                    # polynomial: a + b*x + c*y + d*x*y + e*x**2
                    p = Poly(a + b*x + c*y + d*x*y + e*x**2, x, y)
                    if p.is_zero:
                        continue
                    if sign_matches(p):
                        print(f"Candidate polynomial matches positivity: {p.as_expr()}")
                        
print("No exact polynomial found with degree ≤ 2 and coefficients in", coeffs)
```
This script tries polynomials \(a + b x + c y + d x y + e x^2\) with small integer coefficients and checks their positivity pattern on test points. Immediate output identifies candidates, assisting with conjecture and proof.
