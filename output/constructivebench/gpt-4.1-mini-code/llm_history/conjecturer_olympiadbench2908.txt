abbrev olympiadbench2908_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem olympiadbench2908 : 
  2^(log 800 / log 4) / 2^(log 64 / log 16) = olympiadbench2908_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Parameters:
base1 = 4, x1 = 800
base2 = 16, x2 = 64
log_4(800) = 4.821928
log_16(64) = 1.500000
Exponent in 2^(...) = 3.321928
Approximate value: 10.000000000000002
log_2(800) = 9.643856
log_4(800) = 4.821928 (exact form)
Exponent exact = 3.321928
Value exact = 9.999999999999996
log_16(64) = 3/2 exactly
