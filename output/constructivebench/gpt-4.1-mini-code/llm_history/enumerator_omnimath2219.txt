The problem involves finding the size \( k \) of subsets \( S \subseteq \{1, \ldots, 2015\} \) where no two distinct elements \( a, b \in S \) satisfy \( a - b \mid a + b \). We want to explore such subsets and enumerate possible sizes \( k \).

We will try small ranges and print sizes of subsets that satisfy the condition to conjecture the maximum \( k \).

```python
from math import gcd

def divides(x, y):
    return y % x == 0

def condition(S):
    lst = sorted(S)
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(lst)):
            a, b = lst[i], lst[j]
            diff = abs(a - b)
            summ = a + b
            if divides(diff, summ):
                return False
    return True

def enumerate_subsets(n, max_size=5):
    # Enumerate subsets up to size max_size to avoid explosion
    from itertools import combinations
    max_found = 0
    for size in range(1, max_size+1):
        for comb in combinations(range(1, n+1), size):
            if condition(comb):
                print(f"Satisfies condition with size {size}: {comb}")
                if size > max_found:
                    max_found = size
    print(f"Maximum size found for n={n} (up to {max_size}): {max_found}\n")

def main():
    # Try small values of n to find patterns
    for n in [10, 15, 20]:
        print(f"Checking subsets from 1 to {n}")
        enumerate_subsets(n, max_size=5)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
