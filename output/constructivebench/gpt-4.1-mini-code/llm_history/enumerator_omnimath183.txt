The problem sums a trigonometric expression for k from 0 to 88 involving cosines of angles in degrees converted to radians. To explore, let's test partial sums numerically and check if there's a simplifying pattern or closed form.

```python
import math

# Enumerate partial sums of S = sum_{k=0}^{88} 1 / (cos(pi*k/180)*cos(pi*(k+1)/180))
print("k, partial_sum")
total = 0.0
for k in range(89):
    denom = math.cos(math.pi * k / 180) * math.cos(math.pi * (k + 1) / 180)
    if abs(denom) < 1e-15:
        print(f"k={k} division by zero")
        continue
    val = 1 / denom
    total += val
    print(f"{k}, {total}")

# Check for any pattern in the partial sums (e.g., differences or simplified close numbers)
```
This prints each partial sum as k increases, which helps conjecture exact or closed forms for the sum.
