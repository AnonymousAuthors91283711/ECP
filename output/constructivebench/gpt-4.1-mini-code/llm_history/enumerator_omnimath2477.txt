The problem involves counting multisets of size 9 over a 26-element set. This is equivalent to counting combinations with repetitions: the count is C(26+9-1, 9) = C(34, 9). The program enumerates these combinatorial values for small n, k to confirm this formula.

```python
from math import comb

# Enumerate counts of multisets of size k from n elements for small sample values
for n in range(1, 27):
    k = 9
    if k <= n + k - 1:
        val = comb(n + k - 1, k)
        print(f"Number of multisets of size {k} from {n} elements: {val}")

# Print the main problem output for n=26, k=9
answer = comb(26 + 9 - 1, 9)
print(f"Answer = C(34, 9) = {answer}")
```
