The problem appears to concern real positive numbers \( x, y \) such that \( \frac{y}{x} \) equals some real number \( \text{omnimath2666_answer} \), which is equivalent to the equality \( x \times 30 = y \times 10 \). Simplifying this equality gives:
\[
30x = 10y \implies 3x = y \implies \frac{y}{x} = 3.
\]
This suggests \( \text{omnimath2666_answer} = 3 \).

To assist with verification and conjecturing, the Python program will enumerate pairs \((x, y)\) with positive rational values and print the ratio \( y/x \) when \( 30x = 10y \) (or equivalently \( 3x = y \)) holds. It will also print the simplified form and confirm the ratio.

```python
# Enumerate positive rational samples and check if 30*x == 10*y
# Print all pairs meeting the equality and the ratio y/x

from fractions import Fraction

print("Enumerating positive (x,y) with small integer values:")
for x_num in range(1, 11):
    for x_den in range(1, 6):
        x = Fraction(x_num, x_den)
        # From 30x = 10y => y = 3x, try to find y with small denominator
        y = 3 * x
        # print exact fractions and float approx
        print(f"x = {x} = {float(x):.3f}, y = {y} = {float(y):.3f}, y/x = {y/x} = {float(y/x):.3f}")

print("\nConjectured omnimath2666_answer = 3")
```
This output will demonstrate that the ratio \(y/x\) is exactly 3 whenever the equality holds, matching the conjectured true answer.
