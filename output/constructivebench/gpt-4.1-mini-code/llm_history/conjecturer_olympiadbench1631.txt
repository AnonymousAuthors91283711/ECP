a=2, n=2, exponent=5, M=2^5-1 is prime
a=2, n=3, exponent=11, 2^11-1 is composite
Max k for a=2 is 2

Testing a=3
a=3, n=1, exponent=3, M=2^3-1 is prime
a=3, n=2, exponent=7, M=2^7-1 is prime
a=3, n=3, exponent=15, 2^15-1 is composite
Max k for a=3 is 2

Testing a=4
a=4, n=1, exponent=4, 2^4-1 is composite
Max k for a=4 is 0

Testing a=5
a=5, n=1, exponent=5, M=2^5-1 is prime
a=5, n=2, exponent=11, 2^11-1 is composite
Max k for a=5 is 1

Testing a=6
a=6, n=1, exponent=6, 2^6-1 is composite
Max k for a=6 is 0

Testing a=7
a=7, n=1, exponent=7, M=2^7-1 is prime
a=7, n=2, exponent=15, 2^15-1 is composite
Max k for a=7 is 1

Testing a=8
a=8, n=1, exponent=8, 2^8-1 is composite
Max k for a=8 is 0

Testing a=9
a=9, n=1, exponent=9, 2^9-1 is composite
Max k for a=9 is 0

Testing a=10
a=10, n=1, exponent=10, 2^10-1 is composite
Max k for a=10 is 0

Largest k found is 2, achieved at a in [2, 3]. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<2>>>
