Ground Truth Answer: { (fun _ => 0, fun _ => 0) } ∪ 
  { (fun x => x^2 + c, fun x => x) | c : ℝ }
Proposed Answer: { (f, g) | ∃ a b c : ℝ, (∀ x, f x = a + b * x + c * x ^ 2) ∧ (∀ x, g x = c * x) ∧ a = -b }
Let's analyze the problem and the answers carefully.

1. The functional equation given is: ∀ x y, g(f(x+y)) = f x + (2x + y)*g y

2. Ground Truth Answer provides two cases:
   - The zero solution (f=0, g=0)
   - Quadratic f with linear g: f(x) = x² + c, g(x) = x

3. Proposed Answer suggests a more general form:
   - f is quadratic: f(x) = a + b*x + c*x²
   - g is linear: g(x) = c*x
   - With constraint a = -b

Let's verify if the proposed answer matches the ground truth:

1. For the zero solution:
   - Ground truth includes (0,0)
   - Proposed answer can get this with a=b=c=0

2. For the non-zero solutions:
   - Ground truth has f(x) = x² + c, g(x) = x
   - In proposed form, this would require:
     * c=1 (from g(x) = x)
     * b=0 (to eliminate linear term)
     * a=c (the constant term)
   - But the proposed answer requires a=-b, which would be a=0 when b=0
   - This matches when c=0 in ground truth (f(x)=x²)

However, the proposed answer is more restrictive than ground truth:
- It doesn't allow the general case of f(x)=x²+c with arbitrary c
- It forces a relationship between coefficients that isn't necessary

The proposed answer captures some correct solutions but is too restrictive.
