The problem asks to characterize all functions \( f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \) satisfying:
\[
f(f(f(n))) = f(n+1) + 1 \quad \forall n \in \mathbb{N}.
\]

We want to enumerate possible \( f \) for small \( n \) to detect patterns or candidates. Because \( f \) maps naturals to naturals, and the relation is recursive within the function values composed multiple times, we test candidate functions on small initial segments.

We will try all functions on a small domain \( [0..m] \) for some small \( m \) where \( f(i) \in [0..k] \), verifying if the relation holds on inputs \( n \in [0..m-2] \) (so that \( f(f(f(n))) \) is defined within the range).

The code takes small \( m,k \) to keep output manageable and prints any \( f \) satisfying the relation over this truncated domain. This experimental enumeration might hint at the form of the solutions.

```python
# Enumerate functions f: {0,...,m} -> {0,...,k}
# Verify f(f(f(n))) == f(n+1)+1 for n in {0,...,m-2}

m = 5  # domain upper bound
k = 7  # codomain upper bound

from itertools import product

def check_relation(f):
    # f is a list representing f(0), f(1), ..., f(m)
    for n in range(m - 2):
        # Compute f(f(f(n))) : careful about indexing
        # f(n) may be > m, so to be safe, restrict f values <= m
        # Here we enforce actual f values <= m, else skip test
        try:
            x1 = f[n]
            if x1 > m: return False
            x2 = f[x1]
            if x2 > m: return False
            x3 = f[x2]
            if x3 > k: return False
            lhs = x3
            rhs = f[n+1] + 1
            if lhs != rhs:
                return False
        except IndexError:
            return False
    return True

print(f"Enumerating f: [0..{m}] -> [0..{k}] with condition f(f(f(n)))=f(n+1)+1 for n in 0..{m-2}.")

count = 0
for ftuple in product(range(m+1), repeat=m+1):
    # prune functions with values in [0..m], else indexing issues
    if any(val > m for val in ftuple):
        continue
    if check_relation(ftuple):
        count += 1
        print(f"Found f: {ftuple}")

print(f"Total functions found on domain size {m+1} with codomain limit {m}: {count}")
```
