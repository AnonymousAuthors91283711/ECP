The problem involves enumerating natural numbers \( c > 0 \) such that for all choices of signs \( s_1, s_2 \in \{1,-1\} \), there exists a rational number \( r \) satisfying
\[ r^2 + s_1 p r + s_2 c = 0 \]
for a large prime \( p = 2^{24036583} - 1 \). Since \( p \) is enormous and checking primality or direct computation is impossible here, we will try small values of \( p \) and \( c \) to understand the structure and assist in conjecturing the count of such \( c \).

Key points to check:
- For each \( c > 0 \), and for each pair \( (s_1, s_2) \in \{1, -1\}^2 \), the quadratic
  \[ r^2 + s_1 p r + s_2 c = 0 \]
  must have a solution \( r \in \mathbb{Q} \).
- A quadratic \( r^2 + a r + b = 0 \) with \( a,b \in \mathbb{Z} \) has a rational root if and only if its discriminant \( \Delta = a^2 - 4b \) is a perfect square integer.
- Using this criterion, we will test for small primes \( p \) (e.g., 3, 5, 7) and enumerate \( c \) up to a small threshold (say 50) to find all such \( c \).

This will provide candidates and help conjecture the nature or count of such \( c \) for the big \( p \).

        return False
    root = int(math.isqrt(n))

    # quadratic: x^2 + a x + b = 0
    # rational root iff discriminant a^2 - 4b is a perfect square
    disc = a*a - 4*b
    return is_perfect_square(disc)
