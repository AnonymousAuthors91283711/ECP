The problem asks to find the minimum value of S = a/(1-r), where a, r are real numbers such that a*r = 1 and |r| < 1. We want to enumerate pairs (a,r) satisfying the constraints and compute S, then approach the minimum value. 

Since a*r=1, a=1/r, so S = (1/r)/(1-r) = 1/(r*(1-r)). We need to find min S with |r|<1 and r â‰  0.

We will:
- Enumerate r over rational values between -0.99 and 0.99 (avoid r=0).
- Compute S=1/(r*(1-r))
- Print S.

This helps conjecture the minimum.

```python
# Enumerate rational r in (-1,1), r!=0, compute S=1/(r*(1-r))
# Print S and corresponding r,a to spot minimum
def fracs(start, stop, step):
    # Generate fractions start to stop step approximately
    x = start
    while x < stop:
        yield x
        x += step

def main():
    print("Enumerating S = a/(1-r) with a*r=1, |r|<1, a=1/r")
    candidates = []
    for r in fracs(-0.99, 0.99, 0.01):
        if abs(r) < 1e-8:
            continue
        a = 1/r
        denom = r*(1 - r)
        if abs(denom) < 1e-8:
            continue
        S = 1/denom
        print(f"r={r:.3f}, a={a:.3f}, S={S:.3f}")
        candidates.append(S)
    min_S = min(candidates)
    print(f"Minimum S found among enumerated: {min_S:.3f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
