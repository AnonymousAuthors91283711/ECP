The problem involves finite sets of points in the plane and circles passing through subsets of these points with certain cardinality constraints. We want to find the smallest integer \(k\) such that there exists a 10-point set \(s\) with these properties:

- Every 5-point subset of \(s\) contains at least 4 points on some circle.
- There exists some circle passing through exactly \(k\) points of \(s\).

To enumerate plausible answers, we will:

- Sample candidate point sets \(s\) with 10 points in the plane (with rational or integer coordinates)
- For each 5-subset of \(s\), check if there is a circle passing through at least 4 of these points
- Track the cardinalities \(k\) of circles passing through subsets of \(s\).

Since fully verifying this problem exhaustively is hard, we will:

- Generate 10-point integer coordinate sets in a small range
- Enumerate 5-subsets and check the circle conditions
- For discovered sets \(s\), we will print possible values of \(k\)

This should help to conjecture the minimal \(k\).
