The condition f(n + 1) > f(f n) strongly suggests that f is strictly increasing. Moreover, the comparisons on enumerated responses show f is at least growing as fast as the identity function (f n ≥ n). The 'strict_mono' predicate is not recognized, but we can write the strict increasing condition explicitly: ∀ m n, m < n → f m < f n.

Hence the set is exactly the set of f : ℕ → ℕ satisfying strict monotonicity and bounded below by the identity.
