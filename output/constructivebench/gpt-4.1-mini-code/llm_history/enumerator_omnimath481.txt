[write_program]
The problem considers the function T(L) = sum_{n=1}^L floor(n^3 / 9) and asks for which positive integers L the value T(L) is a perfect square. I will write a Python program to compute T(L) for small L and check when T(L) is a perfect square, printing all such L and T(L) found.

```python
import math

def T(L):
    s = 0
    for n in range(1, L+1):
        s += (n**3) // 9
    return s

def is_perfect_square(x):
    if x < 0:
        return False
    r = int(math.isqrt(x))
    return r*r == x

print("L, T(L), T(L) perfect square?")
for L in range(1, 101):
    val = T(L)
    if is_perfect_square(val):
        print(L, val)
```
This enumerates L from 1 to 100, calculates T(L), and prints L and T(L) whenever T(L) is a perfect square. This approach can assist in conjecturing the set of L where T(L) is a square.
