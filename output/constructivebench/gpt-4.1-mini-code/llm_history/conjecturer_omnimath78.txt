abbrev omnimath78_answer : Set (ℕ × ℕ) := sorry
theorem omnimath78 (p q : ℕ) : 
  p.Prime ∧ q.Prime ∧ p * q ∣ 5^p + 5^q ↔ (p, q) ∈ omnimath78_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating (p,q) with p,q prime and p*q | 5^p + 5^q
Found: p=2, q=3 divides 5^2+5^3 by 6
Found: p=2, q=5 divides 5^2+5^5 by 10
Found: p=5, q=5 divides 5^5+5^5 by 25. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ)
<<<{(2, 3), (2, 5), (5, 5)}>>>
