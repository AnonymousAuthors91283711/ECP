The problem involves analyzing the inequalities \(a^2 < a\) and \(a < \frac{1}{a}\) where \(a = \frac{1}{n}\) for integers \(n > 1\). To get insight, I will enumerate values of \(n > 1\) for some small \(n\), compute \(a\), and check both inequalities exactly. This will help conjecture what the condition \(\text{omnimath3426_answer}(a)\) corresponds to.

```python
# Enumerate for n > 1, n small
# a = 1/n, check inequalities a^2 < a and a < 1/a exactly

def check_inequalities(n):
    a_num = 1
    a_den = n
    # a^2 < a  <=> 1/n^2 < 1/n <=> multiply both sides by n^2 (positive), 1 < n
    a_squared_lt_a = 1 < n

    # a < 1/a <=> 1/n < n/1 => cross multiply n^2 > 1
    a_lt_inv_a = n**2 > 1

    return a_squared_lt_a, a_lt_inv_a

print("n, a=1/n, a^2 < a, a < 1/a, both hold?")
for n in range(2, 10):
    sq, inv = check_inequalities(n)
    a = 1 / n
    print(f"{n}, {a:.4f}, {sq}, {inv}, {sq and inv}")

# Observations:
# For all n > 1, a^2 < a since 1 < n
# For all n != 1, a < 1/a since n^2 > 1 except at n=1
# So both hold True whenever n > 1
```
