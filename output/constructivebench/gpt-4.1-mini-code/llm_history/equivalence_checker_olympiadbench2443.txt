Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {11, 19, 37, 73}
Since the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's intentionally left undefined in the Lean proof assistant), we cannot verify the correctness of the proposed answer {11, 19, 37, 73} against it. In mathematical terms, we cannot determine equivalence without knowing what the ground truth is supposed to be.
