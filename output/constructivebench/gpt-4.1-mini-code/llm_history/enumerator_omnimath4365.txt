The problem asks for integer pairs \((x,y)\) such that \((2x+1)^3 + 1 = y^4\). We want to enumerate possible pairs \((x,y)\) that satisfy this equation for small integer values of \(x\), then print them to assist in conjecturing the truth of the statement.

```python
# Enumerate integer pairs (x,y) with (2x+1)^3 + 1 = y^4 for small |x|
# to find all such integer solutions.

def fourth_root(n):
    # Return the integer fourth root of n if n is a perfect fourth power, else None
    if n < 0:
        return None
    r = int(round(n**0.25))
    for candidate in [r-1, r, r+1]:
        if candidate**4 == n:
            return candidate
    return None

def main():
    # Search for x in [-50..50] arbitrarily chosen to find solutions
    for x in range(-50, 51):
        val = (2*x + 1)**3 + 1
        y = fourth_root(val)
        if y is not None:
            print(f"x = {x}, y = {y}, (2x+1)^3 +1 = y^4 = {val}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
