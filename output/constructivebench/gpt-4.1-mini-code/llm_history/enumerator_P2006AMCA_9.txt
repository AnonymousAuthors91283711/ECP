The problem involves natural numbers pencilCost and eraserCost such that:
- pencilCost > eraserCost
- 13 * pencilCost + 3 * eraserCost = 100

We want to find pencilCost + eraserCost (natural numbers).

The code enumerates eraserCost from 0 to 33 (because 3 * 33 = 99) and computes pencilCost as (100 - 3 * eraserCost)/13 if it is integer and pencilCost > eraserCost.

It prints each valid candidate sum, and finally prints the minimum sum (because the problem likely wants a specific sum, but we just print all candidates).

```python
# Enumerate natural numbers pencilCost and eraserCost with:
# 13 * pencilCost + 3 * eraserCost = 100
# pencilCost > eraserCost
# Print all (pencilCost + eraserCost) found.

def main():
    candidates = []
    for eraserCost in range(34):
        remaining = 100 - 3 * eraserCost
        if remaining % 13 == 0:
            pencilCost = remaining // 13
            if pencilCost > eraserCost and pencilCost > 0 and eraserCost >= 0:
                total = pencilCost + eraserCost
                print(f"Found: pencilCost={pencilCost}, eraserCost={eraserCost}, sum={total}")
                candidates.append(total)
    if candidates:
        min_sum = min(candidates)
        print(f"Minimum sum (pencilCost + eraserCost) = {min_sum}")
    else:
        print("No solution found.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
