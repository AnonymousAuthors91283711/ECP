The problem involves finding the smallest positive integer \( n \) for which there exist integer polynomials \( P \) and \( Q \) of positive degree, such that the coefficient of \( x^4 \) in \( P \cdot Q \) is 1, and the coefficient of \( x^1 \) in \( P \cdot Q \) is \(-n + 63\).

To assist in conjecturing the answer, we will enumerate pairs of integer polynomials \( P \) and \( Q \) with degrees 1 or 2 and small integer coefficients, compute their product, and check the mentioned coefficients. We'll print the values of \( n = 63 - \text{coeff of } x^1 \) as we find them and record the minimal one.

This approach tries small degrees and coefficients to find valid \( n \), streaming candidate \( n \) values.

```python
# Enumerate integer polynomials P,Q with degrees 1 or 2, small integer coefficients.
# Check if (P*Q).coeff(4) == 1 and (P*Q).coeff(1) = -n+63, print n candidates.

def poly_mul(p, q):
    # Multiply polynomials p,q represented as lists of coefficients (lowest degree first)
    res = [0]*(len(p)+len(q)-1)
    for i,c1 in enumerate(p):
        for j,c2 in enumerate(q):
            res[i+j] += c1*c2
    return res

def coeff(poly, k):
    return poly[k] if k < len(poly) else 0
