. Enumerated answers: Enumerating f(4) values from various k with f(19) = 524288 * k
k = 0.5, f(4) = 13.8275502925
k = 1, f(4) = 16.0000000000
k = 2, f(4) = 18.5137637965
k = 10, f(4) = 25.9804278270. Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
Since f is positive and multiplicative (f(x+y)=f(x)*f(y)), it's exponential: f(x)=a^x for some a>0. Given f(19) = 524288 * k and 524288 = 2^19, we have a^19 = 2^19 * k, so a = 2 * k^{1/19}. Then f(4) = a^4 = (2 * k^{1/19})^4 = 2^4 * k^{4/19} = 16 * k^{4/19}.

<<<fun k : ℝ => 16 * k^(4 / 19)>>>
