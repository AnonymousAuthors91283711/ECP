Problem restated: Janice's age 12 years from now equals 8 times her age 2 years ago. We want to find Janice's current age (Janice_now) satisfying this.

We have:
Janice_12years = Janice_now + 12
Janice_2yearsago = Janice_now - 2

Equation: Janice_now + 12 = 8 * (Janice_now - 2)

We enumerate Janice_now over a reasonable domain (e.g., 0 to 100) to find all integers satisfying this.

```python
# Enumerate possible Janice_now values from 0 to 100
# Check if Janice_now + 12 == 8 * (Janice_now - 2)
# Print each solution immediately

for Janice_now in range(101):
    left = Janice_now + 12
    right = 8 * (Janice_now - 2)
    if left == right:
        print(f"Janice_now = {Janice_now} satisfies Janice_12years = 8 * Janice_2yearsago")
```
