This problem involves 100 students categorized as singers, dancers, and actors with the given counts of non-members for each group and no student belonging to all three categories simultaneously. The goal is to determine the size of the union of pairwise intersections of these groups. 

To assist in conjecturing the answer, I'll write a Python program that enumerates possible triples of set sizes consistent with the constraints and outputs corresponding values for the union of pairwise intersections, printing all possibilities given the constraints and no triple intersection. This helps identify the exact count for the union.

```python
# We have 100 students total
total = 100

# Given non-members counts, compute sizes of each group
# singersᶜ = 42 => singers = 58
# dancersᶜ = 65 => dancers = 35
# actorsᶜ = 29 => actors = 71

singers = 58
dancers = 35
actors = 71

# Let:
# x = |S ∩ D ∩ A| = 0 (given no triple intersection)
# a = |S ∩ D|, b = |S ∩ A|, c = |D ∩ A|
# We know x = 0, so the union of pairwise intersections is a + b + c
# Also, using inclusion-exclusion on the three sets without triple intersection:
# |S ∪ D ∪ A| = singers + dancers + actors - a - b - c + x = singers + dancers + actors - (a + b + c)

# Since all students are in S∪D∪A (from constraints) or not?
# We check constraints: It is not stated everyone is at least one category,
# so some students could be in none (not in singer, dancer, actor).

# We want to find possible values of a,b,c with:
# a ≤ min(singers, dancers)
# b ≤ min(singers, actors)
# c ≤ min(dancers, actors)

# Also, the sizes of exclusive parts must be nonnegative:
# |S only| = singers - a - b + x = 58 - a - b (since x=0)
# |D only| = dancers - a - c
# |A only| = actors - b - c
# Since no student is in all three, no deduction

# Also, the total number of students: 
# sum of singles only + pairwise intersections + none = 100
# Number in none = 100 - (singles only + a + b + c)

# For enumerations, we try all possible a,b,c in valid ranges, 
# print a+b+c whenever constraints are satisfied.

print("singers,dancers,actors:", singers, dancers, actors)
print("Enumerating possible pairs (a,b,c) for intersections (no triple intersection)...")

# To reduce search space, bounds:
max_a = min(singers, dancers)
max_b = min(singers, actors)
max_c = min(dancers, actors)

for a in range(max_a+1):
    for b in range(max_b+1):
        for c in range(max_c+1):
            # Check non-negative singles only
            s_only = singers - a - b
            d_only = dancers - a - c
            a_only = actors - b - c
            if s_only < 0 or d_only < 0 or a_only < 0:
                continue
            # Count total counted students:
            total_counted = s_only + d_only + a_only + a + b + c
            none = total - total_counted
            if none < 0:
                continue
            # Also, no triple intersection: x=0

            # Here the condition: no student in all 3 => x=0 already assumed

            # Print the union of pairwise intersections = a + b + c
            union_pairs = a + b + c
            print(f"a={a} b={b} c={c} union_pairs={union_pairs}")
```
This code will print combinations of pairwise intersection sizes consistent with the problem's constraints and the resulting union of pairwise intersections, helping to conjecture the precise answer.
