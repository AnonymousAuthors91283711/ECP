[write_program]
The problem appears to want to identify or verify the value of a rational number expression: 8 divided by the sum 5 + 7 + 8.

I'll write a Python program that:
- Calculates the sum denominator (5+7+8).
- Evaluates the fraction exactly as a rational number.
- Prints the fraction and its decimal value.

Since this is straightforward, I can also check if the fraction can be simplified.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def main():
    num = 8
    denom = 5 + 7 + 8
    frac = Fraction(num, denom)

    # Print the original fraction, simplified fraction, and decimal approximation
    print(f"Numerator: {num}")
    print(f"Denominator (sum 5+7+8): {denom}")
    print(f"Fraction (exact): {frac}")
    print(f"Decimal approx: {float(frac)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
