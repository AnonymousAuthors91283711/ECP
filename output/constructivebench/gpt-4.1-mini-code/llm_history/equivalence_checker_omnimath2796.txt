Ground Truth Answer: 8098
Proposed Answer: 86^2 + 24^2
Let's analyze this step by step:

1. The problem is asking to find real numbers p and q that satisfy certain conditions about quadratic roots, and then compute p² + q².

2. The ground truth answer gives the final result as 8098.

3. The proposed answer gives 86² + 24². Let's calculate this:
   86² = 7396
   24² = 576
   7396 + 576 = 7972

4. 7972 ≠ 8098, so the answers are not equivalent.

5. The proposed answer is completely different from the ground truth answer, not just differing on some domains/constraints.
