The problem describes sets A of functions from Fin n to ℕ, with each function bounded above by the identity function k ↦ k, closed under pointwise max and min, finite, and strictly contained in the full set {a | ∀ k, a k ≤ k}. The goal is to find the greatest cardinality m of such a set A.

To explore, we implement enumeration for small n (like 2, 3), enumerate subsets A of all functions bounded by the identity, check the closure under pointwise max and min, finiteness, and proper subset condition, then output the sizes of such A.

```python
from itertools import product, combinations

def fun_bound(n):
    # All functions f: [0..n-1]→ℕ with f(k) ≤ k
    # Represented as tuples of length n with f[k] ≤ k
    domains = [range(k+1) for k in range(n)]
    return list(product(*domains))

def pointwise_min(s, t):
    return tuple(min(a,b) for a,b in zip(s,t))

def pointwise_max(s, t):
    return tuple(max(a,b) for a,b in zip(s,t))

def is_closed_under_min_max(A):
    # Check A subset of functions, closed under pointwise min and max
    A_set = set(A)
    for s in A:
        for t in A:
            if pointwise_min(s,t) not in A_set or pointwise_max(s,t) not in A_set:
                return False
    return True

def main():
    for n in [2,3]:
        print(f"n={n}")
        funcs = fun_bound(n)
        full_set = set(funcs)
        # Enumerate subsets (except full set) of funcs
        # To limit, only check subsets with size at least len(funcs)-2
        # for efficiency in this demo
        max_card = 0
        max_sets = []
        # Enumerate subsets by size descending to find large candidates early
        for size in range(len(funcs)-1, 0, -1):
            # Enumerate all subsets of this size
            # If too large, we break
            max_checks = 5000
            count_checks = 0
            for subset in combinations(funcs, size):
                if count_checks >= max_checks:
                    break
                count_checks += 1
                A = tuple(sorted(subset))
                if is_closed_under_min_max(A):
                    if set(A) != full_set:
                        print(f"Found set of size {size}")
                        max_card = size
                        max_sets.append(A)
            if max_card > 0:
                break
        print(f"Max cardinality (for n={n}) found: {max_card}")
        # Print one maximal set
        if max_sets:
            print("Example set (functions):")
            for f in max_sets[0]:
                print(f)

This script enumerates sets A for n=2,3, checks closure under min and max, and finds large such sets smaller than the full set. It prints the cardinality and an example set to help conjecture the maximum possible m = omnimath139_answer(n).
