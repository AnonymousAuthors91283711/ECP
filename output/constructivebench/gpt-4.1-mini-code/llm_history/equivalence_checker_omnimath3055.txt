Ground Truth Answer: 12
Proposed Answer: 8
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. First, calculate the total: 4 + 5 + 7 = 16
2. The equation given is: 2 * (4/16) = 4/(16 - k)
3. Simplify: 2 * (1/4) = 4/(16 - k) => 1/2 = 4/(16 - k)
4. Cross multiply: 16 - k = 8 => k = 8

The proposed answer of 8 satisfies the equation perfectly. The ground truth answer of 12 does not satisfy the equation (16-12=4, and 4/4=1 ≠ 1/2).

However, we should also check the other condition new_total > 0:
- For k=8: 16-8=8 > 0 ✔
- For k=12: 16-12=4 > 0 ✔

The proposed answer (8) is mathematically correct while the ground truth answer (12) is incorrect. Therefore, they are not equivalent.

<<<False>>>
