This formal Lean problem involves a strictly increasing sequence \( GEB \) starting at 1, whose first differences \( \text{diff}(n) = GEB(n+1) - GEB(n) \) form a strictly increasing sequence, and every positive integer not in the range of \( GEB \) corresponds uniquely to some difference value. The problem asks to find \( GEB(100) \).

To explore the structure, let's write a Python program that:
- Computes possible \( GEB \) and \( diff \) values for small \( n \) assuming simplest strictly increasing sequences starting from 1,
- Enumerates candidates for \( GEB \) where \( GEB(0) = 1 \), \( diff \) is strictly increasing,
- Prints values and attempts to verify the condition about the missing integers being precisely the difference values.

Due to the complexity, let's test small ranges of differences to detect a pattern, printing sequences and missing integers with their correspondence, especially differences and missing integers.

```python
# Explore sequences GEB: N->N with GEB(0) =1, strictly increasing,
# diff(n)=GEB(n+1)-GEB(n) strictly increasing,
# and missing positive integers = set of unique differences.

def check_sequence(diffs):
    # diffs is list of increasing positive integers, length n
    # construct GEB from diffs, GEB(0)=1
    GEB = [1]
    for d in diffs:
        GEB.append(GEB[-1] + d)
    GEB_set = set(GEB)
    max_val = GEB[-1]
    all_pos = set(range(1, max_val+1))
    missing = sorted(list(all_pos - GEB_set))
    diff_set = set(diffs)
    # Check condition: missing positive integers in range = diff set
    if set(missing) == diff_set:
        print(f"diffs = {diffs}")
        print(f"GEB = {GEB}")
        print(f"missing = {missing}")
        print()

def enumerate_diffs(max_len=7, max_value=20):
    # Enumerate strictly increasing sequences of positive integers (diff)
    # with small length and values
    from itertools import combinations
    for length in range(1, max_len+1):
        for diffs in combinations(range(1, max_value+1), length):
            if all(diffs[i]<diffs[i+1] for i in range(len(diffs)-1)):
                check_sequence(list(diffs))

if __name__=="__main__":
    # Enumerate patterns and print those matching conditions
    enumerate_diffs()
```

This will print examples of \( GEB \), difference sequences, and missing positive integers matching the condition, helping to identify how \( GEB \) grows and conjecture \( GEB(100) \).
