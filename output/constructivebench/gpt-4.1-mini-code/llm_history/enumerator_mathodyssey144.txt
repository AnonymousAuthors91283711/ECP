The problem is asking for the largest size of a subset \( s \subseteq \{1, \ldots, 100\} \) such that for any distinct \(a, b \in s\), the number \(\frac{\mathrm{lcm}(a,b)}{\gcd(a,b)}\) is NOT a perfect square.

Note \(\frac{\mathrm{lcm}(a,b)}{\gcd(a,b)} = \frac{a b}{(\gcd(a,b))^2}\).

We want to search subsets of \(\{1, \ldots, 100\}\) with this property and find the maximum cardinality. Complete brute force enumeration of all subsets is impossible, but we can try enumerating subsets greedily with a backtracking or checking approach to guess possible max sizes.

The program below:
- Checks this property for pairs
- Builds subsets incrementally
- Prints sizes and subsets found
- Enumerates subsets up to some threshold size and prints the max found

This might help conjecture the maximum size and the subsets achieving it.

```python
from math import gcd, isqrt
from itertools import combinations

def is_square(x):
    r = isqrt(x)
    return r*r == x

def lcm(a,b):
    return a*b//gcd(a,b)

# Check condition for all pairs in s:
def condition(s):
    lst = sorted(s)
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        for j in range(i+1,len(lst)):
            a,b = lst[i], lst[j]
            val = lcm(a,b)//gcd(a,b)
            if is_square(val):
                return False
    return True

N = 100
nums = list(range(1,N+1))

max_size_found = 0
max_subsets = []

# We try to build subsets incrementally, ensuring the condition holds
# Because full search is impossible, let's try a greedy approach adding numbers in ascending order

def backtrack(start, curr_subset):
    global max_size_found, max_subsets
    if len(curr_subset) > max_size_found:
        print(f"Found subset size {len(curr_subset)}: {sorted(curr_subset)}")
        max_size_found = len(curr_subset)
        max_subsets = [set(curr_subset)]
    elif len(curr_subset) == max_size_found:
        max_subsets.append(set(curr_subset))

    for nxt in range(start, N+1):
        new_subset = curr_subset + [nxt]
        if condition(new_subset):
            backtrack(nxt+1, new_subset)
        # else skip nxt

# To reduce runtime, let's skip some numbers that are perfect squares themselves
# Usually including 1 causes val=1 which is a perfect square
# Let's try starting from 2 upwards

print("Starting backtracking to find large subsets satisfying condition (up to time limit)...")
backtrack(2, [])

print(f"Maximum subset size found: {max_size_found}")
print("Some subsets of that size (up to 5 shown):")
for s in max_subsets[:5]:
    print(sorted(s))
```
