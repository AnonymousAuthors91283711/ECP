The problem involves maximizing an integer \( k \) such that for all sequences of \( n \) triangles, one can find monotone subsequences of side lengths and a subset of size \( k \) where the triangle inequalities hold. Let's consider small values of \( n \) and enumerate possible \( k \) values by constructing explicit examples of triangles and testing monotone subsequences. We'll aim to identify the maximal \( k \) by brute force search over small \( n \) and simple sequences.

```python
from itertools import combinations

def is_triangle(a,b,c):
    return a>0 and b>0 and c>0 and a+b>c and a+c>b and b+c>a

def monotone(seq):
    return all(x<=y for x,y in zip(seq, seq[1:])) or all(x>=y for x,y in zip(seq, seq[1:]))

def check_triangles(tris, k):
    n = len(tris)
    # Try all subsets of size k:
    for subset in combinations(range(n), k):
        b = [tris[i][0] for i in subset]
        r = [tris[i][1] for i in subset]
        w = [tris[i][2] for i in subset]
        if monotone(b) and monotone(r) and monotone(w):
            # Check triangle inequalities on subset:
            if all(is_triangle(*tris[i]) for i in subset):
                return True
    return False

def test_n(n):
    print(f"Testing n={n}")
    # We try to find the largest k for which check_triangles succeeds for all triangle sequences.
    # We simulate some sequences:
    # Use simple sequences with side lengths in range 1..3 for feasibility
    candidates = []
    # Construct some simple sequences of n triangles, e.g. each side sequences increasing, decreasing or constant:
    sequences = []
    for a_side in [[1]*n, list(range(1,n+1)), list(range(n,0,-1))]:
        for b_side in [[1]*n, list(range(1,n+1)), list(range(n,0,-1))]:
            for c_side in [[1]*n, list(range(1,n+1)), list(range(n,0,-1))]:
                tris = list(zip(a_side, b_side, c_side))
                # Check all k from n down to 1
                for k in range(n,0,-1):
                    if check_triangles(tris, k):
                        candidates.append(k)
                        print(f"Sequence {tris[:min(n,3)]} yields k={k}")
                        break
    if candidates:
        max_k = max(candidates)
        print(f"Max k found for n={n}: {max_k}")

for n_sample in [3,4,5]:
    test_n(n_sample)
