The problem involves real numbers \(x, y > 0\), defining two values \(a = 1 + \frac{x}{y}\) and \(b = 1 + \frac{y}{x}\), with a given condition \(a^2 + b^2 = 15\), and asks to find \(a^3 + b^3\).

To explore and conjecture the possible values of \(a^3 + b^3\) given \(a^2 + b^2 = 15\), we can:

1. Fix some positive values for \(x, y\).
2. Compute \(a = 1 + x/y\), \(b = 1 + y/x\).
3. Check if the condition \(a^2 + b^2 = 15\) holds approximately (due to floating point).
4. Print \(a, b\) and compute \(a^3 + b^3\).

Furthermore, the algebraic manipulation hints to symmetries and we can also try to express \(a, b\) in terms of a parameter, then enumerate possible values.

Let's enumerate small rational values for \(x, y\) (e.g., from 0.1 to 5 with step 0.1), only print values where \(a^2 + b^2\) is close to 15 (within some tolerance), and print the corresponding \(a^3 + b^3\) to spot patterns.

```python
# Program to enumerate (x,y) > 0 where (1 + x/y)^2 + (1 + y/x)^2 ≈ 15 
# and print corresponding a^3 + b^3 to conjecture the closed form.

def approx_eq(a, b, tol=1e-6):
    return abs(a - b) < tol

def main():
    print("Enumerating (x,y), computing a,b and checking a^2 + b^2 ≈ 15")
    print("Format: x, y, a, b, a^2+b^2, a^3+b^3")

    step = 0.05
    # We'll scan x,y in [0.1, 5] with step 0.05 to avoid too large numbers
    xs = [round(0.1 + i*step, 3) for i in range(int((5 - 0.1)/step)+1)]
    ys = xs.copy()

    for x in xs:
        for y in ys:
            if x <= 0 or y <= 0:
                continue
            a = 1 + x/y
            b = 1 + y/x
            sumsq = a*a + b*b
            if abs(sumsq - 15) < 1e-3:
                c = a**3 + b**3
                print(f"x={x:.3f}, y={y:.3f}, a={a:.5f}, b={b:.5f}, a^2+b^2={sumsq:.5f}, a^3+b^3={c:.5f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
