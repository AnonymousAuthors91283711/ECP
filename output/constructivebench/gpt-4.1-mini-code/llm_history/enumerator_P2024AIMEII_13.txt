This problem appears to involve 13th roots of unity ω (with ω^13 = 1 and ω ≠ 1), and asks about the product over k in Fin 13 of the expression (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}), modulo 1000. To assist in conjecturing the value of this product modulo 1000, I will enumerate this product numerically for various 13th roots of unity (excluding 1), approximating values in Python using the complex exponential form.

We will:
- Compute ω = exp(2πi * j / 13) for j = 1 to 12,
- For each ω, compute the product of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) for k = 0 to 12,
- Take the product modulo 1000 (modulus applies to integer parts),
- Print intermediary ω values and computed products.

This enumeration will help understand if the product is constant or depends on the choice of root; it may help conjecture the exact value.

```python
import math
import cmath

MOD = 1000

def mod_int(x):
    # Mod integer part modulo 1000
    return int(round(x)) % MOD

def main():
    n = 13
    two_pi = 2 * math.pi
    print("Enumerating products for 13th roots of unity ω = e^(2πi j/13), j=1..12")
    for j in range(1, n):
        ω = cmath.exp(two_pi * 1j * j / n)
        product = 1 + 0j
        for k in range(n):
            term = 2 - 2 * ω**k + ω**(2*k)
            product *= term
        # Round real part to nearest integer modulo 1000; imag should be close to 0
        real_part = product.real
        imag_part = product.imag
        mod_val = mod_int(real_part)
        # Print each found product approx
        print(f"j={j}, ω^(j) ~ e^(2πi*{j}/13), product ≈ {real_part:.6f}+{imag_part:.6f}i, mod 1000 = {mod_val}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
