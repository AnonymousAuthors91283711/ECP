abbrev omnimath3810_answer : Set (ℕ × ℕ) := sorry
theorem omnimath3810 (x y : ℕ) :
    x^3 * y + x + y = x * y + 2 * x * y^2 ↔ (x, y) ∈ omnimath3810_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating solutions (x,y) with 0 <= x,y <= 50:
Solution found: x=0, y=0
Solution found: x=1, y=1
Solution found: x=2, y=2. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ)
<<<{(0,0), (1,1), (2,2)}>>>
