Answer for 25 additional lines: 354. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The error arises from multiple `let` bindings on the same line without separators. In Lean, each `let` binding should be on its own line or separated by a semicolon. Also, the initial region count is 4, not 54, so the actual formula for total regions after adding `n` lines starting from 2 initial lines and 4 initial regions is:

Total regions = initial_regions + (additional_lines * (additional_lines + 3)) / 2

For 25 additional lines, this equals 4 + (25 * 28) / 2 = 4 + 350 = 354, matching the enumerated answer.

Fixing the let bindings and providing the answer as a natural number literal:

Answer for 25 additional lines: 354. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The main error is the missing semicolons or line breaks between the `let` declarations in the `theorem`. In Lean, each `let` binding should be separated by a comma or a `;` if it's in expression context, or be on separate lines in tactic mode.

Also, from the enumerated data, the formula for the regions formed by adding `n` lines to an initial 2 lines (forming 4 regions) matches the standard formula for the maximum number of regions formed by `m` lines:

Maximum regions formed by `m` lines = (m(m+1))/2 + 1

Given initial lines = 2, initial regions = 4; when adding `additional_lines` = 25, total lines = 27.

Compute the number of regions for 27 lines:

regions = (27*28)/2 + 1 = 378 + 1 = 379 (not matching 354)

Hence, the problem might be about lines added under certain restrictions causing fewer regions.

From enumeration:

`expected_new_regions = additional_lines * (additional_lines + 3) /2`  
with additional_lines=25, expected_new_regions = 25*28/2 = 350

initial_regions = 4, so total_expected_regions = 354 matches.

So the closed formula is:

`total_regions = initial_regions + additional_lines*(additional_lines + 3)/2`

To fix the syntax and define the answer in Lean:

We define

P2025AIMEI_13_answer : ℕ := 4 + 25 * (25 + 3) / 2

or generalize for `additional_lines` as `a`:

P2025AIMEI_13_answer a := 4 + a*(a + 3)/2

and plug in 25.

Since the problem only asks for the number with additional_lines = 25, we can simply fix the `let` syntax and set answer := 354.

Final fix: use line breaks or semicolons between `let` bindings, and final answer 354.
