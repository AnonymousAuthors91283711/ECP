The problem involves polynomials of degree 2010 with coefficients ±1, the leading coefficient fixed at 1, and no real roots. We want to find the greatest number k of coefficients equal to -1 among the first 2010 coefficients (excluding the leading coefficient).

To assist in conjecture, we'll enumerate smaller degree polynomials (e.g., degree 5 or 6), checking all ±1 coefficient assignments with leading coefficient 1, no real roots, and count how many -1 coefficients appear. We'll print all such counts and identify the maximum count for those special polynomials, aiming to observe any pattern.

```python
import numpy as np
from itertools import product

def has_no_real_roots(coeffs):
    # coeffs given from lowest degree to highest, numpy expects highest first
    p = np.poly1d(coeffs[::-1])
    roots = p.roots
    return not np.any(np.isreal(roots))

def enumerate_poly(degree):
    # degree = polynomial degree, coeffs[i] for x^i, coeffs[degree] = 1 fixed
    max_neg = -1
    print(f"Degree: {degree}")
    for signs in product([-1,1], repeat=degree):
        coeffs = list(signs) + [1]  # last coeff is leading coeff
        if has_no_real_roots(coeffs):
            neg_count = sum(c == -1 for c in coeffs[:-1])
            print(f"Neg count: {neg_count}, Coeffs: {coeffs}")
            if neg_count > max_neg:
                max_neg = neg_count
    print(f"Max neg count for degree {degree}: {max_neg}\n")

for deg in [3,4,5,6]:
    enumerate_poly(deg)
```
This program enumerates ±1 polynomials with leading coefficient 1, prints all no-real-root polynomials' negative coefficients count, and the maximal such count, helping to conjecture about the original problem.
