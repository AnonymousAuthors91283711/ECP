The problem involves finding the smallest number \( m \) of "guesses" of functions from \( \text{Fin } n \) to \( \text{Fin } 2 \) such that for any function \( s \), if there exists a function \( t \) matching all guesses at exactly \( k \) differing points, then \( s = t \). This is related to error-correcting or distinguishing sets.

To enumerate candidates for \( m \) for small \( n, k \), we can:
- Represent functions \( \text{Fin } n \to \text{Fin } 2 \) as bitstrings of length \( n \).
- The guesses are subsets of these functions.
- For each \( m \) starting from 1, enumerate subsets of functions of size \( m \).
- For each subset, verify the distinguishing property: for each \( s \), if a \( t \) exists such that for all \( u \in \text{guesses}, \) the Hamming distance between \( u \) and \( t \) is exactly \( k \), then \( s = t \). If true for all \( s \), record \( m \).

We'll try small parameters \( n = 3, k = 1 \) and \( n = 4, k = 1 \) due to combinatorial explosion.

```python
from itertools import product, combinations

def hamming_distance(a, b):
    return sum(x != y for x, y in zip(a, b))

def all_functions(n):
    # All functions Fin n -> Fin 2 as bit tuples
    return list(product((0,1), repeat=n))

def check_guess_set(n, k, guesses):
    funcs = all_functions(n)
    for s in funcs:
        # For s, find functions t so that for all u in guesses,
        # Hamming distance(u,t) = k implies s = t.
        candidates = []
        for t in funcs:
            if all(hamming_distance(u, t) == k for u in guesses):
                candidates.append(t)
        # If no candidates or s not in candidates, continue
        if not candidates:
            continue
        # If s not unique, fail:
        if len(candidates) != 1 or candidates[0] != s:
            return False
    return True

def enumerate_answers(ns_ks, max_m=8):
    for n, k in ns_ks:
        print(f"Parameters n={n}, k={k}")
        funcs = all_functions(n)
        # Try increasing guess set sizes m
        found = False
        for m in range(1, max_m+1):
            print(f"Trying m={m} ...")
            # Enumerate guess subsets of size m
            for guesses in combinations(funcs, m):
                if check_guess_set(n, k, guesses):
                    print(f"Candidate m={m}, guesses={guesses}")
                    found = True
                    break
            if found:
                print(f"Minimum m for n={n}, k={k} is {m}\n")
                break
        if not found:
            print(f"No candidate found up to m={max_m} for n={n}, k={k}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Sample parameters (small n,k)
    enumerate_answers([(3,1),(4,1)])
```
This program enumerates candidate minimal numbers \( m \) for small \( (n,k) \) and prints candidates immediately when found. It prioritizes exact checking by brute force. Adjust `max_m` or parameters for deeper search if needed.
