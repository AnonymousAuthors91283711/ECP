theorem omnimath4312 (x y : ℤ) :
    x^3 - y^3 = 2 * x * y + 8 ↔ (x, y) ∈ omnimath4312_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(2, 0), (0, -2)}
Proposed Answer: {(0, -2), (2, 0)}
<<<True>>>
The two answers are equivalent because they contain the same pairs, just in a different order. Sets are unordered collections, so the order of elements doesn't matter for equality. Both answers correctly identify the integer solutions to the equation x³ - y³ = 2xy + 8.
