This problem involves solving the equation \( 5 \log_2 x = 40 \) for \( x > 0 \).

Rewriting the equation gives \(\log_2 x = 8\), so \( x = 2^8 = 256 \).

To assist in conjecturing this, the Python program will enumerate values of \(x = 2^n\) for integer \(n\), calculate \(5 \log_2 x\), and identify when it equals 40.

```python
import math

print("Enumerating powers of 2 and checking 5 * log2(x) = 40")

# We'll try n from 1 up to 20 (just some sample values)
for n in range(1, 21):
    x = 2 ** n
    val = 5 * math.log2(x)
    print(f"x=2^{n}={x}, 5*log2(x)={val}")
    if val == 40:
        print(f"FOUND exact solution: x = {x}")

print("Conjectured answer: x = 256")
```
