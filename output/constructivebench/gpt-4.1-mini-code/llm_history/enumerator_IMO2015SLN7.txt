The problem asks to study for which \( k \in \mathbb{N} \) there exists a function \( f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \) such that for every distinct \( m,n \), the gcd of \( f(m)+n \) and \( f(n)+m \) is at most \( k \).

We want to find possible \( k \) values, starting from small ones, by testing sample simple functions and small ranges, computing gcds, and printing candidates.

```python
from math import gcd

# We try small k, and small f(n) functions on n=1..N, checking gcd conditions
# For efficiency, we test sample f(n): constant, identity, linear, quadratic

def test_k(k, N=10):
    # Test some functions: constant =0, identity n, n+1, 2n, n^2
    funcs = [
        lambda n: 0,
        lambda n: n,
        lambda n: n+1,
        lambda n: 2*n,
        lambda n: n*n,
    ]
    for f_idx, f in enumerate(funcs):
        max_gcd = 0
        ok = True
        for m in range(1, N+1):
            for n in range(1, N+1):
                if m != n:
                    g = gcd(f(m)+n, f(n)+m)
                    if g > k:
                        ok = False
                        break
                    if g > max_gcd:
                        max_gcd = g
            if not ok:
                break
        if ok:
            print(f"k={k} works with function {f.__name__ if hasattr(f,'__name__') else f_idx}, max gcd observed = {max_gcd}")
    return

print("Enumerating possible k with samples and testing sample functions on n=1..10")

for k in range(1, 20):
    test_k(k)
```
