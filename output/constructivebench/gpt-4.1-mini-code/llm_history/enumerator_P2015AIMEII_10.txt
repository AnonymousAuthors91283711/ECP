The problem is to count the number of permutations σ of {0,1,...,6} such that for all i in {0,...,5}, σ(i) ≤ σ(i+1) + 1. We want to enumerate permutations meeting this condition and count them.

We will:
- Generate permutations of [0..6]
- Check the condition σ(i) ≤ σ(i+1)+1 for 0 ≤ i ≤ 5
- Print permutations satisfying the condition (as lists)
- Print the total count.

This will help conjecture the exact number.

```python
from itertools import permutations

def condition(perm):
    return all(perm[i] <= perm[i+1] + 1 for i in range(6))

count = 0
for perm in permutations(range(7)):
    if condition(perm):
        print(list(perm))
        count += 1

print("Total count:", count)
```
