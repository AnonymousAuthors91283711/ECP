The problem appears to characterize pairs of positive integers (m, n) such that both divide an expression of the form \(9^{|m-n|} + 3^{|m-n|} + 1\). To assist in understanding this set, we'll enumerate pairs (m, n) for small values and check the divisibility conditions.

We'll consider \(m,n \in [1..15]\) and for each pair compute \(k = |m-n|\), evaluate the expression \(9^k + 3^k + 1\), and check if both m and n divide it. Each time the condition holds, we'll print the pair and the value k.

```python
# Enumerate pairs (m,n) with 1 <= m,n <= 15
# Check if m|(9^k + 3^k + 1) and n|(9^k + 3^k + 1), where k=|m-n|
# Print pairs immediately when found

def expr(k):
    return 9**k + 3**k + 1

max_val = 15
for m in range(1, max_val+1):
    for n in range(1, max_val+1):
        if m > 0 and n > 0:
            k = abs(m - n)
            val = expr(k)
            # Check divisibility only if k>=0, val for k=0 is 3
            if val % m == 0 and val % n == 0:
                print(f"(m,n)=({m},{n}), k={k}, val={val}")
```
