Ground Truth Answer: 20
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves logarithmic equations with constraints x,y > 0 and x,y ≠ 1.
2. We have two equations: log₂x = log_y16 and xy = 64.
3. We need to find (log₂(x/y))².

The ground truth answer is 20, while the proposed answer is 4.

Let's verify:
From h1: log₂x = log_y16 = log_y(2⁴) = 4/log₂y
Let a = log₂x and b = log₂y
Then a = 4/b ⇒ ab = 4
From xy = 64 ⇒ log₂(xy) = 6 ⇒ a + b = 6
We have a + b = 6 and ab = 4
Then (a - b)² = (a + b)² - 4ab = 36 - 16 = 20
But (a - b) = log₂x - log₂y = log₂(x/y)
Thus (log₂(x/y))² = 20

The proposed answer 4 is incorrect as it doesn't match the derivation. The correct answer is indeed 20.
