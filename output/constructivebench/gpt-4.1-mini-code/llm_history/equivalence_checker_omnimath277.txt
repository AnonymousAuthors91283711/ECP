Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => if n % 2 = 0 then ((n / 2) : ℝ) / ((n / 2 + 1) : ℝ) else 1
<<<None>>>

Since the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's intentionally left undefined in Lean), we cannot verify the correctness of the proposed answer. The proposed answer provides a concrete formula, but without knowing the intended solution, we cannot determine if they're equivalent. The problem appears to be about polynomial interpolation with specific evaluation points, and the proposed answer suggests a pattern based on parity of n, but we lack the necessary information to confirm its validity.
