The problem asks for the smallest difference \( d \) between two factors \( a \) and \( b \) of 2010 such that \( a > b \).

We enumerate divisors \( b \) of 2010, compute \( a = \frac{2010}{b} \), and find their difference \( d = a - b \). We print all differences and track the minimum.

```python
# Enumerate factor pairs (a,b) of 2010 with a > b and print their differences.
# At the end, print the minimal difference found.

def factors(n):
    for b in range(1, int(n**0.5)+1):
        if n % b == 0:
            a = n // b
            if a > b:
                yield a, b

n = 2010
min_diff = None
for a, b in factors(n):
    d = a - b
    print(f"a={a}, b={b}, difference={d}")
    if min_diff is None or d < min_diff:
        min_diff = d

print(f"Minimal difference: {min_diff}")
```
