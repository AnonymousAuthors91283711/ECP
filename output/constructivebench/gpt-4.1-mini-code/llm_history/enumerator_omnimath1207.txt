The problem asks for the count of positive integers n â‰¤ 420 such that the remainders of n modulo 5, 6, and 7 are all distinct.

We'll enumerate n in [1..420], check the distinctness condition on the triplet (n%5, n%6, n%7), print each n satisfying the property, count them, and finally print the total count.

```python
# Enumerate n with distinct remainders mod 5,6,7 for n in 1..420
def main():
    count = 0
    moduli = [5,6,7]
    for n in range(1,421):
        remainders = [n % m for m in moduli]
        # Check pairwise distinctness of remainders
        if len(set(remainders)) == 3:
            print(n)
            count += 1
    print("Total count:", count)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
