The problem asks for counting 4-element subsets \( S \subseteq \{0,1,\dots,9\} \) (modeled as Fin 10) such that there exists an injective function \( f: \{0,1,2,3\} \to \{0,\dots,9\} \) with image \( S \) and for every \( i \), the absolute difference between \( f(i) \) and \( f((i+1) \bmod 4) \) is at least 4.

In simpler terms, we want to count 4-subsets of \(\{0,\ldots,9\}\) that can be arranged as a 4-cycle where each consecutive pair differs by at least 4.

My plan for enumeration:

- Enumerate all 4-element subsets \(S\) of \(\{0,\ldots,9\}\).
- For each \(S\), check if there is a labeling (bijection) \(f : \{0,1,2,3\} \to S\) such that the circular adjacency differences \(|f(i) - f(i+1 \bmod 4)| \geq 4\).
- To maximize efficiency, we should generate permutations of the 4 elements in \(S\), checking if any such permutation meets the difference condition.
- Print each such subset immediately upon discovery.
- After enumerating all, print the total count.

We keep output minimal and within token limits by printing subsets as sorted tuples.

```python
# Enumerate 4-subsets of {0,...,9} that can be arranged in a 4-cycle
# with differences ≥4 between consecutive elements on cycle

from itertools import combinations, permutations

N = 10
k = 4

def diff_ok(p):
    # Check circular adjacent differences ≥4
    for i in range(k):
        if abs(p[i] - p[(i+1)%k]) <4:
            return False
    return True

count = 0
for subset in combinations(range(N), k):
    # Check permutations of subset for difference condition
    for p in permutations(subset):
        if diff_ok(p):
            print("Valid subset:", tuple(sorted(subset)))
            count += 1
            break  # Found one ordering, no need to check others

print("Total count of valid subsets:", count)
```
