The problem involves finding the largest size k of a white set on an 8x8 grid, given 6 black points with distinct rows and columns, such that every white point shares a row or column with every black point, and both sets have no row/column conflicts internally.

We'll enumerate possible black sets with 6 points, then find white points satisfying conditions, and print candidate k values. We'll sample a few black sets to keep output reasonable.

```python
from itertools import combinations, product

def row_col_distinct(pts):
    rows = set()
    cols = set()
    for r,c in pts:
        if r in rows or c in cols:
            return False
        rows.add(r)
        cols.add(c)
    return True

def whites_compatible(black_set):
    # white points must share row or col with every black point
    compatible = set()
    for r in range(8):
        for c in range(8):
            if (r,c) in black_set:
                continue
            # check âˆ€ b in black: b.row == r or b.col == c
            if all(b[0] == r or b[1] == c for b in black_set):
                compatible.add((r,c))
    return compatible

def white_sets(whites):
    # white points distinct rows and cols
    # maximum size sets of whites such that no two share row or col
    # This is a maximum matching problem in bipartite graph of rows and columns in whites
    # Maximum set is max matching size.
    # We find max sets by recursive search (small scale)
    max_set = []
    def backtrack(chosen, rows_used, cols_used, whites_list):
        nonlocal max_set
        if len(chosen) > len(max_set):
            max_set = chosen[:]
        for i,(r,c) in enumerate(whites_list):
            if r not in rows_used and c not in cols_used:
                backtrack(chosen+[(r,c)], rows_used|{r}, cols_used|{c}, whites_list[i+1:])
    white_list = list(whites)
    backtrack([], set(), set(), white_list)
    return max_set

def print_result(black, white):
    print(f"Black points: {sorted(black)}")
    print(f"White points ({len(white)}): {sorted(white)}\n")

def main():
    # We sample a few black sets with 6 points all row,col distinct for efficiency
    # Total choices: choose 6 rows from 8 and assign 6 cols from 8 (permutation)
    # We'll try 3 choices for rows and permutations of cols for them
    from itertools import permutations
    rows_samples = [
        (0,1,2,3,4,5),
        (1,2,3,4,5,6),
        (2,3,4,5,6,7)
    ]
    count = 0
    for rows in rows_samples:
        for cols in permutations(range(8),6):
            black = set(zip(rows, cols))
            if not row_col_distinct(black):
                continue
            whites = whites_compatible(black)
            white_max = white_sets(whites)
            print_result(black, white_max)
            count += 1
            if count >= 5:  # limit output
                break
        if count >= 5:
            break
    max_k = max(len(white_max) for _ in range(count))
    print(f"Candidates found (white set sizes): at least up to {max_k}")
