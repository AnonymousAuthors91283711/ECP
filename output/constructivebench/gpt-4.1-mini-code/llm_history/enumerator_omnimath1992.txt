The problem describes a function \( f:\mathbb{Q} \times \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{Q} \) such that for all \(x,y\), there exist rational numbers \(a,b,c,d\) depending implicitly on \(x,y\) with:

\[ f(x,y) = a \cdot x \cdot y + b \cdot x + c \cdot y + d \]

However, the problem implies that these coefficients \(a,b,c,d\) are chosen per point \((x,y)\) to represent \(f(x,y)\). We have some concrete values:

- \(f(3,3) = \frac{1}{9}\)
- \(f(3,4) = \frac{1}{12}\)
- \(f(4,3) = \frac{1}{12}\)
- \(f(4,4) = \frac{1}{16}\)

The goal is to find \(f(5,5)\).

This suggests that the function \(f\) behaves as the function \(f(x,y) = \frac{1}{xy}\), which satisfies the points:

- \(f(3,3) = \frac{1}{9}\)
- \(f(3,4) = \frac{1}{12}\), etc.

Moreover, the expression given indicates that we can write \(f(x,y)\) in the form:

\[
f(x,y) = axy + bx + cy + d
\]

for some \(a,b,c,d \in \mathbb{Q}\) that depend on \(x,y\). They do not say that \(a,b,c,d\) are constants. Rather, for every \((x,y)\), there exists such linear coefficients \(a,b,c,d\) that the value holds. Thus, the function is arbitrary but locally affine in terms of those four monomials.

But with the system, if \(f(x,y) = \frac{1}{xy}\), can we represent \(\frac{1}{xy}\) as \(a x y + b x + c y + d\) for some rational \(a,b,c,d\)? No, unless the coefficients depend on \(x,y\), which the problem allows.

Hence, the problem might be to identify what \(f(5,5) = ?\), consistent with this property and the given values.

A reasonable conjecture is that \(f(x,y) = \frac{1}{xy}\), so \(f(5,5) = \frac{1}{25}\).

I will write a program that enumerates all quadruples \((a,b,c,d)\) of rational numbers with numerators and denominators within a range, for each given point, that satisfy the equation \(f(x,y) = a x y + b x + c y + d\). Then try to find a consistent formula or output possible values \(f(5,5)\).

Because the problem size is small and the code must print partial results immediately, I'll try with integers from -5 to 5, denominators 1 to 5, and print possible \(f(5,5)\) values from these linear forms that work for the given points.

Due to problem constraints, I'll enumerate possible form coefficients for the four points and output candidate results for \(f(5,5)\).

                yield Fraction(n,d)
