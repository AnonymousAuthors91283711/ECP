The problem is about characterizing all functions \( f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) satisfying a certain functional equation on positive real numbers, together with positivity conditions. To explore possible solutions, we try specific values of \( x \) and \( y \) and look for patterns in \( f \).

Below is a Python program that tests possible candidate functions \( f(x) = c x^k \) for small rational exponents \( k \) and constants \( c \), to see if they approximately satisfy the given functional equation on positive values \( x, y > 0 \).

This may help conjecture the explicit form of \( f \) that solves the equation. We print candidates \( (c, k) \) that yield small errors.

```python
import math

def f(c, k, x):
    # Candidate function f(x) = c * x^k
    try:
        return c * (x ** k)
    except:
        return None

def check_identity(c, k, xs, ys):
    # Check the functional equation on sample points (x,y)
    # f(y * f(x)^3 + x) ?= x^3 * f(y) + f(x)
    max_err = 0
    for x in xs:
        fx = f(c, k, x)
        if fx is None or fx <= 0:
            return None  # f must be positive on x>0
        for y in ys:
            fy = f(c, k, y)
            if fy is None or fy <= 0:
                return None
            left_arg = y * (fx**3) + x
            fl = f(c, k, left_arg)
            if fl is None:
                return None
            right = (x**3)*fy + fx
            err = abs(fl - right) / (1 + abs(fl) + abs(right))
            if err > max_err:
                max_err = err
    return max_err

def main():
    # Sample positive x,y values
    xs = [0.5, 1, 2]
    ys = [0.5, 1, 2]

    # Search small ranges for c,k
    for k_num in range(0,7):
        for k_den in [1,2,3]:
            k = k_num / k_den
            for c in [0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1, 2, 3]:
                err = check_identity(c, k, xs, ys)
                if err is not None and err < 1e-6:
                    print(f"Candidate: c={c}, k={k}; max relative error={err:.2e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This attempts simple power functions \( f(x) = c x^k \) and prints those that satisfy the functional equation nearly exactly on sample points. Adjusting the sampled points or candidate values may yield further insights.
