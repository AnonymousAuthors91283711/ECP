The problem gives averages of triples of four natural numbers a, b, c, d, and asks for the maximum among a, b, c, d. We want to enumerate possible (a,b,c,d) satisfying the averages:

(a + b + c)/3 = 32  
(a + b + d)/3 = 39  
(a + c + d)/3 = 40  
(b + c + d)/3 = 44  

From these, each triple sum is known:  
a + b + c = 96  
a + b + d = 117  
a + c + d = 120  
b + c + d = 132  

We want to find all quadruples (a,b,c,d) of natural numbers (â„•, presumably starting at 0) fitting these sums, and print their maximum value max(a,b,c,d). We'll enumerate candidate values for a,b,c,d that satisfy the equations exactly and print on the fly. The sums imply a system we can solve. Start by enumerating a in a small range, then solve for b,c,d.

We'll try a from 0 to 50 for efficiency and reasonability (these sums imply values around 30-40). For each a, solve the system for b,c,d. If they are natural numbers and sums are correct, print the quadruple and max.

```python
# Enumerate natural numbers a,b,c,d satisfying: 
# a+b+c=96, a+b+d=117, a+c+d=120, b+c+d=132
# Print all valid tuples and max(a,b,c,d)

def main():
    # Given sums
    sum_abc = 96
    sum_abd = 117
    sum_acd = 120
    sum_bcd = 132

    # From the sums:
    # sum_abc = a+b+c = 96
    # sum_abd = a+b+d = 117
    # sum_acd = a+c+d = 120
    # sum_bcd = b+c+d = 132

    # Adding all four sums:
    # (a+b+c) + (a+b+d) + (a+c+d) + (b+c+d) = 96+117+120+132 = 465
    # Left side = 3(a+b+c+d)
    # => 3*(a+b+c+d) = 465 => a+b+c+d = 155

    # So sum_abcd = 155

    # From sum_abc = 96 => c = 96 - a - b
    # From sum_abd = 117 => d = 117 - a - b

    # Check sum_acd = 120 => a + c + d = 120
    # Substitute c,d:
    # a + (96 - a - b) + (117 - a - b) = 120
    # a + 96 - a - b + 117 - a - b = 120
    # 213 - 2b - a = 120
    # -2b - a = -93
    # 2b + a = 93

    # Similarly, sum_bcd = 132 => b + c + d = 132
    # b + (96 - a - b) + (117 - a - b) = 132
    # b + 96 - a - b + 117 - a - b = 132
    # 213 - 2a - b = 132
    # -2a - b = -81
    # 2a + b = 81

    # We now have a linear system:
    # 2b + a = 93
    # 2a + b = 81

    # Solve for a,b:
    # From first: a = 93 - 2b
    # Substitute into second:
    # 2(93 - 2b) + b = 81
    # 186 -4b + b = 81
    # 186 -3b = 81
    # -3b = -105
    # b = 35
    # Then a = 93 - 2*35 = 93 -70=23

    # Then c = 96 - a - b = 96 -23 -35=38
    # d = 117 - a - b = 117 -23 -35=59

    a,b,c,d = 23,35,38,59
    print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}; max={max(a,b,c,d)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
