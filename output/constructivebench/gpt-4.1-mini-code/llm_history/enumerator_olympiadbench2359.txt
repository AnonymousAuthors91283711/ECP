The problem asks to find the unique positive real number \(x\) satisfying
\[
x \cdot \lfloor x \rfloor = 17.
\]
We want to enumerate possible candidates for \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) (which is a positive integer) and solve for \(x = \frac{17}{\lfloor x \rfloor}\), then check if \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) is indeed the floor of this value.

```python
# Enumerate candidates for floor(x), check if x * floor(x) = 17 and floor(x) = floor(x)
for n in range(1, 18):  # floor(x) = n must satisfy n * x =17 => x = 17/n; n<=floor(x)<x<n+1
    x = 17 / n
    if n <= x < n + 1:
        print(f"Possible floor(x) = {n}, x = {x}")
        answer = x

print(f"Unique solution x = {answer}")
```
