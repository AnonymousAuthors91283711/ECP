Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {(1, 0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1, 0), (2, 2, 1, 1), (3, 0, 0, 1)}
<<<None>>>
Since the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's intentionally left undefined in Lean), we cannot verify whether the proposed answer matches it. The proposed answer provides specific solutions, but without knowing the intended correct answer, we cannot determine equivalence.
