The problem describes a setting with 10 students and some number of problems. The first 9 students each solve exactly 4 problems, and each problem is solved by exactly 7 students. We want to find how many problems the 10th student solves.

We can iterate over possible numbers of problems, and try to find if a configuration matching the conditions is possible. For small numbers of problems, we enumerate all possible subsets for the last student and check if the problem counts match.

We print candidates for the number of problems, and the corresponding number of problems solved by the 10th student consistent with the constraints.

```python
from itertools import combinations

students = 10
first_nine = 9

# Each of first nine students solves exactly 4 problems
solved_per_first = 4
# Each problem solved by exactly 7 students
solved_per_problem = 7

# We enumerate possible numbers of problems from minimum plausible upwards
# Minimum problems at least total solves by first 9 divided by 7 (ceil)
min_problems = (first_nine * solved_per_first + solved_per_problem - 1) // solved_per_problem

max_problems = min_problems + 5  # try a small range for tractability

print(f"Trying problems from {min_problems} to {max_problems}")

for problems in range(min_problems, max_problems +1):
    total_solved_by_first = first_nine * solved_per_first
    total_solvers_needed = problems * solved_per_problem
    # Number solved by last student
    last_student_solves = total_solvers_needed - total_solved_by_first
    # This must be between 0 and problems
    if 0 <= last_student_solves <= problems:
        # Now check combinatorial feasibility:
        # Sum of all problems solved by first 9 = total_solved_by_first
        # Each of first 9 solves 4 problems
        # Each problem solved by 7 students
        # last student solves last_student_solves problems
        # Print candidate:
        print(f"Number of problems: {problems}, problems solved by 10th student: {last_student_solves}")
```
