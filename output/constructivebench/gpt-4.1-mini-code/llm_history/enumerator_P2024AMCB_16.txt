The problem concerns finding the greatest exponent r such that a given expression equals \(3^r \times M\), where \(M\) is a positive integer not divisible by 3. To help conjecture the answer, we'll compute the expression step-by-step, factor out powers of 3, and print possible values of \(r\).

```python
from math import factorial
from math import log

# Expression:
# (16! / (4!^4 * 24)) * (4*3)^4 = 3^r * M, with M not divisible by 3

def v3(n):
    # Count exponent of 3 in n
    count = 0
    while n % 3 == 0 and n > 0:
        n //= 3
        count += 1
    return count

def v3_factorial(n):
    # Count exponent of 3 in n!
    count = 0
    x = 3
    while x <= n:
        count += n // x
        x *= 3
    return count

def main():
    # Compute numerator and denominator parts:
    # numerator = 16! * (4*3)^4
    # denominator = (4!)^4 * 24

    f16 = factorial(16)
    f4 = factorial(4)
    numerator = f16 * (4*3)**4
    denominator = (f4**4) * 24

    val = numerator // denominator

    # Factor out powers of 3 from val
    r = v3(val)
    M = val // (3**r)

    if M % 3 == 0:
        print("M is divisible by 3, not valid decomposition.")
    else:
        print(f"Found r={r}, M={M} (M not divisible by 3)")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
