[write_program]
The problem relates to pairing points on an \( n \times n \) grid (for odd \( n > 1 \)) with certain adjacency and uniqueness properties, excluding four corners and the center. The goal is to understand for which odd \( n \) such pairs exist.

To assist in conjecturing \( \texttt{omnimath3338\_answer} \), we will enumerate all odd \( n \leq 7 \), and for each, try to find all valid pairing configurations meeting the conditions. The adjacency is defined by "squareAdjacent," which means diagonal neighbors differ by Â±1 in each coordinate.

Given the complexity, we will represent the grid as points, exclude specified points, and attempt to pair the remaining points into disjoint adjacent pairs. Since full exhaustive search is expensive (exponential), we will only do small odd \( n \) values and print pairs found (if any).

The program:
- Iterates over odd \( n = 3,5,7 \) (small samples).
- Lists board points excluding forbidden points.
- Attempts to pair points so every point is in exactly one pair and pairs are diagonally adjacent.
- When a valid configuration is found, prints \( n \) and the pairs.
- Prints when no pairing found for a given \( n \).

This enumeration can help conjecture valid \( n \) and corresponding possible pairings.
