The theorem seems related to finding the minimal number \( k \) such that for every relation \( f \) on an \( n \times m \) grid with a given condition (at most one "marked" element per row), if the total marks are at most 3000, then there exist \( k \) rows and \( k \) columns covering all the marked points. The problem resembles a combinatorial covering or a vertex cover problem on bipartite graphs like the KÃ¶nig's theorem context.

Let's write a Python program to explore values of \( n, m, k \) near the given 2011 for small sizes and check the condition manually on small grids to conjecture the minimal \( k \). We fix \( n = m \) for simplicity and enumerate all subsets \( f \) with "one mark per row at most" and total marks \(\le 3000\) (small due to complexity). We then check minimal \( k \) covering rows and columns. We print candidates \( k \) whenever found.

```python
# Enumerate minimal k covering sets of rows and columns for sets f with the property:
# - f subset of (rows x cols) with at most one mark per row
# - total marks <= limit (use smaller limit for runtime)
# Goal: For each n=m, find minimal k that covers all marks in f by k rows and k columns.

from itertools import combinations, product

def minimal_cover(n, limit):
    # Enumerate all f with at most one mark per row and total marks <= limit
    # For small n to keep runtime manageable
    # Output each candidate (n, total_marks, minimal k)
    rows = range(n)
    cols = range(n)
    
    # Generate all possible functions f: from rows to columns or no mark (None)
    # i.e. partial functions with domain size <= limit
    # Implementation: for each size s <= limit, choose s rows,
    # for each of these rows choose a column.
    
    for s in range(1, min(limit, n)+1):
        for row_subset in combinations(rows, s):
            # Assign a column to each selected row - product of size s columns each from n choices
            for col_choices in product(cols, repeat=s):
                f = dict(zip(row_subset, col_choices))  # partial function
                
                # Check minimal k
                # We try k from 1 up to s (max needed)
                # For this f, find minimal k s.t exists k rows and k cols covering all marks
                marks = [(r, c) for r,c in f.items()]

                    # Try all k-subsets of rows and k-subsets of columns to cover all marks
                    row_subsets = combinations(rows, k)
