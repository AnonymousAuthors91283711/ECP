The problem involves finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all numbers of the form \(2002^n + 2\) for \(n \geq 1\). Our goal is to find the maximum natural number \(d\) that divides all these numbers.

We will:
- Compute the GCD for several values of \(n\).
- Use Python's `math.gcd` to recursively find the GCD of the sequence.
- Print GCD candidates for increasing \(n\) until a stable GCD is found.
  
This approach helps us conjecture the maximal \(d\).

```python
from math import gcd

def main():
    base = 2002
    # Compute gcd(2002^1 + 2, 2002^2 + 2, ..., 2002^n + 2) incrementally
    current_gcd = 0
    max_n = 10  # small sample to find pattern
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        val = pow(base, n) + 2
        current_gcd = gcd(current_gcd, val)
        print(f"n={n}, val={val}, current_gcd={current_gcd}")

    print(f"Conjectured maximum gcd dividing all 2002^n+2 is {current_gcd}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
