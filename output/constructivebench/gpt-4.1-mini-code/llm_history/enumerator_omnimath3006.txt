The problem asks to find \( n \in \mathbb{N} \) such that \(4^n = 64^2\).

By rewriting:
- \(64 = 4^3\),
- So \(64^2 = (4^3)^2 = 4^{6}\).

Thus, \(4^n = 4^6 \implies n = 6\).

The program below enumerates \(n\) from 0 to 10 to find all \(n\) with \(4^n = 64^2\), printing candidates immediately:

```python
# Enumerate n to solve 4^n = 64^2 and print candidates immediately.

def main():
    target = 64 ** 2
    print(f"Target value: 64^2 = {target}")
    for n in range(11):
        val = 4 ** n
        if val == target:
            print(f"Found n = {n} with 4^{n} = {val}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
