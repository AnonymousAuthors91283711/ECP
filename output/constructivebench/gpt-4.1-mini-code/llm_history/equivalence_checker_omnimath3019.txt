Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: 9 * 5
Let me analyze this problem and the proposed answer.

The problem states:
Given that 3^x = 5, we need to find the value of 3^(x+2).

The proposed answer is 9 * 5.

Let's verify:
3^(x+2) = 3^x * 3^2 = (3^x) * 9
But we know from the given condition that 3^x = 5
Therefore, 3^(x+2) = 5 * 9 = 45

The proposed answer 9 * 5 is indeed equal to 45 and correctly follows from the given conditions.

<<<True>>>
