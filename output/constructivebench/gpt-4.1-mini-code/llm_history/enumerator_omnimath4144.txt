This problem involves a strictly increasing sequence \( a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \) such that every natural number \( n \) can be uniquely written in the form

\[
n = a_i + 2 a_j + 4 a_k,
\]

with \( i,j,k \in \mathbb{N} \). The question is to find \( a_{1998} \) under these conditions.

To assist in conjecturing the true answer, the Python program below attempts to enumerate possible sequences \( a \) with small values for initial terms and checks the uniqueness and coverage properties for numbers up to a certain threshold. It prints candidate sequences that satisfy these properties, aiming to identify patterns and potentially the exact \( a_{1998} \).

```python
# Enumerate candidate strictly increasing sequences a, satisfying
# uniqueness and coverage of n by n = a_i + 2 a_j + 4 a_k.
# We consider small initial sequences and verify conditions for n <= 100.
# Print partial results to guide conjecture on a.

def check_uniqueness_and_coverage(a, max_n):
    # Check if every n in 0..max_n can be uniquely represented as a_i + 2 a_j + 4 a_k
    represent = {}
    length = len(a)
    for n in range(max_n + 1):
        reps = []
        for i in range(length):
            ai = a[i]
            if ai > n:
                break
            for j in range(length):
                val_j = 2 * a[j]
                if ai + val_j > n:
                    break
                for k in range(length):
                    val_k = 4 * a[k]
                    s = ai + val_j + val_k
                    if s == n:
                        reps.append((i,j,k))
                    if s > n:
                        break
        if len(reps) == 0 or len(reps) > 1:
            return False
        represent[n] = reps[0]
    return True
