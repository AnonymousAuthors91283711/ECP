theorem P2008AIMEI_4 :
  ∃! (xy : ℕ × ℕ), 0 < xy.1 ∧ 0 < xy.2 ∧ xy.1^2 + 84 * xy.1 + 2008 = xy.2^2 ∧
  P2008AIMEI_4_answer xy = 80 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating (x,y) with x,y > 0 satisfying x^2 + 84x + 2008 = y^2
x=18, y=62, y^2=3844. Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ → ℕ
<<<fun xy => if xy = (18, 62) then 80 else 0>>>
