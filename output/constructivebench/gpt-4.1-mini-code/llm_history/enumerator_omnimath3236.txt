The problem seems related to combinatorics or linear algebra involving matrices indexed over finite sets, and conditions controlling zero diagonal elements of products. Considering the abstractness, we try small n and enumerate feasible k.

Below Python code:
- Enumerates n = 1, 2, 3 as sample parameters.
- For each n, tries increasing k and detects a criterion based on an interpretation of zero diagonal entries in product matrices.
- Prints possible k values satisfying simplified feasibility heuristics to conjecture omnimath3236_answer(n).

```python
# Exploring feasible k values for given n in a matrix product problem with zero diagonals
# The problem relates to existence of M,N: Fin k → Matrices Fin n x Fin n ℝ with diagonal zero-product conditions.
# We attempt small n and increasing k to find possible values supporting the condition.

import numpy as np

def zero_diag_product_condition(n, k):
    # Heuristic check:
    # We try to build matrices M[i], N[j] so that (M[i]*N[j]) has zero diagonal iff i != j.
    # Construct "indicator" M, N matrices approximating such condition.
    # For small n,k we try simple rank-1 matrices and check diagonals.
    # If count(i != j with zero diag) == k*k - k and count(i==j with nonzero diag) == k,
    # we consider condition met.
    mats_M = [np.eye(n) for _ in range(k)]
    mats_N = [np.eye(n) for _ in range(k)]
    # Modify to attempt condition:
    # For i!=j, diag zero: enforce product zero diagonal
    # We test a simple construction with sparse rank-1 matrices
    for i in range(k):
        for j in range(k):

                mats_M[i][j % n,j % n] = 0
            else:
                mats_M[i][j % n,j % n] = 1
