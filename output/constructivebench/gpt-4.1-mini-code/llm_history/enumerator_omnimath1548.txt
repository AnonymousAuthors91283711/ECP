The problem involves finding the greatest pair of natural numbers \((p_1, p_2)\) such that:
- \(p_1 < p_2\),
- Neither \(p_1\) nor \(p_2\) can be represented as \(19x + 9y + 8z\) for natural numbers \(x,y,z\),
- Every number greater than \(p_2\) can be so represented.

This is related to the Frobenius coin problem or the concept of the largest nonrepresentable numbers given the set {8,9,19}. We want to enumerate pairs \((p_1, p_2)\) by checking representability of numbers and find the greatest such pair where both are nonrepresentable but everything greater than \(p_2\) is representable.

We'll:
- Enumerate pairs \(p_1 < p_2\) in some range (up to a reasonable max, like 100),
- Check representability,
- Check if beyond \(p_2\), all numbers are representable (up to some threshold),
- Print candidates and finally identify the maximal pair.

```python
# Enumerate pairs (p1, p2) with p1 < p2, both nonrepresentable by 19x+9y+8z, and all > p2 representable.

def can_represent(n, coins):
    # Check if n = 19x+9y+8z for some x,y,z â‰¥ 0
    # Iterate x from 0 to n//19
    for x in range(n//19 +1):
        rem_x = n - 19*x
        if rem_x < 0:
            break
        for y in range(rem_x//9 +1):
            rem_y = rem_x - 9*y
            if rem_y < 0:
                break
            if rem_y % 8 == 0:
                return True
    return False

def main():
    coins = [8,9,19]
    max_n = 100  # Range to search for pairs and test representability beyond p2

    # Precompute which numbers are representable
    representable = [False]*(max_n+50)
    for num in range(max_n+50):
        representable[num] = can_represent(num, coins)

    # Find pairs (p1 < p2) both nonrepresentable
    candidates = []
    for p2 in range(1, max_n+1):
        if representable[p2]:
            continue
        for p1 in range(1, p2):
            if representable[p1]:
                continue
            # Check all numbers > p2 up to p2+50 representable
            # Check "all q > p2" condition approximately
            if all(representable[q] for q in range(p2+1, p2+51)):
                candidates.append((p1,p2))
                print(f"Candidate pair: ({p1},{p2})")

    if candidates:
        max_pair = max(candidates, key=lambda p: p[1])
        print(f"Greatest candidate pair: {max_pair}")
        print(f"Product: {max_pair[0]*max_pair[1]}")

    main()
