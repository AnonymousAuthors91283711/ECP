The problem counts 11x11 matrices with entries between 1 and 2^10 such that row n sums are divisible by 2^n and column n sums are divisible by 2^n for n=0,...,10.

We attempt enumeration over smaller sizes n=1..4 to get insight. We'll fix matrix size `N=4` and max entry `max_val=2^10=1024` but reduce max_val for feasibility in samples. We'll enumerate matrices with entries in [1..max_val] meeting the modular sum conditions. Since brute force on 4x4 with entries 1..1024 is impractical, we'll drastically reduce max_val for demonstration and output found matrices.

```python
# Enumerate small matrices satisfying modular sum constraints for insight.

N = 4        # matrix size (for experimentation, smaller than 11)
max_val = 4  # max entry value (reduced from 2^10=1024 for speed)

moduli = [2**n for n in range(N)]

from itertools import product

def check_matrix(M):
    # Check row sums divisible by 2^n
    for n in range(N):
        s = sum(M[n])
        if s % moduli[n] != 0:
            return False
    # Check column sums divisible by 2^n
    for n in range(N):
        s = sum(M[i][n] for i in range(N))
        if s % moduli[n] != 0:
            return False
    return True

print(f"Enumerating {N}x{N} matrices with entries in [1..{max_val}] meeting modular conditions:")

count = 0
# Generate matrices row by row
rows_possibilities = list(product(range(1, max_val+1), repeat=N))
for matrix_rows in product(rows_possibilities, repeat=N):
    if check_matrix(matrix_rows):
        count += 1
        print(f"Matrix #{count}:")
        for r in matrix_rows:
            print(r)
        print()

print(f"Total count found (N={N}, max_val={max_val}): {count}")
```
This program enumerates small candidate matrices and prints each immediately if it satisfies the constraints. Adjust `N` and `max_val` for manageable runtime and to gather conjectures on the problem structure.
