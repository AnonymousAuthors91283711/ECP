Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: (1/2, 1/2, 1/2)
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer (1/2, 1/2, 1/2) satisfies the condition a*b*c = 1/8 and yields the expression value of 15/16, which matches the equality condition in the theorem. However, the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's unspecified), so we can't confirm if (1/2,1/2,1/2) is the only solution. The proposed answer is correct for the equality case but we can't verify its uniqueness.
