The problem involves a quartic polynomial \( f(x) = x^4 - a x^3 + b x^2 - a x + d \) with roots \( x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 \) all in \([1/2, 2]\), and we want to explore values of the expression
\[
r = \frac{(x_1 + x_2)(x_1 + x_3) x_4}{(x_4 + x_2)(x_4 + x_3) x_1}
\]
to find the greatest possible value \(r\).

To provide insights, we enumerate possible roots within \([1/2, 2]\) (choosing rational points for exactness), compute \(r\), and output these values. Parameters \(a, b, d\) relate to roots through the polynomial, but here we focus directly on roots.

We sample roots from a small set \(\{0.5, 1, 1.5, 2\}\) to keep output manageable, print each evaluated \(r\), and keep track of the maximum.

```python
# Enumerate roots x1,x2,x3,x4 in [0.5,2], sampled from {0.5,1,1.5,2}
# Compute r = ((x1 + x2)*(x1 + x3)*x4)/((x4 + x2)*(x4 + x3)*x1)
# Print each r immediately for streaming insight.
# At the end, print the max r found.

import itertools
from fractions import Fraction

samples = [Fraction(1,2), Fraction(1), Fraction(3,2), Fraction(2)]

max_r = None

print("Enumerating r for roots sampled in {1/2,1,3/2,2}:")

for roots in itertools.product(samples, repeat=4):
    x1, x2, x3, x4 = roots
    # To avoid division by zero, check x1 != 0 and denominator != 0 (always safe here)
    denom = (x4 + x2)*(x4 + x3)*x1
    if denom == 0:
        continue
    num = (x1 + x2)*(x1 + x3)*x4
    r = num / denom
    print(f"roots={roots} -> r={r}")
    if (max_r is None) or (r > max_r):
        max_r = r

print(f"Maximum r found: {max_r}")
```
