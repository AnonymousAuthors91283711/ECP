[write_program]
This problem defines a function `probVisits7` on natural numbers with some base cases and a recursive relation involving averaging the two previous terms. The goal is to find `probVisits7(7)` in lowest terms as a fraction \( \frac{p}{q} \).

I will write a Python program to:
- Compute probVisits7(n) exactly as fractions,
- Print all computed values up to 7,
- Print the simplified fraction for probVisits7(7).

I will store fractions as pairs (numerator, denominator) reduced via gcd, to ensure exact values and coprimality.

```python
from math import gcd

def add_frac(a, b):
    # adds two fractions a=(n1,d1), b=(n2,d2)
    n = a[0]*b[1] + b[0]*a[1]
    d = a[1]*b[1]
    g = gcd(n, d)
    return (n // g, d // g)

def div_by_2(frac):
    # divide fraction by 2: multiply denominator by 2
    n, d = frac
    g = gcd(n, 2*d)
    return (n // g, (2*d) // g)

def probVisits7(n, memo={}):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    if n == 0:
        memo[0] = (0, 1)
    elif n == 1 or n == 2:
        memo[n] = (1, 1)
    else:
        # (probVisits7(n-1) + probVisits7(n-2)) / 2
        f1 = probVisits7(n - 1)
        f2 = probVisits7(n - 2)
        s = add_frac(f1, f2)
        memo[n] = div_by_2(s)
    return memo[n]

def main():
    print("Computing probVisits7(n) for n=0..7")
    for i in range(8):
        p, q = probVisits7(i)
        print(f"probVisits7({i}) = {p}/{q}")
    p7, q7 = probVisits7(7)
    print(f"\nAnswer for probVisits7(7): {p7}/{q7}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
