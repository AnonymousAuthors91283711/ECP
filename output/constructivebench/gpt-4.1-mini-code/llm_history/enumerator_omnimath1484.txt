The problem involves counting functions \( f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}/17\mathbb{Z} \) satisfying two conditions: periodic with period 17, and a functional equation involving squares and shifting by 17. Since \( f(x+17) = f(x) \) for \( x \ge 1 \), the function is completely determined by its values on \( x=1,\ldots,17 \). Condition \( f(x^2) = f(x)^2 + 15 \) applies for \( x \ge 1 \). We want to count how many functions \( f \) from \(\{1,\ldots,17\}\) to \(\mathbb{Z}/17\mathbb{Z}\) satisfy:

- \( f \) is periodic mod 17 (trivially true since domain is size 17),
- \( f(x^2) = f(x)^2 + 15 \) mod 17, for \( x=1,\ldots,16 \) (since \(x^2\) mod 17 ranges over the same set).

Because the domain is \(\mathbb{N}\), and the function is periodic mod 17 for \( x \geq 1 \), it's effectively a function on the multiplicative monoid modulo 17 excluding zero. We can enumerate all possible assignment of \( f(1), \ldots, f(16) \), then determine \( f(0) \) (value at 17 or 0 mod 17).

We'll write a Python program that tries all functions \( f:\{1,\ldots,16\} \to \mathbb{Z}/17\mathbb{Z} \) and checks the condition for all \( x \). The function is determined by \( f(1), \ldots, f(16) \) because of the periodicity modulo 17. Then print the count.

We will try to avoid enumerating all \(17^{16}\) functions (too large), but we can exploit the relations:

- Since \( f(x+17) = f(x) \), for all \( x \ge 1 \), values repeat modulo 17.

- The equation \( f(x^2) = f(x)^2 + 15 \) restricts values.

A better approach:

- Since the domain is \(\{1,...,17\}\) and functions are periodic mod 17, we index elements by residues mod 17 except 0.

- Define \( g(k) := f(k) \), for \( k=1,...,16 \).

- For \( k=1,...,16 \), \( f(k^2 \bmod 17) = f(k)^2 + 15 \) mod 17.

This defines a functional equation on the multiplicative group modulo 17 (which is cyclic of order 16).

Let \( G = \mathbb{Z}_{17}^* = \{1,...,16\} \).

The equation says:

\[
g(k^2) = g(k)^2 + 15 \pmod{17}
\]

So \( g \) is a function on \( G \) satisfying this.

If we consider \( g \) as defined on \( G \), then for each \( k \in G \), \( g(k^2) \) depends on \( g(k) \).

Because \( G \) is cyclic of order 16, generated by some \( a \).

Set \( k = a^m \), then:

\[
g(a^{2m}) = (g(a^m))^2 + 15
\]

We can encode \( g \) as a list \( (g(a^0), g(a^1), ..., g(a^{15})) \) with \( a^0=1 \).

Our goal: find all functions \( g: G \to \mathbb{Z}/17\mathbb{Z} \) satisfying:

\[
g(a^{2m}) = (g(a^m))^2 + 15
\]

We will find all functions \( g \) satisfying this functional equation.

Because \( a^{2m} = a^{2m \bmod 16} \), so indices are modulo 16.

Writing indices modulo 16, the equation is:

\[
g[(2m) \bmod 16] = (g[m])^2 + 15 \pmod{17}, \quad m = 0,..,15
\]

We must find all \( g:[0..15]\to \mathbb{Z}/17\mathbb{Z} \) satisfying this for all \( m=0\ldots 15 \).

We can use the notation \( g_m := g[m] \). Then:

\[
g_{2m \bmod 16} = (g_m)^2 + 15 \pmod{17}
\]

These 16 equations relate the values of \( g \).

To find solutions, we can proceed as:

- Given the function \( g \), for each \( m \), the value at index \( 2m \bmod 16 \) equals \((g_m)^2 + 15\).

- For example, if we know \( g_m \), then \( g_{2m \bmod 16} \) is forced.

- This defines a constraint on the 16 values forming a system of equations.

We can solve this system via DFS or backtracking:

- The permutation \( m \to 2m \bmod 16 \) decomposes into cycles. Each cycle corresponds to an orbit of indices under multiplication by 2 modulo 16.

- For each cycle \( C = \{m, 2m, 4m, ..., 2^{r}m\} \), size \( r \), the values along the cycle obey:

\[
g_{2m} = (g_m)^2 + 15, \quad g_{4m} = (g_{2m})^2 + 15, \quad \ldots
\]

Thus, once \( g_m \) is fixed, the entire cycle's \( g \) values are determined by repeated squaring plus addition.

- So for each cycle, the solution space is the set of \( g_m \in \mathbb{Z}_{17} \) such that the cycle closes perfectly (the composition over the cycle gives the initial value).

To find all solutions:

- For each cycle, try all possible \( g_m \in \mathbb{Z}_{17} \), compute forward values along the cycle, check if the last computed value equals the initial \( g_m \).

- Count how many \( g_m \) satisfy this cycle-closing condition.

- Multiply counts for all cycles to get total number of solutions.

Let's implement this in Python.

Note:

- \(\mathbb{Z}_{17}\) is modulo 17.

- The multiplication by 2 modulo 16 permutes \{0,...,15\}.

- We find cycles of the permutation \( m \to 2m \bmod 16 \).

Our program will:

- Find cycles

- For each cycle, count number of \( g_m \in \{0,...,16\} \) such that cycle closure holds.

- Multiply all counts.

Print each cycle's roots count and total at the end.

```python
# Note: no input, direct output.

def mod17(x):
    return x % 17

def mul2_mod16(x):
    return (2 * x) % 16

def find_cycles():
    seen = [False]*16
    cycles = []
    for i in range(16):
        if not seen[i]:
            c = []
            cur = i
            while not seen[cur]:
                seen[cur] = True
                c.append(cur)
                cur = mul2_mod16(cur)
            cycles.append(c)
    return cycles

def check_cycle(c):
    # For a cycle c = [m0, m1, ..., m_r-1],
    # for a candidate g[m0]=v, define
    # g[m_{i+1}] = (g[m_i])^2 + 15 mod17 (indices mod r)
    # The cycle closure condition: after r steps,
    # starting from v, we get v.
    # Compute g[m_0]=v, then g[m_1],...,g[m_r-1], then check:

    #
    # Return number of v in 0..16 satisfying closure.
    count = 0
    p = 17
    for v in range(p):
        cur = v
        for _ in range(len(c)):
            cur = (cur*cur + 15) % p
        if cur == v:
            count +=1
    return count

def main():
    cycles = find_cycles()
    print("Found cycles (indices modulo 16):")
    for c in cycles:
        print(c)
    counts = []
    for i,c in enumerate(cycles):
        cnt = check_cycle(c)
        print(f"Cycle {i} length {len(c)} has {cnt} roots")
        counts.append(cnt)
    total = 1
    for c in counts:
        total *= c
    print(f"Total number of functions f: {total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This will enumerate possible solutions.

We follow the requirements: print each partial result immediately, no hardcoded answers, no inputs.

The output will show cycles and counts, then the total number of satisfying functions \( f \).
