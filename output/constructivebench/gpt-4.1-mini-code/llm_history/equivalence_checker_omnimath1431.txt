theorem omnimath1431 : 
  sin (1998 + 237) * sin (1998 - 1653) = omnimath1431_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: -1/4
Proposed Answer: (Real.cos 1890 - Real.cos 2580) / 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step.

1. The problem involves evaluating the product of two sine functions: sin(1998+237)*sin(1998-1653)

2. Simplifying the arguments:
   - First term: sin(1998+237) = sin(2235)
   - Second term: sin(1998-1653) = sin(345)

3. The ground truth answer is -1/4

4. The proposed answer uses the trigonometric identity:
   sin A * sin B = (cos(A-B) - cos(A+B))/2
   Applied to our case:
   sin(2235)*sin(345) = (cos(2235-345) - cos(2235+345))/2
                      = (cos(1890) - cos(2580))/2

5. Now let's evaluate the proposed expression:
   - cos(1890) = cos(360*5 + 90) = cos(90) = 0
   - cos(2580) = cos(360*7 + 60) = cos(60) = 1/2
   - Therefore: (0 - 1/2)/2 = -1/4

6. The proposed answer simplifies to the ground truth answer when evaluated.
