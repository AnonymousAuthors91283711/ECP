The problem involves finding the maximum size B of a family S of finite subsets of {1,...,n} with the following properties: each pair of distinct subsets in S intersect, and for each distinct pair of subsets s,t in S, there exists a pair of distinct elements x in s and y in t that have identical membership patterns across all subsets in S. We want to enumerate possible candidates for B given parameters k and n with 2 ≤ k ≤ n.

We will sample small values for k and n, then enumerate all families S of finite subsets of [1..n] of size B, where each subset has size k, and verify the two conditions. We increment B to find maximal sizes.

To keep the output concise, we will limit to small n up to 5 and k up to 3, and limit enumeration scope by symmetries and early pruning.
