This problem involves finding integer coefficients \((a,b,c,d,e,f)\) for a rational function approximation to \(\sqrt[3]{2}\), improving the approximation near \(R=2^{1/3}\). To assist, we enumerate candidate integer tuples \((a,b,c,d,e,f)\) over a small range and calculate the ratio of approximation errors at some rational \(R\) values near the cube root of 2. The goal is to find tuples where the rational function gets closer to \(2^{1/3}\) than \(R\) itself does.

```python
from fractions import Fraction
from math import isclose

# Enumerate small integers for coefficients a,b,c,d,e,f
# For sample R values near 2^(1/3) (~1.26), test if the ration
# (|f(R) - cbrt2|)/(|R - cbrt2|) < 1 holds (approximation improves).

cbrt2 = 2 ** (1 / 3)
sample_Rs = [Fraction(5,4), Fraction(6,5), Fraction(7,6)]  # near 1.25 to 1.33

def eval_rat(a,b,c,d,e,f,R):
    num = a*R**2 + b*R + c
    den = d*R**2 + e*R + f
    if den == 0:
        return None
    return num / den

for a in range(-2,3):
    for b in range(-2,3):
        for c in range(-2,3):
            for d in range(1,4):  # avoid zero denominator polynomials with 0-leading coeff
                for e in range(-2,3):
                    for f in range(-2,3):
                        all_improve = True
                        for R in sample_Rs:
                            val = eval_rat(a,b,c,d,e,f,R)
                            if val is None:
                                all_improve = False
                                break
                            err_num = abs(float(val) - cbrt2)
                            err_den = abs(float(R) - cbrt2)
                            # Check improvement factor < 1 (strict)
                            if err_den == 0 or err_num >= err_den:
                                all_improve = False
                                break
                        if all_improve:
                            print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}, e={e}, f={f}")
