The problem involves finding all triples \((x, y, z) \in \mathbb{R}^3\) satisfying the system:
\[
\begin{cases}
x^2 y + y^2 z + z^2 = 0 \\
z^3 + z^2 y + z y^3 + x^2 y = \frac{1}{4}(x^4 + y^4)
\end{cases}
\]

and conjecturing the cardinality of the solution set (possibly finite). To assist, let's try enumerating solutions by guessing small rational or integer values of \(x, y\) and computing \(z\) from the first equation, verifying the second, and print any exact solutions found. We'll scan over a small grid to keep output small and exact, focusing on simple fractions or integers.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Enumerate small rational triples and check the system
# We'll use fractions with denominators up to 4 and numerators between -4 and 4
# Prioritize exact arithmetic with Fraction to find exact solutions

def eval_eq1(x, y, z):
    return x**2 * y + y**2 * z + z**2

def eval_eq2(x, y, z):
    left = z**3 + z**2 * y + z * y**3 + x**2 * y
    right = Fraction(1,4) * (x**4 + y**4)
    return left == right

# We return all triples with eq1 == 0 and eq2 == 0 satisfied exactly
solutions = set()

denoms = [1,2,3,4]
num_range = range(-4,5)

for dx in denoms:
    for dy in denoms:
        for xnum in num_range:
            for ynum in num_range:
                # build fractions x,y
                x = Fraction(xnum, dx)
                y = Fraction(ynum, dy)

                # From eq1: x^2*y + y^2*z + z^2=0
                # view as quadratic in z: y^2*z + z^2 + x^2*y = 0
                # => z^2 + y^2*z + x^2*y = 0
                # coefficients: a=1, b=y^2, c=x^2*y
                a = Fraction(1)
                b = y**2
                c = x**2 * y

                # discriminant 
                D = b**2 - 4*a*c
                if D < 0:
                    continue

                # possible z values
                # since we want exact fraction sqrt may not be exact, ignore irrational roots
                # only proceed if D is perfect square in rationals

                # Check if D numerator and denominator are perfect squares
                # sqrt(D) = sqrt(num(D)/den(D)) = sqrt(num(D))/sqrt(den(D))
                # so both numerator and denominator must be perfect squares

                def is_perfect_square(n):
                    if n < 0:
                        return False
                    r = int(n**0.5)
                    return r*r == n

                num_D = D.numerator
                den_D = D.denominator
                if not (is_perfect_square(num_D) and is_perfect_square(den_D)):
                    continue

                sqrtD = Fraction(int(num_D**0.5), int(den_D**0.5))

                for sign in [+1, -1]:
                    z = (-b + sign*sqrtD)/(2*a)
                    # check eq2

                        if sol not in solutions:
