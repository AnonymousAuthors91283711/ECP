theorem olympiadbench2926 (T : ℕ) (hT : T = 5) :
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ T ≤ Nat.card {k : ℤ | 0 < k ∧ -k^2 - 2*k + n ≥ 0}} 
  (olympiadbench2926_answer T) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun T => if T = 5 then 35 else 0  -- Default case not specified in problem
Proposed Answer: fun T : ℕ => 7 * T - 2
Let's analyze the problem and answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n where there are at least T=5 integer k>0 satisfying -k²-2k+n ≥ 0.

2. Ground truth answer gives 35 when T=5 (and 0 otherwise, which is just a placeholder).

3. Proposed answer gives a general formula 7*T-2, which for T=5 yields 7*5-2=33.

The key comparison is at T=5:
- Ground truth: 35
- Proposed: 33

These are different values, so the proposed answer is incorrect for the given case. The general formula doesn't match the specific required solution.
