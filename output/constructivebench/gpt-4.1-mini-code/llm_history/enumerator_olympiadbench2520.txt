The problem seems to be about finding the least positive integer \(x\) such that the rational number \(\frac{1}{32}\) can be expressed as \(\frac{x}{10^y}\) for some positive integer \(y\). Equivalently, find \(x, y > 0\) with \(\frac{1}{32} = \frac{x}{10^y}\), or \(x = \frac{10^y}{32}\).

The problem reduces to finding integers \(y > 0\) so that \(10^y\) is divisible by 32, since \(x\) must be an integer.

I'll write a Python program to search for all such pairs \((x, y)\) with \(y\) small (say up to 20) and output all found candidates, then output the minimal \(x\).

```python
# Enumerate positive integers y and corresponding x = 10^y / 32 when integer
# Print all candidates x,y with 1/32 = x/10^y, then print minimal x found

def main():
    candidates = []
    for y in range(1, 21):
        numerator = 10 ** y
        if numerator % 32 == 0:
            x = numerator // 32
            print(f"x = {x}, y = {y}, check: {x}/10^{y} = {x / 10**y} == 1/32")
            candidates.append(x)
    if candidates:
        print("Minimal x found:", min(candidates))
    else:
        print("No x,y found with y <= 20.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
