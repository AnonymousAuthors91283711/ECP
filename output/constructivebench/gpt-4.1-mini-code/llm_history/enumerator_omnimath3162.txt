The problem asks about the existence of a sequence \(a_n\) of real numbers such that for every positive integer \(m\), the infinite sum \(\sum_{n} (a_n)^m = m\). We want to explore sequences that might satisfy this condition. Since \(\sum_n (a_n)^m = m\), and this must hold for all \(m\), the sequence must produce this exact power sum behavior.

We will try small sequences of positive real numbers (or zero) and compute finite sums of powers to see if they can equal the integers \(m\). Since the sums are infinite, we approximate by truncation and check if matching is at least possible for small \(m\).

We try sequences of length up to 3 with rational values and print sums for \(m=1,2,3,4\). This might help conjecture if such infinite sequences exist.

```python
# Enumerate possible sequences (length 1 to 3) of positive rational candidates
# and check if their power sums approximate m for m=1..4.
# Print sums to inspect if any pattern emerges.

from fractions import Fraction

def power_sums(seq, max_m):
    # Compute power sums sum(a_n^m) for m=1..max_m
    sums = []
    for m in range(1, max_m + 1):
        s = sum(x**m for x in seq)
        sums.append(s)
    return sums

def approx_equal(x, y, tol=1e-9):
    return abs(x - y) < tol

def print_candidate(seq, sums):
    # Print rationals as fractions or decimals
    seq_str = ', '.join(str(x) for x in seq)
    sums_str = ', '.join(str(float(s)) for s in sums)
    print(f"Sequence: [{seq_str}] sums for m=1..{len(sums)}: [{sums_str}]")

def search():
    # Consider numerators and denominators from 1 to 5 for fraction candidates
    candidates = [Fraction(n, d) for n in range(1,6) for d in range(1,6)]

    max_m = 4
    # To limit output, consider sequences length 1 to 3
    for length in range(1,4):
        if length == 1:
            for a in candidates:
                sums = power_sums([a], max_m)
                # Ideal is sums == [1,2,3,4], etc. Impossible from one element but print anyway
                print_candidate([a], sums)
