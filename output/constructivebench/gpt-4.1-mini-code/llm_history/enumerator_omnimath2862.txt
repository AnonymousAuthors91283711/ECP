The problem involves counting the number of integer pairs \((x, y)\) with both positive integers such that \(\frac{x}{4} = \frac{9}{y}\). Rearranging,

\[
\frac{x}{4} = \frac{9}{y} \implies x \cdot y = 36.
\]

So the pairs \((x,y)\) are positive integer divisors of 36 satisfying \(x y = 36\).

The task reduces to enumerating all positive integer pairs \((x,y)\) such that \(x y = 36\).

We can programmatically enumerate all divisors \(d\) of 36, then for each divisor \(d\), the pair \((d, 36/d)\) is a solution.

Let's write a Python program to output all such pairs and count them.

```python
# Enumerate all positive integer pairs (x,y) with x*y = 36.
def main():
    N = 36
    count = 0
    print(f"Enumerating pairs (x, y) with positive integers and x*y = {N}:")
    for x in range(1, N + 1):
        if N % x == 0:
            y = N // x
            print(f"(x, y) = ({x}, {y})")
            count += 1
    print(f"Total number of such pairs: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
