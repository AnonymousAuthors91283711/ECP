. Enumerated answers: Candidate f(x)=x PASSES on samples
Candidate f(x)=-x failed at x=-2, y=-2: lhs=-6, rhs=2
Candidate f(x)=x^2 failed at x=-2, y=-2: lhs=64, rhs=14
Candidate f(x)=sqrt(x) failed at x=-2, y=-2: lhs=2.0, rhs=-2
Candidate f(x)=0 failed at x=-2, y=-2: lhs=0, rhs=-2
Candidate f(x)=1 failed at x=-2, y=-2: lhs=1, rhs=-1
Candidate f(x)=x+1 failed at x=-2, y=-2: lhs=4, rhs=-1. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ → ℝ)
