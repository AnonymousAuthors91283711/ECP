The problem is to find all triples \((x,y,p)\) of natural numbers such that \(p\) is prime and

\[
p^x - y^p = 1.
\]

We want to enumerate possible solutions for small values.

```python
from sympy import primerange, isprime

# Enumerate triples (x,y,p) with small parameters satisfying p prime and p^x - y^p = 1
MAX_P = 20
MAX_EXP = 10

print("Enumerating triples (x, y, p) with p prime, p^x - y^p = 1:")

for p in primerange(2, MAX_P + 1):
    # p prime
    for x in range(1, MAX_EXP + 1):
        # compute p^x - 1
        val = p**x - 1
        # try to write val as y^p
        # y^p = p^x - 1 => y = (p^x - 1)^(1/p)
        # test integer y values near val**(1/p)
        approx_y = int(round(val**(1/p)))
        for y in range(max(1, approx_y - 1), approx_y + 2):
            if y**p == val:
                print(f"Found solution: x={x}, y={y}, p={p}")

# This finds all solutions with small parameters.
```
