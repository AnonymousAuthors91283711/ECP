The problem involves a sixth-degree polynomial with integer coefficients and roots that are positive integers. The polynomial is:

p(X) = X^6 - 10 X^5 + A X^4 + B X^3 + C X^2 + D X + 16.

It's given that all roots are positive integers. Since the leading term is X^6 and the constant term is 16, whose positive divisors are limited, the roots must be positive integers whose product is 16.

We want to find possible values of A, B, C, D under the conditions, in particular B, and we want to enumerate possible tuples of six positive integer roots that multiply to 16 and sum to 10 (since coefficient of X^5 is -10, sum of roots is 10).

We can enumerate all tuples of 6 positive integers whose product is 16 and sum is 10. For each such tuple, we can compute the symmetric sums to find coefficients A, B, C, D.

Since the polynomial is monic with integer coefficients, the Viète formulas hold:
- Sum of roots = 10 (coefficient of X^5 = -sum of roots)
- sum of products of roots taken 2 at a time = A
- sum of products taken 3 at a time = -B
- sum of products taken 4 at a time = C
- sum of products taken 5 at a time = -D
- product of roots = 16

We enumerate all 6-tuples of positive integers with product=16 and sum=10, then compute coefficients and print B each time.

Since 16 has few divisors, the number of tuples to check is small.

Below is the program that does this enumeration:

```python
from itertools import combinations
from math import prod

# Generate all 6-tuples of positive integers >0 with product 16 and sum 10
# Since 16 = 2^4, possible divisors are 1,2,4,8,16

def gen_mult_product(target_product, length, start=1):
    # recursively generate tuples of given length with product=target_product
    if length == 1:
        if target_product >= start:
            yield (target_product,)
        return
    for i in range(start, target_product + 1):
        if target_product % i == 0:
            # Fix i as first root
            for tail in gen_mult_product(target_product // i, length - 1, i):
                yield (i,) + tail

# Compute symmetric sums needed for coefficients
def sum_k_products(roots, k):
    return sum(prod(comb) for comb in combinations(roots, k))

def main():
    target_product = 16
    length = 6
    
    print("Enumerating 6 positive integer roots with product=16 and sum=10:")
    found = []
    for roots in gen_mult_product(target_product, length):
        if sum(roots) == 10:
            # root tuple found
            r = roots
            # compute Viète sums
            # p = X^6 -10 X^5 + A X^4 + B X^3 + C X^2 + D X +16
            # sum roots = 10 (confirmed)
            A = sum_k_products(r, 2)
            B = -sum_k_products(r, 3)
            C = sum_k_products(r, 4)
            D = -sum_k_products(r, 5)
            print(f"Roots: {r}, B = {B}")
            found.append(B)
    if found:
        min_B = min(found)
        max_B = max(found)
        print(f"Minimum B found: {min_B}")
        print(f"Maximum B found: {max_B}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
