The problem looks for two distinct complex numbers \( z_1, z_2 \) satisfying
\[
z^2 + 2z = i,
\]
and aims to find the value of \(\operatorname{Re}(z_1) \cdot \operatorname{Re}(z_2)\).

We want to enumerate the roots of
\[
z^2 + 2z - i = 0,
\]
then compute the product of their real parts.

This is a quadratic equation in \(z\), so roots can be computed exactly using the quadratic formula:
\[
z = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4i}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{1 + i}.
\]

We'll enumerate these two roots numerically and print their real parts and the product of real parts, which gives us the supposedly unique answer.

```python
# Enumerate roots of z^2 + 2z = i and find product of real parts
import cmath

def main():
    c = 1j  # i in Python
    # Solve z^2 + 2z - i = 0
    a, b = 1, 2
    discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*(-c)  # 4 + 4i
    sqrt_disc = cmath.sqrt(discriminant)
    z1 = (-b + sqrt_disc) / (2*a)
    z2 = (-b - sqrt_disc) / (2*a)
    print(f"z1 = {z1}")
    print(f"z2 = {z2}")
    re_prod = z1.real * z2.real
    print(f"Re(z1) * Re(z2) = {re_prod}")
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
