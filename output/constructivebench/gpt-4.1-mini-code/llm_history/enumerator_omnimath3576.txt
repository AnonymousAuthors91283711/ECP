The problem involves maximizing a parameter \( c \) related to families of subsets of an \( n \)-element set with each subset having size at least \( \ell \), and a double sum expression involving intersection sizes and subset sizes weighted by nonnegative rationals.

We will try small values for \( n \) and \( \ell \), generate all collections \( A = (A_i) \) of subsets with at least size \( \ell \), then for a choice of weights \( x_i \geq 0 \), compute the value inside the supremum expression. We will search for the largest \( c \) such that the inequality always holds. Since the problem is complicated and symbolic, we will enumerate subsets and simple weights (such as indicator vectors or uniform weights) for small \(k\), and print candidate values for \(c\).

We will:
- Fix small \( n, \ell \) values.
- Consider various families \((A_i)\) with small \(k\).
- Try simple weight vectors \(x_i\) such as unit vectors and uniform vector.
- Compute the quantity \[
Q = \frac{\sum_{i,j} x_i x_j \frac{|A_i \cap A_j|^2}{|A_i||A_j|}}{\left(\sum_i x_i\right)^2}
\]
- For given \( (A_i, x_i) \), print the attained \(Q\) as candidates for \(c\).

This enumeration helps guess upper bounds on \(c\).
