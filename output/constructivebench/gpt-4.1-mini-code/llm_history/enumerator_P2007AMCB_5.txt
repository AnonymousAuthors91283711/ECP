The problem seems to ask for the smallest integer \( n \leq 22 \) satisfying:
\[ 6n + 0 \times (22-n) + 3 \times 1.5 \geq 100 \]

Here, \( 3 \times 1.5 = 4.5 \), so the inequality is:
\[ 6n + 4.5 \geq 100 \quad\Rightarrow\quad 6n \geq 95.5 \quad\Rightarrow\quad n \geq \frac{95.5}{6} \approx 15.9167 \]

Since \( n \) is a natural number and \( n \leq 22 \), the smallest \( n \) satisfying this is \( n=16 \).

I will enumerate \( n \) from 0 to 22, check the inequality, print candidates, and then print the minimum \( n \) that works.

```python
# Enumerate n in [0..22] to find all n with 6*n + 3*1.5 >= 100, print candidates and minimal one.

def main():
    target = 100
    const = 3 * 1.5  # 4.5
    candidates = []
    print("Enumerating n in [0..22]:")
    for n in range(23):
        val = 6 * n + const
        if val >= target:
            print(f"n={n}, value={val} >= {target}")
            candidates.append(n)
    if candidates:
        min_n = min(candidates)
        print(f"Minimum n satisfying inequality: {min_n}")
    else:
        print("No n in [0..22] satisfies the inequality")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
