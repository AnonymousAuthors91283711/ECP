The problem describes a set of 68 integer pairs with a certain anti-symmetry condition, and asks about the largest number N such that there's always a subset of integers `erased` with no zero-sum pairs and covering at least N elements of the pairs. We will try small sample sets to enumerate possible sizes and subsets to get a sense of values for N.

```python
from itertools import combinations

# We test with pairs from a small range to keep enumeration practical
S = list(range(-5, 6))  # integers from -5 to 5
pairs = [(x, y) for x in S for y in S if x != y]

def no_zero_sum_subset(s):
    # Returns True if no two elements sum to zero in set s
    return all(a + b != 0 for a in s for b in s)

def check_erased_subset(pairs_subset):
    # Given pairs_subset, try to find erased subset covering all pairs by element + no zero sums
    elements = set(x for p in pairs_subset for x in p)
    max_covered = 0
    erased_candidates = []
    # Check all subsets of elements (small sets only)
    # prune: check subsets bit by bit (only subsets with no zero-sum pairs)
    from itertools import chain, combinations as comb
    elems_list = list(elements)
    for r in range(len(elems_list)+1):
        for sub in comb(elems_list, r):
            if no_zero_sum_subset(sub):
                # check cover: each pair has x or y in sub
                if all(x in sub or y in sub for x, y in pairs_subset):
                    if len(pairs_subset) > max_covered:
                        max_covered = len(pairs_subset)
                        erased_candidates.append((sub, max_covered))
    return max_covered

print("Testing subsets of pairs from small sets")
for sz in range(5, 8):
    for c in combinations(pairs, sz):
        # check anti-symmetry condition: no (k,k) and (-k,-k) both in pairs
        if all(not ((k,k) in c and (-k,-k) in c) for k in S if k > 0):
            covered = check_erased_subset(c)
            print(f"#pairs={sz} covered={covered} pairs={c}")
```
