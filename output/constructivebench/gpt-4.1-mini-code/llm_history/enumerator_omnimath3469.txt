[write_program]
The given problem relates three real numbers x, y, z under the constraints x = 0.2 * y and x = 0.5 * z, and asks to express z as some fraction of y (omnimath3469_answer / 100 * y). We want to explore and confirm the factor connecting z and y.

To assist, I'll write a Python program that:
- Assigns symbolic or numeric values to y,
- Computes x from y via 0.2*y,
- Computes z from x via z = 2*x (since x=0.5*z => z=2*x),
- Prints the ratio 100*z/y to guess the numerator omnimath3469_answer.

We quickly verify the formula for sample values and enumerate candidates if needed.

```python
# Enumerate potential answers for the factor z = (answer/100)*y given x=0.2*y and x=0.5*z

def test_samples():
    print("y\t x=0.2*y \t z=2*x \t ratio=100*z/y")
    for y in range(1, 11):
        x = 0.2 * y
        z = 2 * x  # since x = 0.5*z => z = 2*x
        ratio = 100 * z / y
        print(f"{y}\t {x:.3f}\t\t {z:.3f}\t {ratio:.1f}")

    # Confirm the ratio is constant for all samples by assertions
    ratios = []
    for y in range(1, 20):
        x = 0.2 * y
        z = 2 * x
        ratios.append(100 * z / y)
    unique_ratios = set(ratios)
    for r in unique_ratios:
        print(f"Candidate omnimath3469_answer: {r:.1f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_samples()
```
