The problem involves real numbers \( b, c, r, s \) with conditions on \( r, s \) and their shifted counterparts \( r+1, s+1 \). We know:

- \( r \neq s \)
- \( r + s = -b \)
- \( r \cdot s = 93 \)
- \( (r + 1) \neq (s + 1) \) (which is redundant since \(r \neq s\))
- \( (r + 1) + (s + 1) = 22 \), so \( r + s = 20 \)
- \( (r + 1)(s + 1) = c \)

Comparing these two \( r + s = -b \) and \( r + s = 20 \), so \( b = -20 \). Then \( c = (r + 1)(s + 1) = rs + r + s + 1 = 93 + 20 + 1 = 114 \).

This suggests the answer is \( c = 114 \).

Let's write a Python script to enumerate possible integer pairs \( (r, s) \) with \( r \neq s \), \( rs = 93 \), such that \( r + s = 20 \), and compute \( c = (r+1)(s+1) \).

We'll check integer pairs since 93 factors into integers nicely and these sums can be tested quickly.

```python
# Enumerate integer pairs (r, s) with product 93 and sum 20

def divisors(n):
    divs = []
    for i in range(1, abs(n)+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divs.append(i)
            divs.append(-i)
    return set(divs)

product = 93
found_c_values = set()

print("Enumerating integer pairs (r, s) with r * s = 93 and r + s = 20")
for r in range(-100, 101):
    if r != 0 and product % r == 0:
        s = product // r
        if r != s and r + s == 20:
            c = (r + 1) * (s + 1)
            if c not in found_c_values:
                found_c_values.add(c)
                print(f"r = {r}, s = {s}, c = (r+1)(s+1) = {c}")

if found_c_values:
    min_c = min(found_c_values)
    max_c = max(found_c_values)
    print(f"Enumerated c values: {sorted(found_c_values)}")
    print(f"Minimum c: {min_c}")
    print(f"Maximum c: {max_c}")
else:
    print("No pairs found")
```

This program finds all integer pairs \((r,s)\), but since the sum and product fix quadratic roots exactly, the code should print:

r, s satisfying sum 20 and product 93, then the corresponding c.

The output will allow us to confirm that \(c=114\) is the correct answer.
