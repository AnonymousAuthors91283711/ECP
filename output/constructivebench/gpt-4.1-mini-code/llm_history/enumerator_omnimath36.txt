The problem is about whether there exist positive integers \(a, b\) such that for every positive integer \(n\), \(a\) does NOT divide \(b^n - n\). We want to enumerate examples for small \(a, b\) and small \(n\) to see if such pairs exist or are impossible, aiding conjecture.

```python
# Enumerate small positive integers a, b and check for n up to a limit
# if a divides b^n - n for some n. If such an n exists, then (a,b) 
# violates the condition ∀n>0: a ∤ b^n - n. We print these pairs.

MAX_A = 20
MAX_B = 20
MAX_N = 30

for a in range(1, MAX_A + 1):
    for b in range(1, MAX_B + 1):
        # Check if for all n, a ∤ b^n - n up to MAX_N
        # If we find one n with a | b^n-n, print this (a,b) as NOT satisfying
        # If none found (likely for too small range), print candidate.
        divides_found = False
        for n in range(1, MAX_N + 1):
            val = pow(b, n) - n
            if val % a == 0:
                divides_found = True
                print(f"({a},{b}) fails at n={n} because {a} | {b}^{n} - {n} = {val}")
                break
        if not divides_found:
            print(f"(a,b)=({a},{b}) may satisfy '∀n>0: a ∤ b^n - n' up to n={MAX_N}")
```
