[write_program]
The problem defines a function \( f(x) = x^2 - 2 \) over the natural numbers, and iterates it 24 times starting from 18, then takes the result modulo 89. We want to find \( f^{24}(18) \mod 89 \).

We will write a Python program to:
- Implement the function \( f(x) \) modulo 89 to keep numbers small
- Iterate \( f \) 24 times starting from 18 modulo 89
- Print intermediate results for each iteration for insight and finally print the answer

This will help conjecture the actual answer for the "answer" abbreviation in the Lean theorem statement.

```python
# Function f(x) = x^2 - 2 modulo 89
def f(x):
    return (x*x - 2) % 89

def main():
    x = 18
    print(f"Starting x = {x} modulo 89")
    for i in range(1, 25):  # iterate 24 times
        x = f(x)
        print(f"f^{i}(18) mod 89 = {x}")
    print(f"Answer: f^{24}(18) mod 89 = {x}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
