The problem involves solving for \( k \) given \( T = 650 \), \( \log T \), and a relation involving \( \log T \) and \( \log k \). We are to find \( k \) satisfying:

\[
\log T = 2 - \log 2 + \log k
\]

We can rearrange this as:

\[
\log k = \log T - 2 + \log 2
\]

Then find \( k \) exactly and numerically.

The code enumerates the exact logarithms for the given \( T \) and uses exact relations to compute \( k \), printing intermediate steps and the candidate value for \( k \).

```python
import math

# Given T
T = 650
print(f"T = {T}")

# Compute logT = log(T)
logT = math.log(T)
print(f"logT = ln({T}) ≈ {logT}")

# Given relation: logT = 2 - log(2) + log(k)
# Solve for log(k):
log2 = math.log(2)
print(f"log(2) ≈ {log2}")

logk = logT - 2 + log2
print(f"log(k) = logT - 2 + log2 ≈ {logk}")

# Compute k
k = math.exp(logk)
print(f"k = e^(log(k)) ≈ {k}")

# For verification, check the original equation
lhs = logT
rhs = 2 - log2 + math.log(k)
print(f"Check: lhs={lhs} rhs={rhs} difference={abs(lhs - rhs)}")
```
