The problem involves finding natural numbers \(b, r, w, p\) satisfying a set of linear equalities and inequalities. The expressions relate four values (130, 164, 188) and the answers depend on an unknown \( P2009AIMEII_1\_answer \) appearing in the sum condition. The equalities among \(130-b\), \(164-r\), and \(188-w\) imply these three values are equal. Let's enumerate all possibilities for \(b, r, w\) satisfying these conditions, then find \(p\) and compute \(P2009AIMEII_1\_answer\). We will try all feasible \(b \leq 130\) and find the rest accordingly.

```python
# Enumerate all natural numbers b,r,w,p satisfying the given conditions
# We know 130 - b = 164 - r = 188 - w = x (say)
# So r = 164 - x, w = 188 - x, b = 130 - x, x ≥ 0
# p ≤ r + w and b + r + w + p = 130 + 164 + 188 - answer
# We'll try x in range [0, 130]
# For each x, compute b,r,w,p range and find possible answers.

def main():
    total_sum = 130 + 164 + 188
    max_x = 130
    for x in range(max_x+1):
        b = 130 - x
        r = 164 - x
        w = 188 - x
        if b < 0 or r < 0 or w < 0:
            continue
        max_p = r + w
        # sum of b, r, w, p = total_sum - answer
        # Thus answer = total_sum - (b+r+w+p)
        # p can be 0...max_p
        for p in range(max_p+1):
            s = b + r + w + p
            answer = total_sum - s
            # print the parameters and answer
            print(f"x={x} b={b} r={r} w={w} p={p} answer={answer}")
