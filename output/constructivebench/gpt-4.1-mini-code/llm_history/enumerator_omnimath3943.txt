The problem involves analyzing numbers \( t \) with digits constrained to the union of ranges 2 to 7, such that \( t \) is divisible by \( 2^{100} \) and has exactly 100 digits. We want to explore such numbers and count them.

To help conjecture the answer, I will:
- Enumerate candidate digit sets \(S\) as defined,
- Construct numbers \(t\) of length 100 using digits only in \(S\),
- Check divisibility by \(2^{100}\) (which is a very large power of two, so the number must be divisible by a high power of 2, thus have many trailing zero bits),
- Output numbers and counts found.

The problem is complex for direct brute force, but we can sample smaller lengths (e.g., up to 10 digits) and smaller powers (e.g., \(2^4\)) to observe patterns. Then scale up the reasoning.

```python
from itertools import product

# S is digits in the union of ranges [0..1]∪[0..2]∪[0..3]∪[0..4]∪[0..5]∪[0..6]∪[0..7]
# S = {digits < 8}, but filtered by union of ranges 2..7 as stated
# The original problem states S = union of ranges 2..7, 
# but these "Finset.range 2" includes digits 0 and 1? 
# Actually Finset.range n includes digits 0..n-1,
# so Finset.range 2 = {0,1}
# union of Finset.range 2 ∪ Finset.range 3 ∪ ... is {0..6}
# However, re-reading: hS := S = {d | d ∈ range 2 ∪ range 3 ∪ ...}

# So S = the union of range 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
# That is digits in 0..1 ∪ 0..2 ∪ 0..3 ∪ ... 0..6
# That is digits in {0..6} (because range 7 = {0..6})

# So S = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}

S = set(range(7))

def divisible_by_power_of_two(n, p):
    # Check if n divisible by 2^p
    return n & ((1 << p) - 1) == 0

def digits_to_number(digs):
    return int(''.join(map(str, digs)))

# Because 2^100 is approx 1.26e30, this is enormous.
# To illustrate, let's reduce p to 4 and digits length to 5 for demo.

p = 4    # power of two divisor
length = 5  # length of t in digits

print(f"Digits allowed (S): {S}")
print(f"Checking {length}-digit numbers with digits in S, divisible by 2^{p}")

count = 0
first_leading_digit_choices = [d for d in S if d != 0]

for leading_digit in first_leading_digit_choices:
    # rest digits can include 0
    for rest in product(S, repeat=length-1):
        digs = (leading_digit,) + rest
        n = digits_to_number(digs)
        if divisible_by_power_of_two(n, p):
            print(n)
            count += 1
            # Limit output to avoid too big output
            if count >= 20:
                break
    if count >= 20:
        break

print(f"Total found (up to 20): {count}")
```
