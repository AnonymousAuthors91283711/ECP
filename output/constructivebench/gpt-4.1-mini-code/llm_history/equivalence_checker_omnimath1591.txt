Ground Truth Answer: 577
Proposed Answer: 2^0 + 2^6 + 2^7
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem asks for the smallest number n in set S (numbers expressible as sum of three distinct powers of 2) such that there are exactly 99 smaller numbers in S.

2. The ground truth answer is 577, which is indeed equal to 2^0 + 2^6 + 2^7 (1 + 64 + 512).

3. The proposed answer presents this exact decomposition of 577.

4. Both answers represent the same number and the same mathematical concept.

The answers are equivalent in every way - they represent the same value and the same solution to the problem.
