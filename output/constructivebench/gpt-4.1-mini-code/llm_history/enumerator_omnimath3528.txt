The problem appears to involve triples \((w, l, t)\) of natural numbers summing to 3, with some condition involving existence of \(g_{\text{for}}\) and \(g_{\text{against}}\) such that \(g_{\text{for}} > g_{\text{against}}\), and some excluded set \(\text{omnimath3528\_answer}\). To assist, I will enumerate all triples \((w,l,t) \in \mathbb{N}^3\) with \(w+l+t=3\), print them, and mark those for which there exist some candidate \(g_{\text{for}}, g_{\text{against}}\) satisfying \(g_{\text{for}} > g_{\text{against}}\) (using a simple construction). This will help identify which triples belong or not belong to the answer set.

```python
# Enumerate all (w, l, t) with w+l+t=3, w,l,t >=0
# For each triple, check if there exist g_for, g_against in N with g_for > g_against
# N = natural numbers including 0, so we just check if there is g_for > g_against,
# which is always true if w, l, t > 0 or some trivial case.
# Since the problem is abstract, we will just print triples and a label.

print("Enumerating triples (w,l,t) with w+l+t=3 and checking g_for>g_against condition")

for w in range(4):
    for l in range(4 - w):
        t = 3 - w - l
        # Check condition exists g_for > g_against.
        # If we assume existence always true (since g_for=1, g_against=0),
        # let's mark those triples accordingly.
        # The problem may actually want to characterize exceptions.
        # We'll print triples and "exists_g" flag.
        exists_g = True if (w+l+t == 3) else False
        # Output format: (w,l,t): exists_g
        print(f"Triple: (w={w}, l={l}, t={t}), exists g_for>g_against: {exists_g}")
```
