No exact integer solutions found, trying finer floating grid.... Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ × ℝ × ℝ)
Explanation: The errors happen because the current expression uses the constant "cos", the variable "θ", and the symbolic "π" which are not declared or imported, nor are they handled as bounded quantifications inside the set comprehension. Also, a set of triples (x,y,z) defined via parameters θ should be defined using existential quantification over θ ∈ ℝ rather than as a conjunction with a free symbol θ in the set-builder notation.

In Lean, we can represent the set of solutions as the image of the function mapping θ : ℝ to (x, y, z) = (2*cos θ, 2*cos (θ + 2π/3), 2*cos (θ + 4π/3)) for all real θ. We should import `Mathlib.Analysis.SpecialFunctions.Trigonometric` for cosine, and `Real.pi` is available as `Real.pi`, with appropriate notations. The set can be expressed as the range (image) of that function.

Below is the corrected Lean expression for the answer set, expressed as the image of the function from θ ∈ ℝ to (x,y,z). This both fixes the unknown identifiers by qualifying them and making θ locally bound, and expresses the set correctly.
