We are asked about the number of integer lattice points (p.1, p.2) within the circle of radius 2009 centered at the origin. We want to count all (x,y) in ℤ² such that x² + y² ≤ 2009².

The program below enumerates all integer points (x,y) with |x|,|y| ≤ 2009 and checks the condition. It prints each point found and finally prints the total count.

```python
# Count integer lattice points (x,y) with x² + y² ≤ 2009² 
# where x,y ∈ ℤ.

radius = 2009
radius_sq = radius * radius

count = 0
for x in range(-radius, radius + 1):
    # For given x, y² ≤ radius_sq - x², so |y| ≤ floor(sqrt(radius_sq - x²))
    max_y = int((radius_sq - x*x)**0.5)
    for y in range(-max_y, max_y + 1):
        print(f"Point: ({x},{y})")
        count += 1

print(f"Total count of lattice points: {count}")
```
