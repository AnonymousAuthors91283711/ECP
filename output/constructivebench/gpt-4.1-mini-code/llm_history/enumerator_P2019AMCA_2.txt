The problem defines a relation between two real numbers \(a\) and \(b\): \(a = 1.5 \times b\).

We want to evaluate \(\frac{3b}{a}\) and express it as \(\frac{\text{P2019AMCA\_2\_answer}}{100}\).

The program below numerically checks this expression for several sample \(b\) values (to illustrate, even though it's straightforward from the formula) and prints the corresponding fraction numerator (the answer times 100).

```python
# Enumerate values of (3 * b) / a where a = 1.5 * b, for sample b values
# and print the result expressed as numerator / 100.

def main():
    print("Enumerated values of (3 * b) / a for a = 1.5 * b:")
    for b in [0.5, 1, 2, 10, 100]:
        a = 1.5 * b
        val = (3 * b) / a
        numerator = val * 100  # P2019AMCA_2_answer
        # Check if numerator is an integer (exact value)
        if abs(round(numerator) - numerator) < 1e-10:
            numerator = int(round(numerator))
        print(f"b={b}, a={a}, (3*b)/a = {val} = {numerator}/100")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
