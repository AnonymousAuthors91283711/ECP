Ground Truth Answer: fun x y => if x > y then x / y else y / x
Proposed Answer: fun x y => x / y
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer `fun x y => x / y` is mostly correct but fails to handle the case when `y > x`. The ground truth answer correctly handles both cases (`x > y` and `y > x`) by returning the ratio of the larger number to the smaller one. The proposed answer would give incorrect results when `y > x`. Therefore, the answers are not fully equivalent, but the proposed answer is correct in the domain where `x > y`.
