The problem appears to concern finding the greatest real number \( c \) such that for all real sequences \( x_0, x_1, \dots, x_{2016} \), the inequality

\[
\sum_{i=0}^{2015} x_i (x_i + x_{i+1}) \ge c \cdot x_{2016}^2
\]

holds. We want to find or at least explore candidates for this constant \( c \).

To help analyze, we can:

- Enumerate for small values first, e.g., smaller sequences and get a feel for \( c \).
- For each \( c \), try to find \( x \) that violates the inequality or nearly does.
- Use vector tricks to approach the supremum of values of 

\[
\frac{\sum_{i=0}^{2015} x_i (x_i + x_{i+1})}{x_{2016}^2}
\]

over nonzero \( x \) with \( x_{2016} \neq 0 \).

We will try a variational approach considering \( x_{2016} = 1 \) and try to maximize 

\[
S(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{2015} x_i(x_i + x_{i+1})
\]

over vectors \( x_0, \dots, x_{2015} \in \mathbb{R} \).

We can interpret this as maximizing a quadratic form in \( x_0, \dots, x_{2015} \). This quadratic form has a matrix \(A\) with entries:

\[
A_{i,i} = 1, \quad A_{i,i+1} = \frac{1}{2}, \quad A_{i+1,i} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

approximating the quadratic form \( S(x) = x^\top A x \).

Since \( x_{2016} = 1 \) fixed, the formula can be rewritten as

\[
\max_{x \in \mathbb{R}^{2016}} \sum_{i=0}^{2015} x_i^2 + \sum_{i=0}^{2015} x_i x_{i+1}
\]

with the convention \( x_{2016} = 1 \).

So for fixed \( x_{2016}=1 \), we vary \( x_0, \ldots, x_{2015} \).

Hence the problem reduces to maximizing

\[
Q(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{2015} x_i^2 + \sum_{i=0}^{2015} x_i x_{i+1}
\]

where \(x_{2016}=1\).

Let me rewrite the second sum:

\[
\sum_{i=0}^{2015} x_i x_{i+1} = \sum_{i=0}^{2014} x_i x_{i+1} + x_{2015} \times 1
\]

So we can express \(Q\) in terms of \(x_0,\dots,x_{2015}\).

Our program enumerates candidates for \(c\) by computing the maximum possible \(Q(x)\) with \(x_{2016} = 1\), then \(c\) is this maximum.

To keep things manageable, we implement for small values \(n\) instead of 2016.

The maximum can be found by solving the linear system derived from setting derivatives to zero or directly considering the matrix.

Below is a program that prints maximum \(c\) for small \(n\), illustrating how to extend results for \(n=2016\).

```python
import numpy as np

def max_c(n):
    # We want to maximize over x_0,...,x_{n-1} real
    # Q(x) = sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x_i^2 + sum_{i=0}^{n-1} x_i x_{i+1}
    # with x_n = 1 fixed.
    # The sum x_i x_{i+1} = sum_{i=0}^{n-2} x_i x_{i+1} + x_{n-1}*x_n
    # x_n=1 fixed

    # We can write Q(x) = x^T x + x^T shift(x) + x_{n-1}*1
    # More precisely:
    # Q(x) = sum x_i^2 + sum_{i=0}^{n-2} x_i x_{i+1} + x_{n-1}*1

    # Let's put Q(x) = x^T x + x^T S x + x_{n-1}
    # But S is just off diagonal with 1's shifted by 1 -> it's bilinear

    # Alternatively, define function f(x) = Q(x) - lambda constraint (none here)
    # Since there's no constraint on x_i except reals and x_n fixed,
    # the problem is unconstrained; we maximize Q(x) by picking x 
    # as large as we want, so max is infinite unless we consider denominator (x_n^2=1 fixed).

    # Since x_n=1 fixed and is outside vector x, let's consider the problem as quadratic in x only:
    # Q(x) = sum_i x_i^2 + sum_{i=0}^{n-2} x_i x_{i+1} + x_{n-1}

    # We maximize Q(x) over x in R^n.

    # Taking derivative w.r.t x_i and set to zero:
    # For i < n-1:
    # 2*x_i + x_{i-1} + x_{i+1} = 0
    # with x_{-1} = 0, x_n = 1 fixed.
    # For i = n-1:
    # 2*x_{n-1} + x_{n-2} + 1 = 0

    # Solve system:
    A = np.zeros((n, n))
    b = np.zeros(n)
    # Setup A matrix:
    for i in range(n):
        A[i, i] = 2
        if i > 0:
            A[i, i-1] = 1
        if i < n-1:
            A[i, i+1] = 1

    # Setup b vector:
    b[-1] = -1  # from +1 term in eq for i = n-1

    # Solve linear system A x = b
    x = np.linalg.solve(A, b)

    # Compute Q(x):
    s = sum(x_i**2 for x_i in x)
    s += sum(x[i]*x[i+1] for i in range(n-1))
    s += x[-1]*1  # x_{n-1} * x_n = x_{n-1} *1

    # c = maximum value of sum_i x_i (x_i + x_{i+1}) / (x_n)^2
    # Here, we fixed x_n=1, so denominator =1
    return s

print("Enumerating max c for small n:")
for n in [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]:
    c = max_c(n)
    print(f"n={n}, max c ≈ {c:.6f}")

# For the original problem with n=2016 (x_0..x_{2015}, x_{2016}=1)
# we can compute approximately:
n = 2016
c = max_c(n)
print(f"n={n}, max c ≈ {c:.6f}")
```
