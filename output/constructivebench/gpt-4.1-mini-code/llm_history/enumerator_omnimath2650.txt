The problem is to find the remainder modulo 7 of the sum \( \sum_{k=0}^{2010} 2^{\frac{k(k+1)}{2}} \).

To help conjecture the answer, we'll compute and print the value of \(2^{\frac{k(k+1)}{2}} \mod 7\) for \(k = 0, 1, \ldots, 30\), and accumulate the sum modulo 7. This will reveal any patterns or cycles and help us guess the final answer efficiently.

```python
# Enumerate values of 2^{k(k+1)/2} mod 7 and their cumulative sum mod 7 for k=0..30
# This helps in recognizing periodicity or patterns to conjecture the answer for k=0..2010

def mod_exp(base, exp, mod):
    result = 1
    base %= mod
    while exp > 0:
        if exp & 1:
            result = (result * base) % mod
        base = (base * base) % mod
        exp >>= 1
    return result

def triangle_num(k):
    return (k*(k+1)) // 2

mod = 7
max_k = 30
cumulative = 0

print("k, T_k, 2^{T_k} mod 7, cumulative sum mod 7")
for k in range(max_k+1):
    T = triangle_num(k)
    val = mod_exp(2, T, mod)
    cumulative = (cumulative + val) % mod
    print(f"{k}, {T}, {val}, {cumulative}")

# From the output, one may attempt to detect cycles or find a formula for sum modulo 7 and then
# extend this pattern to k=2010 to conjecture the remainder.
```
