The problem involves 100 real numbers \( x_i \) such that

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{100} x_i^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{100} (x_i + 1)^2.
\]

We want to find the value of

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{100} (x_i + 2)^2 - \sum_{i=1}^{100} x_i^2.
\]

Let's analyze the constraint first to guess the answer. Expanding the right side of the equality:

\[
\sum x_i^2 = \sum (x_i^2 + 2 x_i + 1) \implies 0 = \sum (2 x_i + 1) = 2\sum x_i + 100 \implies \sum x_i = -50.
\]

The quantity we want is:

\[
\sum (x_i + 2)^2 - \sum x_i^2 = \sum (x_i^2 + 4 x_i + 4) - \sum x_i^2 = \sum (4 x_i + 4) = 4 \sum x_i + 400.
\]

Plug in \(\sum x_i = -50\):

\[
4 \cdot (-50) + 400 = -200 + 400 = 200.
\]

So the answer should be 200.

We'll verify this by enumeration for small \(n\) (say \(n=1,2,3\)) where we try all integer vectors \(x_i \in [-10, 10]\), prune those that satisfy the constraint, and print the difference sum formula.

This will confirm the pattern numerically.

```python
# Verify the formula for small n with sample integer vectors satisfying the constraint.
# The constraint is sum x_i^2 = sum (x_i+1)^2
# Which implies sum x_i = -n/2.
# We enumerate integer vectors x in [-10,10]^n with sum x_i = -n/2 (only possible if -n/2 is integer) and check sums.

def check_for_n(n, bound=10):
    print(f"Testing n={n}")
    # sum x_i must be -n/2, only integer if n even
    target_sum = -n/2
    if target_sum != int(target_sum):
        print("No integer solutions because sum x_i not integer")
        return
    target_sum = int(target_sum)

    # Enumerate all integer vectors x of length n in [-bound,bound]
    from itertools import product
    count = 0
    for x in product(range(-bound, bound+1), repeat=n):
        if sum(x) != target_sum:
            continue
        sum_x2 = sum(xi*xi for xi in x)
        sum_x1_2 = sum((xi+1)**2 for xi in x)
        if sum_x2 != sum_x1_2:
            # Should always be equal if sum x_i = -n/2 by algebra, but due to integer might fail due to rounding
            continue
        diff = sum((xi+2)**2 for xi in x) - sum_x2
        # Theoretical diff is 4*sum(x) + 4n = 4*target_sum + 4*n = 4*(-n/2) + 4*n = -2n + 4n = 2n
        print(f"x={x} sum_x={sum(x)} diff={diff} expected={2*n}")
        count += 1
        if count >= 5:
            break
    if count == 0:
        print("No vectors found.")
    else:
        print(f"Theoretical answer for n={n} is {2*n}.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    for n in [2,4,6]:
        check_for_n(n)
```

The output will show vectors satisfying the constraint and the difference, agreeing with the formula \(2n\).

For \(n=100\), the answer is \(2 \times 100 = 200\).
