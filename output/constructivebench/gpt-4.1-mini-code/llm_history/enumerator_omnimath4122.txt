The problem gives a Fibonacci-like sequence \( F \) with \( F(1) = 1 \), \( F(2) = 1 \), and recurrence \( F(n+1) = F(n) + F(n-1) \) for \( n \geq 2 \). We want to find all pairs \((p.1, p.2) \in \mathbb{N}^2\) with positive coordinates such that \(5 F(p.1) - 3 F(p.2) = 1\).

The program will:
- Enumerate Fibonacci numbers up to some limit.
- Check all pairs \( (i, j) \) in a range (say, 1 to 20).
- Print each pair for which the equation holds exactly.
- This will help in conjecturing the solution set.

```python
# Enumerate pairs (i,j) with i,j in 1..20 for the equation: 5*F_i - 3*F_j = 1
# F is the standard Fibonacci sequence with F1=1,F2=1

def fib(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 1
    a, b = 1, 1
    for _ in range(3, n+1):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return b

max_n = 20
fib_values = [fib(i) for i in range(max_n+1)]  # 0 unused, indexing 1-based

print("Checking pairs (i, j) with 1 <= i,j <= 20:")

for i in range(1, max_n+1):
    Fi = fib_values[i]
    for j in range(1, max_n+1):
        Fj = fib_values[j]
        val = 5 * Fi - 3 * Fj
        if val == 1:
            print(f"Found pair: (i={i}, j={j}), 5*F({i}) - 3*F({j}) = 1")
```
