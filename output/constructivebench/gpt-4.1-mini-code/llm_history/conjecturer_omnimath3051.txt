. Enumerated answers: Given f(2)=5, f(3)=7, and f(mn)=f(m)+f(n) for m,n>0
f(1) + f(12) = 0 + 17 = 17 -> f(12) = 17
f(2) + f(6) = 5 + 12 = 17 -> f(12) = 17
f(3) + f(4) = 7 + 10 = 17 -> f(12) = 17
f(4) + f(3) = 10 + 7 = 17 -> f(12) = 17
f(6) + f(2) = 12 + 5 = 17 -> f(12) = 17
f(12) + f(1) = 17 + 0 = 17 -> f(12) = 17
Therefore, f(12) = 17. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<17>>>
