The problem relates to characterizing integer polynomials \(P\) such that for any bijection \(a: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z}\), there exist indices \(i < j\) and an integer \(k\) with the sum \(\sum_{n=i}^j a(n)\) equal to \(P(k)\). To explore this, I will enumerate some polynomials \(P\) over small degrees and integer inputs \(k\), and test if such sums can match \(P(k)\) under carefully constructed bijections \(a\). The bijection and sums can be simulated with finite integer ranges. The code prints candidate polynomials and instances to help conjecture which polynomials belong to the set.

```python
# Enumerate small integer polynomials and check if for all bijections
# there exist interval sums matching P(k). Since testing all bijections
# is infeasible, we experiment with special bijections to see if P(k)
# values can be "hit" by sums of disjoint consecutive integers.

# Generate polynomials P(x)=a0 + a1 x + a2 x^2 for coefficients in [-2,2].
# We'll try degrees 0,1,2 with small coefficients.

max_i_j = 6  # maximum interval length for sums

    return sums
