The problem involves a monic quadratic polynomial \( P(x) = x^2 + px + q \) whose composition with itself, \( P(P(x)) \), has roots \( \{3, 4, a, b\} \) where \( a, b \) are complex numbers. We want to find possible values of \( (a + b)^2 \).

Key points:
- \( P \) has degree 2 and leading coefficient 1.
- \( P(P(x)) = 0 \) has roots \( \{3,4,a,b\} \).
- Since \( P \) is quadratic, \( P(x) \) has 2 roots, say \( r_1, r_2 \).
- The roots of \( P(P(x)) = 0 \) are the preimages under \( P \) of roots of \( P(x) = 0 \).
- So the four roots of \( P(P(x))=0 \) are the roots of \( P(x) = r_1 \) and \( P(x) = r_2 \).
- The roots \( 3,4,a,b \) are the union of \( P^{-1}(r_1) \) and \( P^{-1}(r_2) \).
- The problem fixes roots \( 3,4 \) as two roots of \( P(P(x)) \), so they come from one of those inverse images.
- Our task: For polynomials \( P \) satisfying the above, find \( (a+b)^2 \).

We will set \( P(x) = x^2 + px + q \), and try different values for roots \( r_1, r_2 \). Using the relationships between roots and coefficients, we will find solutions that give roots \( 3,4 \) and two others \(a,b\). Then output \( (a + b)^2 \).

The program will:
- Iterate over integer sample roots \( r_1, r_2 \) in a small range.
- For each, solve the equation system for \( p,q \).
- Find roots of \( P(x) = r_i \).
- Collect roots and check if \( \{3,4,a,b\} \) matches the roots of \( P(P(x)) \).
- Print each candidate \( (a+b)^2 \).
