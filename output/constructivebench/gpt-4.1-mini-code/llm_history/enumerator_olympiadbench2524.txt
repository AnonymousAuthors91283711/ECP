The given problem involves a logarithmic equation with the variable x > 0 and x ≠ 1. We want to find all real x satisfying:

(log x / log 4) - (log 16 / log x) = 7/6 - (log 8 / log x)

We can rewrite logs in any base since log a / log b = log_b a.

To explore solutions, let's:

- Enumerate candidate x values over a range skipping 1 (since x ≠ 1)
- For each x, check numerically if left side (LHS) and right side (RHS) are close (within some tolerance)
- Print x and the values when close to equal.

We'll test x values in (0, 5] avoiding 1 (say, by increments like 0.01). 

We'll also try to check symbolic values like powers of 2 (since logs involve 4, 8, 16 which are powers of 2).

This enumeration will help conjecture which x satisfy the equation.

```python
import math

# Avoid log(0) and division by zero in denominator log x, so skip x=1

def close(a, b, eps=1e-12):
    return abs(a - b) < eps

def test_x(x):
    if x <= 0 or x == 1:
        return
    logx = math.log(x)  # natural log
    log4 = math.log(4)
    log16 = math.log(16)
    log8 = math.log(8)
    lhs = (logx / log4) - (log16 / logx)
    rhs = 7/6 - (log8 / logx)
    if close(lhs, rhs):
        print(f"x = {x:.12f}, LHS = {lhs:.12f}, RHS = {rhs:.12f}")

def main():
    print("Checking x in (0.01 to 5), excluding x=1")
    step = 0.01
    x = step
    while x <= 5:
        if abs(x - 1) > 1e-9:
            test_x(x)
        x += step
    # Also test some powers of 2 manually for precision
    powers = [0.5, 2, 4, 8, 16]
    print("\nTesting powers of 2 and notable values:")
    for x in powers:
        test_x(x)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
