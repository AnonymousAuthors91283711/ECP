The problem seems to involve characterizing the domain and range of a function \( g(x) = 1 - f(x+1) \), given that \( f \) maps the interval \([0,2]\) into \([0,1]\). We want to enumerate possible answers for the sets representing the domain and range of \( g \).

We'll try some sample values and functions \( f \) satisfying the domain and range conditions and compute \( g \)'s domain and range.

```python
# Enumerate samples for f and compute domain and range of g(x) = 1 - f(x+1)
# Given: f: [0,2] → [0,1], dom g = {x | x+1 ∈ [0,2]} = [-1,1]

def f_candidates(x):
    # Example functions f within [0,2] → [0,1]
    # Identity scaled: f(x) = x/2
    yield x / 2
    # Constant zero
    yield 0
    # Constant one
    yield 1
    # Quadratic ascending
    yield (x / 2)**2
    # Quadratic descending
    yield 1 - (x / 2)**2

def g_domain():
    # x s.t x + 1 in [0,2], so x in [-1,1]
    return (-1,1)

def sample_points():
    # Sample 5 evenly spaced points in domain of g
    return [-1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1]

print("Domain of g: x such that x+1 ∈ [0,2] => x ∈ [-1,1]")

range_samples = set()
for x in sample_points():
    vals = set()
    for valf in f_candidates(x+1):
        g_val = 1 - valf
        vals.add(g_val)
        print(f"g({x}) with f({x+1}) = {valf:.3f} -> g({x}) = {g_val:.3f}")
    range_samples.update(vals)

print("Sample range values of g over domain:")
for val in sorted(range_samples):
    print(f"{val:.3f}")

print("Conjecture: Domain of g is [-1,1], range of g is [0,1]")
```
