The issue in the original expression is mixing the function definition and the condition a = 0 ∨ a = 1 ∨ a = -1 inside the function body, which must be a real-valued function ℝ → ℝ, but you wrote a function returning a Prop-valued expression.

You need to separate the function definition and the condition on a. The answer set should be the set of all functions f such that there exists a real number a with (a = 0 ∨ a = 1 ∨ a = -1) and f = λ x, a * x.

Hence, a correct Lean expression is:

{ f | ∃ a : ℝ, (a = 0 ∨ a = 1 ∨ a = -1) ∧ f = fun x => a * x }

This means f is the function x ↦ a * x for some a ∈ {0, 1, -1}.

This matches the enumerated solutions.
