theorem omnimath2926 : 
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | 1 / 2 < n / 9} omnimath2926_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating n where 1/2 < n/9
n = 5 satisfies 1/2 < n/9
n = 6 satisfies 1/2 < n/9
n = 7 satisfies 1/2 < n/9
n = 8 satisfies 1/2 < n/9
n = 9 satisfies 1/2 < n/9
Minimal n satisfying 1/2 < n/9 is 5. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<5>>>
