The problem involves finding natural numbers \(a, r, q, d\) with conditions:
- \(a, r, q, d > 0\),
- \(q > 1\),
- \(a + a q + a q^2 + a q^3 = (a + (a+d) + (a+2d) + (a+3d)) + 1\),
- Both sums \(a + a q + a q^2 + a q^3 \leq 100\) and \(a + (a+d) + (a+2d) + (a+3d) \leq 100\),
and then calculate \(2a + (a q) + (a+d)\).

Below, I enumerate possible tuples \((a, q, d)\) while ignoring \(r\) since it doesn't appear in the conditions explicitly, then print all satisfying tuples and their computed answers.

```python
# We enumerate values of a, q, d under given constraints to find all satisfying triples
# a, q, d > 0, q > 1, sums â‰¤ 100, and the key equation holds:
# a*(1 + q + q^2 + q^3) = (4a + 6d) + 1
# We'll try a, q, d up to reasonable limits

def main():
    max_sum = 100
    for a in range(1, 30):  # a chosen small since terms grow quickly
        for q in range(2, 10):  # q > 1, upper bound arbitrary
            gp_sum = a * (1 + q + q**2 + q**3)
            if gp_sum > max_sum:
                continue
            for d in range(1, 30):
                ap_sum = a + (a + d) + (a + 2 * d) + (a + 3 * d)
                if ap_sum > max_sum:
                    continue
                # Check the equation
                if gp_sum == ap_sum + 1:
                    # Compute expression: 2a + a*q + (a+d)
                    val = 2 * a + a * q + (a + d)
                    print(f"a={a}, q={q}, d={d}, sum_gp={gp_sum}, sum_ap={ap_sum}, answer={val}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
