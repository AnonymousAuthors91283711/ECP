The problem studies the set of complex numbers of the form ((1 + i)/√2)^n for n ∈ ℕ. Since (1 + i)/√2 is a complex number on the unit circle (its magnitude is 1), these numbers correspond to points on the unit circle at angles n·π/4 because (1 + i)/√2 = cis(π/4). The problem asks to confirm the set is finite and find its cardinality (number of distinct elements).

Key insight: (1 + i)^n/ (√2)^n = ((1+i)/√2)^n = exp(i·n·π/4)
The distinct values correspond to different angles modulo 2π. Since π/4 increments, angles repeat every 8 steps.

So the set has 8 elements corresponding to n=0..7. Let's enumerate and print these values exactly as complex numbers and confirm the cardinality.

```python
from math import sqrt
from fractions import Fraction
from cmath import exp, pi

# (1 + i)/√2 corresponds to exp(iπ/4)
# We'll enumerate values for n in 0..15 to see repetition, but print only unique

base_angle = pi/4
vals = {}
print("Enumerating values of ((1 + i)/sqrt(2))^n:")

for n in range(16):
    z = exp(1j * base_angle * n)
    # To express exactly, z = cos(nπ/4) + i sin(nπ/4)
    # Precompute cos and sin values with sqrt(2)/2 etc. for multiples of 45°
    # Use known exact values for cos and sin of multiples of π/4
    angle_mod8 = n % 8
    # exact cos and sin for multiples of π/4
    # cos(0)=1, sin(0)=0
    # cos(π/4)=sin(π/4)=√2/2
    # cos(π/2)=0, sin(π/2)=1
    # cos(3π/4)=-√2/2, sin(3π/4)=√2/2
    # cos(π)=-1, sin(π)=0
    # cos(5π/4)=-√2/2, sin(5π/4)=-√2/2
    # cos(3π/2)=0, sin(3π/2)=-1
    # cos(7π/4)=√2/2, sin(7π/4)=-√2/2

    elif angle_mod8 == 5:

        cos_val, sin_val = 0, -1
    else: # 7
        cos_val, sin_val = sqrt2_2, -sqrt2_2

    # Represent the number as a tuple of exact values if possible
    # Use sqrt(2)/2 as notation to highlight exactness
    # We'll print as string expressions for exactness:
    def val_str(x):
        # Check for 0,1,-1, or ±√2/2
        if abs(x - 0) < 1e-12:
            return "0"
        elif abs(x - 1) < 1e-12:

        elif abs(x + 1) < 1e-12:

        elif abs(x - sqrt2_2) < 1e-12:

print(f"Number of distinct values: {len(vals)}")
print("Hence, the set is finite with cardinality 8.")
