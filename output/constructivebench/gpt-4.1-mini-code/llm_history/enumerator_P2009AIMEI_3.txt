The problem involves finding rational values \( p = \frac{m}{n} \) (with \( m \) and \( n \) coprime and \( 0 < p < 1 \)) such that

\[
\binom{8}{3} p^3 (1-p)^5 = \frac{1}{25} \binom{8}{5} p^5 (1-p)^3.
\]

We want to enumerate small coprime pairs \((m,n)\) with \(1 \le m < n \le 20\), and print those pairs \((m,n)\) for which the above equality holds exactly (or very close numerically), then print the unique such pair if found.

```python
from math import comb, gcd

# Check equality within a tiny tolerance to handle floating-point arithmetic
def close_eq(a, b, tol=1e-14):
    return abs(a - b) < tol

print("Enumerating rational p = m/n with m,n â‰¤ 20 and gcd(m,n)=1")

for n in range(2, 21):
    for m in range(1, n):
        if gcd(m, n) != 1:
            continue
        p = m / n
        lhs = comb(8,3)* (p**3) * ((1-p)**5)
        rhs = (1/25)* comb(8,5)* (p**5) * ((1-p)**3)
        if close_eq(lhs, rhs):
            print(f"Found solution p = {m}/{n}")

print("Candidates up to n=20 enumerated.")
```
This program enumerates coprime pairs for denominator up to 20, printing each candidate as soon as it is found. Observe all printed solutions to conjecture the true answer.
