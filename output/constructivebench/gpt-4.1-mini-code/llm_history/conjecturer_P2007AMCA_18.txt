open Polynomial Complex

abbrev P2007AMCA_18_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2007AMCA_18 (f : ℝ[X]) (hdeg : degree f = 4) 
  (hroots : {2 * I, (2 : ℂ) + I} ⊆ (f.map (algebraMap ℝ ℂ)).roots) :
  coeff f 3 + coeff f 2 + coeff f 1 + coeff f 0 = P2007AMCA_18_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Polynomial coefficients (constant to x^4):
coeff f_0: 20.0
coeff f_1: -16.0
coeff f_2: 9.0
coeff f_3: -4.0
coeff f_4: 1
Sum coeff f_3 + f_2 + f_1 + f_0 = 9.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
