The problem involves real numbers \(a\) for which there exists a unique real \(x\) satisfying the inequality \(|x^2 + 2ax + 3a| \leq 2\). We want to enumerate possible values of \(a\) for which this uniqueness holds.

To analyze this, consider the quadratic function \(f(x) = x^2 + 2ax + 3a\). We want \(\exists!\ x\) with \(|f(x)| \leq 2\), i.e. exactly one \(x\) satisfies this.

Key insight:
- \(|f(x)| \leq 2\) means \(f(x) \in [-2, 2]\).
- Usually, quadratic inequality solutions are intervals or unions.
- Unique \(x\) solution means the set \(\{x : |f(x)| \leq 2\}\) is a single point.
- This implies \(f(x) = \pm 2\) has exactly one solution, i.e. tangent line scenarios.

We will enumerate sample values of \(a\) over some small range and check the sets where \(|f(x)| \leq 2\) has exactly one solution \(x\).

We can rewrite \(f(x) = (x+a)^2 - a^2 + 3a = y^2 + 3a - a^2\) where \(y = x+a\).

The inequality becomes \(|y^2 + 3a - a^2| \leq 2\).

Solve \(-2 \leq y^2 + 3a - a^2 \leq 2\).

For each fixed \(a\), find the number of \(y\) such that this holds. For uniqueness, the length of \(y\)-interval with the inequality holds must be zero (single \(y\)).

This happens when one boundary equality is tangent, i.e. when the quadratic \(y^2 + 3a - a^2 = \pm 2\) has exactly one solution.

Thus for each \(a\),
- \(y^2 + 3a - a^2 = 2 \implies y^2 = 2 + a^2 - 3a\).
- \(y^2 + 3a - a^2 = -2 \implies y^2 = -2 + a^2 - 3a\).

For uniqueness, one of these equals zero (one solution), the other inequality checked.

Now let's write a Python program enumerating values of a over some range, checking this uniqueness, and streaming candidates.

```python
import math

# Enumerate sample values for a in range [-5,5] step 0.1, check uniqueness

def unique_solution_a_candidates():
    # For each a, find the number of solutions x for |x^2 + 2ax + 3a| ≤ 2
    # Equivalently |(x+a)^2 + 3a - a^2| ≤ 2
    # Check number of solutions to inequalities and uniqueness condition

    step = 0.1
    low = -5
    high = 5

    for i in range(int((high - low)/step)+1):
        a = low + i*step
        c = 3*a - a**2
        # Solve y^2 + c = ±2
        # Equate to 2:
        val_up = 2 - c
        # Equate to -2:
        val_down = -2 - c

        # Number of solutions y^2 ≤ val_up and y^2 ≥ val_down
        # Inequality |y^2 + c| ≤ 2 means y^2 ∈ [ -2 - c, 2 - c ]

        # For real y, y^2 ≥ 0 so the intersection of [0,∞) with [val_down, val_up]
        # Number of y values with y^2 in that interval

        # Check that val_down ≤ val_up
        if val_down > val_up:
            # Empty set
            continue

        # Intersection with y^2 ≥ 0 is [max(0,val_down), val_up]

        left = max(0, val_down)
        right = val_up

        if left > right:
            # No real solution
            continue

        # If left == right and left >= 0, single y^2 value -> y = ±sqrt(left)
        # Corresponding to 1 or 2 solutions in y, but x = y - a (one to one)

        # However, solutions in x correspond to y solutions 1-1

        # So count solutions:
        if left == right and left >= 0:
            # exactly 2 solutions if left > 0 (y= ±√left)
            # exactly 1 solution if left == 0 (single solution y=0)
            if left == 0:
                # Exactly one solution for x
                print(f'a = {a:.2f} yields exactly one solution x for |f(x)| ≤ 2')
        else:
            # If left < right:
            # y^2 in interval of positive length, so infinite solutions x
            pass

unique_solution_a_candidates()
```
