[write_program]
The problem essentially asks us to find a natural number \(n\) such that \(n\) is composite (not prime), and \(n-2\) is also composite. Also, the problem negates the statement that for every composite \(n\), \(n-2\) is prime. So, we want to find examples of composite \(n\) with composite \(n-2\), and identify the smallest such \(n\).

We can write a Python program to enumerate values of \(n\), test primality for \(n\) and \(n-2\), and print such cases immediately.

```python
# Enumerate natural numbers n where both n and n-2 are composite.
# We'll print all such n up to a threshold, and identify the smallest.

def is_prime(k):
    if k < 2:
        return False
    if k < 4:
        return True
    if k % 2 == 0:
        return False
    r = int(k ** 0.5) + 1
    for i in range(3, r, 2):
        if k % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

max_n = 100  # reasonable upper bound for demonstration

candidates = []
for n in range(4, max_n + 1):  # start from 4 since n-2 must be >= 2
    if not is_prime(n) and not is_prime(n - 2):
        print(f"Found n={n}: composite n and composite n-2={n-2}")
        candidates.append(n)

if candidates:
    answer = min(candidates)
    print(f"Smallest such n (P2019AMCB_2_answer): {answer}")
else:
    print("No such n found up to", max_n)
```
