The problem asks to find all real values \(a\) for which the quartic polynomial 
\[16x^4 - a x^3 + (2a+17)x^2 - a x + 16 = 0\] 
has four distinct real roots \(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\) in geometric progression, i.e., \(x_2 = r x_1\), \(x_3 = r x_2 = r^2 x_1\), \(x_4 = r x_3 = r^3 x_1\) for some \(r \in \mathbb{R}\).

We'll enumerate over small rational values \(r\), and for each \(r\), solve for possible \(a\) and \(x_1\). Since the roots satisfy the polynomial, the polynomial can be factored as 
\[(x - x_1)(x - r x_1)(x - r^2 x_1)(x - r^3 x_1).\]

By expanding this factorization and equating coefficients with the given polynomial, we'll derive expressions for \(a\) and constraints on \(r\). We'll print all found candidate \(a\) values with corresponding \(r\), ensuring roots distinctness by checking \(r \neq 0, 1\) and roots distinctness conditions.

# Define symbolic variables
a, r, x1 = symbols('a r x1', real=True)
# Roots in geometric progression
x2 = r * x1
x3 = r * x2
x4 = r * x3

# Expand (x - x1)(x - r x1)(x - r^2 x1)(x - r^3 x1)
# The polynomial with roots x1, r x1, r^2 x1, r^3 x1 is:
# x^4 - (sum roots)*x^3 + (sum product pairs)*x^2 - (sum product triples)*x + product roots

S1 = x1 * (1 + r + r**2 + r**3)
S2 = x1**2 * (r + r**2 + r**3 + r**3*r + r**2*r**3 + r*r**3)  # incorrect: fix below

# Sum of roots:
S1 = x1 * (1 + r + r**2 + r**3)

# Sum of products of roots taken two at a time:
# Pairs: (x1*x2, x1*x3, x1*x4, x2*x3, x2*x4, x3*x4)
S2 = x1**2 * (r + r**2 + r**3 + r**3 + r**4 + r**5)
# Simplify S2
S2 = simplify(S2)

# Sum of products of roots taken three at a time:
# Triples: x1*x2*x3 + x1*x2*x4 + x1*x3*x4 + x2*x3*x4
S3 = x1**3 * (r * r**2 + r * r**3 + r**2 * r**3 + r**3 * r**2 * r**3)  # fix below

# Let's list triples explicitly:
# x1*x2*x3 = x1 * (r x1) * (r^2 x1) = r^3 x1^3
# x1*x2*x4 = x1 * (r x1) * (r^3 x1) = r^4 x1^3
# x1*x3*x4 = x1 * (r^2 x1) * (r^3 x1) = r^5 x1^3
# x2*x3*x4 = (r x1) * (r^2 x1) * (r^3 x1) = r^6 x1^3
S3 = x1**3 * (r**3 + r**4 + r**5 + r**6)

# Product of all four roots:
P = x1**4 * r**(1+2+3)  # r^(6)
P = x1**4 * r**6

# So the quartic expanded is:
# x^4 - S1 x^3 + S2 x^2 - S3 x + P

# Match given polynomial: 16 x^4 - a x^3 + (2a+17) x^2 - a x +16 = 0

# Coefficient matching:
# Coeffs of x^4: 16 = 1 * scale => polynomial is scaled by 16 from the monic factorization
# So multiply factorization by 16:
# 16 x^4 - 16 S1 x^3 + 16 S2 x^2 -16 S3 x + 16 P

eq1 = Eq(-16 * S1, -a)
eq2 = Eq(16 * S2, 2 * a + 17)
eq3 = Eq(-16 * S3, -a)
eq4 = Eq(16 * P, 16)

# Simplify eq4:
# 16 * P = 16 => P = 1
eq4_simple = Eq(P, 1)

# From eq1 and eq3:
# -16 S1 = -a and -16 S3 = -a implies S1 = S3

# So set S1 = S3
eq_s1_s3 = Eq(S1, S3)

# From eq4, P=1: x1^4 * r^6 =1 => x1^4 = 1 / r^6

# We will try to solve for x1 in terms of r using eq4 and check consistency

# Define r values to try:
r_values = [Rational(-3,2), Rational(-2,1), Rational(-1,2), Rational(-1,1), Rational(2,1), Rational(3,2), Rational(1,2)]
