Ground Truth Answer: 9/2
Proposed Answer: abs ((-6 / 2) - (6 / 4))
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step.

1. The problem gives two lines:
   - line1: y = 2x + 6 (x-intercept at x1 = -3)
   - line2: y = -4x + 6 (x-intercept at x2 = 3/2)

2. We need to find |x1 - x2|, which is |-3 - (3/2)| = |-9/2| = 9/2 (ground truth answer)

3. The proposed answer is abs ((-6 / 2) - (6 / 4)):
   - -6/2 = -3 (which is x1)
   - 6/4 = 3/2 (which is x2)
   - So this becomes abs (-3 - (3/2)) = 9/2

The proposed answer is just expressing the same calculation in a different form, using the coefficients from the line equations (6/2 and 6/4 instead of the pre-calculated intercepts). The final result is identical.
