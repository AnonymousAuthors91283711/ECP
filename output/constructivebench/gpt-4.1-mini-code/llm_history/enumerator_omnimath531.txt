The problem seems to consider a Monty Hall style scenario with 7 doors and 2 prizes behind them. The host opens 2 doors out of the remaining 5, picking only doors without prizes. The formula to check is the probability of initially choosing a door without a prize, then the host opening 2 doors that do not reveal a prize. The problem likely wants the exact probability fraction.

We can enumerate the probability by enumerating all possible initial choices and host openings satisfying the constraints, then compute the ratio accordingly.

We'll:
- Enumerate all ways to pick initial door (7 choices)
- Enumerate all ways for host to open 2 doors from remaining 6 doors
- Count how many times the initial choice was a door without a prize (2 prize doors out of 7)
- Count how many favorable cases (initial no prize and host opens 2 prize-free doors)

We'll print partial results.

```python
from itertools import combinations

def choose(n, k):
    # Compute n choose k efficiently
    if k > n or k < 0:
        return 0
    k = min(k, n - k)
    c = 1
    for i in range(k):
        c = c * (n - i) // (i + 1)
    return c

doors = list(range(7))
prize_doors = set([0,1]) # assume prizes at door 0 and 1 for enumeration

total_cases = 0
favorable_cases = 0

print("Enumerating cases with 7 doors and 2 prizes behind doors 0,1")

for initial_choice in doors:
    remaining_doors = [d for d in doors if d != initial_choice]
    # Host picks 2 doors from remaining 6 that do NOT contain prizes
    # so host doors must be from non-prize doors excluding initial choice
    # Let's find non-prize doors excluding initial_choice if it is non-prize
    # Actually the host picks 2 doors from remaining doors excluding prize doors
    host_options = [d for d in remaining_doors if d not in prize_doors]
    # host picks 2 doors from host_options
    for host_open in combinations(host_options, 2):
        total_cases += 1
        # Check if initial_choice is NOT a prize door: favorable if yes
        if initial_choice not in prize_doors:
            favorable_cases += 1
            print(f"Initial:{initial_choice}, Host opens:{host_open} --> Favorable")

print(f"Total cases: {total_cases}")
print(f"Favorable cases: {favorable_cases}")
# Print exact fraction
from fractions import Fraction
frac = Fraction(favorable_cases, total_cases)
print(f"Probability (favorable/total): {frac} = {float(frac):.6f}")
```
This enumerates all valid cases, prints favorable cases, shows the fraction and decimal probability. This assists in conjecturing/validating the formula in the theorem.
