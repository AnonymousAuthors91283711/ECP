Ground Truth Answer: fun N => 2^(N - 2) + 1
Proposed Answer: fun N : ℕ => N + 1
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the minimal number M such that any collection of M boolean functions on N variables must contain a subset of N functions that agree on a common output value for each input position.

2. The ground truth answer is 2^(N-2) + 1, which comes from combinatorial reasoning about boolean functions. This grows exponentially with N.

3. The proposed answer is N + 1, which grows linearly with N. This is clearly different from the exponential growth of the correct answer.

4. For N = 4:
   - Ground truth: 2^(4-2) + 1 = 5
   - Proposed: 4 + 1 = 5
   They match at N=4, but diverge quickly for larger N (e.g., at N=5: 9 vs 6).

5. The proposed answer is only correct for N=4 (the minimal case given by hN), but fails for all larger N.
