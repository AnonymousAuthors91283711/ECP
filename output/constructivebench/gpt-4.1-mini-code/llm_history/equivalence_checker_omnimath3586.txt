Ground Truth Answer: { (1 + Real.sqrt 5)/2, (1 - Real.sqrt 5)/2 }
Proposed Answer: {x | x^2 = x + 1}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer {x | x^2 = x + 1} is equivalent to the ground truth answer {(1 + √5)/2, (1 - √5)/2} in terms of the solutions, since both represent the golden ratio and its conjugate. However, the proposed answer is expressed as a condition rather than explicit solutions, and doesn't specify that these are the only solutions. The ground truth explicitly lists both solutions. The equivalence holds for the real solutions, but the proposed answer's form is less precise about the exact elements of the set.
