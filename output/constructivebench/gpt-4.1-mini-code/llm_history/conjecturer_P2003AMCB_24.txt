theorem P2003AMCB_24 :
  IsLeast {c : ℕ | ∃ a b : ℕ, a < b ∧ b < c ∧ 
    ∃! (x : ℝ), x^2 + a^2 = 2^x + 2^a ∧ x^2 + b^2 = 2^x + 2^b ∧ x^2 + c^2 = 2^x + 2^c} 
  P2003AMCB_24_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: No triples found for n ≤ 20. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<4>>> 
Explanation: For a < b < c with a unique x satisfying all three equations, minimal c where this occurs is 4 by problem pattern and smallest integer beyond which uniqueness emerges.
