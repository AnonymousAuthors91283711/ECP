[write_program]
The problem concerns finding all pairs \((f, P)\) with \(f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}\) and \(P\) a polynomial with nonnegative coefficients and zero constant term, satisfying 
\[ f(f(x) + P(y)) = f(x - y) + 2y \] 
for all \(x>y>0\), and \(f(x)>0\) for \(x>0\).

To explore candidates for \(f\) and \(P\), we try:
- simple polynomials \(P(y) = a_1 y + a_2 y^2\) with \(a_i \ge 0\), and \(P(0)=0\),
- monotone \(f\) (likely increasing and positive on \(\mathbb{R}_{>0}\)),
- try linear and quadratic \(f\).

We guess a parameter grid, enumerate options, and print those which satisfy the equation on some test points approximately.

```python
# Enumerate candidate functions f and polynomials P satisfying the given functional equation on sample points

import numpy as np

def eval_poly(coeffs, x):
    # coeffs: list for polynomial coefficients, coeffs[i] for x^i
    return sum(c * x**i for i, c in enumerate(coeffs))

def f_linear(a, b, x):
    return a * x + b

def check_identity(f_a, f_b, P_coeffs):
    # Check the identity for some sample (x,y), x>y>0
    samples = [(2.0,1.0),(3.0,1.5),(5.0,2.0)]
    for x,y in samples:
        if y <= 0 or x <= y:
            continue
        lhs = f_linear(f_a, f_b, f_linear(f_a,f_b,x) + eval_poly(P_coeffs,y))
        rhs = f_linear(f_a, f_b, x - y) + 2*y
        if not np.isclose(lhs, rhs, atol=1e-6):
            return False
    return True

                    continue
