The problem is to find the minimal integer value that the given rational function
\[ f(x) = \frac{x^4 - 6x^3 + 2x^2 - 6x + 2}{x^2 + 1} \]
takes as \( x \) varies over the real numbers.

We will enumerate integer values of \( f(x) \) by sampling real \( x \) values (including some critical points approximated numerically), checking if \( f(x) \) hits integer values near these points, and print all integer values found. From these, we can conjecture the minimum integer value attained.

```python
import math

def f(x):
    numerator = x**4 - 6*x**3 + 2*x**2 - 6*x + 2
    denominator = x**2 + 1
    return numerator / denominator

# We search for integers y = f(x) by sampling many x and checking if f(x) is close to an integer
# Sampling a range from -5 to 7 with small steps to catch integer values
found_ints = set()
print("Sampling f(x) for x in [-5,7] to find integer values of f(x)")

for i in range(-500, 700):
    x = i / 100  # step 0.01
    val = f(x)
    val_round = round(val)
    if abs(val - val_round) < 1e-6:
        if val_round not in found_ints:
            found_ints.add(val_round)
            print(f"f({x:.2f}) â‰ˆ {val:.6f} ~ {val_round}")

# Print all found integer values sorted
print("Candidate integer values of f(x) found (approximately):")
for y in sorted(found_ints):
    print(y)

# To conjecture the minimum integer, print minimum found
if found_ints:
    min_int = min(found_ints)
    print(f"Minimum integer value of f(x) found: {min_int}")
else:
    print("No integer values found in sampled range.")
```
