The problem involves characterizing functions \( f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \) such that for every \( a, b \in \mathbb{N} \), there exist natural numbers \( x, y, z \) meeting certain equalities and inequalities resembling triangle inequalities with certain substitutions.

To assist in conjecturing the form of \( f \), we'll enumerate over small values of \( a, b \). For candidate \( f \), we'll check if, for all \( a, b \) up to some small threshold, there exist \( x, y, z \) satisfying the given equalities and triangle inequalities. Since \( x = a \), \( y = f(b) \), \( z = f(b + f(a) - 1) \), the constraints reduce to testing these values.

We will try some small candidate functions such as identity \( f(n) = n \), constant functions, and others, printing for each whether the conditions hold in the sample range.

```python
# Enumerate candidate functions and check the triangle inequalities conditions for small inputs.
# The problem defines:
# For all a,b in N, we need x=a, y=f(b), z=f(b + f(a) -1),
# and the triangle inequalities: x+y>z, y+z>x, z+x>y.
# We'll test functions f on small domains and print results to conjecture the form of f.

def tri(a, b, f):
    x = a
    y = f(b)
    try:
        z = f(b + f(a) - 1)
    except:
        return False
    return (x + y > z) and (y + z > x) and (z + x > y)

    return n

    return n + 1

    return n*n

candidates = [
    ("identity", identity),

]

max_val = 5  # small testing bounds

for name, f in candidates:
    print(f"Testing f = {name}")
    all_good = True
    for a in range(max_val):
        for b in range(max_val):
            if not tri(a, b, f):
                print(f"Failed at a={a}, b={b}")
                all_good = False
                break
        if not all_good:
            break
    if all_good:
        print(f"Function '{name}' satisfies the conditions for a,b in [0..{max_val-1}]")
    else:
        print(f"Function '{name}' does NOT satisfy the conditions for all tested a,b")
