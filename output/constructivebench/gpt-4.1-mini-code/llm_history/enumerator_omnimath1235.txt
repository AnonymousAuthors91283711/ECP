This problem asks to find the exact value of the product \(\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{7}\right) \tan\left(\frac{2\pi}{7}\right) \tan\left(\frac{3\pi}{7}\right)\).

We'll write a Python program that enumerates approximations of these tangent values and their products to conjecture the exact value. We will also check rational or simple algebraic candidates close to this product.

```python
import math
from fractions import Fraction

# Compute tangents of pi/7, 2pi/7, and 3pi/7
angles = [math.pi/7, 2*math.pi/7, 3*math.pi/7]

tans = []
for a in angles:
    t = math.tan(a)
    print(f"tan({a:.5f}) = {t:.12f}")
    tans.append(t)

prod = 1
for t in tans:
    prod *= t

print(f"Product of tans: {prod:.12f}")

# Enumerate simple fractions (or small integer-related values) near product
# trying to identify if it is a simple rational or integer value
# Check integers and fractions near product (up to denominator=20)
candidates = []
for denom in range(1, 21):
    for numer in range(-20, 21):
        val = numer / denom
        if abs(val - prod) < 0.01:
            candidates.append(Fraction(numer, denom))

print("Candidates near product:")
for c in candidates:
    print(f"{c} = {float(c):.12f}")

# Since these tangents come from roots of unity-related angles,
# the product might be sqrt(7), or sqrt(7)/7, or just sqrt(7)/7.
# Check these values:
specials = [math.sqrt(7), 1/math.sqrt(7), -1/math.sqrt(7)]
for s in specials:
    print(f"Special value: {s:.12f}, difference from product: {abs(s-prod):.12f}")
```
This will print the tangent values, their product, and candidate close fractions or notable values, helping us conjecture the exact answer.
