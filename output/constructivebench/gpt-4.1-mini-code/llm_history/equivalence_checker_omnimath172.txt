Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {(a, b, c) : ℤ × ℤ × ℤ | (a - b) * (b - c) * (c - a) = 0} ∪
{(a, b, c) : ℤ × ℤ × ℤ | a ≠ b ∧ b ≠ c ∧ c ≠ a ∧ ∃ n : ℕ, ((a - b) * (b - c) * (c - a)) / 2 + 2 = 2016 ^ n}
<<<None>>>
The problem statement is incomplete as both the ground truth answer and the proposed answer are marked as "sorry" (a placeholder in Lean). Without knowing the actual intended solution or the definition of `omnimath172_answer`, it's impossible to determine whether the proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth. The proposed answer appears to be a reasonable attempt, but we cannot verify its correctness without more information.
