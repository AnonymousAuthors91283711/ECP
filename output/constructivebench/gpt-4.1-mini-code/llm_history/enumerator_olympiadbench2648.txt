The problem describes a geometric sequence \( a_n = a_1 \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^{n-1} \), with given values \( a_{20} = 8 \) and \( a_{14} = 2^{21} \). We want to find \( a_{21} \).

To help conjecture the answer, let's enumerate candidates by:
- Picking two initial values \( a_1 \) and ratio \( r = \frac{a_2}{a_1} \) consistent with the given conditions,
- Solve for \( a_1 \) and \( r \),
- Calculate \( a_{21} \) exactly,
- Print intermediate calculations and the final candidate \( a_{21} \).

We use symbolic calculations with `sympy` for exact values.

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Rational, simplify, Pow

# Define symbolic variables
a1, r = symbols('a1 r', real=True)
# Geometric sequence formula: a_n = a1 * r^(n-1)
# Given a_20 = 8 and a_14 = 2^21
eq1 = Eq(a1 * r**19, 8)
eq2 = Eq(a1 * r**13, 2**21)

# Solve system for a1 and r
sol = solve((eq1, eq2), (a1, r))
print("Solutions for (a1, r):")
for s in sol:
    a1_val = simplify(s[0])
    r_val = simplify(s[1])
    # Calculate a_21 = a1 * r^20
    a21 = simplify(a1_val * Pow(r_val, 20))
    print(f"a1 = {a1_val}, r = {r_val}, a21 = {a21}")
```

This enumerates the exact solutions and calculates \( a_{21} \). From this, the value \( a_{21} \) can be conjectured precisely.
