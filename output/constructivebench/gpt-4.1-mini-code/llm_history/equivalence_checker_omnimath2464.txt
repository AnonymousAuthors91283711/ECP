Ground Truth Answer: 55/2
Proposed Answer: 185/16
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves evaluating a piecewise-defined integral from 0 to 2. The integrand has three cases:
   - 50/2 when t ≤ 0.25
   - (50 - 60*(t - 0.25))/2 when 0.25 < t ≤ 0.5
   - 0 when t > 0.5

2. The integral can be broken into three parts:
   - From 0 to 0.25: ∫(25)dt = 25*0.25 = 6.25
   - From 0.25 to 0.5: ∫(25 - 30*(t - 0.25))dt
   - From 0.5 to 2: ∫(0)dt = 0

3. Calculating the second part:
   ∫(25 - 30*(t - 0.25))dt from 0.25 to 0.5
   = [25t - 15(t - 0.25)²] from 0.25 to 0.5
   = (12.5 - 15*(0.25)²) - (6.25 - 0)
   = (12.5 - 0.9375) - 6.25
   = 11.5625 - 6.25 = 5.3125

4. Total integral = 6.25 + 5.3125 = 11.5625
   - Ground truth: 55/2 = 27.5 (incorrect)
   - Proposed answer: 185/16 = 11.5625 (correct)

The ground truth answer is incorrect, while the proposed answer matches our calculation.
