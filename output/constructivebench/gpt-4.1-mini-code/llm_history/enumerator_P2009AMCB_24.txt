The problem involves finding the number of values \( x \in [0, \pi] \) satisfying \(\arcsin(\sin(6x)) = \arccos(\cos x)\). To enumerate solutions, I'll sample \(x\) in \([0,\pi]\), compute both sides, and check equality with a tolerance. Since both sides are principal values of inverse trig functions, their ranges differ: \(\arcsin\) in \([- \pi/2, \pi/2]\) and \(\arccos\) in \([0, \pi]\). Equality implies \(\arcsin(\sin(6x)) = \arccos(\cos x) \in [0, \pi/2]\) because arcsin output is limited, so values must be consistent.

To find exact values, I consider the known identities:
- \(\arcsin(\sin \theta) = \theta\) if \(\theta \in [-\pi/2, \pi/2]\).
- \(\arccos(\cos \phi) = \phi\) if \(\phi \in [0, \pi]\).

Thus, for each \(x\), we can compute principal values and check equality, considering that \(\arcsin(\sin(6x))\) "folds" \(6x\) into \([- \pi/2, \pi/2]\) via periodicity.

I'll discretize \([0, \pi]\) finely and print solutions immediately when found.

```python
import math

# Numerically find x in [0, pi] where arcsin(sin(6x)) = arccos(cos x).
# Both functions return principal values:
# arcsin(sin θ) ∈ [-pi/2, pi/2]; arccos(cos φ) ∈ [0, pi].
# We'll sample 0 <= x <= pi with a fine step and check near equality.

def arcsin_sin(theta):
    # Reduce theta mod 2pi and apply arcsin(sin(theta)) formula
    # arcsin(sin(theta)) = theta - 2*pi*k if in [-pi/2, pi/2], else adjusted.
    # Equivalently: 
    # arcsin(sin theta) = residual in [-pi/2, pi/2]:
    # Calculate theta mod 2pi in [0, 2pi)
    t = theta % (2 * math.pi)
    if t <= math.pi/2:
        return t
    elif t <= 3*math.pi/2:
        return math.pi - t
    else:
        return t - 2*math.pi

def arccos_cos(phi):
    # arccos(cos phi) = phi if phi in [0, pi], else folds accordingly
    # Since domain is [0, pi], no folds needed
    return phi

n_solutions = 0
delta = 1e-5
step = 1e-4
x = 0.0
solutions = []
while x <= math.pi + 1e-8:
    val1 = arcsin_sin(6*x)
    val2 = arccos_cos(x)
    # Since arcsin_sin in [-pi/2, pi/2], arccos_cos in [0, pi], equality only possible if val1 >= 0
    if val1 >= 0 and abs(val1 - val2) < delta:
        # Print solution rounded nicely
        sol = round(x, 6)
        # Avoid duplicates by checking proximity to last found
        if not solutions or abs(sol - solutions[-1]) > 1e-4:
            print(f"x = {sol}, arcsin(sin(6x)) = {val1:.6f}, arccos(cos x) = {val2:.6f}")
            solutions.append(sol)
            n_solutions += 1
    x += step

print(f"Number of solutions in [0, pi]: {n_solutions}")
```
