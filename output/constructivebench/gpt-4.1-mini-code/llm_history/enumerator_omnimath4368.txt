The problem involves counting permutations \( f: \{0,\ldots,19\} \to \{0,\ldots,19\} \) satisfying certain order constraints encoded by a function \(\text{constraints}\), such that the count equals 2010. To explore possible sets of constraints and the number of corresponding bijections, I will:

- Enumerate small sample constraint sets for \( n=4 \) (instead of 20, to keep computations manageable).
- Check for each set the number of permutations satisfying the constraints.
- Print the constraint sets and counts immediately.
- Try to observe how the number of constraints affects the count and if 2010 ever appears at small \( n \).

This approach will help conjecture about the structure needed for the constraints at \( n=20 \).

```python
import itertools

n = 4  # smaller n for feasibility
elements = list(range(n))

def count_bijective_with_constraints(constraints):
    count = 0
    for perm in itertools.permutations(elements):
        # perm is a tuple of length n representing f(0), f(1), ..., f(n-1)
        # For each i, j in constraints[i], check f(j) < f(i)
        valid = True
        for i in range(n):
            for j in constraints[i]:
                if perm[j] >= perm[i]:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if not valid:
                break
        if valid:
            count += 1
    return count

# Generate constraint sets and count perms

# To limit output, only consider constraints where each constraints[i] is subset of {0,...,n-1}\{i}
# and total number of constraints up to 3 for feasibility.

print(f"n = {n}, enumerating sample constraints:")

# We will try all assignments of constraints where each constraints[i] is one or zero elements,
# total constraints <=3

indices = list(range(n))
all_positions = set(indices)

from itertools import combinations, product

max_constraints = 3  # total constraint edges

# We try constraint edges as (i,j) with j != i meaning j in constraints[i].
# Select subsets of at most max_constraints edges
edges_candidates = [(i,j) for i in indices for j in indices if j != i]

for num_edges in range(max_constraints+1):
    for edges_subset in combinations(edges_candidates, num_edges):
        # Build constraints dictionary mapping i -> set of j
        constraints = {i:set() for i in indices}
        for (i,j) in edges_subset:
            constraints[i].add(j)
        cnt = count_bijective_with_constraints(constraints)
        print(f"Constraints edges = {edges_subset}, count = {cnt}")

# Trying to reach count=2010 is impossible for n=4, but this systematic exploration
# can help gain insight about how the constraints affect the count.
