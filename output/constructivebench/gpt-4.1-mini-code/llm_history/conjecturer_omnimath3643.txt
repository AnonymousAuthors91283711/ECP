abbrev omnimath3643_answer : Prop := sorry
theorem omnimath3643 : 
  (∃ (n : ℤ), ∃ (r : ℚ), (Real.sqrt (n - 1) + Real.sqrt (n + 1)) = r) ↔ omnimath3643_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating n values for sqrt(n-1)+sqrt(n+1) rationality check (1 ≤ n ≤ 100):
No rational sums found for n in 1..100. Expected Answer Type: Prop
<<<¬∃ (n : ℤ) (r : ℚ), Real.sqrt (↑n - 1) + Real.sqrt (↑n + 1) = r>>>
