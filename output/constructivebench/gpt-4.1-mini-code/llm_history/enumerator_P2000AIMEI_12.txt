The problem involves a function \( f \) on \(\mathbb{R}\) with conditions \( f(x) = f(46 - x) \) and \( f(x) = f(398 - x) \). We want to analyze the cardinalities of the image set obtained by restricting \( f \) to the finite domain \(\{0, 1, \ldots, 999\}\), i.e., a function \( g: \text{Fin } 1000 \to \mathbb{R} \) with \( g(i) = f(i) \).

Our goal is to enumerate possible cardinalities \( n \) of the image of \( g \), i.e., the number of distinct values \( f(i) \) takes on integers \( 0 \leq i < 1000 \), and find the greatest such \( n \).

To help conjecture the true maximum size of the image set, we will:

- Consider the relations among points forced by the equalities \( f(x)=f(46 - x) \) and \( f(x)=f(398 - x) \).
- Each orbit under the group generated by the involutions \( x \mapsto 46 - x \) and \( x \mapsto 398 - x \) must have all \( f \)-values equal. Thus, distinct orbits correspond to distinct values within the image.
- We will enumerate these orbits for points \( 0 \leq i \leq 999 \).
- Print each orbit set size and the points in it, helping identify the possible distinct \( f \)-values.
- Finally, output the maximum possible distinct values (= number of orbits).

```python
# Enumerate the orbits of the group generated by involutions x -> 46 - x and x -> 398 - x on the set {0,...,999}.
# For each orbit print its elements. The number of orbits equals the maximal possible image size.

def orbit(x):
    """Compute the orbit of x under the involutions."""
    orbit_set = set()
    stack = [x]
    while stack:
        p = stack.pop()
        if p not in orbit_set and 0 <= p < 1000:
            orbit_set.add(p)
            # Apply the two involutions
            a = 46 - p
            b = 398 - p
            # Add to stack if new
            if a not in orbit_set and 0 <= a < 1000:
                stack.append(a)
            if b not in orbit_set and 0 <= b < 1000:
                stack.append(b)
    return orbit_set

visited = set()
orbits = []

for i in range(1000):
    if i not in visited:
        orb = orbit(i)
        orbits.append(orb)
        visited.update(orb)
        print(f"Orbit with {len(orb)} elements: {sorted(orb)}")

print(f"\nTotal distinct orbits (max distinct values): {len(orbits)}")
```
