We want to analyze the expression \((33 \times 11 + 55 \times 33) / (33 + 55)\).

Let's write a Python program that computes the exact value for this expression and potentially for some similar weighted averages using small sample values.

```python
# Enumerate weighted averages for sample values.
# Here, we focus on the expression: (33*11 + 55*33) / (33 + 55)

def weighted_average(x1, w1, x2, w2):
    return (w1 * x1 + w2 * x2) / (w1 + w2)

w1, x1 = 33, 11
w2, x2 = 55, 33
result = weighted_average(x1, w1, x2, w2)
print(f"Weighted average for w1={w1}, x1={x1}, w2={w2}, x2={x2}: {result}")

# To assist conjecture, enumerate few more samples changing weights and values
samples = [
    (10, 5, 20, 15),
    (1, 1, 1, 1),
    (2, 3, 4, 5),
    (33, 11, 55, 12),  # close but different x2
    (33, 10, 55, 33),  # close but different x1
]

for w1, x1, w2, x2 in samples:
    val = weighted_average(x1, w1, x2, w2)
    print(f"Weighted average for w1={w1}, x1={x1}, w2={w2}, x2={x2}: {val}")
```
