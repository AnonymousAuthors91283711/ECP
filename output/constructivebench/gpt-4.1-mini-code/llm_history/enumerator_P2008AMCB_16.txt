The problem involves pairs of natural numbers \((a,b)\) with \(b > a > 0\) such that there exist \(x, y \in \mathbb{N}\) with \(x+2 = a\), \(y+2 = b\), and the equation \(x y = \frac{a b}{2}\) holds with \(2 \mid a b\).

We want to enumerate candidate pairs \((a,b)\) for certain ranges and verify the conditions:
- \(a > 0\)
- \(b > a\)
- \(2 \mid a b\) (i.e., \(a b\) even)
- There exist \(x,y\) with \(x = a-2\), \(y = b-2\), such that \(x y = \frac{a b}{2}\)

We enumerate for a small range (e.g., \(1 < a < b \leq 20\)) and output pairs that satisfy this relation, printing the pairs \((a,b)\) immediately when found.

```python
# Enumerate (a,b) with 1 < a < b <= 20 such that
# (a-2)*(b-2) = (a*b)/2 and 2 divides a*b
# Print pairs (a,b) that satisfy these conditions

def main():
    max_val = 20
    for a in range(1, max_val + 1):
        for b in range(a + 1, max_val + 1):
            ab = a * b
            # Check divisibility by 2
            if ab % 2 != 0:
                continue
            x = a - 2
            y = b - 2
            if x < 0 or y < 0:
                continue
            if x * y == ab // 2:
                print(f"(a,b) = ({a},{b})")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This will help us observe the pairs satisfying the problem constraint and conjecture the answer set.
