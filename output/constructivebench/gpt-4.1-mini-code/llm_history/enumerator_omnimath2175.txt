The problem deals with a finite set \( s \) of positive integers where for each \( n \in s \), the 2022nd iterate of the map \( m \mapsto m - \minFac(m) \) is prime, but the 2021st is not prime. The sum of all such \( n \) equals a certain answer.

To explore, we:
- Define \(\minFac(m)\) as the smallest prime factor of \( m \) (or \( m \) itself if \( m \) is prime),
- Starting from \( n \), iterate the mapping 2022 times,
- Check if the 2022nd image is prime,
- Check if the 2021st is *not* prime,
- If so, record \( n \).

The problem is difficult and computationally intensive, so we limit the search to some manageable range, e.g., \( n \leq 2000 \). We print each candidate \( n \) as we find it and their sum at the end.

```python
import math

def is_prime(x: int) -> bool:
    if x < 2:
        return False
    if x % 2 == 0:
        return x == 2
    r = int(math.isqrt(x))
    for i in range(3, r+1, 2):
        if x % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def min_fac(x: int) -> int:
    if x % 2 == 0:
        return 2
    r = int(math.isqrt(x))
    for i in range(3, r+1, 2):
        if x % i == 0:
            return i
    return x

def iterate_map(n: int, times: int) -> int:
    m = n
    for _ in range(times):
        m -= min_fac(m)
        if m <= 0:  # If we go to <= 0, stop early
            return 0
    return m

def main():
    limit = 2000
    candidates = []
    print(f"Checking n in [1..{limit}]")
    for n in range(1, limit+1):
        before = iterate_map(n, 2021)
        after = iterate_map(n, 2022)
        if after > 1 and is_prime(after) and not is_prime(before):
            candidates.append(n)
            print(n)
    total = sum(candidates)
    print(f"Sum of candidates: {total}")

    main()
