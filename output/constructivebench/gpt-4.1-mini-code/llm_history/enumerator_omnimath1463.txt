The problem considers injective functions q from a 4-element set to a 9-element set, with inequalities among the function values at specific points. We want to count the number of such functions q: Fin 4 → Fin 9 such that q is injective and q 1 < q 0, q 1 < q 2, and q 3 < q 2.

We enumerate all injective functions from {0,1,2,3}→{0,...,8} and count those satisfying the inequalities.

```python
from itertools import permutations

# Elements of domain and codomain sizes
n_domain = 4
n_codomain = 9

count = 0
for p in permutations(range(n_codomain), n_domain):
    # p corresponds to q: q[0], q[1], q[2], q[3]
    # Check inequalities q1 < q0, q1 < q2, q3 < q2
    if p[1] < p[0] and p[1] < p[2] and p[3] < p[2]:
        count += 1
        print(f"Found valid q: {p}")

print(f"Total count of valid functions q: {count}")
```
