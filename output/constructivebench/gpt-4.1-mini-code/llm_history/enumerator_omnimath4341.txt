The problem involves summing the floor of \(\frac{(i+1)(j+1)}{n+1}\) over \(i,j = 0\) to \(n-1\), and checking if it equals \(\frac{n^2(n-1)}{4}\).

Let's enumerate for small \(n\) to observe and conjecture about the sum and its relation to the formula.

```python
# Enumerate sums for small n and compare to (n^2*(n-1))//4
def floor_sum(n):
    total = 0
    denom = n + 1
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            total += ((i + 1) * (j + 1)) // denom
    return total

print("n, sum, formula, equal?")
for n in range(1, 21):  # small n up to 20
    s = floor_sum(n)
    f = (n**2 * (n - 1)) // 4
    print(f"{n}, {s}, {f}, {s == f}")
```
