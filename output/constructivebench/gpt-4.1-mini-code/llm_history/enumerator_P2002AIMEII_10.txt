This problem concerns finding positive real numbers \( x \) such that \(\sin(x \pi/180) = \sin x\), specifically focusing on two particular forms involving \(\pi\):

\[
x_1 = \frac{\pi \cdot 180}{180 - \pi}, \quad x_2 = \frac{\pi \cdot 180}{180 + \pi}.
\]

We want to:

- Enumerate values of \( (m,n,p,q) \in \mathbb{N}^4 \) satisfying 
\[
m \pi / (n - \pi) = x_1, \quad p \pi / (q + \pi) = x_2,
\]
approximately by checking if \( m \pi/(n - \pi) \) closely matches \( x_1 \) and similarly for \( x_2 \).

- Print the sums \( m+n+p+q \) for all small integer candidates.

We'll try small integer ranges for \(m,n,p,q\) (1 to 20) and look for matches with a reasonable tolerance.

```python
import math

# Precompute x1 and x2 from the problem
pi = math.pi
x1 = pi * 180 / (180 - pi)
x2 = pi * 180 / (180 + pi)

tol = 1e-9  # tolerance for float comparison

found_sums = []

print(f"x1 ≈ {x1}")
print(f"x2 ≈ {x2}")

# We'll try m,n,p,q from 1 to 20 to find integer tuples matching the equations
for m in range(1, 21):
    for n in range(1, 21):
        denom1 = n - pi
        if abs(denom1) < 1e-6:
            continue  # avoid division by zero or near zero
        val1 = m * pi / denom1
        if abs(val1 - x1) < tol:
            for p in range(1, 21):
                for q in range(1, 21):
                    denom2 = q + pi
                    val2 = p * pi / denom2
                    if abs(val2 - x2) < tol:
                        s = m + n + p + q
                        print(f"m={m}, n={n}, p={p}, q={q}, m+n+p+q={s}")
                        found_sums.append(s)

if found_sums:
    min_sum = min(found_sums)
    print(f"Minimum m+n+p+q = {min_sum}")
else:
    print("No matching tuples found in given range.")
```
