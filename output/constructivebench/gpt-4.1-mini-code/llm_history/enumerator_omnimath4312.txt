The problem is to find all integer pairs \((x,y)\) satisfying the equation:
\[
x^3 - y^3 = 2 x y + 8.
\]

We'll iterate over a reasonable range of integers (e.g., \(-20\) to \(20\)) for both \(x\) and \(y\), and print all solutions found. This will help conjecture the exact pattern or closed form of solutions.

```python
# Enumerate integer solutions (x,y) with x,y in [-20,20] satisfying:
# x^3 - y^3 = 2*x*y + 8
# Print exact solutions immediately upon finding.

def main():
    for x in range(-20, 21):
        for y in range(-20, 21):
            lhs = x**3 - y**3
            rhs = 2*x*y + 8
            if lhs == rhs:
                print(f"x={x}, y={y}")
                
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
