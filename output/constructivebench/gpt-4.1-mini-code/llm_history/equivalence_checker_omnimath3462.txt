Ground Truth Answer: 14
Proposed Answer: 29
Let's analyze the proposed answer (29) against the conditions:

1. 29 % 3 = 2 ≠ 0 ✔ (satisfies first condition)
2. √29 ≈ 5.385 (not an integer) ✔ (satisfies second condition)
3. Sum of digits: 2 + 9 = 11 (which is prime) ✔ (satisfies third condition)

The ground truth answer (14) also satisfies all conditions:
1. 14 % 3 = 2 ≠ 0
2. √14 ≈ 3.741 (not an integer)
3. Sum of digits: 1 + 4 = 5 (which is prime)

Both answers satisfy all the given conditions, so they are both valid solutions to the problem. The problem appears to have multiple correct answers.
