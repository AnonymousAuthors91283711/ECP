The problem involves counting integers k > 0 such that the quadratic inequality \(-k^2 - 2k + n \geq 0\) holds for varying n, then finding the minimum n for which the count is at least T=5.

I will enumerate values of n, count how many positive integers k satisfy the inequality, and identify those n where the count is at least 5. This will help conjecture the minimal such n.

```python
# Enumerate n and count positive k with -k^2 -2k + n >= 0
# Print counts for n up to a threshold to find minimal n with count >= 5

def count_k(n):
    # k > 0, integer, satisfy -k^2 -2k + n >=0 => k^2 + 2k <= n
    # For each k, check if k^2+2k <= n
    count = 0
    k = 1
    while k*k + 2*k <= n:
        count += 1
        k += 1
    return count

T = 5
print(f"T = {T}")
threshold = 30
candidates = []
for n in range(1, threshold+1):
    c = count_k(n)
    print(f"n={n}, count={c}")
    if c >= T:
        candidates.append(n)

if candidates:
    min_n = min(candidates)
    print(f"Minimal n with count >= {T}: {min_n}")
else:
    print(f"No n <= {threshold} has count >= {T}")
```
