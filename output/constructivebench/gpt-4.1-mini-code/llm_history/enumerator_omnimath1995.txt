The problem seems to involve counting the number of possible functions \( f: \{0,\ldots,9\} \to \{\text{Bool}\} \) with a certain structure using two coins \( c_1, c_2 \), which are elements of the finite set of 10 elements.

We interpret:
- `coins` as the set of indices 0 to 9.
- `initial` is the function constantly true.
- `possible_configs` is the set of functions obtained by updating `initial` at \( c_1 \) to false, then updating at \( c_2 \) to the negation of the value at \( c_2 \) after the first update.

Our goal: count the number of distinct functions generated this way by all pairs \( (c_1, c_2) \in \{0,\ldots,9\}^2 \).

This will help conjecture the answer `omnimath1995_answer`.

Approach:
- Enumerate all pairs \( c_1, c_2 \)
- For each pair, construct the function from 0 to 9.
- Store the function as a tuple of Bools.
- Use a set to keep unique functions.
- Print each new function as it's found (in tuple form, True/False).
- Finally print the count.

We keep tuples with True/False, since exact bool values are better than approximations.

```python
# enumerator.py
def main():
    n = 10
    initial = (True,) * n
    seen = set()
    for c1 in range(n):
        for c2 in range(n):
            # After first update: initial[c1] = False
            f_list = list(initial)
            f_list[c1] = False
            # After second update: f[c2] = not previous value at c2
            f_list[c2] = not f_list[c2]
            f_tuple = tuple(f_list)
            if f_tuple not in seen:
                seen.add(f_tuple)
                print(f_tuple)
    print(f"Total distinct functions: {len(seen)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
