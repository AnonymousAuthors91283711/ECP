Ground Truth Answer: 5/4
Proposed Answer: 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum value of a complex expression involving roots of a quartic polynomial, where all roots are constrained between 1/2 and 2.

2. The ground truth answer is 5/4 (1.25), which suggests this is the proven maximum value of the given expression under the constraints.

3. The proposed answer is 2, which is the upper bound of the root values but doesn't match the actual maximum of the given expression.

4. The expression being maximized is quite complex, and it's unlikely that its maximum would coincidentally equal the upper bound of the root constraints.

5. The proposed answer seems to be just taking the upper bound of the roots rather than properly analyzing the expression's behavior.

Conclusion: The answers are not equivalent. The proposed answer is incorrect.
