The problem is from IMO 2013 SL N1, involving functions \( f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \) with a divisibility property:

\[
\forall m,n \in \mathbb{N},\quad m^2 + f(n) \mid m \cdot f(m) + n.
\]

The goal of the enumerator is to test small functions \( f \) (likely polynomials or specific functions on small domains, or trying simple patterns) for small values of \( m, n \) to seek patterns or candidates for \( f \).

Since \( f \) is unknown, we'll try some candidate functions and verify the property for small \( m, n \). We will:

- Enumerate candidates from small ranges (like linear or constant functions).
- For each candidate \( f \), test the divisibility property for all \( m, n \) up to small bound (e.g. 5).
- Print candidates that hold true for tested values, as a hint.

This approach will not prove the theorem but helps conjecture the answer function.

```python
# Enumerate possible candidates for f: N -> N satisfying
# ∀ m,n, m^2 + f(n) divides m*f(m)+n
#
# We try simple functions f(n) = a*n + b, with a,b small integers >=0,
# and test for small m,n up to 5.

def divides(a, b):
    return b % a == 0

def test_candidate(a, b, max_val=5):
    # f(n) = a*n + b
    for m in range(1, max_val+1):
        fm = a*m + b
        for n in range(1, max_val+1):
            fn = a*n + b
            left = m*m + fn
            right = m*fm + n
            if left == 0 or right % left != 0:
                return False
    return True

print("Testing linear candidates f(n) = a*n + b with 0 ≤ a,b ≤ 3")

for a in range(4):
    for b in range(4):
        if test_candidate(a, b):
            print(f"Candidate f(n) = {a}*n + {b} passes tests for n,m ∈ [1..5]")

# Also try constant functions f(n) = c
print("Testing constant candidates f(n) = c with 1 ≤ c ≤ 5")
for c in range(1,6):
    def f_const(n): return c
    ok = True
    for m in range(1,6):
        fm = c
        for n in range(1,6):
            fn = c
            left = m*m + fn
            right = m*fm + n
            if left == 0 or right % left != 0:
                ok = False
                break
        if not ok:
            break
    if ok:
        print(f"Constant function f(n)={c} passes tests for n,m ∈ [1..5]")

# Try quadratic f(n) = n^2
print("Testing f(n) = n^2")
ok = True
for m in range(1,6):
    fm = m*m
    for n in range(1,6):
        fn = n*n
        left = m*m + fn
        right = m*fm + n
        if left == 0 or right % left != 0:
            ok = False
            break
    if not ok:
        break
if ok:
    print("Function f(n)=n^2 passes tests for n,m ∈ [1..5]")

# Try f(n)=n
print("Testing f(n)=n")
ok = True
for m in range(1,6):
    fm = m
    for n in range(1,6):
        fn = n
        left = m*m + fn
        right = m*fm + n
        if left == 0 or right % left != 0:
            ok = False
            break
    if not ok:
        break
if ok:
    print("Function f(n)=n passes tests for n,m ∈ [1..5]")
```
This code quickly tests some simple candidates and outputs those that satisfy the divisibility on small values, aiding the conjecture of the formula \( f \). Further algebraic reasoning is required for a full proof.
