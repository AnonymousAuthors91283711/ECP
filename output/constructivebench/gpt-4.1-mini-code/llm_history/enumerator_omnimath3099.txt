The problem involves computing a probability related to some faces on a die with faces [2,3,4,5,6,7], focusing on odd faces and a given formula. We'll print intermediate computed values to inspect the components and the final probability.

```python
# Enumerate values and compute the given probability for the die faces
faces = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
total_dots = sum(faces)

odd_faces = [3, 5, 7]

# For each odd face n, compute (n - 1) / total_dots
vals_1 = [(n - 1) / total_dots for n in odd_faces]
for n, v in zip(odd_faces, vals_1):
    print(f"(n-1)/total_dots for n={n}: {v}")

# For each odd face n, compute 1/(6 * total_dots)
vals_2 = [1 / (6 * total_dots) for n in odd_faces]
for n, v in zip(odd_faces, vals_2):
    print(f"1/(6*total_dots) for n={n}: {v}")

sum_1 = sum(vals_1)
print(f"Sum of (n-1)/total_dots for odd faces: {sum_1}")

sum_2 = sum(vals_2)
print(f"Sum of 1/(6*total_dots) for odd faces: {sum_2}")

prob = sum_1 + sum_2
print(f"Computed probability: {prob}")
```
