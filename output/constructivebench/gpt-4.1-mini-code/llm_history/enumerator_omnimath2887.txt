The problem involves solving for a natural number T > 20 satisfying the equation 13 + (T - 20)/4 = T. We want to enumerate possible T values greater than 20 and check this condition exactly (without floating-point approximations).

```python
# Enumerate natural numbers T > 20 to solve 13 + (T - 20)/4 = T
# Print each candidate T and check equality exactly
# Since (T - 20)/4 must be an integer, focus on dividing T-20 by 4 cleanly

def main():
    print("Enumerating T > 20 satisfying 13 + (T-20)/4 = T")
    for T in range(21, 100):  # sample range, enough to see where condition holds
        diff = T - 20
        if diff % 4 == 0:
            val = 13 + diff // 4
            if val == T:
                print(f"T = {T} satisfies 13 + (T-20)/4 = T")
    print("Checked all T in range 21 to 99.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
