[write_program]
The problem asks for \(1 / (1/2 + 2/3)\). I'll write a Python program to compute and print the value exactly as a fraction and as a decimal approximation.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Compute exact value of 1 / (1/2 + 2/3)
x = Fraction(1, 2) + Fraction(2, 3)
answer = Fraction(1, 1) / x

print("Exact value as fraction:", answer)
print("Decimal approximation:", float(answer))
```
