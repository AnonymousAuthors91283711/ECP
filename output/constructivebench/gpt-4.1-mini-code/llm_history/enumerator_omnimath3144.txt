The problem explores the limit as \( x \to 1^- \) of the infinite product
\[
\prod_{n=0}^\infty \left(\frac{1 + x^{n+1}}{1 + x^n}\right)^{x^n}.
\]
We want to approximate and conjecture the value of this limit by numerical exploration with \(x\) close to 1 from below.

We will:
- Enumerate partial products for finite \(N\).
- Test for several \(x\) values approaching 1 from below (e.g., 0.9, 0.99, 0.999).
- Print intermediate partial product values to see convergence behavior.

This enumeration may suggest the limit value \(\text{omnimath3144_answer}\).

```python
import math

def partial_product(x, N):
    # Compute product for n=0 to N-1 of ((1 + x^{n+1})/(1 + x^n))^{x^n}
    prod = 1.0
    for n in range(N):
        numerator = 1 + x**(n+1)
        denominator = 1 + x**n
        base = numerator / denominator
        power = x**n
        prod *= base**power
    return prod

def main():
    xs = [0.9, 0.99, 0.999]
    max_N = 30  # number of terms in partial product
    for x in xs:
        print(f"x = {x}")
        for N in range(1, max_N + 1):
            p = partial_product(x, N)
            print(f"N={N}: partial product = {p:.15f}")
        print()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
