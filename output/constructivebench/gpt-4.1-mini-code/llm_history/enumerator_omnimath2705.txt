[write_program]
The given problem defines a function omnimath2705_answer and claims a theorem about its explicit form. The code seems to hint at a function of a real variable that is equivalent to 3*(x-2)+5. However, the function's definition is absent (marked as sorry) and the proof of the theorem is also missing.

To assist in conjecturing or verifying the explicit form, I will write a Python program that tests the formula and enumerates values of x and corresponding values of both sides to see if they match. Since the problem is symbolic, I will check for several real values x and verify the two expressions.

```python
# Enumerate real numbers x in a range and print omnimath2705_answer(x) = 3*(x-2)+5
# Since the function is unknown, we print the right side for x to guess the function form

def omnimath2705_answer(x):
    # Unknown function, but let's output None for now
    return None

def right_side(x):
    return 3*(x - 2) + 5

print("x\tomnimath2705_answer(x)\t3*(x-2)+5")
for x in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:
    ans = omnimath2705_answer(x)
    rhs = right_side(x)
    print(f"{x}\t{ans}\t{rhs}")

print("\nSince omnimath2705_answer is unknown, the RHS is given by 3*(x-2)+5, which looks like a linear function.")
```

However, per instructions, we must prioritize exact values, print immediately found answers, and the output cannot exceed 400 tokens. The above code is simple, adheres to instructions, and helps enumerate candidate values.

But since omnimath2705_answer is unknown, we cannot compute or verify it except for the RHS.

Alternatively, considering that the theorem states omnimath2705_answer x = 3*(x - 2) + 5, the function might just equal this expression. To assist the conjecture, we enumerate test points x and print this value.

```python
# Enumerate x in an integer range and print candidate values of the function 3*(x - 2)+5

for x in range(-5, 6):
    val = 3 * (x - 2) + 5
    print(f"x={x}: {val}")
```

Combining both and focusing on verifying the formula:

```python
# Enumerate x values and output the supposed function formula results

def candidate_function(x):
    return 3 * (x - 2) + 5

print("Enumerating candidate function values:")
for x in range(-5, 6):
    print(f"x={x}, candidate_function(x)={candidate_function(x)}")
```

This suffices for conjecturing the true answer.

Final code:

```python
# Enumerate real x and print candidate function values to assist conjecturing the formula.

def candidate_function(x):
    return 3 * (x - 2) + 5

for x in range(-5, 6):
    print(f"x={x}, candidate_function(x)={candidate_function(x)}")
```
