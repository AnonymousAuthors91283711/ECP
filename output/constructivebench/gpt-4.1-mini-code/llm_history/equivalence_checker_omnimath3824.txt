Ground Truth Answer: fun a d n => (-1)^n * 2^(n-1) * d^n * (2 * a + n * d)
Proposed Answer: fun a d n => (a - d) * (a + d)^n * (-1)^n
Let's analyze the two answers:

1. Ground Truth: (-1)^n * 2^(n-1) * d^n * (2 * a + n * d)
2. Proposed: (a - d) * (a + d)^n * (-1)^n

These are clearly different expressions. Let's test with concrete values to see if they match:

For n=1:
- Ground Truth: (-1)^1 * 2^0 * d^1 * (2a + d) = -d(2a + d)
- Proposed: (a - d)(a + d)(-1) = -(a² - d²)

These are not equal (unless d=0, which isn't guaranteed).

For n=2:
- Ground Truth: (-1)^2 * 2^1 * d^2 * (2a + 2d) = 2d²(2a + 2d) = 4ad² + 4d³
- Proposed: (a - d)(a + d)²(1) = (a - d)(a² + 2ad + d²) = a³ + 2a²d + ad² - a²d - 2ad² - d³ = a³ + a²d - ad² - d³

Again, completely different expressions.
