[write_program]
The problem involves finding the optimal constant \(\alpha\) satisfying a certain inequality over all strictly monotone sequences \(y\) with \(y_0 = 0\) and positive terms. I will write a Python program to numerically explore candidates for \(\alpha\) by considering small values of \(n\) and simple monotone sequences \(y\). This can help conjecture the true value of \(\alpha\).

```python
import math

def lhs(alpha, n, y):
    # Compute: sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (k+1)^{3/2} / sqrt(y((k+1)^2) - y(k^2))
    total = 0.0
    for k in range(n):
        diff = y((k+1)**2) - y(k**2)
        if diff <= 0:
            return None
        total += (k+1)**1.5 / math.sqrt(diff)
    return alpha * total

def rhs(n, y):
    # Compute: sum_{k=0}^{n-1} ((k+1)^2 + 3(k+1) +3) / y(k+1)
    total = 0.0
    for k in range(n):
        denom = y(k+1)
        if denom <= 0:
            return None
        numerator = (k+1)**2 + 3*(k+1) + 3
        total += numerator/denom
    return total

# Test with simple sequences y(x) = c*x for c > 0, which is strictly monotone and y(0)=0
# y(k) = c*k, so y(k^2) = c*k^2
# Let's test small n and vary alpha to find boundary values

print("Testing linear y(k)=k and n=1..5 to estimate alpha")

for n in range(1,6):
    # For y(k)=k, lookup sums
    def y(x): return float(x)
    # Compute sums:
    lhs_val = lambda alpha: lhs(alpha, n, y)
    rhs_val = rhs(n, y)
    if rhs_val is None:
        continue
    # Solve alpha * sum(...) >= sum(...)
    # so alpha >= sum(...) / sum(...)
    denom = 0.0
    numer = 0.0
    s1 = 0.0
    s2 = 0.0
    for k in range(n):
        diff = y((k+1)**2) - y(k**2)  # (k+1)^2 - k^2
        if diff == 0:
            break
        s1 += (k+1)**1.5 / math.sqrt(diff)
        s2 += ((k+1)**2 + 3*(k+1) +3) / y(k+1)
    if s1 > 0:
        alpha_candidate = s2 / s1
        print(f"n={n}, linear y(k)=k, candidate alpha = {alpha_candidate}")

# Try quadratic sequences y(k)=k^2 (then y(k^2) = (k^2)^2 = k^4)
print("\nTesting quadratic y(k)=k^2 for n=1..5:")

for n in range(1,6):
    def y(x): return float(x**2)
    s1 = 0.0
    s2 = 0.0
    valid = True
    for k in range(n):
        diff = y((k+1)**2) - y(k**2)
        if diff <= 0:
            valid = False
            break
        s1 += (k+1)**1.5 / math.sqrt(diff)
        denom = y(k+1)
        if denom <= 0:
            valid = False
            break
        s2 += ((k+1)**2 + 3*(k+1) +3) / denom
    if valid and s1 > 0:
        alpha_candidate = s2 / s1
        print(f"n={n}, quadratic y(k)=k^2, candidate alpha = {alpha_candidate}")
```

This program tests two families of monotone sequences \(y\), linear and quadratic, computes sums for small \(n\), then prints candidate values of \(\alpha\). This aids conjecturing the infimum \(\alpha\) satisfying the inequality.
