The problem involves a function \( f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) positive on positives and satisfying a complicated functional equation involving triple products and square roots, plus strict monotonicity. We want to explore candidates \( f \) possibly parameterized by some \( k > 0 \), so we try sample values of \( x,y,z \) and check which forms of \( f \) satisfy the identity. A natural approach is to test candidates of form \( f(x) = x^a \) or \( f(x) = k \cdot x^a \) for some \( a,k >0 \), and enumerate samples to see what fits best.

We will:
- Enumerate \( k \) and \( a \) over a small range (rational fractions for test)
- Check if the functional equation holds approximately on chosen sample triples \((x,y,z)\)
- Print exact formulas found that satisfy the equation up to small numerical deviations

```python
import math

# Enumerate candidates f(x) = k * x^a with k,a in small ranges
def f(x,k,a):
    return k * (x**a)

# Check the functional equation on given triples:
# f(xyz) + f(x) + f(y) + f(z) ?= f(sqrt(xy)) * f(sqrt(yz)) * f(sqrt(zx))
def check_eq(k,a, samples, tol=1e-9):
    for x,y,z in samples:
        lhs = f(x*y*z,k,a) + f(x,k,a) + f(y,k,a) + f(z,k,a)
        rhs = (f(math.sqrt(x*y),k,a) * f(math.sqrt(y*z),k,a) * f(math.sqrt(z*x),k,a))
        if abs(lhs - rhs) > tol:
            return False
    return True

# Generate test triples with positive real numbers > 0,
# simple integers and fractions for coverage
samples = [
    (1,1,1),
    (1,2,3),
    (2,2,2),
    (1.5,2.5,3.5),
    (0.5,1.5,2.5),
]

print("Enumerating candidates f(x) = k * x^a with k,a in {0.5,1,1.5,2}")

for k_mul in [0.5,1,1.5,2]:
    for a_pow in [0.5,1,1.5,2]:
        if check_eq(k_mul,a_pow,samples):
            # Print exact formula candidate if it fits all samples well
            # Use rational fraction if a_pow matches common roots
            print(f"Candidate found: f(x) = {k_mul} * x^{a_pow}")
            # Since no approximations are output, this is the exact form

# Trying k=1, since hpos and monotonicity suggests k>0 and positive exponent a works best
# Test a=1 (identity), a=0.5 (sqrt), a=2 (square)
print("Checking simple powers with k=1:")
for a_pow in [0.5,1,2]:
    if check_eq(1,a_pow,samples):
        print(f"Candidate found: f(x) = x^{a_pow}")

# Report extremal candidate (smallest positive a) found
found_as = [0.5,1,1.5,2]
valid_as = []
for a_pow in found_as:
    if check_eq(1,a_pow,samples):
        valid_as.append(a_pow)
if valid_as:
    min_a = min(valid_as)
    print(f"Minimal exponent a for valid f(x) = x^a with k=1: {min_a}")
