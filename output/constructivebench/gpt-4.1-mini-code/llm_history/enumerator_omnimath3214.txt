The problem involves finding the minimum \( t \) such that there exist triples of walk distances and ride distances with certain constraints. We want to explore discrete approximations for walk and ride distances indexed by \(\text{Fin }3 = \{0,1,2\}\), such that:
- Each walk distance \( \leq 6t \),
- Each ride distance \( \leq 90t \),
- Walk + Ride for each \(i\) = 135,
- Sum of ride distances over any 2 distinct indices \(\leq 90t\).

We will enumerate candidate values of \( t \) over a range to find minimal \( t \) for which the constraints are satisfiable with simple rational walk and ride distances that sum to 135.

```python
# Enumerate candidate t values and check existence of triples (walk, ride).
# For each t, try simple multiples of t for walk distances from 0 to 6t,
# compute ride distances as 135 - walk[i], and check constraints.
# When constraints hold, print t and the corresponding triplets.

def feasible_for_t(t):
    max_walk = 6 * t
    max_ride = 90 * t
    candidates = []
    step = max_walk / 3  # granularity for walk distances
    from itertools import product, combinations
    walks_range = [step * i for i in range(4)]  # 0, step, 2*step, 3*step <= max_walk
    
    for w0, w1, w2 in product(walks_range, repeat=3):
        # Check walks ≤ max_walk
        if any(w > max_walk for w in (w0,w1,w2)):
            continue
        r0, r1, r2 = 135 - w0, 135 - w1, 135 - w2
        # Check ride distances ≤ max_ride
        if any(r > max_ride or r < 0 for r in (r0,r1,r2)):
            continue
        # Check sum of ride distances over any 2 indices ≤ max_ride
        pairs = [(r0,r1),(r1,r2),(r0,r2)]
        if any(sum(pair) > max_ride for pair in pairs):
            continue
        candidates.append(((w0, w1, w2), (r0, r1, r2)))
    return candidates

# Enumerate t from 0.1 to 3 by 0.1 increments
found_ts = []
for i in range(1, 31):
    t = i / 10
    solutions = feasible_for_t(t)
    if solutions:
        print(f"t = {t:.2f} feasible solutions:")
        for w, r in solutions:
            print(f"  walk={w}, ride={r}")
        found_ts.append(t)
        # Stop early after printing first few feasible t's
        if len(found_ts) >= 3:
            break

if found_ts:
    print(f"Minimal feasible t among enumerated: {min(found_ts):.2f}")
else:
    print("No feasible t found in range.")
