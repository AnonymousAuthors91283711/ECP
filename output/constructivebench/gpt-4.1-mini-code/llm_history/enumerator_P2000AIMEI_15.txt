The problem involves a permutation of the integers 1 to 2000 and a special "process" function that manipulates the list in a particular way. The goal is to determine the value of `P2000AIMEI_15_answer` that relates the position of 1999 in the original list to the length 2000.

To assist in conjecturing, we consider smaller examples (e.g., 4 or 6 elements) and simulate the process. We enumerate the position of 1999 (or the equivalent max element in smaller cases) and print the intermediate results. We specifically track the index of the second largest element in the list after such a transformation to find a pattern.

```python
def process(s, t):
    if not s:
        return t
    if len(s) == 1:
        return t + s
    x, y, *rest = s
    return process(rest + [y], t + [x])

def test_n(n):
    # Original list is the range [1..n]
    original = list(range(1, n+1))
    proc = process(original, [])
    # Find index of the element n-1 (like 1999 in 2000)
    if n-1 in original:
        pos = original.index(n-1) + 1  # 1-based index
    else:
        pos = None
    print(f"n={n}, process(original)={proc}, pos of {n-1} in original={pos}")
    return pos

# Run for small test cases to observe pattern
for N in [4,6,8,10,12]:
    test_n(N)
```
