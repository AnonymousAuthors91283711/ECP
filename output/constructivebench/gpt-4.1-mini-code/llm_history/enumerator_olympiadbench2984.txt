The problem involves evaluating an expression with sine values at specific angles (in degrees). To explore the value, I'll enumerate approximate numerical values along with symbolic sine values for selected small multiples of 6 degrees. This might give insight and possibly identify exact values or known trigonometric identities.

```python
import math

# Convert degrees to radians
deg_to_rad = lambda d: d * math.pi / 180

# angles used in the expression
angles = [6, 12, 24, 42]

# Compute sin for these angles
sin_values = {a: math.sin(deg_to_rad(a)) for a in angles}

print("Sine values:")
for a in angles:
    print(f"sin({a}°) = {sin_values[a]}")

# Calculate first part: sin(6)*sin(12)*sin(24)*sin(42)
part1 = sin_values[6] * sin_values[12] * sin_values[24] * sin_values[42]
print(f"sin(6)*sin(12)*sin(24)*sin(42) = {part1}")

# Calculate second part: sin(12)*sin(24)*sin(42)
part2 = sin_values[12] * sin_values[24] * sin_values[42]
print(f"sin(12)*sin(24)*sin(42) = {part2}")

# Sum
total = part1 + part2
print(f"sum = {total}")

# To conjecture a closed form, multiply total by 8 (common trick for such angles)
scaled = total * 8
print(f"8 * sum = {scaled}")

# Also print fraction multiples of π for these angles
print("Exact angle fractions of π:")
for a in angles:
    print(f"{a} degrees = {a}/180 * π = {a/180} * π")

# For small angle samples, test if sin(6)*sin(12)*sin(24)*sin(42) + sin(12)*sin(24)*sin(42) matches a simple fraction
# Additionally, try to evaluate if total is close to 1/16 (a guess)
guess_fraction = 1/16
print(f"Difference with 1/16: {total - guess_fraction}")
```
