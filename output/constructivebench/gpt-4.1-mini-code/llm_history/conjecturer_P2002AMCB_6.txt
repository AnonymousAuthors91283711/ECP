. Enumerated Answers: a = -0.5, b = -0.5 satisfy P(b)=0; P(a) implied b=-2a^2
a = 1.0, b = -2.0 satisfy P(b)=0; P(a) implied b=-2a^2. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ × ℝ)
The errors come from incorrectly using `{ (a, b) | ... }` where `a` and `b` are already bound variables of the pair, but Lean expects a predicate on a single `(a, b) : ℝ × ℝ` input, so the condition should be expressed in terms of the pair itself.

Also, the numeral literals must be clarified as reals, and exponentiation and multiplication should be with numerals coerced into reals. The standard way to write a set in Lean of pairs satisfying a predicate is:

{ p : ℝ × ℝ | <predicate on p.1 and p.2> }

So the corrected answer sets will use projection `p.1` for `a`, and `p.2` for `b`.

Re-expressed it becomes:

P2002AMCB_6_answer := { p : ℝ × ℝ | p.1 ≠ 0 ∧ p.2 = -2 * (p.1)^2 }

This matches the given enumerated answer and respects the Lean syntax and types.
