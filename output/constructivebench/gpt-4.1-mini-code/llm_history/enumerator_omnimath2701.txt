[write_program]
The problem states that \(2^a \cdot 2^b = 64\), and we want to explore the value of \(\frac{a+b}{2}\).

Since \(2^a \cdot 2^b = 2^{a+b} = 64 = 2^6\), it follows that \(a + b = 6\). Therefore, \(\frac{a+b}{2} = 3\).

To enumerate and verify this, I'll write a Python program that tries various pairs \((a,b)\) such that \(2^a \cdot 2^b = 64\) (within some floating tolerance), and print the corresponding \(\frac{a+b}{2}\) values. This will help conjecture the answer.

```python
import math

target = 64
exponent_sum = 6  # because 2^6 = 64

# Enumerate pairs (a, b) with a,b from -5 to 11 in steps of 0.5
for a in [x * 0.5 for x in range(-10, 23)]:
    # Compute b from the equation 2^a * 2^b = 64 => a + b = 6 => b = 6 - a
    b = exponent_sum - a
    # Check the product to avoid floating error
    product = 2**a * 2**b
    if abs(product - target) < 1e-12:
        avg = (a + b) / 2
        print(f"a={a:.2f}, b={b:.2f}, (a+b)/2={avg:.2f}")

# After enumeration, print the unique average
print(f"Unique average (a+b)/2 = {exponent_sum/2:.2f}")
```
