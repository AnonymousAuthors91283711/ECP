[write_program]
The problem seeks the smallest size \( k \) of a subset \( A \) of integers such that every residue modulo 100 is represented as \( a^n \bmod 100 \) for some \( a \in A \) and \( n > 0 \). To explore this, the program enumerates subsets of \( \mathbb{Z}/100\mathbb{Z} \) of increasing sizes and checks whether their powers cover all residues mod 100. The program outputs subsets that achieve this coverage and finally prints the minimal such size.

```python
from itertools import combinations, product

MOD = 100
RESIDUES = list(range(MOD))

def powers(a):
    # Return set of all powers a^n mod 100, for nâ‰¥1, until cycle is detected
    seen = set()
    x = a % MOD
    while x not in seen:
        seen.add(x)
        x = (x * a) % MOD
    return seen

def covers_all(A):
    # Check if union of powers(a) for a in A covers all residues mod 100
    covered = set()
    for a in A:
        covered |= powers(a)
        if len(covered) == MOD:
            return True
    return False

# We only consider 1..99 as representatives for residues mod 100 (0 mod 100 is 0 always)
elements = list(range(1, MOD))
min_size = None

print("Enumerating subsets and their coverage for modulus 100:")

for k in range(1, 6):  # limit to size 5 for efficiency
    print(f"Trying subsets of size {k}...")
    for A in combinations(elements, k):
        if covers_all(A):
            print(f"Found covering subset of size {k}: {A}")
            if min_size is None or k < min_size:
                min_size = k
    if min_size is not None:
        print(f"Minimum k found at most {min_size}, stopping search.")
        break

if min_size is not None:
    print(f"Minimal size k for coverage mod {MOD} is {min_size}")
else:
    print("No covering subset found up to size 5.")
```
