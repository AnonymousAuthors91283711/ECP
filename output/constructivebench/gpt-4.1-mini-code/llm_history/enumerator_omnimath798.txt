The problem involves finding values of \( n \) such that there is a unique 8-element subset \( s \) of positive natural numbers with sum \( n \). We want to enumerate such \( n \) up to some reasonable range, and confirm the uniqueness condition efficiently.

A direct approach: For sums up to a threshold (e.g., \( n \leq 100 \)), iterate over all 8-element subsets of \(\{1,\dots,n\}\), count how many sum to \( n \), print the sums with exactly one solution.

Use combinations with early pruning to maximize efficiency and avoid combinatorial explosion.

```python
from itertools import combinations

def main():
    MAX_N = 100

    # Precompute all 8-element subsets from numbers 1..MAX_N.
    # Instead, for each n, generate all 8-combinations from 1..n (or a fixed max)
    # and count sums equaling n. To reduce time, fix the set to 1..MAX_N.

    candidates = []
    nums = list(range(1, MAX_N + 1))

    # For each possible sum n, track count of subsets summing to n
    count_sums = {}

    # Generate all 8-combinations, summing once, updating counts
    print("Enumerating 8-element subsets of [1..{}] and counting sums...".format(MAX_N))
    # To reduce memory/time, sum for each combo and update counts
    # We will store which sums have count=1 to print after.

    # To avoid large memory, count on the fly and track sums with exactly one set
    # We only print sums with exactly one set after processing all combos.
    from collections import defaultdict
    sum_counts = defaultdict(int)

    for comb in combinations(nums, 8):
        s = sum(comb)
        sum_counts[s] += 1

    # Now print sums with exactly one 8-element subset summing to them
    print("Sums n with unique 8-subset summing to n:")
    for s in sorted(sum_counts.keys()):
        if sum_counts[s] == 1:
            print(s)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
