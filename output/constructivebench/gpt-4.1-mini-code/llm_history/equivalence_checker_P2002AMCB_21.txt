Ground Truth Answer: 448
Proposed Answer: (2002 / 11) + (2002 / 13) + (2002 / 14) - (2002 / (11 * 13)) - (2002 / (11 * 14)) - (2002 / (13 * 14)) + 6 * (2002 / (11 * 13 * 14))
Let me analyze the problem and the proposed solution:

1. The problem defines a function `a(n)` that assigns different values based on divisibility by 11, 13, and 14. The sum is taken over numbers from 0 to 2001.

2. The proposed answer uses the inclusion-exclusion principle to count:
   - First adds counts divisible by each individual number (11,13,14)
   - Then subtracts counts divisible by pairs (11*13, 11*14, 13*14)
   - Finally adds back the count divisible by all three (11*13*14) multiplied by 6

3. The ground truth is 448. Let's calculate the proposed formula:
   - 2002/11 = 182
   - 2002/13 = 154
   - 2002/14 = 143
   - 2002/(11*13) = 14
   - 2002/(11*14) = 13
   - 2002/(13*14) = 11
   - 2002/(11*13*14) = 1
   - Total = 182 + 154 + 143 - 14 - 13 - 11 + 6*1 = 448

The proposed answer correctly implements the inclusion-exclusion principle and matches the ground truth value of 448.
