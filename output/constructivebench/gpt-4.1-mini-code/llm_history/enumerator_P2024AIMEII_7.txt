[write_program]
The problem looks for 4-digit numbers N (1000 ≤ N ≤ 9999) such that replacing any digit with 1 yields a number divisible by 7. The program enumerates these and for each found N prints N and also prints the sum of its thousands digit and the last three digits at the end, which appears to be the target variable P2024AIMEII_7_answer.

```python
def digits(n):
    return [(n // 10**i) % 10 for i in range(4)]

def replace_digit(n, i, new_digit):
    # Replace digit at position i (0=units, 3=thousands) with new_digit
    exp = 10**i
    old_digit = (n // exp) % 10
    return n - old_digit * exp + new_digit * exp

def check_condition(n):
    # For each digit position, replace that digit with 1 and check divisible by 7
    for i in range(4):
        modified = replace_digit(n, i, 1)
        if modified % 7 != 0:
            return False
    return True

def main():
    # Enumerate all 4-digit numbers satisfying the condition, print each
    candidates = []
    for N in range(1000, 10000):
        if check_condition(N):
            print(f"Candidate: {N}")
            candidates.append(N)
    if candidates:
        maxN = max(candidates)
        # Print sum of thousands digit and last three digits of maxN
        thousand = maxN // 1000
        last_three = maxN % 1000
        print(f"Maximum candidate: {maxN}")
        print(f"Sum of digits: {thousand} + {last_three} = {thousand + last_three}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
