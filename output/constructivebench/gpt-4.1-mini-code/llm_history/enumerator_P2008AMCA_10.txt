The problem involves an equation \((\frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{7})(t - 1) = 1\). We want to explore values of \(t\) that satisfy this equation. The expression simplifies to \(\frac{12}{35}(t - 1) = 1\), so \(t - 1 = \frac{35}{12}\), and thus \(t = 1 + \frac{35}{12} = \frac{47}{12}\). We'll enumerate \(t\) values around this solution and verify if the equation holds, printing exact rational solutions as fractions when possible.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# define the constant sum of fractions 1/5 + 1/7 = 12/35
coef = Fraction(1,5) + Fraction(1,7)  # 12/35

# since coef * (t - 1) = 1, solve t:
# (t - 1) = 1 / coef
# t = 1 + 1/coef = 1 + 35/12 = 47/12

exact_t = Fraction(1) + 1/coef

print(f"Exact solution to (1/5 + 1/7)*(t - 1) = 1:")
print(f"t = 1 + 1/({coef}) = {exact_t} â‰ˆ {float(exact_t)}")

# enumerate some t values near exact_t and check left side
print("\nEnumerating t in range [3,5] with step 1/12:")
step = Fraction(1,12)
start = 3
end = 5

t = Fraction(start)
while t <= end:
    lhs = coef*(t - 1)
    if lhs == 1:
        print(f"t = {t} satisfies: {coef}*({t} - 1) = {lhs} == 1")
    else:
        # print near hits within a small tolerance
        diff = abs(float(lhs) - 1)
        if diff < 0.01:
            print(f"t = {t}: LHS={lhs} approx 1 (diff={diff:.3f})")
    t += step
```
