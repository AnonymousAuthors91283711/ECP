The problem appears to be about finding the sum of the infinite series \(\sum_{i=0}^\infty \frac{a \cdot i}{a^i}\) for real \(a > 1\). Simplifying the series: \(\sum_{i=0}^\infty \frac{a i}{a^i} = a \sum_{i=0}^\infty \frac{i}{a^i}\).

This can be analyzed by enumerating partial sums for some \(a > 1\). The series actually starts from \(i=0\), with the term at \(i=0\) being zero because of the factor \(i\). 

The series \(\sum_{i=1}^\infty i x^i\) with \(|x|<1\) has closed form \(\frac{x}{(1-x)^2}\). Here \(x = \frac{1}{a}\), so \(\sum_{i=1}^\infty i / a^i = \frac{1/a}{(1 - 1/a)^2} = \frac{1/a}{\frac{(a-1)^2}{a^2}} = \frac{a}{(a-1)^2}\).

Therefore,
\[
\sum_{i=1}^\infty \frac{a i}{a^i} = a \cdot \frac{a}{(a-1)^2} = \frac{a^2}{(a-1)^2}
\]

The program below numerically sums the first N terms with some precision check and prints partial sums for \(a=2,3\) to provide insight.

```python
# Enumerate partial sums for the series sum_{i=1}^\infty (a*i)/a^i = sum_{i=1}^\infty i / a^{i-1}
# Which equals a^2 / (a-1)^2 based on known formula, to conjecture the sum.

def partial_sum(a, N):
    s = 0.0
    for i in range(1, N+1):
        term = (a * i) / (a**i)
        s += term
        print(f"a={a}, i={i}, term={term:.10f}, partial_sum={s:.10f}")

def run():
    for a in [2, 3]:
        print(f"Enumerating partial sums for a = {a}")
        partial_sum(a, 10)
        # print approximation of closed-form
        closed_form = a**2 / (a - 1)**2
        print(f"Conjectured sum for a={a}: {closed_form}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run()
```
