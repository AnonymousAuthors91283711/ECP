The problem asks for natural numbers \( n > 0 \) such that \( (n^2 + n + 15) \mod n = 0 \). Since \( n^2 \mod n = 0 \) and \( n \mod n = 0 \), the expression modulo \( n \) simplifies to \( 15 \mod n = 0 \). Thus, \( n \) must divide 15. The program will enumerate all divisors of 15 and print them as possible answers.

```python
# Enumerate n > 0 such that (n^2 + n + 15) % n == 0,
# which simplifies to n dividing 15.
def divisors(x):
    for i in range(1, x+1):
        if x % i == 0:
            yield i

print("n values dividing 15 that satisfy the condition:")
for n in divisors(15):
    expr_mod = (n**2 + n + 15) % n
    if expr_mod == 0:
        print(n)
print("All such n are divisors of 15; thus the answer set is {1,3,5,15}.")
```
