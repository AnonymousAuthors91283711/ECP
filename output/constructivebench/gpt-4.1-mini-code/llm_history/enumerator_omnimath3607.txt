This problem concerns finding the minimal number \( n \) of steps needed to transform any 100-length list of natural numbers into a list of pairwise coprime numbers, using a function \( f \) iterated up to \( n \) times, keeping the list length constant.

Since the problem is complex and theoretical, I will implement an enumerator that:
- Uses small list lengths (e.g., length = 3 or 4) as samples.
- Tries all possible lists with small entries (like 1 to 6) to verify how many steps it takes to reach a pairwise coprime list under some function \( f \).
- Given generality, we'll enumerate lists and test a simple operation for \( f \), e.g., replace each element by its gcd with others or factorize to separate factors.
- Our sample function \( f \) will attempt to "reduce" common divisors step by step.
- We print the required minimal number of steps observed for all tested lists.
- It's an enumerator and output streaming partial results.

Due to complexity, this code focuses on enumerating candidates and testing a heuristic function \( f \) on smaller list sizes and small values, to detect minimal steps or upper bounds for number of steps needed.

```python
# Enumerate sample lists of length 3 with elements in [1..6]
# For each list, try applying a heuristic step function f repeatedly,
# until the list is pairwise coprime or steps > max_steps
# Print list, steps needed.
# After processing all, print maximal steps needed as a candidate 'n'.

def pairwise_coprime(lst):
    for a, b in combinations(lst, 2):
        if gcd(a, b) != 1:
            return False
    return True

def step_function(lst):
    # Example heuristic function f:
    # Replace each element by gcd of itself and neighbors to reduce common factors.
    n = len(lst)
    new_lst = []
    for i in range(n):
        g = lst[i]
        if i > 0:
            g = gcd(g, lst[i-1])
        if i < n-1:
            g = gcd(g, lst[i+1])
        new_lst.append(g)
    return new_lst

def main():
    length = 3
    value_range = range(1, 7)  # elements from 1..6
    max_steps = 10
    max_steps_found = 0

    print(f"Sampling lists of length {length} over values 1..6")

    for lst in product(value_range, repeat=length):
        # Skip pairwise coprime already
        if pairwise_coprime(lst):
            print(f"List {lst} is already pairwise coprime (0 steps)")
            continue
        current = list(lst)
        for steps in range(1, max_steps + 1):
            current = step_function(current)
            if pairwise_coprime(current):
                print(f"List {lst} -> pairwise coprime in {steps} steps: {current}")
                if steps > max_steps_found:
                    max_steps_found = steps
                break
        else:
            print(f"List {lst} NOT pairwise coprime within {max_steps} steps, last: {current}")

    print(f"Max steps observed (candidate n): {max_steps_found}")
