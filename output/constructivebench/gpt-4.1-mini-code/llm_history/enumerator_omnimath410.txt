The problem involves characterizing the set of positive real numbers \( c \) for which there exists a function \( f: \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{N} \) with finite range, such that for all \( i \), points in the same fiber \( f^{-1}(i) \) have pairwise distance at least \( c^i \). Intuitively, this is a packing problem on the integer lattice with distance scaling exponentially in \( i \).

To assist conjecturing about which \( c \) satisfy the property, we enumerate possible finite ranges and test sample values of \( c \). Note: the distance on \( \mathbb{Z}^2 \) is presumably the Euclidean distance or \( \ell^2 \)-norm here.

We will:
- Vary \( c \) in \((0,3)\) with fine steps.
- Try small finite ranges (e.g., 1 to 3).
- For each candidate \( c \) and finite range, try to construct \( f \) on a small grid \( [-m,m]^2 \) (e.g., \( m=2 \)) with the spacing requirements.
- Enumerate all assignments \( f:\mathbb{Z}^2 \to \{0,\dots,k-1\} \) to the small grid and check the property.
- Print all \( c \)s for which candidates exist, to identify omnimath410_answer.

Because the search is combinatorial explosive, we keep parameters small.

This program attempts to find an assignment \( f \) with finite range \( k \) on a \(5\times 5\) grid satisfying the distance spacing condition for different \( c \) values, printing when successful to help conjecture the omnimath410_answer set.
