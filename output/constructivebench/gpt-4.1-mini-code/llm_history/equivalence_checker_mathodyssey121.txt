Ground Truth Answer: 112
Proposed Answer: 52
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n such that:
   - 7n ≡ 0 mod 52 (meaning 7n is divisible by 52)
   - n ≡ 0 mod 2 (meaning n is even)

2. Ground Truth Answer is 112:
   - 7*112 = 784
   - 784/52 = 15.0769... Wait no, actually 52*15 = 780, remainder 4 - this seems incorrect
   - Wait, actually 52*15 = 780, 784-780=4, so 784 mod 52 = 4 ≠ 0
   - This suggests 112 might not be correct

3. Proposed Answer is 52:
   - 7*52 = 364
   - 364/52 = 7 exactly, so 364 ≡ 0 mod 52
   - 52 is even, so satisfies n ≡ 0 mod 2
   - Checking if it's the smallest: the next candidate would be 26, but 7*26=182, 182/52≈3.5 not integer

Actually, both answers seem incorrect:
- For 52: 7*52=364 ≡ 0 mod 52, and 52 is even - this satisfies the conditions
- For 112: as shown above, doesn't satisfy 7n ≡ 0 mod 52
- The actual smallest solution should be 52, since:
  - We need 7n ≡ 0 mod 52 ⇒ n ≡ 0 mod 52/gcd(7,52) = 52/1 = 52
  - And n must be even, which 52 satisfies
  - No smaller even multiple of 52 exists
