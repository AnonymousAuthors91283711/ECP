The problem involves finding the smallest natural number \( n \) such that \( T \leq \binom{n}{2} \cdot \binom{n-2}{2} \). To conjecture the minimal \( n \) for given values of \( T \), the program will enumerate \( n \) from a small start and compute the value \( \binom{n}{2} \cdot \binom{n-2}{2} \) until it reaches or exceeds \( T \). For demonstration, we'll try some sample \( T \) values and print the minimal \( n \) for each.

```python
from math import comb

# Sample T values to test
T_values = [1, 10, 100, 1000]

for T in T_values:
    print(f"T = {T}")
    n = 4  # minimal n to have n-2 >= 2, so binomial coefficients are defined
    while True:
        val = comb(n, 2) * comb(n - 2, 2)
        print(f"  n={n}, C(n,2)*C(n-2,2) = {val}")
        if val >= T:
            print(f"  => minimal n for T={T} is {n}\n")
            break
        n += 1
```
