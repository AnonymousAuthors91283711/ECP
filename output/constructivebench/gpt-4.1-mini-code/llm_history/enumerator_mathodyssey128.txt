The problem asks us to count the permutations p of {1,...,6} such that for every i in {0,...,3}, the sum of the values at positions i, i+1, and i+2 is not divisible by 3.

We can enumerate all permutations of [1..6] (there are 720) and check the sum condition for indices 0..3.

```python
from itertools import permutations

def mod_sum_not_zero(p):
    # Check indices 0 to 3 inclusive
    for i in range(4):
        if (p[i] + p[i+1] + p[i+2]) % 3 == 0:
            return False
    return True

count = 0
print("Enumerating permutations of [1..6] with no triple sums divisible by 3:")
for p in permutations(range(1,7)):
    if mod_sum_not_zero(p):
        print(p)  # Print each valid permutation immediately
        count += 1

print("Total count of valid permutations:", count)
```
This code enumerates all permutations, prints each valid one immediately, and finally prints the count. This enumeration assists in conjecturing or verifying the math problem's answer.
