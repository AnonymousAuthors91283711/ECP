This problem involves summing a complex expression over 23rd roots of unity other than 1 (since the root is nonreal and satisfies \( z^{23}=1 \)). The summand is \( \frac{1}{1 + z^k + z^{2k}} \), for \( k=0,\dots,22 \).

To gain insight, we will enumerate the sum for sample 23rd roots of unity (excluding 1) and print the sum values. This may suggest a closed formula independent of the root chosen. The program will print each individual summand and the resulting sum for a chosen root \( z \).

We select several 23rd roots of unity \( z = e^{2\pi i m/23} \) with \( m \in \{1,2,3,4\} \), exclude the real root at \( m=0 \). For each \( z \), we compute and print the summands and sum with enough precision.

```python
import cmath

# Enumerate sum of 1/(1 + z^k + z^{2k}) for 23rd roots of unity z, Im(z) != 0.
def main():
    n = 23
    # Sample m values for roots of unity (excluding 0 which is 1)
    ms = [1, 2, 3, 4]

    for m in ms:
        # Compute z = e^(2πim/n)
        z = cmath.exp(2j * cmath.pi * m / n)
        print(f"Root z = exp(2πi*{m}/23): {z}")
        total = 0 + 0j
        for k in range(n):
            zk = pow(z, k)
            denom = 1 + zk + zk * zk
            val = 1 / denom
            print(f"k={k}: 1/(1 + z^{k} + z^{2*k}) = {val}")
            total += val
        print(f"Sum for m={m}: {total}\n")

    main()
```
