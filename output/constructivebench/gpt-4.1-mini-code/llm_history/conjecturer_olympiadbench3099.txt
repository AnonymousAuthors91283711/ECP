  := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Total lawns mowed in 2 hours: 10 lawns
Time (hours) - Lawns mowed:
0.00 hrs - 0 lawns (exact integer)
0.25 hrs - 5/4 lawns (fraction)
0.50 hrs - 5/2 lawns (fraction)
0.75 hrs - 15/4 lawns (fraction)
1.00 hrs - 5 lawns (exact integer)
1.25 hrs - 25/4 lawns (fraction)
1.50 hrs - 15/2 lawns (fraction)
1.75 hrs - 35/4 lawns (fraction)
2.00 hrs - 10 lawns (exact integer). Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<10>>>
