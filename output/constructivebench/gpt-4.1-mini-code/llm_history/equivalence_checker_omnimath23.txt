abbrev omnimath23_answer : Set (ℤ × ℤ → ℝ) := sorry
theorem omnimath23 (f : ℤ × ℤ → ℝ) :
  (∀ (x y : ℤ), f (x, y) ∈ Set.Icc 0 1 ∧ f (x, y) = (f (x - 1, y) + f (x, y - 1)) / 2) ↔ f ∈ omnimath23_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {f | ∃ (C : ℝ), C ∈ Set.Icc 0 1 ∧ ∀ (x y : ℤ), f (x, y) = C}
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ a b : ℝ, 0 ≤ a ∧ a ≤ 1 ∧ 0 ≤ b ∧ b ≤ 1 ∧ (∀ x y : ℤ, f (x, y) = a * 2 ^ (-x) * (1 - 2 ^ (-y)) + b * (1 - 2 ^ (-x)) * 2 ^ (-y))}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes functions f: ℤ×ℤ→ℝ that satisfy:
   - f(x,y) is always between 0 and 1
   - f satisfies a recurrence relation: f(x,y) = (f(x-1,y) + f(x,y-1))/2

2. The ground truth answer states that the only solutions are constant functions where f(x,y) = C for some C ∈ [0,1]

3. The proposed answer suggests a much more complex family of functions involving exponential terms in x and y.

Key observations:
- The recurrence relation is similar to a discrete version of Laplace's equation, whose solutions on ℤ×ℤ are harmonic functions
- The ground truth correctly identifies that the only bounded harmonic functions on ℤ×ℤ are constants
- The proposed solution includes non-constant functions, which would not satisfy the recurrence relation for all x,y
- The proposed solution's functions are not constant unless a = b, but even then they don't reduce to constants

Conclusion: The proposed answer is incorrect as it includes many non-constant functions that don't satisfy the given conditions, while the ground truth correctly identifies only the constant solutions.
