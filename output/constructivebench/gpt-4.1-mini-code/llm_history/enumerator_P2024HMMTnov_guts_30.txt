This problem counts 4-element subsets of pairs from a 4x4 grid with the property that any two distinct points differ by at least 2 in either coordinate. We interpret points as (r,c) with r,c in 0..3. We want all 4-sized sets S of points so that for any distinct p,q in S, |p_r - q_r| > 1 or |p_c - q_c| > 1.

We'll enumerate all 4-subsets of the 16 grid points meeting this condition and print found sets and count them. This will help conjecture the count and the structure.

```python
from itertools import combinations

points = [(r, c) for r in range(4) for c in range(4)]

def condition_ok(s):
    # For all pairs p,q distinct in s, check condition
    for i, p in enumerate(s):
        for q in s[i+1:]:
            if abs(p[0]-q[0]) <= 1 and abs(p[1]-q[1]) <= 1:
                return False
    return True

count = 0
for s in combinations(points, 4):
    if condition_ok(s):
        count += 1
        print(f"Set #{count}: {s}")

print(f"Total count of sets of size 4 meeting the property: {count}")
```
