This problem characterizes functions f: ℕ → ℕ satisfying a gcd-related functional equation for all positive integers x,y:

gcd(f(x), y) * f(xy) = f(x) * f(y).

We want to enumerate functions f: ℕ → ℕ that satisfy this for some small domain (e.g. up to n=5), printing candidates f as lists of values [f(1), f(2), ..., f(n)].

Approach:
- We'll try all f with values in {1,...,M} for small M (e.g. M=5) for n=3,4 to keep complexity down.
- Check the equation for all x,y in [1..n].
- Print all satisfying candidates found.

This will help conjecture the nature of f and verify if it has multiplicativity or related conditions.

```python
# Enumerate candidate functions f: [1..n] -> [1..M] satisfying:
# gcd(f(x), y) * f(x*y) == f(x) * f(y), for all x,y>0 with x,y ≤ n and x*y ≤ n
# Print all found functions immediately.

from math import gcd

def check_function(f, n):
    # f maps 1..n, list f indexed 0..n-1
    for x in range(1, n+1):
        for y in range(1, n+1):
            if x*y > n:
                continue
            lhs = gcd(f[x-1], y) * f[x*y-1]
            rhs = f[x-1] * f[y-1]
            if lhs != rhs:
                return False
    return True

def main():
    n = 4  # max domain size
    M = 5  # max value for f(x)
    print(f"Enumerating functions f: [1..{n}] -> [1..{M}] satisfying gcd(f(x), y)*f(xy) = f(x)*f(y)")
    from itertools import product
    count = 0
    for f in product(range(1, M+1), repeat=n):
        if check_function(f, n):
            print("Candidate f:", f)
            count += 1
    print("Total candidates found:", count)
