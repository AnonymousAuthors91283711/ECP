The problem involves functions \( f \) and \( g \) with \( g(x) = 2x -4 \), \( g \) bijective, and a condition on \( f \) given by

\[
g(f(g^{-1}(x))) = 2x^2 + 16x + 26.
\]

We want to find \( f(\pi) \).

Since \( g \) is bijective and given, its inverse is 

\[
g^{-1}(x) = \frac{x+4}{2}.
\]

Then

\[
g(f(g^{-1}(x))) = 2x^{2} + 16x + 26.
\]

Set \( y = g^{-1}(x) \), then

\[
g(f(y)) = 2(g(y))^{2} + 16 g(y) + 26,
\]

but this is already in terms of \( x \), so it’s easier to rewrite:

Given for all \( x \),

\[
g(f(g^{-1}(x))) = 2x^2 + 16x + 26,
\]

or equivalently for all \( t \),

\[
g(f(t)) = 2 (g(t))^2 + 16 g(t) + 26.
\]

Since \( g(t) = 2t -4 \), then:

\[
g(f(t)) = 2 (2t-4)^2 + 16 (2t -4) + 26.
\]

Since \( g(x) = 2x -4 \), this means

\[
g(f(t)) = 2 (2t -4)^2 + 16 (2t -4) + 26.
\]

Thus,

\[
2 f(t) -4 = 2 (2t-4)^2 + 16 (2t-4) + 26,
\]

so

\[
2 f(t) = 2 (2t -4)^2 + 16 (2t -4) + 30,
\]

and

\[
f(t) = \frac{1}{2} \left(2 (2t -4)^2 + 16 (2t -4) + 30 \right).
\]

This formula can be evaluated for any \( t \).

Now we want \( f(\pi) \).

We will write a Python program to enumerate values \( f(t) \) for test values near \( \pi \), but primarily just compute \( f(\pi) \).

The program will:

- Define \( f(t) \) as given
- Print \( f(t) \) for a few test \( t \) values, including \( \pi \).
- Print the exact rational expression for \( f(t) \) if possible.

This helps to conjecture the exact value.

```python
from math import pi

# Define g(x) = 2x -4
def g(x): return 2*x -4
def g_inv(x): return (x + 4)/2

# Given relation: g(f(t)) = 2 * (g(t))^2 + 16 * g(t) + 26
# So f(t) = (2*(g(t))^2 + 16*g(t) + 30)/2

def f(t):
    gt = g(t)
    return (2 * gt**2 + 16 * gt + 30)/2

# Print values for some t, including pi
test_values = [0, 1, 2, 3, pi]
for t in test_values:
    val = f(t)
    print(f"f({t}) = {val}")

```

This prints f(π) and other values immediately to help conjecture the exact formula.
