The problem involves evaluating an expression with binomial coefficients. Let's enumerate the values of "Nat.choose 13 2", compute the product, then take the reciprocal as a rational number (1 / product). We'll print the intermediate values and the final rational answer.

```python
# Enumerate the answer related to 1 / (C(13,2) * C(13,2)) and print step-by-step

from math import comb
from fractions import Fraction

def main():
    n, k = 13, 2
    c = comb(n, k)
    print(f"Combination C({n},{k}) = {c}")
    
    product = c * c
    print(f"Product C({n},{k}) * C({n},{k}) = {product}")
    
    reciprocal = Fraction(1, product)
    print(f"Reciprocal as a fraction: 1/{product} = {reciprocal}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
