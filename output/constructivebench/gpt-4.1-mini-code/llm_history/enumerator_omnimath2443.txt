The problem involves finding all rational numbers \( a \) for which there exists a \(4 \times 4\) matrix \( B \) over \(\mathbb{Q}\) such that \( B^2 = M(a) \), where

\[
M(a) = \begin{bmatrix}
a & -a & -1 & 0 \\
a & -a & 0 & -1 \\
1 & 0 & a & -a \\
0 & 1 & a & -a
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Our approach will be to try candidate values of \(a\) in a small range of rationals (e.g., integers and simple fractions), construct the matrix \(M(a)\), and check if it admits a square root matrix \(B\) over \(\mathbb{Q}\).

Since the existence of a rational square root matrix is nontrivial, we'll start by checking the characteristic polynomial and whether \(M(a)\) is diagonalizable with rational eigenvalues (a necessary condition for such \(B\)).

We'll enumerate rational \(a\) values from -3 to 3 (including some simple fractions) and attempt to find \(B\) by checking Jordan normal form or by direct enumeration of simpler \(B\) patterns.

The program will print candidate \(a\) values and a note on whether a square root matrix is plausible based on eigenvalues and minimal polynomial.

```python
# enumerator.py
import numpy as np
from fractions import Fraction

def matrix_a(a):
    # Construct matrix M(a)
    return np.array([
        [a, -a, -1, 0],
        [a, -a, 0, -1],
        [1, 0, a, -a],
        [0, 1, a, -a]
    ], dtype=object)

def is_rational(x):
    # Check if a numpy eigenvalue is rational (approximation)
    tol = 1e-12
    r = round(x.real)
    if abs(x.imag) < tol and abs(x.real - r) < tol:
        return True
    return False

def try_candidate(a):
    M = matrix_a(a)
    # Convert to float for eigenvals
    Mf = np.array(M, dtype=float)
    eigs = np.linalg.eigvals(Mf)
    # Check if all eigenvalues are approximately rational
    all_rational = all(is_rational(ev) for ev in eigs)
    if all_rational:
        print(f"Candidate a={a}: eigenvalues approx rational {eigs}")
    else:
        print(f"Candidate a={a}: eigenvalues not rational {eigs}")

def main():
    candidates = [Fraction(n, d) for d in [1,2,3,4] for n in range(-12,13)]
    printed = set()
    for a in candidates:
        # Simplify fraction
        a = a.limit_denominator()
        if a in printed:
            continue
        printed.add(a)
        try_candidate(a)

if __name__=="__main__":
    main()
```

This program generates rational \(a\) values with denominators up to 4 over \([-3,3]\), constructs \(M(a)\), and prints if the eigenvalues are approximately rational, a first heuristic toward finding the actual \(a\) admitting \(B\). Further symbolic algebra or more sophisticated methods would be needed for thorough proof.
