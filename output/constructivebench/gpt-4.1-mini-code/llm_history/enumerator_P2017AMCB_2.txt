The problem involves three variables \( x, y, z \) within specified intervals:

- \( 0 < x < 1 \),
- \( -1 < y < 0 \),
- \( 1 < z < 2 \).

We want to explore the behavior of some function \( P2017AMCB_2_answer(x,y,z) \) and understand if it is always positive.

Since the function definition is missing, let's write a flexible enumerator that tests samples of \( x, y, z \) in their domains and prints the function values if the function is provided.

We will:

- Define a sample function placeholder (e.g., a simple expression involving \( x,y,z \)) that can be replaced later.
- Enumerate values of \( x, y, z \) in their domains.
- Print the function value for each triple tested.
- This will help conjecturing whether the function is positive or not.

We keep the code efficient by sampling a small grid of values.

```python
# Enumerate possible values of a function P2017AMCB_2_answer(x,y,z) over the given domains.
# Since the function is unknown, we define a placeholder function to be customized.

def P2017AMCB_2_answer(x, y, z):
    # Placeholder function for exploration:
    # Replace or modify this function as needed.
    # Example candidate: (x - y)*(z - 1) - x*y*z
    return (x - y)*(z - 1) - x*y*z

def frange(start, stop, steps):
    """Generate 'steps' evenly spaced floats in (start, stop)."""
    step_size = (stop - start) / (steps + 1)
    return [start + step_size * (i+1) for i in range(steps)]

def main():
    # Sample points counts
    steps = 3

    xs = frange(0, 1, steps)      # x in (0,1)
    ys = frange(-1, 0, steps)     # y in (-1,0)
    zs = frange(1, 2, steps)      # z in (1,2)

    print("Sampling values for x,y,z and function results:")
    for x in xs:
        for y in ys:
            for z in zs:
                val = P2017AMCB_2_answer(x, y, z)
                print(f"x={x:.3f}, y={y:.3f}, z={z:.3f} => P2017AMCB_2_answer={val:.6f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This will print many samples of function values with the placeholder function defined. You can update the function definition for your specific problem to enumerate actual values and investigate positivity.
