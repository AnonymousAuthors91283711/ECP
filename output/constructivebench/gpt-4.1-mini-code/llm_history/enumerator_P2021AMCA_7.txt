This problem asks to find the minimum value of the expression \((xy - 1)^2 + (x + y)^2\) for real numbers \(x, y\). We'll enumerate sample values of \(x, y\) in reasonable ranges, print every computed value, and then identify the minimum observed value as a conjecture.

```python
import math

def f(x, y):
    return (x * y - 1) ** 2 + (x + y) ** 2

# Sample points: integers and simple fractions in [-3, 3]
# to cover vicinity and symmetry, taking care to prioritize exact values.
values = []
min_val = None
min_pair = None

print("Enumerating values of (x, y) with x,y in [-3,3] (integers and halves)")
for xi in range(-6, 7):   # step 0.5 via xi / 2
    x = xi / 2
    for yi in range(-6, 7):
        y = yi / 2
        val = f(x, y)
        print(f"x={x:.1f}, y={y:.1f}, value={val:.5f}")
        if (min_val is None) or (val < min_val):
            min_val = val
            min_pair = (x, y)

print(f"\nMinimum observed value: {min_val:.5f} at x={min_pair[0]}, y={min_pair[1]}")
```
