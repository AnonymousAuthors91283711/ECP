Ground Truth Answer: {(-1, 1)}
Proposed Answer: {(x, y) | y = (x + 1)^2 / (x + 1) + 1 ∧ x ≠ -1} ∪ {( -1, 1 )}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The original equation is: (x + y)^2 = (x + 1)(y - 1)
2. The ground truth answer is just the single point (-1, 1)
3. The proposed answer has two parts:
   - A general solution for x ≠ -1: y = (x+1)^2/(x+1) + 1
   - The point (-1, 1)

Let's simplify the proposed solution:
For x ≠ -1: y = (x+1)^2/(x+1) + 1 = (x+1) + 1 = x + 2

Now let's check if y = x + 2 satisfies the original equation:
(x + (x+2))^2 = (x+1)((x+2)-1)
(2x+2)^2 = (x+1)(x+1)
4(x+1)^2 = (x+1)^2
This would imply 4 = 1 when x ≠ -1, which is false.

Therefore, the only solution is indeed (-1, 1), as the general solution leads to a contradiction. The proposed answer incorrectly includes non-solutions.
