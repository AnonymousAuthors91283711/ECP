[write_program]
The problem describes a strictly increasing sequence \(a: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}\) satisfying two functional equations linking terms at even and odd indices, with given values at \(a_1\) and \(a_{13}=2016\). We want to enumerate possible strictly increasing sequences that satisfy the conditions for sample \(a_1\) values and see which yield \(a_{13}=2016\).

We will:
- Attempt small initial values \(a_1\).
- Use the recursive relations to compute up to \(a_{13}\).
- Check strict monotonicity and whether \(a_{13} = 2016\).
- Print all such \(a_1\) candidates and corresponding sequences as possible matches.

```python
# Enumerate sequences satisfying
# a(2k+1)^2 = a(2k)*a(2k-1)
# a(2k+2) = 2*a(2k+1) - a(2k)
# with a(13) = 2016, StrictMono a, a(1) = ? to be found

def enum_candidates():
    # We'll try small a1 from 1 to 50 for demonstration, limited output length
    TARGET = 2016
    for a1 in range(1, 51):
        # To start, need a0 to compute terms? a0 not defined.
        # But a0 appears in a(2*0 -1) = a(-1), invalid. We'll start indexing at a(1)?
        # Given expressions start at k
        # We'll manually define a(0) to be some integer that we find, or start from k=1.

        # Let's shift indexing to 1-based k to avoid negative index:
        # The first relation at k=1:
        # a(3)^2 = a(2)*a(1)
        # The second relation at k=1:
        # a(4) = 2*a(3) - a(2)
        # We need a(2) to begin; so let's try small a(2) and for each a(1), a(2)

[refine_program]
The original program attempts to enumerate sequences (a_n) satisfying given recursive relations and conditions, trying initial values a_1 and a_2 to build the sequence up to a_13 = 2016, checking strict monotonicity. However, it produces no output for a_1 in [1..50], which may be due to several issues:

1. The indexing interpretation is tricky: the original problem involves a(2k+1)^2 = a(2k) * a(2k-1), but for k=0, this refers to a(-1), undefined. Hence starting at k=1 is correct. Still, a(0) and a(-1) are never defined or assigned, but the code accesses a[2k-1] for k=1 â†’ a[1], so this is okay.

2. The code uses a dictionary a with keys from 1 to 13, but it lacks initial definitions for a(0) and a(-1), which might be needed if the formula applied for k=0.

3. The code assumes a_1 and a_2 given, and computes subsequent terms, verifying the constraints. However, the code quietly refuses candidates if roots are not perfect squares or monotonicity fails.

4. The upper bound for a_2 tries values from a_1+1 to a_1+50. This might be too narrow or miss the actual solution.

5. The program only prints sequences but does not explicitly print the found a_1 value that satisfies all conditions including a(13)=2016, nor does it summarize minimal or maximal a_1 or a_2 if multiple solutions exist.

6. The problem involves strict monotonicity of a, so a_1 < a_2 < a_3 < ... < a_13 =2016.

7. The output length is not controlled but is not large since no solutions are found.

Because the program produces no output, it likely does not correctly find the solution or explore enough candidates.

Therefore, the original program should be **rejected**.

Correction approach:

- The problem's key relations:

  a(2k+1)^2 = a(2k) * a(2k - 1),

  a(2k+2) = 2 * a(2k+1) - a(2k),

  with a(1) unknown, a(13) =
[refine_program]
The given submission only contains the problem statement in a formal math library style (Lean) and no Python program. The problem seems to involve a sequence defined with certain recurrence relations and uniqueness conditions, and asks to find a specific value, presumably \( a(1) \) given \( a(13) = 2016 \).

There is no program provided that attempts to enumerate or compute the answers. The enumerated answers section even states an error due to an empty program.

Therefore, I must reject the submission due to the absence of any Python enumerator program, which is required by the instructions.
