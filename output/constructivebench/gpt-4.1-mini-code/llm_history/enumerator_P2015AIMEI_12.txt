The problem involves sums of binomial coefficients and their gcd. To explore this, we'll compute p = sum_{m=0}^{n-1} C(n-m, k-1) and q = C(n, k) for some smaller n, k, and examine p/d + q/d where d = gcd(p, q). We'll enumerate several pairs and print the values to conjecture a formula.

```python
from math import comb, gcd

# Explore for small n,k and print p,q,d and p/d + q/d
for n in range(5, 16):  # n from 5 to 15
    for k in range(2, min(n, 8)):  # k from 2 to min(n,7)
        p = sum(comb(n - m, k - 1) for m in range(n))
        q = comb(n, k)
        d = gcd(p, q)
        val = p // d + q // d
        print(f"n={n}, k={k}: p={p}, q={q}, gcd={d}, val={val}")
```
