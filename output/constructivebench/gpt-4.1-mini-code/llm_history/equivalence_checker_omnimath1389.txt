Ground Truth Answer: 995 * 2^998
Proposed Answer: if 999 = 1 then 1 else 0
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves summing over all permutations of Fin 999, with each term being (-1) raised to (f(π) + g(π)), where:
   - f counts inversions in the permutation
   - g counts fixed points modulo n (with ±1 offset)

2. The ground truth answer is 995 * 2^998, which is a specific large number.

3. The proposed answer is a conditional that returns 1 only when n=1, and 0 otherwise. This is completely different from the ground truth answer.

4. For n=999 (which is ≠1), the proposed answer would be 0, while the ground truth is a very large positive number (995 * 2^998).

The two answers are clearly not equivalent. The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth in any case except the trivial n=1 case, which isn't even relevant to the problem (n=999).
