The problem involves evaluating a double sum of probabilities based on given discrete outcomes and probability functions. We'll enumerate all possible pairs (j, n) from the set {1, 2, 3} and compute the product jerry_prob(j) * neil_prob(j, n) only when n=3, then sum these values.

We'll print each term as we find it, followed by the total sum to conjecture the exact rational answer.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def jerry_prob(j):
    outcomes = {1, 2, 3}
    return Fraction(1,3) if j in outcomes else Fraction(0)

def neil_prob(j, n):
    outcomes = {1, 2, 3}
    if n in outcomes and n >= j:
        return Fraction(1,3) * (Fraction(2,3)**(n - j))
    else:
        return Fraction(0)

outcomes = [1, 2, 3]
total = Fraction(0)
print("Enumerating terms for sum over j in {1,2,3} and n=3:")
for j in outcomes:
    p_j = jerry_prob(j)
    p_n = neil_prob(j, 3)
    term = p_j * p_n
    print(f"j={j}, n=3: jerry_prob={p_j}, neil_prob={p_n}, term={term}")
    total += term

print(f"Sum of all terms = {total}")
```
