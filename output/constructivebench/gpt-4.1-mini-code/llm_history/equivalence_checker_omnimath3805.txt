Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: { (fun x => (0 : ℝ)) } ∪
{ (fun x => (-x + 1 : ℝ)) } ∪
{ (fun x => (x - 1 : ℝ)) }
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer lists three potential solutions: the zero function, the function f(x) = -x + 1, and the function f(x) = x - 1. While these are indeed solutions to the functional equation, the ground truth answer (which we don't know) might include additional solutions or might be expressed in a different form. The proposed answer is correct in terms of the solutions it provides, but we can't be certain it's complete without seeing the ground truth. Therefore, the answer is "Close" - mostly correct but potentially incomplete.
