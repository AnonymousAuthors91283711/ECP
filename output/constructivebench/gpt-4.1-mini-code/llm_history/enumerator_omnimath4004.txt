The problem is to verify or explore the inequality for nonnegative real numbers a, b, c, d with sum 4:

    a/(a^3 + 8) + b/(b^3 + 8) + c/(c^3 + 8) + d/(d^3 + 8) ≤ 4/9.

We want to test various quadruples (a,b,c,d) ≥ 0 with a+b+c+d=4 and compute the sum to see if it is ≤ 4/9 = 0.4444...

Likely candidates for extremal values are when the variables are equal or when one is 4 and others zero, and values in between. We'll enumerate rational quadruples with denominator at most 4 summing to 4, output each sum and test if sum ≤ 4/9, printing values immediately.

We prioritize exact fractions but will print floats for clarity due to fraction complexities.

We also print extremal value found to conjecture if 4/9 really is the maximum.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def f(x):
    # f(x) = x / (x^3 + 8), handle x=0
    if x == 0:
        return Fraction(0)
    return Fraction(x, x**3 + 8)

# We'll try rational values with denominator 4 since sum=4 means numerator in [0..16]
# We'll enumerate a,b,c and compute d=4 - (a+b+c) to avoid quadruple loops over d.
# Only consider nonnegative a,b,c,d ≤ 4.

max_val = Fraction(0)
max_tuple = None

den = 4
total_num = 4 * den  # 16

print("Enumerating quadruples (a,b,c,d) with sum=4, a,b,c,d multiples of 1/4")

for a_num in range(total_num + 1):
    a = Fraction(a_num, den)
    if a > 4:
        continue
    for b_num in range(total_num - a_num + 1):
        b = Fraction(b_num, den)
        if b > 4:
            continue
        for c_num in range(total_num - a_num - b_num + 1):
            c = Fraction(c_num, den)
            d_num = total_num - a_num - b_num - c_num
            d = Fraction(d_num, den)
            if d < 0 or d > 4:
                continue
            # compute sum
            val = f(a) + f(b) + f(c) + f(d)
            # print current candidate and value as fraction and float
            print(f"a={a} b={b} c={c} d={d} sum={val} ≈ {float(val):.5f}")
            if val > max_val:
                max_val = val
                max_tuple = (a,b,c,d)

print("\nMaximum sum found:")
print(f"a={max_tuple[0]}, b={max_tuple[1]}, c={max_tuple[2]}, d={max_tuple[3]}, sum={max_val} ≈ {float(max_val):.5f}")
print("Comparison to 4/9 ≈ 0.44444:", float(max_val) <= 4/9 + 1e-9)
