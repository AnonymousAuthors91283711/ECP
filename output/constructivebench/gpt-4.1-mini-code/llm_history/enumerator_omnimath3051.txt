This problem defines a function \( f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \) with two initial conditions and a functional equation:

- \( f(2) = 5 \)
- \( f(3) = 7 \)
- \( f(m) + f(n) = f(mn) \) for all positive integers \( m,n \).

We want to find \( f(12) \).

Given the relation, \( f \) transforms multiplication into addition, so this is a homomorphism from the multiplicative semigroup of positive integers into addition. The function behaves like a logarithm but with integer outputs.

Since \( f(mn) = f(m) + f(n) \), \( f \) is completely determined by its values on prime numbers and extended additively over prime factorizations.

We know \( f(2) = 5 \), \( f(3) = 7 \), so for \( f(12) = f(2^2 \cdot 3) = 2 f(2) + f(3) = 2 \times 5 + 7 = 17 \).

To programmatically confirm this, we can:

- Define \( f \) on prime factors.
- Enumerate factor pairs \( m, n \) with \( m \cdot n = 12 \).
- Check the consistency of sums based on initial values.
- Compute \( f(12) \) through the additive relation.

Here's a Python program enumerating factor pairs and printing \( f(12) \) based on the given conditions.

```python
# Enumerate possible values of f(12) given f(2)=5, f(3)=7, and f(mn)=f(m)+f(n)

def prime_factors(n):
    factors = {}
    d = 2
    while d * d <= n:
        while n % d == 0:
            factors[d] = factors.get(d, 0) + 1
            n //= d
        d += 1
    if n > 1:
        factors[n] = factors.get(n, 0) + 1
    return factors

def f(n, values):
    # f(n) = sum of exponents times f(prime)
    factors = prime_factors(n)
    res = 0
    for p, e in factors.items():
        if p not in values:
            return None  # unknown prime factor
        res += e * values[p]
    return res

def main():
    # Given initial values
    values = {2:5, 3:7}

    # We'll enumerate factor pairs (m,n) with m*n=12
    n = 12
    print(f"Given f(2)={values[2]}, f(3)={values[3]}, and f(mn)=f(m)+f(n) for m,n>0")

    # Find factor pairs of 12
    fact_pairs = []
    for m in range(1, n+1):
        if n % m == 0:
            fact_pairs.append((m, n//m))

    for m, k in fact_pairs:
        fm = f(m, values)
        fk = f(k, values)
        if fm is not None and fk is not None:
            fn = fm + fk
            print(f"f({m}) + f({k}) = {fm} + {fk} = {fn} -> f({n}) = {fn}")

    # Compute f(12) directly through prime factorization
    f12 = f(n, values)
    print(f"Therefore, f({n}) = {f12}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
