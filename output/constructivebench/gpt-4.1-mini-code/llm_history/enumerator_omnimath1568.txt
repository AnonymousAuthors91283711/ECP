The problem asks for the value of the triple infinite sum over positive integers \(a,b,c\):
\[
\sum_{a=1}^\infty \sum_{b=1}^\infty \sum_{c=1}^\infty \frac{a b (3a + c)}{4^{a+b+c}(a+b)(b+c)(c+a)}.
\]

We want to explore partial sums for finite upper limits \(N\) on \(a,b,c\), and print these partial sums to conjecture the infinite sum value.

The program uses integer limits up to \(N=6\) to limit output length. It accumulates the partial sums exactly with fractions and prints both the fraction and float approximation. This helps observe convergence to identify the limit numerically.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def triple_sum(N):
    total = Fraction(0)
    for a in range(1, N+1):
        for b in range(1, N+1):
            for c in range(1, N+1):
                numerator = a * b * (3*a + c)
                denominator = (4**(a+b+c)) * (a+b) * (b+c) * (c+a)
                term = Fraction(numerator, denominator)
                total += term
    return total

def main():
    print("Enumerating partial sums for triple sum:")
    for N in range(1, 7):
        s = triple_sum(N)
        print(f"N={N}: sum = {s} â‰ˆ {float(s)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This will print partial sums of the triple series for \(N=1..6\), showing convergence behavior and aiding conjecture of the infinite sum.
