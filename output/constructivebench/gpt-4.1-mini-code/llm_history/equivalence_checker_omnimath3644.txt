Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: fun k => if k > 0 then {(k, k, k + 1), (k, k + 1, k), (k + 1, k, k)} else ∅
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer correctly identifies the solution set for k > 0, which consists of all permutations of (k, k, k+1). However, it doesn't address the case when k = 0, where the set should be empty (as shown in the proposed answer). The ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's not provided), but based on the problem statement, the proposed answer seems mostly correct except it might need to explicitly state that these are the only solutions (completeness of the solution set). The equivalence would hold if we can confirm there are no other solutions besides these permutations.
