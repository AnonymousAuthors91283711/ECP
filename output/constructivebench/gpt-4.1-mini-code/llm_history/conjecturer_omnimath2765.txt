abbrev omnimath2765_answer : ℚ → ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath2765 (n : ℚ) : 
  1/(2 * n) + 1/(4 * n) = 3/12 ↔ n = omnimath2765_answer 3 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating candidates n = p/q and checking 1/(2n) + 1/(4n) = 3/12
Found exact solution: n = 3/1 = 3
Found exact solution: n = 6/2 = 3
Found exact solution: n = 9/3 = 3
Found exact solution: n = 12/4 = 3
Found exact solution: n = 15/5 = 3
Found exact solution: n = 18/6 = 3. Expected Answer Type: ℚ → ℚ
<<<fun x : ℚ => 3>>>
