The problem involves the Fibonacci numbers and a quadratic equation with roots \(r\) and \(s\) defined by coefficients from Fibonacci numbers depending on \(k\). The goal is to understand or conjecture an explicit formula for \((r+1)(s+1)\) in terms of \(k\).

From the equation:
\[
\text{fib}(k+2) + \text{fib}(k+1) r + \text{fib}(k) r^2 = 0,
\]
the roots \(r, s\) satisfy a quadratic of the form:
\[
\text{fib}(k) x^2 + \text{fib}(k+1) x + \text{fib}(k+2) = 0.
\]

By Viète's formulas:
\[
r + s = -\frac{\text{fib}(k+1)}{\text{fib}(k)}, \quad rs = \frac{\text{fib}(k+2)}{\text{fib}(k)}.
\]

We want to enumerate values of \((r+1)(s+1) = rs + r + s + 1\) for small \(k\) to identify a pattern. The code below will:

- Compute Fibonacci numbers.
- Compute \(r+s\) and \(rs\) using Viète's formulas.
- Calculate and print \((r+1)(s+1)\) for \(k=1\) to \(15\).
- Print the conjectured formula after enumerations.

```python
# Enumerate (r+1)(s+1) values based on Fibonacci coefficients for k=1..15

def fib(n):
    a,b=0,1
    for _ in range(n): a,b=b,a+b
    return a

print("k (fib(k)), (r+1)(s+1) values:")
for k in range(1,16):
    fk=fib(k)
    fk1=fib(k+1)
    fk2=fib(k+2)
    # Viète: r+s = -fk1/fk, rs = fk2/fk
    val = fk2/fk - fk1/fk + 1  # (r+1)(s+1) = rs + r + s +1 = rs + (r+s) +1
    # Simplify numerator: fib(k+2) - fib(k+1) + fib(k), divide by fib(k)
    # Print exact fraction and float approximation for insight
    print(f"k={k}, fib(k)={fk}, (r+1)(s+1)={val:.5f}")

# Conjectured simplification:
# (r+1)(s+1) = (fib(k+2) - fib(k+1) + fib(k))/fib(k)
# Since fib(k+2) = fib(k+1) + fib(k), numerator = (fib(k+1) + fib(k)) - fib(k+1) + fib(k) = 2*fib(k)
# So (r+1)(s+1) = 2*fib(k)/fib(k) = 2 for all k>=1
print("\nConjecture: (r+1)(s+1) = 2 for all k ≥ 1")
```
