Let's try to understand and enumerate function values of \(f\) for small \(n\), adhering to the recursive relation and inequalities. We'll then check pairs \((k,l)\) with \(k < l\) and \(f(k) + f(l) = 293\).

```python
# Enumerate values of f(n) with the given constraints and relations
# f(1)=1
# 3*f(n)*f(2n+1) = f(2n)*(1 + 3*f(n))
# f(2n) < 6*f(n)
# We'll build f for n up to some reasonable bound and check sums to 293.

def possible_fs(max_n=50):
    f = dict()
    f[1] = 1
    # To avoid infinite computation, limit to max_n
    
    # Since we can calculate f(2n+1) from f(n) and f(2n)
    # but f(2n) has inequality constraint. We can try to find integer solutions.
    # Rearranged from hf2:
    # 3*f(n)*f(2n+1) = f(2n)*(1+3*f(n)) => 
    # f(2n+1) = f(2n)*(1+3*f(n)) / (3*f(n))
    
    # We'll try to guess f(2n), then compute f(2n+1).
    # f(2n) < 6*f(n)
    
    # We'll proceed by breadth first enumeration of f values for n from 1 to max_n.
