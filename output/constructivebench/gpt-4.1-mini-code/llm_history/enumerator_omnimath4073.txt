The problem involves a cubic polynomial \( Q = x^3 - 21x + 35 \) with roots \( r, s, t \) and a quadratic polynomial \( P = x^2 + ax + b \) with real coefficients \( a, b \). The conditions are that \( r, s, t \) are distinct roots of \( Q \), and \( P \) permutes them cyclically: \( P(r) = s \), \( P(s) = t \), \( P(t) = r \).

We want to find possible values of \( (a, b) \) for which such an arrangement exists.

The task is to enumerate candidates for \( a \) and \( b \), then check if the system conditions can be met with the roots of \( Q \).

I'll write a Python program to:
- Compute the roots of \( Q \).
- For a grid of values for \( (a,b) \), check if the induced map \( P \) permutes roots cyclically.
- Print triples \( (a,b) \) which work or nearly work (considering floating-point accuracy).

Because the roots of \( Q \) are real and can be computed exactly (with Cardano's method) or numerically, Iâ€™ll compute numerically.

```python
# enumerator.py
import numpy as np

# Define Q(x) = x^3 - 21x + 35
def Q(x):
    return x**3 - 21*x + 35

def poly_P(x, a, b):
    return x**2 + a*x + b

def cyclic_perm_check(roots, a, b, tol=1e-5):
    # roots: array of 3 distinct real roots of Q
    # Check if P permutes roots cyclically: 
    # P(r) ~ s, P(s) ~ t, P(t) ~ r in some order
    # Since it's a 3-cycle, check all permutations of roots 
    from itertools import permutations
    for perm in permutations(roots):
        r,s,t = perm
        if (abs(poly_P(r,a,b) - s) < tol and
            abs(poly_P(s,a,b) - t) < tol and
            abs(poly_P(t,a,b) - r) < tol):
            return True
    return False

def main():
    # Find roots of Q numerically
    # Coefficients: x^3 -21x + 35 = x^3 + 0 x^2 -21x +35
    coefs = [1,0,-21,35]
    roots = np.roots(coefs)
    # Filter to keep only real roots, since we want r,s,t in R
    real_roots = roots[np.isreal(roots)].real
    if len(real_roots) < 3:
        print("Less than 3 real roots found, cannot proceed.")
        return
    # Check distinctness
    if len(set(np.round(real_roots,8))) < 3:
        print("Roots are not distinct enough.")
        return

    print(f"Roots of Q: {real_roots}")

    # Enumerate (a,b) over a grid to find approx matches
    # Based on rough scale of roots (-5 to 5), try a,b in [-10,10]
    grid_points = 51  # to keep output short
    a_values = np.linspace(-10,10,grid_points)
    b_values = np.linspace(-10,10,grid_points)

    for a in a_values:
        for b in b_values:
            if cyclic_perm_check(real_roots, a, b):
                print(f"Candidate (a,b): ({a:.3f}, {b:.3f})")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This enumerator will print the three real roots and candidate quadratic coefficients \( (a,b) \) for which \( P \) cyclically permutes the roots of \( Q \) within a tolerance. This helps conjecture the exact values and verify them.
