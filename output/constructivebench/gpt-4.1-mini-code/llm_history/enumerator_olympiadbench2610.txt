The problem involves evaluating the integral of the square of the ceiling function over the interval \([0, w]\) and then, given the integral equals \(20 \sqrt{7}\), finding the value of \(\lceil 2w \rceil\).

To explore this numerically, we can:
- Compute the integral \(\int_0^w \lceil x \rceil^2 dx\) for various \(w\).
- For the integral equal to \(20 \sqrt{7} \approx 52.915\), find \(w\) such that the integral is close to this value.
- Then compute and print \(\lceil 2w \rceil\) for these \(w\) values.
  
We will do this by:
- Considering intervals \([0, n]\), \(n\) integer, the integral splits into sums of integrals over intervals \([k, k+1]\) where ceiling is \(k+1\).
- Since ceiling function is constant on \((k, k+1]\), \(\int_k^{k+1} (k+1)^2 dx = (k+1)^2 \cdot 1 = (k+1)^2\).
- For a partial last interval \([n, w]\) with \(w \in (n, n+1)\), \(\int_n^w (n+1)^2 dx = (n+1)^2 (w-n)\).
- We sum over full intervals and partial last interval.

We will:
- Enumerate \(n=0,1,2,...,10\)
- For each \(n\), try to find \(w \in (n, n+1)\) s.t integral \(= 20 \sqrt{7}\).
- Print candidates \(w\) and \(\lceil 2w \rceil\).

```python
# Enumerate possible w > 0 with integral of ceil(x)^2 from 0 to w equals 20*sqrt(7)
# Then print ceil(2*w) for these candidates.

from math import sqrt, ceil

target = 20 * sqrt(7)  # ≈ 52.915

# integral from 0 to n of ceil(x)^2 dx for integer n is sum_{k=1}^n k^2 = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6
def sum_of_squares(n):
    return n*(n+1)*(2*n+1)//6  # integer sum

# For w in (n, n+1), integral = sum_of_squares(n) + (n+1)^2*(w - n)
# Solve for w:
# target = sum_of_squares(n) + (n+1)^2 * (w - n)
# => w = n + (target - sum_of_squares(n)) / (n+1)^2

for n in range(11):  # n=0 to 10
    base = sum_of_squares(n)
    diff = target - base
    denom = (n+1)**2
    if 0 < diff < denom:  # w must be in (n, n+1)
        w = n + diff / denom
        print(f"w ≈ {w:.6f}, ceil(2*w) = {ceil(2*w)}")
```
