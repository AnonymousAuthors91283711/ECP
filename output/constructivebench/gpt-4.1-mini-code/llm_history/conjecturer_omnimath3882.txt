theorem omnimath3882 (n : ℕ) (hn : 0 < n) :
  (∃ m, (2^n - 1) ∣ (m^2 + 9)) ↔ n ∈ omnimath3882_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n = 1, m = 0 satisfies (m^2 + 9) divisible by 1 (2^1 - 1)
n = 2, m = 0 satisfies (m^2 + 9) divisible by 3 (2^2 - 1)
n = 4, m = 6 satisfies (m^2 + 9) divisible by 15 (2^4 - 1)
n = 8, m = 39 satisfies (m^2 + 9) divisible by 255 (2^8 - 1)
n = 16, m = 8529 satisfies (m^2 + 9) divisible by 65535 (2^16 - 1). Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
<<<{n | ∃ k : ℕ, n = 2 ^ k}>>>
