The problem asks for real solutions \( a \) to the equation \(\frac{3a - 7}{a - 2} = 2\). We want to enumerate candidate solutions and conjecture the exact one.

```python
# Enumerate potential solutions for (3a - 7)/(a - 2) = 2 with a in small integers and decimals.
print("Checking a near 2 (to avoid division by zero):")
for a in [1, 1.5, 1.9, 1.99, 2.01, 2.1, 3, 4]:
    if abs(a - 2) < 1e-9:
        # Division by zero, skip
        continue
    val = (3*a - 7) / (a - 2)
    print(f"a = {a}, (3a - 7)/(a - 2) = {val}")

# Exact algebraic approach: solve (3a - 7) = 2(a - 2) -> 3a -7 = 2a -4 -> a = 3
for a in [3]:
    val = (3*a -7)/(a-2)
    print(f"Exact candidate a = {a}, evaluates to {val}")

# Summary candidate:
print("Conjecture: a = 3 solves the equation exactly.")
```
