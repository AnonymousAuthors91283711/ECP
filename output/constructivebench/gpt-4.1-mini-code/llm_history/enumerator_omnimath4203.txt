The problem involves sequences defined piecewise with parameters m > 1, where for i < m, x i = 2^i, and for i â‰¥ m, x i sums previous m values. We want to find the greatest k where a contiguous block of length k in x contains elements all divisible by m.

To assist, I'll enumerate x for small m, print possible k satisfying the divisibility condition for some intervals, and identify the maximum such k. This is a linear recurrence with initial powers of 2, so we can compute values and check divisibility efficiently.

```python
# Enumerate sequence x for various m > 1 and find intervals where all x_j are divisible by m.
# Print candidates for k = lengths of such intervals, along with i (start index).
# Then print the maximum such k found for each m.

def x_sequence(m, n_terms):
    x = [2**i for i in range(m)]
    for i in range(m, n_terms):
        s = sum(x[i - j - 1] for j in range(m))
        x.append(s)
    return x

def find_divisible_intervals(m, n_terms=30):
    x = x_sequence(m, n_terms)
    max_k = 0
    for start in range(n_terms):
        for length in range(1, n_terms - start + 1):
            block = x[start:start+length]
            if all(e % m == 0 for e in block):
                print(f"m={m}, start={start}, length={length}, block={block}")
                if length > max_k:
                    max_k = length
            else:
                break  # longer intervals won't satisfy divisibility from this start
    print(f"m={m}: maximum k with a divisible block = {max_k}\n")

def main():
    for m in range(2, 6):  # small sample m values
        print(f"Checking m={m} with first 30 terms...")
        find_divisible_intervals(m)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
