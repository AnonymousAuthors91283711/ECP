The problem involves computing a sum of harmonic series terms based on parameters n and alice. We will enumerate expectedGames for small values n and alice, printing partial sums to observe and conjecture the pattern.

```python
# Enumerate sums of harmonic series segments for small n, alice
def harmonic_sum(k):
    # Sum of 1/i for i=1 to k
    s = 0.0
    for i in range(1, k+1):
        s += 1/i
    return s

print("Enumerating expectedGames = sum_{k=1}^{alice-1} 1/k + sum_{k=1}^{n-alice} 1/k")
for n in range(5, 25, 5):  # sample n values
    for alice in range(1, n+1):
        left = harmonic_sum(alice-1) if alice > 1 else 0.0
        right = harmonic_sum(n - alice) if alice < n else 0.0
        expected = left + right
        print(f"n={n}, alice={alice}, expectedGames={expected:.12f}")
print("Example for n=21, alice=11:")
n, alice = 21, 11
left = harmonic_sum(alice-1)
right = harmonic_sum(n - alice)
expected = left + right
print(f"Expected games = {expected:.12f}")
```
