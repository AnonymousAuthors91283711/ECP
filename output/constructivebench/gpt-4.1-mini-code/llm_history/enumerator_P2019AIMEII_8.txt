The problem involves finding the value of the polynomial f(z) = a*z^2018 + b*z^2017 + c*z^2016 with integer coefficients a,b,c ≤ 2019, given that f evaluated at a specific complex number equals a particular complex value. We want to find f(1) mod 1000.

To assist in conjecturing, we'll try small integer values for a,b,c in [0..50] (to keep the search quick) and check if f at the given complex number matches the target complex value (within a small tolerance due to complex arithmetic). When a match is found, we print the triple (a,b,c) and the value f(1) mod 1000.

This enumeration can help reveal the actual solution or the pattern.

```python
import cmath

# Given complex number z and target value w
sqrt3 = cmath.sqrt(3)
z = (1 + sqrt3 * 1j) / 2
w_target = 2015 + 2019 * sqrt3 * 1j

tolerance = 1e-6

max_coef = 50  # sample upper bound for parameters a,b,c

z2016 = z ** 2016
z2017 = z2016 * z
z2018 = z2017 * z

print("Enumerating possible (a,b,c) with coefficients ≤ 50 satisfying f(z)=w_target:")

for a in range(max_coef+1):
    for b in range(max_coef+1):
        for c in range(max_coef+1):
            fz = a*z2018 + b*z2017 + c*z2016
            if abs(fz.real - w_target.real) < tolerance and abs(fz.imag - w_target.imag) < tolerance:
                val = (a + b + c) % 1000  # f(1) = a + b + c (since z^k at 1 is 1)
                print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, f(1) mod 1000 = {val}")
```
