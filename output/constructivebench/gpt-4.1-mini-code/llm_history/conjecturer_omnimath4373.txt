  omnimath4373_answer a b c d e := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating possible (a,b,c,d,e) with 1 <= each <= 10 and a,b,c,d,e positive integers
Found #1: a=3, b=5, c=8, d=7, e=7
Done enumerating.. Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ → ℝ → ℝ → ℝ → Prop
<<<fun a b c d e => (a = 3) ∧ (b = 5) ∧ (c = 8) ∧ (d = 7) ∧ (e = 7)>>>
