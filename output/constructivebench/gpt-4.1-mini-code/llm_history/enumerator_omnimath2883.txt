The problem asks to find a natural number `omnimath2883_answer` such that for integers `odot` and `nabla` satisfying:
- `0 < odot < 20`
- `0 < nabla < 20`
- `odot ≠ nabla`
- `odot³ = nabla`
we have `nabla² = omnimath2883_answer`.

So the key is to find pairs `(odot, nabla)` where `nabla = odot³`, both are under 20 and different.

Python code will:

- Iterate over `odot` in 1 to 19
- Compute `nabla = odot^3`
- Check `nabla < 20` and `odot != nabla`
- If these hold, print `odot`, `nabla`, and compute `nabla²` which is the candidate answer.

Because `nabla` must be less than 20, and `nabla = odot^3`, we restrict to cubes less than 20. The cubes less than 20 are 1 (1³), 8 (2³), and 27 (3³ - which is >20), so only 1 and 8.

But `nabla` must be less than 20, `nabla=1` when `odot=1`, but then `odot == nabla` so excluded.

`odot=2` => `nabla=8`, and `2 != 8`. This fits.

So the candidate pair is `(2, 8)`.

Then `nabla² = 8² = 64`.

The program will print all candidates as per the requirements and the final `omnimath2883_answer`.

```python
# Enumerate odot and nabla as per problem constraints and print resulting nabla^2.

def main():
    print("Enumerating candidates for (odot, nabla) with odot³ = nabla, odot != nabla, 0 < odot,nabla < 20")
    for odot in range(1, 20):
        nabla = odot ** 3
        if nabla < 20 and odot != nabla:
            nabla_sq = nabla ** 2
            print(f"odot={odot}, nabla={nabla}, nabla^2={nabla_sq}")
    print("Answer (nabla^2) for omnimath2883_answer is 64")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
