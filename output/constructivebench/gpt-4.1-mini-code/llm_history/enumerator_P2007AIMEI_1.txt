The problem is to count positive integers \( k \) such that \( k^2 < 10^6 \) and \( 24 \mid k^2 \). Equivalently, find the number of positive integers \( k < 1000 \) with \( 24 \mid k^2 \).

Since \(24 = 2^3 \times 3\), to have \(24 \mid k^2\), \(k^2\) must be divisible by \(2^3\) and by \(3\). Thus, \(k^2\) must be divisible by \(8\) and \(3\). For \(k^2\) to be divisible by 8, \(k\) must be divisible by at least \(2^2=4\) (because squares double the exponent). For \(k^2\) to be divisible by 3, \(k\) must be divisible by 3.

Therefore, \(k\) must be divisible by \(\mathrm{lcm}(4, 3) = 12\).

Our task reduces to counting positive multiples of 12 less than 1000. The largest multiple of 12 below 1000 is \(12 \times 83 = 996\).

I write a program that enumerates all such \(k\) and prints them and their count.

```python
# Enumerate positive integers k < 1000 such that 24 divides k^2
# 24 = 2^3 * 3, so k must be divisible by 12 to meet divisibility of k^2 by 24.

def main():
    max_k = 999
    # Divisor for k^2 is 24
    # k must be divisible by 12
    candidates = []
    print("k such that k^2 is divisible by 24 and k^2 < 10^6:")
    for k in range(12, max_k+1, 12):
        k_sq = k*k
        if k_sq < 10**6:
            print(k)
            candidates.append(k)
    print(f"Total count: {len(candidates)}")
    print(f"Answer: {len(candidates)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
