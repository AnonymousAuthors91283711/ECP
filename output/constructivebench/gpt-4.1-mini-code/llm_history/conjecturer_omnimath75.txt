abbrev omnimath75_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath75 (m : ℕ) (hm : 0 < m) :
  (∃ p, Prime p ∧ ∀ n, ¬p ∣ (n^m - m)) ↔ m ∈ omnimath75_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: m=1: no prime p up to 50 without n^m ≡ m mod p
m=2, p=3 has no n with n^2 ≡ 2 (mod 3)
m=3, p=7 has no n with n^3 ≡ 3 (mod 7)
m=4, p=5 has no n with n^4 ≡ 4 (mod 5)
m=5, p=11 has no n with n^5 ≡ 5 (mod 11)
m=6, p=7 has no n with n^6 ≡ 6 (mod 7)
m=7, p=29 has no n with n^7 ≡ 7 (mod 29)
m=8, p=3 has no n with n^8 ≡ 8 (mod 3)
m=9, p=7 has no n with n^9 ≡ 9 (mod 7)
m=10, p=7 has no n with n^10 ≡ 10 (mod 7). Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
<<<{ m | m ≥ 2 }>>>
