The problem is to find the cardinality of the set of integers \( x \) such that \( |2x| \leq 7\pi \). This equivalently means finding the number of integers \( x \) with \(-\frac{7\pi}{2} \leq x \leq \frac{7\pi}{2} \).

We want to enumerate all such integers \( x \) and count them, for example approximating \(\pi\) as 3.14159.

```python
import math

def enumerate_integers():
    threshold = 7 * math.pi / 2
    print(f"Threshold (7π/2) ≈ {threshold:.6f}")
    count = 0
    # x is integer satisfying -threshold <= x <= threshold
    min_x = math.ceil(-threshold)
    max_x = math.floor(threshold)
    print(f"Enumerating integers x with {min_x} <= x <= {max_x}:")
    for x in range(min_x, max_x + 1):
        print(x)
        count += 1
    print(f"Total count: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    enumerate_integers()
```
