The problem is to find the least natural number s such that s is a square number and s can be written as the sum of 18 consecutive natural numbers starting from some positive integer k. The form is:

s = k + (k+1) + (k+2) + ... + (k+17)

We want s to be a perfect square.

The sum of 18 consecutive integers starting from k is:

s = 18*k + (0+1+...+17) = 18*k + (17*18)/2 = 18*k + 153

So s = 18*k + 153

We want to find the smallest s = 18*k + 153 such that s = m^2 for some integer m.

We can enumerate k starting from 1 upwards:

Check if 18*k + 153 is a perfect square.

We print all such s that satisfy these conditions immediately once found.

Once we find the least such s, we announce it.

We stop after checking, say, k up to 1000 to keep output concise.

```python
import math

def is_perfect_square(n):
    root = int(math.isqrt(n))
    return root*root == n

def main():
    print("Searching for perfect squares s = 18*k + 153, with k > 0, sum of 18 consecutive integers.")
    min_s = None
    min_k = None
    max_k = 1000
    for k in range(1, max_k+1):
        s = 18*k + 153
        if is_perfect_square(s):
            root = int(math.isqrt(s))
            print(f"s = {s} = {root}^2, with k = {k}")
            if min_s is None or s < min_s:
                min_s = s
                min_k = k
    if min_s is not None:
        print(f"Least such s: {min_s} = ({int(math.isqrt(min_s))})^2, with k = {min_k}")
    else:
        print("No such s found for k up to", max_k)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
