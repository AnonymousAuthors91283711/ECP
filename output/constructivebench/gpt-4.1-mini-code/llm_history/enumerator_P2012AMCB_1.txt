The problem seems to want us to find the value of \(4 \times (18 - 2)\), or at least verify it, then assign that value as P2012AMCB_1_answer. To assist in conjecturing the answer via enumeration, I'll write a Python program that computes \(4 \times (18 - 2)\) and enumerates possible values for multiplication and subtraction involving small numbers to mimic this operation and print intermediate results immediately.

```python
# Enumerate values for 4*(18-2) and intermediate results
def enumerate_values():
    for a in range(1, 6):  # small values for first multiplicand
        for b in range(15, 21):  # range around 18 for subtraction operand
            for c in range(1, 5):  # values for second subtraction operand
                sub = b - c
                result = a * sub
                print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c} => {a} * ({b} - {c}) = {result}")

enumerate_values()
```

This will print many lines including when a=4, b=18, c=2, the exact target \(4 \times (18-2) = 64\). This helps to identify and confirm the value.
