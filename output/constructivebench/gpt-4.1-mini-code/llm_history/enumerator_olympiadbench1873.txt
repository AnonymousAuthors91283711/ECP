The problem involves finding the minimal integer \( n \) such that any monomial \( X_0^i X_1^j X_2^k \) with \( i+j+k \geq n \) can be expressed as a linear combination of three polynomials multiplied by the symmetric sums \(X_0+X_1+X_2\), \(X_0X_1 + X_1X_2 + X_2X_0\), and \(X_0X_1X_2\) respectively. 

To investigate this, we enumerate tuples \((i,j,k)\) of nonnegative integers with \(i+j+k\) large. We try to express each monomial as:
\[
X_0^i X_1^j X_2^k = (X_0 + X_1 + X_2) P + (X_0 X_1 + X_1 X_2 + X_2 X_0) Q + (X_0 X_1 X_2) R,
\]
where \(P, Q, R\) are polynomials in \(\mathbb{Z}[X_0,X_1,X_2]\).

We'll test all monomials with degree from 0 up to some bound, and check divisibility in terms of the symmetric sums. Our goal is to find the smallest \(n\) where all monomials of degree \(\geq n\) satisfy this property.
