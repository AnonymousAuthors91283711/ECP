The problem involves a linear recurrence defined by \(a_{n+2} = x a_{n+1} + y a_n\), with initial terms \(a_0 = a_0\), \(a_1 = a_1\). For given \(x, y\), it asks for existence of some \(m\) such that the sequence difference condition \(a_{m+3} - a_{m+1} = a_{m+1} - a_m\) holds for all initial values \(a_0, a_1\). We want to find all \(y\) for which this is true (presumably for fixed \(x\)).

This condition resembles a relation on the sequence terms that restricts the form of the sequence, independent of initial values. Let's enumerate some values \(x, y\), then for each, check for some \(m\) whether the difference condition is identically true for all \(a_0, a_1\). Because the recurrence is linear in initial values, this reduces to checking the relation on basis sequences with \((1,0)\) and \((0,1)\) as \((a_0,a_1)\).

We take small integer values for \(x, y\) and \(m\), and print \(x, y, m\) when the condition holds.

```python
# Enumerate x, y in small range, for each check m up to a threshold
# For each (x,y,m), check the condition holds for all a_0, a_1
# Use linearity: test sequences with (1,0) and (0,1) to get vectors
# Condition: a_{m+3} - a_{m+1} = a_{m+1} - a_m
# => a_{m+3} - 2 a_{m+1} + a_m = 0 for all sequences a
# This is a linear constraint on a_0, a_1. Must hold identically, so both coeff for a_0 and a_1 zero.

def recurrence_term(x, y, a0, a1, n):
    # compute a_n by recurrence
    if n == 0:
        return a0
    elif n == 1:
        return a1
    an_2, an_1 = a0, a1
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        an = x * an_1 + y * an_2
        an_2, an_1 = an_1, an
    return an_1

def condition_holds(x, y, m):
    # Check if for all a0, a1 (real), 
    # a_{m+3} - 2 a_{m+1} + a_m = 0
    # is identically zero
    # We check for basis (a0,a1) = (1,0) and (0,1)
    c0 = recurrence_term(x, y, 1, 0, m+3) - 2*recurrence_term(x, y, 1, 0, m+1) + recurrence_term(x, y, 1, 0, m)
    c1 = recurrence_term(x, y, 0, 1, m+3) - 2*recurrence_term(x, y, 0, 1, m+1) + recurrence_term(x, y, 0, 1, m)
    return abs(c0) < 1e-12 and abs(c1) < 1e-12

print("Enumerating (x,y,m) with x,y in [-3..3], m in [0..5], checking condition:")
for x in range(-3,4):
    for y in range(-3,4):
        for m in range(6):
            if condition_holds(x, y, m):
                print(f"x={x}, y={y}, m={m} satisfies a(m+3)-2a(m+1)+a(m)=0 for all a0,a1")
