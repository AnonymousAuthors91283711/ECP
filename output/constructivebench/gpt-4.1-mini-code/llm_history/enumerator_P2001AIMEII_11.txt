Below is a Python program that enumerates all triples \((w, l, t)\) with \(w + l + t = 6\) and \(w > l\), computes the multinomial coefficient \(\frac{6!}{w!l!t!}\) multiplied by \((\frac{1}{3})^{w+l+t} = (1/3)^6\), and prints each term. It then sums these to approach the probability value as a fraction and decimal approximation. This helps conjecture the exact simplified fraction and verify correctness.

```python
from math import factorial
from fractions import Fraction

def multinomial_coefficient(w, l, t):
    return factorial(w + l + t) // (factorial(w) * factorial(l) * factorial(t))

def main():
    outcomes = 6
    p = Fraction(1, 3)
    total = Fraction(0, 1)

    print("Enumerating valid triples (w, l, t) with w + l + t = 6 and w > l:")
    for w in range(outcomes + 1):
        for l in range(outcomes + 1):
            t = outcomes - w - l
            if t < 0:
                continue
            if w > l:
                coeff = multinomial_coefficient(w, l, t)
                term = coeff * (p ** outcomes)
                total += term
                print(f"w={w}, l={l}, t={t}, coeff={coeff}, term={term}")

    print("\nSum of all terms (probability) as fraction:")
    print(total)
    print("Decimal approximation:")
    print(float(total))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
