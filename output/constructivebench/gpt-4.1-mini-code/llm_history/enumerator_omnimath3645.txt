[write_program]
The problem defines a sequence \( x(n) \) with initial values \( x(1)=19, x(2)=95 \), and for \( n > 1 \),
\[
x(n+2) = \mathrm{lcm}(x(n+1), x(n)) + x(n).
\]
We need to understand the behavior of this sequence and in particular study \(\gcd(x(1995), x(1996))\).

I'll write a program to:
- Generate the sequence \( x(n) \) for small \( n \).
- Compute \(\gcd(x(n), x(n+1))\) for various \( n \) to observe a pattern.
- Print out early values and some gcd values to conjecture the form of the gcd at large \( n \).

Since the values will grow quickly, I will run it up to a feasible small \( n \), like 15-20, to observe patterns.

```python
import math

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)

def generate_sequence(n_max):
    x = [0, 19, 95]  # 1-based indexing: x[1]=19, x[2]=95
    for n in range(2, n_max):
        val = lcm(x[n], x[n-1]) + x[n-1]
        x.append(val)
        print(f"x({n+1}) = {val}")
    return x

def gcd_pairs(x):
    for n in range(1, len(x) - 1):
        g = math.gcd(x[n], x[n+1])
        print(f"gcd(x({n}), x({n+1})) = {g}")

def main():
    print("Generating sequence up to n=15:")
    x = generate_sequence(15)
    print("\nComputing gcds of consecutive terms:")
    gcd_pairs(x)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This will print terms and gcds for \( n \leq 15 \). By observing these, you could conjecture the exact gcd value at large \( n \), such as \( n=1995 \).
