The problem involves finding a natural number \( d \) such that for the arithmetic sequence \( a_n = 10 + (n - 1)d \), the conditions \( a(a(2)) = 100 \) and then evaluating \( a(a(a(3))) \) hold. We want to enumerate possible values of \( d \), find \( a(a(a(3))) \), and observe values to conjecture the answer.

```python
# Enumerate values of d to satisfy a(a(2)) = 100 for a_n = 10 + (n-1)*d,
# then print a(a(a(3))) for each such d.

def a(n, d):
    return 10 + (n - 1)*d

print("Enumerating d such that a(a(2)) = 100:")
for d in range(1, 50):  # Arbitrarily chosen limit for d
    inner = a(2, d)
    val = a(inner, d)
    if val == 100:
        # Condition satisfied, now compute a(a(a(3)))
        triple = a(a(3, d), d)
        triple_val = a(triple, d)
        print(f"d={d}, a(a(a(3))) = {triple_val}")
```
