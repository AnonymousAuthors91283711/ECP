Ground Truth Answer: 1/4
Proposed Answer: 12 / 48
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer 12/48 simplifies to 1/4, which matches the ground truth answer. The calculations are equivalent:
- sayDislikeFromLike = 0.2 * 60 = 12
- sayDislikeFromDislike = 0.9 * 40 = 36
- totalSayDislike = 12 + 36 = 48
- Fraction = 12/48 = 1/4
