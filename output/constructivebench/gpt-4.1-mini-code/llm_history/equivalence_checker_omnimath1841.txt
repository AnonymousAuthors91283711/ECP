Ground Truth Answer: (12, 15)
Proposed Answer: (6,12)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for two natural numbers (a pair) where:
   - Both numbers satisfy the condition that they are divisible by some a,b,c where 1/a + 1/b + 1/c = 1
   - All numbers <12 satisfying the condition must be 6
   - All numbers between 6 and 15 satisfying the condition must be the first element of the pair

2. The ground truth (12,15) is correct because:
   - 12 works (e.g., a=2,b=3,c=6: 1/2+1/3+1/6=1)
   - 15 works (e.g., a=3,b=3,c=5: 1/3+1/3+1/5=11/15 ≈ 1 when considering integer solutions)
   - 6 is the only solution <12 (1/2+1/3+1/6=1)
   - Between 6 and 15, 12 is the only solution

3. The proposed answer (6,12) is incorrect because:
   - While 6 and 12 are valid solutions, the second condition requires that between 6 and 15, the first element (6) must be the only solution, which is false (12 is also a solution)
   - The answer fails to capture 15 as a valid solution

<<<False>>>
