The problem involves evaluating the floor of the base-4 logarithm of the sum \(1 + \sum_{i=0}^{8640} 2^i\). We can enumerate partial sums and check powers of 4 to approximate the logarithm's floor value. The sum is a geometric series, so directly compute and then determine the floor of its log base 4.

```python
# Enumerate to find floor(log_4(1 + sum_{i=0}^{8640} 2^i))

def main():
    # Geometric sum S = 2^(8641) -1, so total = 1 + S = 2^(8641)
    n = 8640
    total = 1 + (2**(n+1) - 1)  # = 2^(8641)

    # Since total = 2^(8641), compute log_4(total) = log_4(2^(8641)) = 8641 * log_4(2)
    # Note log_4(2) = 1/2, so log_4(total) = 8641/2 = 4320.5
    # floor is 4320

    print(f"Parameters: n = {n}")
    print(f"Total sum: 1 + sum of 2^i from i=0 to {n} = {total}")
    print("log_4(total) = 8641/2 = 4320.5")
    print("Floored value:", 8641//2)  # Using integer division for floor

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
