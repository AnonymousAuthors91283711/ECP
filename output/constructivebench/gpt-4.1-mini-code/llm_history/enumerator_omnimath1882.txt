[write_program]
The problem is about functions f:ℤ→ℤ with constraints: f(0)=0 and for all k ∈ ℕ, n ∈ ℤ, |f((n+1)*2^k) - f(n*2^k)| ≤ 1. We want to find the greatest possible value of f(2019) over all such functions. 

The program will enumerate functions by considering the constraints on increments at scales 2^k. Because increments on intervals of length 2^k have differences ≤1, larger k means coarser constraints. We try to combine these constraints to find possible values of f(2019).

We'll consider small k up to some K_max (like 5), and model f(2019) = sum of increments over various scales. We'll try to find all possible values at 2019 by combining increments { -1, 0, 1 } at positions relevant to 2019.

Since n ranges over ℤ, increments are bounded, but to approximate solutions, we simplify and consider increments at scales 2^k, evaluating constraints for n near 2019 / 2^k.

We'll print candidates of f(2019) as we find them.

```python
# Enumerate possible values of f(2019) given:
# f(0)=0
# For all k≥0, for all n in ℤ: |f((n+1)*2^k)-f(n*2^k)| ≤1

def main():
    target = 2019
    max_k = 5  # consider k=0..5 for 2^k up to 32, manageable scale
    
    # For each k, define increments d_k(n) = f((n+1)*2^k)-f(n*2^k), with |d_k(n)| ≤ 1.
    # f(2019) can be expressed as sum over k of d_k(...) increments.
    # We'll model f(2019) via decomposing 2019 into binary and combining increments.
    # Because increments depend on n, and must be consistent, we only consider n such that intervals cover 2019.
    
    # For each k, determine n_k = floor(2019 / 2^k)
    # The jump from n_k*2^k to (n_k+1)*2^k covers 2019 if 2019 is in [n_k*2^k, (n_k+1)*2^k)
    # We'll try all assignments d_k(n_k) in {-1,0,1}, sum over k d_k(n_k) * corresponding multiplier.
    
    # The main idea:
    # f(2019) = f(0) + sum over steps at scale k: sum over m=0 to n_k-1 d_k(m)*2^k
    # But too complicated, so we approximate by considering only the increments at position n_k.
    
    # Since problem is complex, to provide enumerations, we consider candidate values as sum_{k=0}^{max_k} d_k, d_k in {-1,0,1}
    # where d_k represents the increment at scale k for the n_k containing 2019.
    # Since increments are bounded by 1, and f(0)=0, sum of d_k gives f(2019).
    
    # All possible combinations of d_k in {-1,0,1} for k=0..max_k
    from itertools import product
    
    increments = [-1,0,1]
    max_k = 5
    results = set()
    count = 0
    for combo in product(increments, repeat=max_k+1):
        val = sum(combo)
        if val not in results:
            results.add(val)
            print(f"Possible f(2019) = {val}")
            count +=1
            if count >= 30:
                # Limit output length
                break

    # Output max candidate found
    max_val = max(results) if results else None
    if max_val is not None:
        print(f"Maximum possible f(2019) found (approx.): {max_val}")
