The problem looks like it involves summing over integers n, where for each term you use the reciprocal of the "closest to sqrt(n+1)" value, presumably some integer or rational close to sqrt(n+1). To help conjecture the sum, let's enumerate values for small n, print each term exactly (as a rational), and sum them progressively.

Given the sum is over n from 0 to 2009 (2010 terms), and (1 / closest_to_sqrt(n+1)), I will:
- Define closest_to_sqrt(k) as the integer closest to sqrt(k).
- Enumerate n from 0 to 19 (small sample for efficiency and output limit),
- For each compute the term 1 / closest integer to sqrt(n+1),
- Print terms and partial sums.

Then I will do the full range 0 to 2010 to find approximate sum.

This way we get exact rationals and approximate total, assisting in conjecturing.

```python
from math import sqrt

def closest_to_sqrt(k: int) -> int:
    root = sqrt(k)
    lower = int(root)
    upper = lower + 1
    # Decide which integer is closer
    if abs(root - lower) <= abs(root - upper):
        return lower
    else:
        return upper

def print_fraction(num: int, denom: int):
    # Print fraction in simplest form if denom != 1
    if denom == 1:
        print(f"1/{num} = {1/num:.6f}")
    else:
        val = denom / num
        print(f"1/{num} = {val:.6f}")

def main():
    print("Sample enumeration for n in 0..19:")
    total = 0.0
    for n in range(20):
        k = n + 1
        c = closest_to_sqrt(k)
        val = 1 / c
        print(f"n={n}, k={k}, closest_to_sqrt={c}, term=1/{c}={val:.6f}")
        total += val
    print(f"Partial sum for n=0..19 = {total:.6f}")

    print("\nFull sum for n in 0..2009 (2010 terms):")
    total_full = 0.0
    counts = {}  # Count how many times each closest integer appears
    for n in range(2010):
        k = n + 1
        c = closest_to_sqrt(k)
        total_full += 1 / c
        counts[c] = counts.get(c, 0) + 1
    # Print counts for insight
    for c in sorted(counts):
        print(f"closest value {c} appears {counts[c]} times")
    print(f"Sum total â‰ˆ {total_full:.6f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
