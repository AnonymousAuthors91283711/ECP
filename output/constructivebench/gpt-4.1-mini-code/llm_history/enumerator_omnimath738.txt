The problem involves an \( 8 \times 8 \) matrix \( M \) of real numbers with the constraint \( M_{ij} \geq \max(i+1, j+1) \), where \( i, j \) are zero-based indices (from \( 0 \) to \( 7 \)). The goal is to understand the minimal possible sum of all entries \( \sum_{i=0}^7 \sum_{j=0}^7 M_{ij} \) under these constraints. The minimal sum should occur when all entries are exactly at their minimal bound \(\max(i+1, j+1)\).

To assist in conjecturing the minimal sum, the Python program will:
- Enumerate the matrix entries \( M_{ij} = \max(i+1, j+1) \).
- Compute the sum of all these minimal values explicitly.
- Print the parameters and result.

This will verify the minimal sum hypothesis by exact formula evaluation.

```python
# Enumerate possible M[i][j] values given M[i][j] >= max(i+1,j+1),
# focus on minimal sum where M[i][j] = max(i+1,j+1).

def main():
    n = 8  # matrix size
    print(f"Matrix size: {n}x{n}")
    # Build minimal matrix using the given constraint
    M = [[max(i+1, j+1) for j in range(n)] for i in range(n)]
    # Stream printing all entries exactly
    print("Matrix entries M[i][j] = max(i+1, j+1):")
    for i in range(n):
        row = " ".join(str(M[i][j]) for j in range(n))
        print(f"Row {i}: {row}")
    # Compute sum over all entries
    total_sum = sum(sum(row) for row in M)
    print(f"Sum of all M[i][j]: {total_sum}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
