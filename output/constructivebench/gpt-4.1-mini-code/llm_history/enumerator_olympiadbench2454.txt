The problem seems to involve two dice with faces numbered 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13. We want to find the probability that the sum of the numbers on the two dice is prime. The program below enumerates all pairs, calculates their sums, checks primality, and prints the prime sums and their probability.

```python
# Two dice faces as given
faces = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2: return False
    if n == 2: return True
    if n % 2 == 0: return False
    # Check divisors up to sqrt(n)
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5)+1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

outcomes = []
prime_sums = []
for a in faces:
    for b in faces:
        s = a + b
        outcomes.append(s)
        if is_prime(s):
            print(f"Prime sum found: {s}")
            prime_sums.append(s)

total = len(outcomes)
prime_count = len(prime_sums)

print(f"Total outcomes: {total}")
print(f"Number of prime sums: {prime_count}")
# Print exact fraction probability
from fractions import Fraction
prob = Fraction(prime_count, total)
print(f"Probability (as fraction): {prob}")
print(f"Probability (decimal approx): {float(prob):.6f}")
```
