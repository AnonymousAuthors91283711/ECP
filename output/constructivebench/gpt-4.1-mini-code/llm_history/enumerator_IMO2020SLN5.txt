The problem involves finding all functions \( f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N} \) satisfying
- \( f(xy) = f(x) + f(y) \),
- not all zero,
- and the set of \( n \) such that \( f(k) = f(n-k) \) for all \( k < n \) is infinite.

The characterization involves primes \( p \) and constants \( c \), with an explicit formula \( IMO2020SLN5\_answer(p,c) \).

We will try to guess the form of \( f \) by enumerating examples. The key functional equation suggests \( f \) behaves like a logarithm (additive on multiplication). The symmetry condition on infinitely many \( n \) is special.

We will enumerate pairs \((p,c)\) for small primes \(p\) and integers \(c\), define \( f \) accordingly, and check the symmetry condition for initial \( n \).

```python
import math

# Check primes up to max_p
def is_prime(x):
    if x < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(math.isqrt(x)) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Candidate functions: f(n) = c * v_p(n), where v_p(n) = exponent of prime p in n
def v_p(n, p):
    if n == 0:
        return None  # undefined exponent for 0
    cnt = 0
    while n % p == 0 and n > 0:
        n //= p
        cnt += 1
    return cnt

# Check symmetry condition for a given f and n: f(k) == f(n-k) for all 1 <= k < n
def check_symmetry(f, n):
    for k in range(1, n):
        if f(k) != f(n - k):
            return False
    return True

def main():
    max_p = 11  # small primes to check
    candidates = [(p,c) for p in range(2, max_p+1) if is_prime(p) for c in range(1,4)]
    for p,c in candidates:
        def f(n):
            if n == 0:
                return 0
            return c * v_p(n, p)

        # We will try to find n up to 50 with symmetry
        symmetric_ns = []
        for n in range(2, 51):
            if check_symmetry(f, n):
                print(f"p={p}, c={c}, symmetric n={n} with f(k)=c*v_p(k,p)")
                symmetric_ns.append(n)

        # Output summary for this candidate
        if len(symmetric_ns) >= 5:  # heuristic: infinite shape if many symmetric n found
            print(f"Candidate p={p}, c={c} has many symmetric n: {symmetric_ns}")
