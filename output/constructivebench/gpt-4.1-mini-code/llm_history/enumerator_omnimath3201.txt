[write_program]
This problem seems to be asking to evaluate the expression \(\frac{50 \times 76 - 40 \times 80}{50 - 40}\) and state it as a real number. We can write a Python program to enumerate possible answers by computing the numerator and denominator explicitly and then calculate the fraction exactly as a rational number, then as a decimal.

```python
# Enumerate numerator and denominator values, then compute and print the fraction
def main():
    numerator = 50 * 76 - 40 * 80
    denominator = 50 - 40
    print(f"Numerator = {numerator}")
    print(f"Denominator = {denominator}")
    # Exact rational value
    print(f"Exact fraction = {numerator}/{denominator}")
    # Decimal approximation
    approx = numerator / denominator
    print(f"Decimal approximation = {approx}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
