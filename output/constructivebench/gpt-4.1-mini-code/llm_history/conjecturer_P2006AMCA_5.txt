  davePayment - dougPayment = P2006AMCA_5_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: total_slices=8, plain_cost=8, anchovy_cost=2
Dave plain slices: 0, Dave payment: 10.000, Doug payment: 4.000, Difference: 6.000
Dave plain slices: 1, Dave payment: 11.000, Doug payment: 3.000, Difference: 8.000
Dave plain slices: 2, Dave payment: 12.000, Doug payment: 2.000, Difference: 10.000
Dave plain slices: 3, Dave payment: 13.000, Doug payment: 1.000, Difference: 12.000
Dave plain slices: 4, Dave payment: 14.000, Doug payment: 0.000, Difference: 14.000. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<14>>> 
Explanation: The difference is maximized when Dave eats 4 plain slices, corresponding to the enumerated max difference 14.
