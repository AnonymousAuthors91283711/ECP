[write_program]
The problem seems to involve a function olympiadbench2904_answer from pairs of rational numbers to a rational number, with a specific theorem stating that for inputs A=1/9 and B=1/25, the function value is 3750. We don't know the function definition.

I will write a Python program that tries small rational values near 1/9 and 1/25, evaluating some candidate expressions to potentially guess the formula or generate candidates and check whether it equals 3750 for A=1/9 and B=1/25.

Since the original problem and function are not defined, I will set the program to enumerate pairs of rationals (a,b) near (1/9, 1/25), compute some rational expressions, and print those evaluations. This might help conjecture the formula and verify if 3750 is a special value.

I'll generate pairs a = p/q and b = r/s with small denominators q,s <= 10, and compute some forms like (1/a)/(1/b), or a formula involving products and inverses.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Enumerate small rationals near 1/9 and 1/25:
target_A = Fraction(1,9)
target_B = Fraction(1,25)

# We'll try nearby fractions q in 7..11 denominators
denom_range = range(7,12)

print("Enumerate rational pairs (A,B) near (1/9,1/25) and compute candidates:")

def candidates(a,b):
    # Generate candidate expressions that are simple rational functions of a,b
    # e.g. product inverses, sum inverses, scaled versions
    exprs = []
    # just for sample: (1/a - 1/b), (1/(a*b)), (a*b), (a+b), (a/(b)), (b/(a))
    try:
        exprs.append(("1/a - 1/b", 1/a - 1/b))
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        pass
    try:
        exprs.append(("1/(a*b)", 1/(a*b)))
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        pass
    exprs.append(("a*b", a*b))
    exprs.append(("a+b", a+b))
    try:
        exprs.append(("a/b", a/b))
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        pass
    try:
        exprs.append(("b/a", b/a))
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        pass
    # try squared difference reciprocal
    try:
        val = 1/((a - b)**2)
        exprs.append(("1/(a-b)^2", val))
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        pass
    return exprs
