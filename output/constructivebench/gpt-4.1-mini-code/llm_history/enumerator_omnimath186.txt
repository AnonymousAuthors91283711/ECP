[write_program]
The problem statement here is incomplete, only showing an abstraction with no concrete math problem specified. Therefore, I'll provide a template Python enumerator that sets up a routine to enumerate possible values for typical high-school competition math sets (like sums, products, or solutions to Diophantine equations) for small parameters. 

Since no problem details are given, I assume a general approach: enumerate integer triples (a,b,c) from 1 to 10, compute some function f(a,b,c), and print results while filtering or searching for extremal values.

This template can be updated once the explicit math problem is known.

```python
# Enumerate integer triples (a,b,c) with 1 <= a,b,c <= 10
# Example function: check a+b+c == 12, and print these triples
# This assists in conjecturing properties or extremal values.

MAX_VAL = 10

def f(a, b, c):
    # Placeholder for the function or property to check
    return a + b + c

def main():
    target_sum = 12
    candidates = []
    print(f"Enumerating triples (a,b,c) with sum = {target_sum}")
    for a in range(1, MAX_VAL +1):
        for b in range(1, MAX_VAL +1):
            for c in range(1, MAX_VAL +1):
                val = f(a,b,c)
                if val == target_sum:
                    print(f"Found triple: a={a}, b={b}, c={c} with sum={val}")
                    candidates.append((a,b,c))
    print(f"Total candidates found: {len(candidates)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
