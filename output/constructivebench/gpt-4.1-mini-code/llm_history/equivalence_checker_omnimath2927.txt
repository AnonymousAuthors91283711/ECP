abbrev omnimath2927_answer : ‚Ñù := sorry
theorem omnimath2927 :
  4 + 3 / 10 + 9 / 1000 = omnimath2927_answer :=
sorry

Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: 4.309
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer 4.309 is exactly equal to the expression 4 + 3/10 + 9/1000 when calculated:
4 + 0.3 + 0.009 = 4.309
The ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (a placeholder in Lean), but the proposed answer correctly computes the given expression. Therefore, the answers are equivalent.
