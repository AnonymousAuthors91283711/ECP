The problem involves expressing \(\sqrt{7 + \sqrt{48}}\) in the form \(m + \sqrt{n}\) where \(m\) and \(n\) are positive integers, then finding \(m^2 + n^2\). We enumerate small positive integers \(m, n\) to find candidates that satisfy:
\[
\sqrt{7 + \sqrt{48}} = m + \sqrt{n}.
\]
Squaring both sides leads to:
\[
7 + \sqrt{48} = m^2 + n + 2m\sqrt{n}.
\]
Matching the rational and irrational parts:
\[
m^2 + n = 7,
\]
\[
2m \sqrt{n} = \sqrt{48}.
\]
Square the second equation:
\[
4m^2 n = 48 \implies m^2 n = 12.
\]
We enumerate \(m,n \in \mathbb{N}^+\), with \(m^2 + n = 7\) and \(m^2 n = 12\), then output candidate \((m,n)\) and \(m^2 + n^2\).

```python
# Enumerate positive integers m,n to solve:
# m^2 + n = 7 and m^2 * n = 12
# Then print m^2 + n^2.

def main():
    print("Enumerating candidates for m,n >0:")
    for m in range(1, 10):
        m2 = m * m
        n = 7 - m2
        if n <= 0:
            continue
        if m2 * n == 12:
            val = m2 + n * n
            print(f"m={m}, n={n}, m^2+n^2={val}")
    print("Answer: m^2 + n^2 =", val)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
