The problem is about finding the minimum number \( n \) such that there's a sequence of length \( n+1 \) of permutations of the list \([16,15,\dots,1]\) to \([1,2,\dots,16]\), where each step is obtained by swapping two adjacent elements in the next permutation.

We can model this as sorting the list with adjacent swaps, and \( n \) is the minimal number of swaps needed to transform the reversed list into the sorted list.

Since the initial list is reversed, the number of inversions is maximal, equal to \( \binom{16}{2} = 120 \), and it is well-known that the minimal number of adjacent swaps to sort a reversed list is exactly this number of inversions.

I will write a Python program to enumerate, for smaller \( n \), the minimal number of swaps required to sort reversed lists of differing sizes \( N \in \{2,3, \dots,6\} \) so the speed is manageable and outputs remain concise. This helps conjecture the minimal \( n \) for \( N=16 \).

```python
# Enumerate minimal number of adjacent swaps to sort reversed list of size N
# Output includes N, inverted list, minimal swaps (=inversions), and confirm sequence length

from collections import deque

def swap_adjacent(l, k):
    l = list(l)
    l[k], l[k+1] = l[k+1], l[k]
    return tuple(l)

def minimal_adj_swaps(n):
    start = tuple(range(n, 0, -1))
    target = tuple(range(1, n+1))
    if start == target:
        return 0
    visited = {start:0}
    queue = deque([start])
    while queue:
        curr = queue.popleft()
        dist = visited[curr]
        if curr == target:
            return dist
        for i in range(n-1):
            nxt = swap_adjacent(curr, i)
            if nxt not in visited:
                visited[nxt] = dist + 1
                queue.append(nxt)

print("Enumerating minimal adjacent swaps for N=2..6")
for N in range(2,7):
    start = tuple(range(N,0,-1))
    minimal = minimal_adj_swaps(N)
    print(f"N = {N}, reversed = {start}, minimal swaps = {minimal}")
# For N=16, minimal swaps = 120 (confirm by combinatorial formula)
print("For N=16, reversed list inversion count = 120 (known formula for max inversions)")

```

This code enumerates minimal adjacent swaps required for N=2 to 6 and confirms for N=16 by the known formula. It streams partial results immediately on finding minimal swaps for each N.
