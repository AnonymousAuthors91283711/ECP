The problem is about finding the least natural number \( n \) such that there exist \( r, y, b \in \mathbb{N} \) with \( r \leq 10, y \leq 7, b \leq 3 \) satisfying:
\[
(10 - r) = (7 - y) = (3 - b) \quad \text{and} \quad n = (10 - r) + (7 - y) + (3 - b)
\]

From the equalities, let \( k = 10-r = 7-y = 3-b \). Since \( r,y,b \) are bounded, their values imply bounds on \( k \):
- \( r \leq 10 \Rightarrow 10 - r \geq 0 \Rightarrow k \geq 0 \)
- \( y \leq 7 \Rightarrow 7 - y \geq 0 \Rightarrow k \geq 0 \)
- \( b \leq 3 \Rightarrow 3 - b \geq 0 \Rightarrow k \geq 0 \)

Also, since \( r,y,b \geq 0 \), 
- \( k = 10-r \leq 10 \)
- \( k = 7 - y \leq 7 \)
- \( k = 3 - b \leq 3 \)

So \( k \) must be between 0 and 3 (minimum upper bound).

Then \( n = k + k + k = 3k \), for \( k = 0,1,2,3 \).

We must find all \( k \) for which valid \( (r,y,b) \) exist with given bounds:
- \( r = 10 - k \)
- \( y = 7 - k \)
- \( b = 3 - k \)

Check that these \( r,y,b \) are natural numbers in the allowed ranges, which they will be for \( k=0,1,2,3 \).

This program enumerates all such candidates, prints each \( n=3k \) with parameters used, and reports the minimum \( n \).

```python
# Enumerates n = (10 - r) + (7 - y) + (3 - b) where (10-r) = (7-y) = (3-b) = k,
# and r ≤ 10, y ≤ 7, b ≤ 3, r,y,b ≥ 0.

def main():
    max_r, max_y, max_b = 10,7,3
    candidates = []
    # k ranges from 0 to min(10,7,3) = 3
    for k in range(4):
        r = 10 - k
        y = 7 - k
        b = 3 - k
        # Check validity
        if 0 <= r <= max_r and 0 <= y <= max_y and 0 <= b <= max_b:
            n = 3 * k
            print(f"Found n={n} with k={k}, r={r}, y={y}, b={b}")
            candidates.append(n)
    if candidates:
        min_n = min(candidates)
        print(f"Minimum n found: {min_n}")
    else:
        print("No valid n found")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
