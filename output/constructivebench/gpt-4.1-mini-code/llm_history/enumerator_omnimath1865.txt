The problem considers natural numbers \( n > 0 \) such that the expression 
\[ m = 9 \sqrt{n} + 4 \sqrt{n+2} - 3 \sqrt{n+16} \]
is an integer (where \( m \in \mathbb{Z} \)). We want to find all such \( n \) and sum them up.

This sum is what `omnimath1865_answer` should be assigned to.

To investigate, we can enumerate \( n \) starting from 1 up to some reasonable threshold (e.g., 1000). For each \( n \), we compute the value of 
\[ 9 \sqrt{n} + 4 \sqrt{n+2} - 3 \sqrt{n+16} \]
and check if it is very close to an integer (within a tiny epsilon, since floating point might be used).

Print each \( n \) and the corresponding \( m \) when \( m \) is an integer.

This way we get candidate \( n \) values, and then finally sum all such \( n \).

```python
import math

def is_int_close(x, eps=1e-9):
    return abs(x - round(x)) < eps

def main():
    limit = 1000
    candidates = []
    for n in range(1, limit+1):
        val = 9*math.sqrt(n) + 4*math.sqrt(n+2) - 3*math.sqrt(n+16)
        if is_int_close(val):
            m = round(val)
            print(f"n={n}, m={m}")
            candidates.append(n)
    if candidates:
        total = sum(candidates)
        print(f"Sum of all such n: {total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
