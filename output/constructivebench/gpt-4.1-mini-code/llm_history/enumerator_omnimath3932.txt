The problem asks to find all triples of positive integers (x, y, z) satisfying the system:
x² = 2(y + z)
x⁶ = y⁶ + z⁶ + 31(y² + z²)

We will enumerate positive integers x, y, z with moderate bounds and print all triples meeting the conditions exactly.

```python
# Enumerate positive integer triples (x,y,z) satisfying
# x^2 = 2(y+z) and x^6 = y^6 + z^6 + 31(y^2+z^2)
# Print each found triple immediately.

def main():
    max_x = 30  # upper bound for x to keep runtime reasonable
    for x in range(1, max_x + 1):
        x2 = x * x
        # y+z = x^2 / 2 must be integer
        if x2 % 2 != 0:
            continue
        s = x2 // 2
        # y,z positive, y+z = s
        for y in range(1, s):
            z = s - y
            if z <= 0:
                continue
            lhs = x**6
            rhs = y**6 + z**6 + 31 * (y**2 + z**2)
            if lhs == rhs:
                print(f"x={x}, y={y}, z={z}")
    print("Enumeration complete")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
