abbrev omnimath3443_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath3443 : 
  3/4 + 4/omnimath3443_answer = 1 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating rational x = p/q with |p| <= 20, 1 <= q <=10, satisfying 3/4 + 4/x = 1
x = 16 satisfies 3/4 + 4/x = 1
Minimum positive solution found: x = 16. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
<<<16>>>
