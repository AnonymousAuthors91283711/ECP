The provided problem involves studying sequences \(a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}\) for which there exists a polynomial \(P\) of degree \(k\) with nonnegative coefficients (except possibly the leading one) satisfying:

\[
P(a(n)) = \prod_{i=0}^{k-1} a(n+1+i)
\]

for each natural number \(n\), where \(k \geq 2\).

Our goal is to experimentally enumerate sequences \(a\) and check such polynomial relations for small values of \(k\) and small values of inputs \(a(n)\).

We will:

- Select small \(k\) (e.g., 2 and 3).
- Enumerate candidate polynomials \(P = c_k x^k + \dots + c_0\) with nonnegative integer coefficients and degree exactly \(k\), coefficient count is \(k+1\).
- For fixed sequences \(a\) with small values, check whether \(P(a(n)) = \prod_{i=0}^{k-1} a(n+1+i)\) for a range of \(n\).
- Print sequences \(a\) that satisfy such \(P\) for initial \(n\).
- Show the polynomial \(P\) coefficients found.
- This may help conjecture the structure of \(a\) and \(P\).

We limit the search space significantly to keep output short.
