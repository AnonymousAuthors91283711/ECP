Ground Truth Answer: ∏ k in Finset.range 1009, (1 + 1 / (2 * k + 2)) < (50 : ℝ)
Proposed Answer: ∀ n : ℕ, n ≥ 1 → ∃ k : ℕ, k * 2 = n
Let me analyze this carefully.

The ground truth answer is a specific inequality about a product of terms from k=0 to 1008, comparing it to the real number 50.

The proposed answer is a general statement about all natural numbers n ≥ 1 having an even divisor (which is trivially true since n itself could be that k if n is even, or n/2 if n is even, etc.).

These two statements are completely different in nature:
1. One is a concrete numerical inequality
2. The other is an abstract existence claim about natural numbers

There is no meaningful connection between these two statements. The proposed answer doesn't address the problem at all.
