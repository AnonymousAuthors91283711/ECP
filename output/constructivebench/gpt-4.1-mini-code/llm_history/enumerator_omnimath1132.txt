The problem concerns enumerating the number of sets \( s \) of size \( m \), where each element \( t \in s \) is a \( k \)-subset of an \( n \)-element set \( \alpha \). So \( s \subseteq \mathcal{P}_k(\alpha) \), with \(|s|=m\). The count is the number of \( m \)-element subsets of the family of all \( k \)-subsets of an \( n \)-element set.

This is \(\binom{\binom{n}{k}}{m}\), the binomial coefficient of the \(k\)-subset count choose \(m\).

To assist in conjecturing, the program will enumerate values for small \( n, k, m \), print exact integer values immediately, and confirm the combinatorial formula.

```python
from math import comb

# Enumerate small sample parameters
for n in range(1, 7):        # n from 1 to 6
    for k in range(0, n+1):  # k from 0 to n
        total_k_subsets = comb(n, k)
        for m in range(0, total_k_subsets+1):  # possible m up to total subsets
            count = comb(total_k_subsets, m)  # number of m-subsets of k-subsets
            print(f"n={n} k={k} m={m} count={count}")
```
This enumerates all possible values, prints exact binomial coefficients, and shows the cardinality of the set described. The pattern observed strongly supports the binomial formula \(\binom{\binom{n}{k}}{m}\).
