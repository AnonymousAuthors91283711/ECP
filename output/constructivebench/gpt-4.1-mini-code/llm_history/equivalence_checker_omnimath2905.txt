abbrev omnimath2905_answer : â„• := sorry
theorem omnimath2905 :
  (2 * 2 * 3 * 3 * 5 * 6 = 5 * 6 * omnimath2905_answer * omnimath2905_answer) :=
sorry

Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: 6
Let me analyze this problem carefully.

The equation given is:
2 * 2 * 3 * 3 * 5 * 6 = 5 * 6 * omnimath2905_answer * omnimath2905_answer

First, let's simplify both sides:

Left side:
2 * 2 * 3 * 3 * 5 * 6 = 4 * 9 * 5 * 6 = 36 * 30 = 1080

Right side with proposed answer (6):
5 * 6 * 6 * 6 = 30 * 36 = 1080

The proposed answer of 6 makes both sides equal (1080 = 1080). The ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" which typically means it's intentionally left blank in Lean proofs, but the proposed answer correctly satisfies the equation.

<<<True>>>
