abbrev omnimath2997_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath2997 : 
  (8 : ℚ) / (5 + 7 + 8) = omnimath2997_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 2/5
Proposed Answer: 2 / 5
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is evaluating the expression (8 : ℚ) / (5 + 7 + 8)
2. First, we calculate the denominator: 5 + 7 + 8 = 20
3. So the expression simplifies to 8/20
4. This fraction can be reduced by dividing numerator and denominator by 4: 2/5

The ground truth answer is 2/5, and the proposed answer is also 2/5. They are identical.
