Ground Truth Answer: 350
Proposed Answer: 513
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the smallest number N (between 1 and 1024) where the expected number of rounds is less than 2.

2. The expected_rounds function calculates a sum of probabilities over 10 rounds.

3. The ground truth answer is 350, meaning that N=350 is the smallest number where expected_rounds(N) < 2.

4. The proposed answer is 513, which is significantly larger than 350.

Since 513 > 350, if 350 is indeed the smallest N satisfying the condition, then 513 cannot be correct as it's not the least such number. The proposed answer is too large and misses smaller valid solutions.
