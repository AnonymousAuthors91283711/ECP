Ground Truth Answer: fun n => choose n 2 + 1
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => if n = 0 ∨ n = 1 then 0 else 2^(n - 1)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum number of ways to partition a set of n points in ℝ² into two subsets (A,B) using a line (ax + by + c = 0) such that all points in A lie on one side and all in B lie on the other side.

2. The ground truth answer is the combination formula C(n,2) + 1, which is correct because:
   - The maximum number of such partitions equals the maximum number of regions n points can divide the plane into
   - This is given by C(n,2) + 1 (where C(n,2) comes from pairs of points and +1 for the whole plane)

3. The proposed answer gives:
   - 0 for n=0 or n=1 (correct)
   - 2^(n-1) for n≥2 (incorrect)

The proposed answer is wrong because:
- For n=2, ground truth gives C(2,2)+1=2, but proposed gives 2^(1)=2 (matches)
- For n=3, ground truth gives 4, proposed gives 4 (matches)
- For n=4, ground truth gives 7, proposed gives 8 (doesn't match)
- The pattern diverges for n≥4
