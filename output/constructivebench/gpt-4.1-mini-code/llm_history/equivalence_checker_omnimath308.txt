Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (n + 1) / 2
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => if n = 1 then 1 else 2 * n - 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the maximum size of a subset S of integers in [-n, n] where no three elements sum to zero.

2. The ground truth answer suggests the maximum size is (n+1)/2 (integer division).

3. The proposed answer gives a piecewise function: 1 when n=1, otherwise 2n-2.

Let's test some values:
- For n=1: 
  Ground truth: (1+1)/2 = 1
  Proposed: 1
  Match
- For n=2:
  Ground truth: (2+1)/2 = 1
  Proposed: 2*2-2 = 2
  Don't match
- For n=3:
  Ground truth: (3+1)/2 = 2
  Proposed: 2*3-2 = 4
  Don't match

The answers only match at n=1 and diverge for all n>1. The proposed answer grows much faster (linearly with coefficient 2) while the ground truth grows much slower (linearly with coefficient 0.5).
