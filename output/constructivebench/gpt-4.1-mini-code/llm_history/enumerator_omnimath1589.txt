The problem is about finding the minimum real number \(\alpha\) such that there exist \(\beta, \gamma \in \mathbb{R}\) with
\[
\cos \alpha + \cos \beta + \cos \gamma = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad \sin \alpha + \sin \beta + \sin \gamma = 1.
\]

We can try to enumerate values of \(\alpha, \beta, \gamma\) on a fine grid within \([0, 2\pi]\), check the equations, and print values of \(\alpha\) that work. We will use a tolerance to handle floating-point approximations.

Then we output the minimum \(\alpha\) found.

```python
import math

# Check a triple (a,b,c) if it satisfies the conditions within a tolerance
def check(a,b,c, tol=1e-6):
    s1 = math.cos(a)+math.cos(b)+math.cos(c)
    s2 = math.sin(a)+math.sin(b)+math.sin(c)
    return abs(s1 - 1) < tol and abs(s2 - 1) < tol

# We enumerate α, β, γ in 0..2pi by steps of 0.1 radian for efficiency
step = 0.1
candidates = []
alpha_min = None

print("Enumerating possible α satisfying the system for some β, γ:")

alphas = [round(i*step,3) for i in range(int(2*math.pi/step)+1)]
betas = alphas
gammas = alphas

for a in alphas:
    found_for_a = False
    for b in betas:
        for c in gammas:
            if check(a,b,c):
                print(f"α={a:.3f}, β={b:.3f}, γ={c:.3f}")
                if alpha_min is None or a < alpha_min:
                    alpha_min = a
                found_for_a = True
                # Once we find any triple for a, no need to continue with more triples for that α
                break
        if found_for_a:
            break

if alpha_min is not None:
    print(f"Minimum α found: {alpha_min:.3f}")
else:
    print("No α found satisfying the conditions with given discretization.")
```
