The problem looks to enumerate pairs of positive integers (a, b) satisfying 45 * a + b = 2021 and then find the minimum value of a + b for such pairs.

I will:
- iterate over positive integers a starting from 1 so that 45 * a < 2021
- compute b = 2021 - 45 * a
- check if b > 0
- print each candidate sum a + b
- after enumerating all, print minimal sum found

```python
# Enumerate positive integers a,b with 45*a + b = 2021
# Print each a,b and their sum, then print minimal sum found

def main():
    target = 2021
    min_sum = None
    for a in range(1, target // 45 + 1):  # a positive with 45*a < 2021
        b = target - 45 * a
        if b > 0:  # b positive
            s = a + b
            print(f"a={a}, b={b}, sum={s}")
            if min_sum is None or s < min_sum:
                min_sum = s

    print(f"Minimum sum: {min_sum}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
