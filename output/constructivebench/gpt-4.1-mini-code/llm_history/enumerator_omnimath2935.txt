The problem is to find the least natural number n such that 1/2 < n/9. Since n/9 > 1/2, this implies n > 9/2 = 4.5. So we want the smallest integer n > 4.5, which is 5. The program enumerates n and checks if n/9 > 1/2.

```python
# Find the smallest natural number n such that 1/2 < n/9
threshold_num = 1
threshold_den = 2
denominator = 9

print(f"Looking for smallest n with {threshold_num}/{threshold_den} < n/{denominator}")
for n in range(1, denominator + 5):  # Check a few values beyond denominator to be sure
    # Check inequality without floating point: n/denominator > 1/2 <=> 2n > denominator
    if 2 * n > denominator:
        print(f"Candidate n = {n} because {n}/{denominator} > {threshold_num}/{threshold_den}")
        print(f"Least n = {n}")
        break
```
