The problem seems to involve a finite set of 10 points in the plane with a distance function satisfying certain uniqueness and minimality conditions. We want to find the least number k such that there exists a configuration of points where at least k points appear as a unique closest neighbor from some other point. The program will enumerate small test cases with fewer points to gain intuition, printing candidate k values.

```python
from itertools import combinations
import math

# For small n (e.g., 4 to 6 points), enumerate sets of points on a grid
# to check conditions and count points that appear as unique closest neighbor.
# Only print results when conditions hold.

def dist(p1, p2):
    return math.dist(p1, p2)

def all_distances_unique(points):
    dists = {}
    for p1, p2 in combinations(points, 2):
        d = dist(p1, p2)
        if d in dists:
            # Check if pairs are different
            pairs = dists[d]
            if any({p1, p2} != set(pair) for pair in pairs):
                return False
            else:
                pairs.append((p1, p2))
        else:
            dists[d] = [(p1, p2)]
    return True

def symmetric_dist(points):
    # distance symmetric by definition of Euclidean metric
    return True

def unique_closest_neighbor(points):
    # For each p, find the unique closest q != p
    # If no unique closest, return False
    unique_closest = {}
    for p in points:
        distances = [(dist(p,q), q) for q in points if q != p]
        distances.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
        if len(distances) == 0:
            return False
        if len(distances) > 1 and math.isclose(distances[0][0], distances[1][0], rel_tol=1e-9):
            return False  # not unique
        unique_closest[p] = distances[0][1]
    return unique_closest

def count_victims(unique_closest):
    # Points q that appear as a unique closest neighbor of some p (p!=q)
    victims = set(unique_closest.values())
    return len(victims)

# Enumerate small sets of points on a 1D grid to limit complexity,
# then 2D small integer lattice points up to 4 points.
# Print parameters and victims count if all conditions satisfy.

def main():
    print("Testing configurations for n=4 to 6 points")
    for n in range(4,7):
        print(f"n={n}")
        # Generate all sets of n points in [0..3]^2 grid (small)
        coords = [(x,y) for x in range(4) for y in range(4)]
        # To reduce complexity, only consider first 200 combinations
        count = 0
        for points_set in combinations(coords, n):
            count +=1
            if count > 200:
                break
            points = list(points_set)
            # Check all distances unique condition
            if not all_distances_unique(points):
                continue
            # Symmetry holds for Euclidean
            # Check unique closest neighbor for each point
