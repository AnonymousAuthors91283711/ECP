# The problem describes a cubic polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 - a x^2 + b x - a \) with positive \(a,b\),
# and for which \(f(x) = 0\) for all real \(x\). We want to find the least \(a > 0\) for which there exists \(b > 0\) such that \(f(x) = 0\) for all real \(x\).
# This is impossible for "all \(x\)", so presumably a subtlety means all roots of this polynomial are real or something similar.
# The problem likely means: "for all roots \(x\), \(f(x) = 0\) (of course), and the polynomial has three real roots."
# We suspect looking for \(a,b > 0\) such that the cubic is either factorable or has three real roots all positive.
# The code enumerates small integer \(a,b\) values > 0, computes roots of the cubic \(x^3 - a x^2 + b x - a = 0\),
# and prints triples \((a,b)\) with all roots real. Then it prints the minimal such \(a\).
# This helps conjecturing the minimal \(a=3\), and corresponding \(b\).
