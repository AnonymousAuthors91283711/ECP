The problem is to solve for all real x > 0 such that (x/3) + 20 + (x/5) = x. We can write a simple Python program to find all positive real solutions, enumerating over rational candidates and computing exact forms.

```python
# Enumerate possible positive real solutions to the equation:
# (x/3) + 20 + (x/5) = x
# or equivalently:
# (x/3) + 20 + (x/5) - x = 0
# Rearranged and solved exactly.

from fractions import Fraction

# The equation is:
# x/3 + 20 + x/5 = x
# => 20 = x - x/3 - x/5 = x(1 - 1/3 - 1/5) = x(1 - 8/15) = x(7/15)
# => x = 20 * 15 / 7 = 300/7

# We will print candidates near that value, confirm exact solution.

def approx_equal(a, b, tol=1e-9):
    return abs(a - b) < tol

# Enumerate candidates around 300/7 (approx 42.857...)
known_x = Fraction(300,7)

print(f"Trying exact candidate x = {known_x} = {float(known_x)}")
lhs = known_x / 3 + 20 + known_x / 5
rhs = known_x
print(f"LHS = {lhs}, RHS = {rhs}")
if lhs == rhs:
    print(f"Exact solution found: x = {known_x}")

# Try some nearby fractions to see if any other solutions emerge (unlikely)
for num in range(40*7, 46*7):  # around 42.85 *7 = 300, num in [280,322]
    x = Fraction(num,7)
    lhs = x/3 + 20 + x/5
    rhs = x
    if lhs == rhs and x > 0:
        print(f"Exact solution found: x = {x}")

# Also check approximate float values near 42.85
print("Approximate check around 42.8 to 43.0 in increments of 0.01:")
x = 42.8
while x <= 43.0:
    lhs = x/3 + 20 + x/5
    rhs = x
    diff = abs(lhs - rhs)
    if diff < 1e-6:
        print(f"Approximate solution candidate: x â‰ˆ {x:.5f} with difference {diff:.2e}")
    x += 0.01

print(f"Minimum positive solution satisfying equation is x = {known_x} (exact)")
```
