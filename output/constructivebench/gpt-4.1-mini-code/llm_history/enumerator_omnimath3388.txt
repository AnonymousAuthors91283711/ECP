The provided lines define a system of three linear equations in the rational numbers:

p + 3q + r = 3  
p + 2q + 3r = 3  
p + q + r = 2  

We want to enumerate all rational triples (p, q, r) that satisfy this system.

Since this is a linear system of three equations in three unknowns, it should have a unique solution or no solution. The code can enumerate all rational triples with small denominators and numerators to check which satisfy the system, then print those solutions exactly.

To prioritize exact values, we will use Python's fractions.Fraction.

We will try numerator and denominator values for p, q, r with numerators and denominators up to a small limit (e.g., 5), and print those satisfying the system exactly.

Finally, we can identify if there is a unique solution.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Enumerate rational triples (p,q,r) with numerator and denominator up to 5
# that satisfy the system:
# p + 3q + r = 3
# p + 2q + 3r = 3
# p + q + r = 2

max_num = 5
solutions = []

def is_solution(p, q, r):
    return (p + 3*q + r == 3) and (p + 2*q + 3*r == 3) and (p + q + r == 2)

# We'll use denominators from 1 to max_num to construct fractions
denominators = list(range(1, max_num + 1))

print("Enumerating rational solutions with numerators and denominators up to 5:")

for pd in denominators:
    for pn in range(-max_num*pd, max_num*pd +1):  # extended range for numerator
        p = Fraction(pn, pd)
        for qd in denominators:
            for qn in range(-max_num*qd, max_num*qd+1):
                q = Fraction(qn, qd)
                for rd in denominators:
                    for rn in range(-max_num*rd, max_num*rd+1):
                        r = Fraction(rn, rd)
                        if is_solution(p, q, r):
                            sol = (p, q, r)
                            if sol not in solutions:
                                solutions.append(sol)
                                print(f"Solution found: p={p}, q={q}, r={r}")

print("\nSummary of solutions found:")
for sol in solutions:
    print(f"p={sol[0]}, q={sol[1]}, r={sol[2]}")

if solutions:
    # Since linear system should have one solution, select minimal by lex order
    minimal = min(solutions)
    print(f"\nConjectured unique solution: p={minimal[0]}, q={minimal[1]}, r={minimal[2]}")
else:
    print("No solutions found in the enumerated range.")
