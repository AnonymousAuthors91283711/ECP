Ground Truth Answer: (221, 8)
Proposed Answer: (8157, 256)
Let me analyze the equivalence between the proposed answer (8157, 256) and the ground truth answer (221, 8).

First, let's simplify both fractions:
- Ground truth: 221/8 = 27.625
- Proposed: 8157/256 ≈ 31.863

These are clearly different values (27.625 ≠ 31.863), so the answers are not equivalent.

We can also check if one is a scaled version of the other:
221/8 = (8157/256) would require 221*256 = 8*8157
56576 = 65256 which is false.

Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.

<<<False>>>
