The problem asks to find the least integer \( s \) such that there exists a sequence \( x: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z} \) with \( x_0 = 0 \), and for all \( k \ge 1 \), \( |x_k| = |x_{k-1} + 3| \), and \( s = \left| \sum_{k=1}^{2006} x_k \right| \). We want the minimum such \( s \).

This is a sign-choosing problem since the magnitude of \( x_k \) is fixed at \( |x_{k-1} + 3| \), so the absolute values increase deterministically but sign can vary. We need to find sequences \( x \) compatible with the rule and minimize the absolute sum.

We will:
- Enumerate the possibilities for the first few steps (using sign patterns).
- Compute the sums.
- Try sign sequences to minimize absolute sum.
- Use a modest number of steps (e.g., 10) as a sample to conjecture behavior.
- Then extend to 2006 if feasible.

The program enumerates sign sequences and prints candidate sums in absolute values.

```python
# Enumerate sign choices for the sequence x_k where x_0 = 0,
# and for k >=1, |x_k| = |x_{k-1} + 3|.
# We want to find minimum of |sum_{k=1}^n x_k|.
# We use a small n and try all sign possibilities.

def enumerate_candidates(n=10):
    # x_0 = 0
    # For k in 1..n: |x_k| = |x_{k-1} + 3|
    # We'll store all possible x_k with possible signs given x_{k-1}.
    # For each step, possible x_k are: x_{k-1}+3 or -(x_{k-1}+3) if nonzero.
    # We use DFS and keep track of sum.

    results = set()
    from collections import deque

    # Each state: (k, x_{k-1}, sum_so_far)
    queue = deque([(0, 0, 0)])  # k=0, x_0=0, sum=0

    while queue:
        k, prev_x, s = queue.popleft()
        if k == n:
            results.add(abs(s))
            print(f"n={n} sum_abs={abs(s)}")
            continue

        val = prev_x + 3
        # next x_k can be val or -val
        # if val=0 (unlikely), only 0
        for nxt in (val, -val):
            queue.append((k+1, nxt, s + nxt))

def main():
    # Test for n=10, print all sums encountered
    print("Enumerating sums for n=10:")
    enumerate_candidates(10)

    # Try n=5 as well for quicker runs
    print("Enumerating sums for n=5:")
    enumerate_candidates(5)

    main()
