Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (2 * n - 1) / 5
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => (n + 1) / 2
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum number of pairs (a,b) where:
   - All pairs have distinct components (a≠b, a≠d, etc. for any two pairs)
   - a + b ≤ n for each pair
   - All pairs have distinct sums

2. The ground truth answer suggests the maximum number is (2n-1)/5 (integer division)
   - This would give counts like: n=3→1, n=8→3, n=13→5, etc.

3. The proposed answer is (n+1)/2 (integer division)
   - This would give counts like: n=3→2, n=8→4, n=13→7, etc.

The proposed answer is clearly larger than the ground truth for all n ≥ 3. For example:
- At n=3: proposed gives 2 pairs, but you can only have (1,2) as (1,1) and (2,1) would violate distinctness
- At n=8: proposed gives 4, but ground truth gives 3 (e.g., (1,7), (2,6), (3,5))

The proposed answer overcounts by not properly accounting for all the distinctness constraints.
