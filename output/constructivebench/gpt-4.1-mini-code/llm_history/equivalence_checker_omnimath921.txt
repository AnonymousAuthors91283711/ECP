Ground Truth Answer: (16^2014 - 14^2014) / 2
Proposed Answer: 2^(2014 * 4 - 1)
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is counting the number of subsets S of Fin 2014 × Fin 4 where the number of distinct first coordinates in S is odd.

2. The ground truth answer (16^2014 - 14^2014)/2 makes sense because:
   - For each of the 2014 elements in Fin 2014, we have 16 possible subsets of Fin 4 (since |Fin 4| = 4, and 2^4 = 16)
   - We want the count where an odd number of elements have non-empty subsets
   - This can be calculated via inclusion-exclusion as (16^2014 - 14^2014)/2

3. The proposed answer 2^(2014*4-1) = 2^8055 is:
   - Half of the total number of subsets of Fin 2014 × Fin 4 (since 2^(2014*4) would be all subsets)
   - This doesn't account for the condition about odd number of distinct first coordinates
   - The correct count should be much smaller than half of all possible subsets
