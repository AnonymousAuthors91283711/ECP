theorem P2003AIMEII_10 : 
  IsGreatest {s : ℕ | ∃ (a b : ℕ), a + b = s ∧ a - b = 60 ∧ ∃ (k : ℕ), Real.sqrt a + Real.sqrt b = Real.sqrt k ∧ ¬IsSquare k} 
  P2003AIMEII_10_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Searching for s = a + b with a - b = 60
s=100, a=80, b=20, k=180 (not perfect square)
s=156, a=108, b=48, k=300 (not perfect square)
Greatest s found: 156. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<156>>>
