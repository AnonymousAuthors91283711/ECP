Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {x | x = -Real.pi / 4 ∨ x = Real.pi / 4}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer correctly identifies the solutions to the equation within the given domain (-π/2 < x < π/2), but it doesn't explicitly state the domain constraints in the set definition. The solutions x = -π/4 and x = π/4 are indeed correct, but the full answer should include the domain restriction. Therefore, the proposed answer is mostly correct but incomplete.
