Ground Truth Answer: 2004002
Proposed Answer: 2001 * 2002
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves summing an alternating series with quadratic terms from k=0 to k=2000 (since range 2001 gives 0-2000).

2. The ground truth answer is 2004002.

3. The proposed answer is 2001*2002 = 2001*2002 = 2005002 - 2001 = 2003001 (which is incorrect).

4. The correct sum can be computed by pairing terms:
   - The series is (1*2) - (2*3) + (3*4) - ... + (2001*2002)
   - Pairing terms 2 by 2: (1*2 - 2*3) + (3*4 - 4*5) + ... + (1999*2000 - 2000*2001) + 2001*2002
   - Each pair simplifies to -4k-2 where k is the pair index
   - There are 1000 pairs (2000 terms) plus the final 2001*2002 term
   - The sum becomes -4*(0+1+...+999) - 2*1000 + 2001*2002
   - Which simplifies to -4*(999*1000/2) - 2000 + 2001*2002 = 2004002

The proposed answer (2001*2002) is incorrect as it doesn't account for the alternating nature and proper pairing of the series.
