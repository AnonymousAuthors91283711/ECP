The problem is to find the unique natural number \( x \leq 10 \) that satisfies:
\[
3x + 2(10 - x) = 26
\]

We can enumerate \( x \) from 0 to 10, check the equation, and print all solutions, then state the unique answer.

```python
# Enumerate x in [0..10], check equation 3*x + 2*(10 - x) = 26
for x in range(11):
    val = 3*x + 2*(10 - x)  # left side of equation
    if val == 26:
        print(f"x = {x} satisfies 3*{x} + 2*(10 - {x}) = 26")
# Print unique answer explicitly (should be only one)
print("Unique answer found:")
for x in range(11):
    if 3*x + 2*(10 - x) == 26:
        print(f"x = {x}")
        break
```
