The problem asks to find an integer `omnimath2872_answer ≤ 100` such that the set of numbers `n` between 1 and `omnimath2872_answer` inclusive are exactly those that can be expressed as the sum of `m` consecutive integers starting at `k`, with `m ≥ 4`.

In other words, we want all sums of at least 4 consecutive integers, and we want the largest integer `omnimath2872_answer` such that all numbers from 1 to that number inclusive can be represented as such sums.

To explore this, I'll enumerate sums of consecutive integers with length at least 4 for values up to 100 and identify the smallest integer which cannot be represented this way, thus finding the largest integer such that all numbers up to it can be represented.

```python
# enumerate all sums of m consecutive integers for various starts k, lengths m ≥ 4
# Find all numbers ≤ 100 representable as sums of at least 4 consecutive integers
# Then find the largest integer n ≤ 100 such that all numbers 1..n are representable

def main():
    MAX_N = 100
    representable = set()
    # m≥4, k≥0
    # sum of m consecutive integers starting at k is sum_{i=k}^{k+m-1} i = m*(2k + m -1)/2
    for m in range(4, MAX_N+1):
        # For each m, find max k s.t sum ≤ MAX_N
        # sum = m*(2k + m -1)/2 ≤ MAX_N => 2k + m -1 ≤ 2*MAX_N/m => 2k ≤ 2*MAX_N/m - m +1
        max_2k = int(2*MAX_N/m - m +1)
        max_k = max_2k // 2
        for k in range(max_k+1):
            total = m*(2*k + m -1)//2
            if total <= MAX_N:
                representable.add(total)
    # Now find the largest n ≤ MAX_N such that 1..n ⊆ representable
    n = 1
    while n in representable:
        print(f"Representable: {n}")
        n +=1
    # n-1 is the largest such that 1..(n-1) are representable
    print(f"Largest integer such that all numbers 1..n are representable: {n-1}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
