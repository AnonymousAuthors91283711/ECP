[write_program]
The problem is about counting the number of integers \( k \) between 1 and 17 (inclusive) such that

\[
\frac{5 \sin(10k^\circ) - 2}{\sin^2(10k^\circ)} \geq 2.
\]

We enumerate \( k = 1, \ldots, 17 \), evaluate the expression exactly using sine in radians, and check the condition. The program prints all \( k \) satisfying the inequality and the total count.

```python
import math

# Enumerate integers k from 1 to 17 inclusive
count = 0
print("k values (1 to 17) where expression >= 2:")

for k in range(1, 18):
    angle_deg = 10 * k
    angle_rad = math.radians(angle_deg)
    s = math.sin(angle_rad)
    # Avoid division by zero, but sin(10k degrees) won't be zero for k=1..17
    if s == 0:
        continue
    val = (5 * s - 2) / (s * s)
    if val >= 2:
        print(f"k={k}, val={val:.6f}")
        count += 1

print(f"Total count = {count}")
```
