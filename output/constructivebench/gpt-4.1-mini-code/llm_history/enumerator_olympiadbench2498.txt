The problem involves the equation \(\log_2 x - 2 \log_2 y = 2\) with positive real numbers \(x, y\). Reformulating this gives \(y = \sqrt{\frac{x}{4}}\). The Python program will enumerate positive \(x, y\) values to check which satisfy the equation closely, verifying the relationship.

```python
import math

print("Enumerating (x,y) with x,y > 0 satisfying log2(x) - 2*log2(y) = 2 within tolerance")
tol = 1e-9
# Sample x values: powers of 2 from 1 to 16 (to keep output brief)
for i in range(1, 17):
    x = float(i)
    val_log = math.log2(x) - 2 * math.log2(1.0)  # placeholder for y
    # According to equation: log2(x) - 2*log2(y) = 2 => log2(y) = (log2(x) - 2)/2
    logy = (math.log2(x) - 2)/2
    y = 2**logy
    # Verify the equation exactly
    left = math.log2(x) - 2 * math.log2(y)
    if abs(left - 2) < tol:
        print(f"x={x:.5f}, y={y:.5f}, verification log2(x)-2*log2(y)={left:.5f}")
```
