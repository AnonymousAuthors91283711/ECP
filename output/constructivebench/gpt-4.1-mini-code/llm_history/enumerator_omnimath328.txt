[write_program]
The problem concerns a property over triples in finite sequences with certain bounds. We will try small n ≥ 3 and test sequences of positive reals a_i bounded by n times the minimum, to find triples (i,j,k) with distinct indices satisfying the two strict inequalities. The program enumerates sequences with rational values on a grid, checks all triples, and prints which n satisfy the property for all sampled sequences, helping to conjecture the correct omnimath328_answer set.

```python
from itertools import product, combinations

# Check the property for given n and sampled sequences a
def check_property(n, samples=5):
    # We try sequences a with values from 1 to n in increments of 1/(samples-1)
    vals = [1 + (n-1)*i/(samples-1) for i in range(samples)]
    
    # We'll test many sequences a: tuples of length n with values in vals,
    # but with a_i >= 0 (all positive), and a_i <= n * min(a)
    # To avoid infinite loops, try some sequences and if any fails, fail n
    
    # Generate some sample sequences for partial testing
    for a in product(vals, repeat=n):
        if any(x <= 0 for x in a):
            continue
        amin = min(a)
        if any(x > n*amin for x in a):
            continue
        # Check if ∃ distinct i,j,k with inequalities
        found = False
        for i, j, k in combinations(range(n), 3):
            for (x,y,z) in [(i,j,k),(i,k,j),(j,i,k),(j,k,i),(k,i,j),(k,j,i)]:
                if x!=y and y!=z and x!=z:
                    if (a[x] + a[y] > a[z]) and (a[x]**2 + a[y]**2 > a[z]**2):
                        found = True
                        break
            if found:
                break
        if not found:
            print(f"n={n} fails with a={a}")
            return False
    print(f"n={n} passes all sampled sequences")
    return True

def main():
    print("Testing n from 3 to 7 with sample sequences:")
    results = []
    for n in range(3,8):
        print(f"\nTesting n={n}")
        if check_property(n, samples=4):
            results.append(n)
    print("\nConjectured omnimath328_answer contains these n:")
    for r in results:
