This problem involves finding the greatest integer \( M \) such that there exists a positive speed \( v \) where the given time gap formula fits \( M = \lfloor \frac{3600}{\text{timeGap}} \rfloor \). We iterate over possible speeds \( v \), compute \( \lceil v / 15 \rceil \), then the minimum gap and time gap, and finally compute \( M \).

We'll enumerate values of \( v \) in small increments, compute \( M \), and track the maximum found. We'll print each \( M \) as found to see all possible values.

```python
import math

def main():
    print("Enumerating M values for speeds v from 0.1 to 100:")
    max_M = 0
    # step size chosen for balance of speed and precision
    for v_int in range(1, 1001):  # v from 0.1 to 100 in increments of 0.1
        v = v_int / 10
        # Compute minGap = 4 * ceil(v / 15)
        min_gap = 4 * math.ceil(v / 15)
        time_gap = (4 + min_gap) / v
        M = math.floor(3600 / time_gap)
        print(f"v={v:.1f}, minGap={min_gap}, timeGap={time_gap:.4f} => M={M}")
        if M > max_M:
            max_M = M
    print(f"Maximum M found: {max_M}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
