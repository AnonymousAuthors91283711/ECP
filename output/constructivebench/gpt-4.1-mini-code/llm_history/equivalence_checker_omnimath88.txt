Ground Truth Answer: fun k n => n * (3 * k)
Proposed Answer: fun k n => n * (2 * n - 1) / k
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum number m such that there exists a function f from Fin m to subsets of Fin(2n) where:
   - Each f(i) has exactly 2 elements
   - For any subset of size k+1, there are two distinct elements whose images under f are not disjoint

2. The ground truth answer is n * (3 * k), which grows linearly with both n and k.

3. The proposed answer is n * (2 * n - 1) / k, which:
   - Decreases as k increases (counterintuitive for a maximum)
   - Grows quadratically with n (while the ground truth grows linearly)
   - Doesn't match the structure of the problem

The proposed answer is fundamentally different from the ground truth in both its behavior and structure. It's not just a matter of different domains or constraints - the entire functional form is wrong.
