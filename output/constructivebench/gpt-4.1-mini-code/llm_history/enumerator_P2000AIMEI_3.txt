This problem is about finding positive integers \(a, b\) such that \(\gcd(a,b) = 1\) and

\[
\binom{2000}{2} a^{1998} b^2 = \binom{2000}{3} a^{1997} b^3,
\]

which simplifies to

\[
\binom{2000}{2} a = \binom{2000}{3} b.
\]

Given that \(a, b\) are positive and coprime, this becomes a linear integer equation with a ratio constraint. We'll compute \(\binom{2000}{2}\) and \(\binom{2000}{3}\), reduce the equation, find the possible \((a,b)\) pairs with gcd 1, and enumerate candidates, printing them. We'll also print their sum \(a + b\) as the answer candidate.

```python
import math

# Compute binomial coefficients exactly
C_2000_2 = (2000 * 1999) // 2
C_2000_3 = (2000 * 1999 * 1998) // (3 * 2 * 1)

# The equation reduces to:
# C_2000_2 * a = C_2000_3 * b
# => a / b = C_2000_3 / C_2000_2

# Let's find the ratio:
from math import gcd

num = C_2000_3
den = C_2000_2
g = gcd(num, den)
num //= g
den //= g

print(f"Reduced ratio a/b = {num}/{den}")

# Since gcd(a,b)=1 and a/b = num/den, the minimal solution is (a,b) = (num, den).
# Any multiple k*(num, den) also solves ratio but not coprime.
# So only minimal solution is coprime.

a, b = num, den
print(f"Candidate solution: a = {a}, b = {b}, gcd(a,b) = {gcd(a,b)}")
print(f"Sum a + b = {a + b}")
```
