The problem considers expressing the product \(3 \times 3 \times 5 \times 5 \times 7 \times 9\) as \(3 \times 3 \times 7 \times x \times x\) for some natural number \(x\). After simplifying both sides, we want to find all integers \(x\) such that \(x^2 = 5 \times 5 \times 9 = 225\), so \(x = 15\).

The Python program below enumerates possible integer values \(x\) (1 to 30, covering the plausible range), checking if the equality holds. It will print candidates immediately and the final answer.

```python
# Enumerate integer candidates x satisfying 3*3*5*5*7*9 = 3*3*7*x*x

target = 3*3*5*5*7*9  # left side product
base = 3*3*7           # fixed part of right side

# We want to find x where base * x * x == target

print(f"Target product: {target}")
print(f"Fixed base: {base}")

for x in range(1, 31):
    rhs = base * x * x
    if rhs == target:
        print(f"Found exact match: x = {x}")
    elif rhs > target:
        # Since rhs increases quadratically, no need to check further for larger x
        break

print("Enumerated candidates up to 30; the value(s) making the equality hold are above.")
```
