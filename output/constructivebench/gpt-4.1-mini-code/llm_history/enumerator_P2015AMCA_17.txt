The problem counts Boolean functions on an 8-element domain without adjacent 1's, then divides by all Boolean functions (2^8). We want to enumerate the number of 8-length binary strings with no two consecutive 1s, then print the ratio.

```python
def no_consecutive_ones(n):
    # Counts binary strings of length n with no two adjacent 1s using DP
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    dp0, dp1 = 1, 1  # dp0: ending with 0, dp1: ending with 1
    for _ in range(2, n + 1):
        new_dp0 = dp0 + dp1
        new_dp1 = dp0
        dp0, dp1 = new_dp0, new_dp1
    return dp0 + dp1

n = 8
total = 2 ** n
count = no_consecutive_ones(n)
for i in (count, total):
    print(i)
print("Ratio:", f"{count}/{total}", "â‰ˆ", count/total)
```
