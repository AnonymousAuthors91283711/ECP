Ground Truth Answer: 12
Proposed Answer: 2014
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive sequence `a : ℕ → ℝ` with:
   - a(0) = √2
   - a(1) = 2
   - a(n+1) = a(n) * a(n-1)²

2. We're asked to find the smallest positive period p (mod 2014) where the floor of a(m) modulo 2014 repeats every p steps for sufficiently large m.

3. The ground truth answer is 12, which suggests the sequence's floor values modulo 2014 have a period of 12 when m is large enough.

4. The proposed answer is 2014, which would be the maximum possible period since we're working modulo 2014.

Key observations:
- The sequence's behavior modulo 2014 is what matters here
- The ground truth suggests the actual period is much smaller than 2014
- 2014 is too large to be the minimal period (it's the modulus itself)
- The problem asks for the least period, not just any period

Conclusion: The proposed answer (2014) is incorrect as it's not the minimal period. The correct minimal period is 12.
