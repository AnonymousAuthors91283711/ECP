The problem counts integer triples \((x,y,z)\) with \(x+y+z=525\) where \(7\mid x\), \(5\mid y\), and \(3\mid z\). We want to enumerate all such triples that satisfy these divisibility and sum conditions.

We'll iterate over possible multiples of 7 and 5 for \(x\) and \(y\) within reasonable bounds, compute \(z\), and check if \(z\) is divisible by 3 and if the sum condition holds. Each such triple will be printed immediately.

We'll select \(x\) and \(y\) multiples such that \(x,y,z\) are integers and \(x+y+z=525\). Because \(525\) is positive, we can assume \(x,y,z\) in a reasonable range (e.g. \([-525,525]\)).

After enumerating, we print the total count.

```python
# Enumerate (x,y,z) in integers with x+y+z=525, 7|x, 5|y, 3|z.
# Print each triple found and output total count.

def main():
    total = 0
    # x = 7a, y = 5b
    # x in [-525,525], so a in [-75,75]
    # y in [-525,525], so b in [-105,105]
    for a in range(-75, 76):
        x = 7*a
        for b in range(-105, 106):
            y = 5*b
            z = 525 - x - y
            if z % 3 == 0:
                # print each triple immediately
                print(f"(x={x}, y={y}, z={z})")
                total += 1
    print(f"Total number of triples: {total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
