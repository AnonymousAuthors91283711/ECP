This problem studies the number of regions formed by a set of lines: starting with 2 lines that form 4 regions, and then adding 25 lines each intersecting all previous ones. The formula for the number of new regions formed by adding \(n\) lines in general position is \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 1\), but here we verify specifically, starting from 2 lines and adding 25 more.

The Python program below enumerates the number of new regions formed by adding \(n\) lines to 2 initial lines, printing intermediate values for small \(n\), then verifies the formula \(\text{initial_regions} + n(n+3)/2\) for some sample values.

```python
# Enumerate number of regions formed by lines in general position
# starting with 2 lines and 4 regions, adding n lines one-by-one.
# New regions added when adding line k is k + 1 (intersect with previous k lines)
# So total new regions after adding n lines: sum_{k=1}^n (k+1) = n(n+3)/2

def regions_after_adding_lines(initial_lines=2, additional_lines=25):
    initial_regions = 4  # Given for 2 lines
    total_lines = initial_lines + additional_lines
    for n in range(1, additional_lines + 1):
        # Sum of new regions after adding n lines one at a time:
        new_regions = n * (n + 3) // 2
        total_regions = initial_regions + new_regions
        print(f"Adding {n} lines: total regions = {total_regions}")
    # Final answer for 25 additional lines
    total_expected = initial_regions + additional_lines * (additional_lines + 3) // 2
    print(f"Answer for {additional_lines} additional lines: {total_expected}")

    print("Parameters: initial_lines=2, additional_lines=25")
    regions_after_adding_lines()
