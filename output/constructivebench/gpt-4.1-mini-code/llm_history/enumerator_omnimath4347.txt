The problem concerns finding natural numbers \( n \) between 10 and 20 for which there exists \( k \in \mathbb{N} \) such that \( 4k + 5k = n^2 \) and \( n^2 \) is divisible by 9. Note \(4k + 5k = 9k = n^2\), so \(n^2\) must be a multiple of 9, i.e., \(n\) divisible by 3. We'll enumerate suitable \(n\) and check if \(k\) is natural.

```python
# Enumerate n in (10,20), check if n^2 divisible by 9, 9*k=n^2, k natural

def main():
    for n in range(11, 20):
        n2 = n*n
        # Check if n^2 divisible by 9
        if n2 % 9 == 0:
            k = n2 // 9
            # k should be natural (>=0). Here n>10 so k>0.
            print(f"n={n}, k={k}, since 4k+5k=9k=n^2={n2}")
            
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
