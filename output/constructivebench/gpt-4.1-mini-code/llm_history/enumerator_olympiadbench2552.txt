The expression to evaluate is \( \frac{2}{5} + \frac{5}{2} + \frac{1}{2 \times 5} \).
Let's write a Python program to enumerate the terms and sum them exactly as fractions, printing intermediate steps.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Enumerate each term with exact fractions
terms = [Fraction(2, 5), Fraction(5, 2), Fraction(1, 10)]  # since 2*5=10

print("Terms:")
for i, term in enumerate(terms, 1):
    print(f"Term {i}: {term}")

total = sum(terms)
print("Sum of terms:")
print(total)
```
