Ground Truth Answer: {m | m ≠ 1}
Proposed Answer: { m | m ≥ 2 }
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer { m | m ≥ 2 } is very close to the ground truth {m | m ≠ 1}, but not exactly equivalent. The difference is that the proposed answer excludes m = 0 and m = 1, while the ground truth only excludes m = 1. For m = 0, the condition 0 < m in the theorem statement already excludes it, so both answers effectively work for the domain of the theorem. However, strictly speaking, the sets are not identical.
