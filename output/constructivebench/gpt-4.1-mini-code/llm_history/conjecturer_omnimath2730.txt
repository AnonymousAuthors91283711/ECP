noncomputable abbrev omnimath2730_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2730 :
  let pWinAfterWin := 3/4
  let pWinAfterLoss := 1/3
  let pInitial := 1/2
  
  -- Define the probability of winning exactly 3 games before 2 losses
  let p3Wins : ℝ := 
    -- Path 1: WWWL (3 wins then 2nd loss)
    pInitial * pWinAfterWin * pWinAfterWin * (1 - pWinAfterWin) +
    -- Path 2: WWLWL (2 wins, 1 loss, 1 win, then 2nd loss)
    pInitial * pWinAfterWin * (1 - pWinAfterWin) * pWinAfterLoss * (1 - pWinAfterLoss) +
    -- Path 3: WLWWL (1 win, 1 loss, 2 wins, then 2nd loss)
    pInitial * (1 - pInitial) * pWinAfterLoss * pWinAfterWin * (1 - pWinAfterWin) +
    -- Path 4: LWWWL (1 loss, 3 wins, then 2nd loss)
    (1 - pInitial) * pWinAfterLoss * pWinAfterWin * pWinAfterWin * (1 - pWinAfterWin)
  
  p3Wins = omnimath2730_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Sequence: WWW, Probability: 0.28125
Sequence: WWLW, Probability: 0.03125
Sequence: WLWW, Probability: 0.03125
Sequence: LWWW, Probability: 0.09375
Total probability of exactly 3 wins before 2 losses: 0.4375. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
