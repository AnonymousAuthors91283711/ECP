The problem is to find the sum over k = 0 to 100 of floor((2^100) / (2^50 + 2^k)). To conjecture the answer, we first evaluate the floor for each k and sum it up, printing intermediate values. We'll work entirely with integers to avoid floating point errors.

```python
# Enumerate sum of floor((2^100) / (2^50 + 2^k)) for k in [0..100]

def main():
    two_50 = 2 ** 50
    two_100 = 2 ** 100

    total = 0
    for k in range(101):
        denominator = two_50 + (2 ** k)
        quotient = two_100 // denominator
        print(f"k={k}, floor = {quotient}")
        total += quotient

    print(f"Sum = {total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
