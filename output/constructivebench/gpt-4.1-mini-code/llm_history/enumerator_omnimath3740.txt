[write_program]
The problem counts integers \( k \) from 1 to 332 such that the leading digit of \( 2^k \) is 4 in base 10. The program enumerates \( k \) in this range, computes \( 2^k \), extracts the first digit, and checks if it equals 4.

```python
# Enumerate k in [1..332], check if leading digit of 2^k is 4, print all k where true and count total

def leading_digit(n):
    while n >= 10:
        n //= 10
    return n

count = 0
for k in range(1, 333):
    val = 2 ** k
    ld = leading_digit(val)
    if ld == 4:
        print(k)
        count += 1
print("Total count:", count)
```
