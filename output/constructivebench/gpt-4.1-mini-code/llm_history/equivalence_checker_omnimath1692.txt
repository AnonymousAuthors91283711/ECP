Ground Truth Answer: [-7, -7, 18, -7, -7, -7, 18, -7, -7, 18, -7, -7, -7, 18, -7, -7]
Proposed Answer: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, -3, -3, -3, -3]
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a list of integers where:
   - No element is zero
   - Every 7-element sublist has positive sum
   - Every 11-element sublist has negative sum
   - The list should be the greatest possible (likely meaning longest possible)

2. Ground Truth Answer:
   - Length 16
   - Pattern of -7 and 18 values
   - Carefully balanced to meet the conditions

3. Proposed Answer:
   - Length 11
   - First 7 elements are 3, last 4 are -3
   - Any 7-element sublist would have at least 4 positive numbers (sum ≥ 4*3-3*3 = 3 > 0)
   - The full 11-element list sums to 7*3 + 4*(-3) = 21-12 = 9 > 0 (but should be <0)

The proposed answer fails the 11-element sublist condition (should be negative but is positive). Also, it's shorter than the ground truth answer.
