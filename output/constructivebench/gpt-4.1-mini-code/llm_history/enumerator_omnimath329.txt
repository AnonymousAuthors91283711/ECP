The problem involves the real variable \(x > 0\) satisfying the equation

\[
x^2 + 9x + 2 \sqrt{x^2 \cdot 9x} = 121.
\]

Simplifying the square root term,

\[
\sqrt{x^2 \cdot 9x} = \sqrt{9x^3} = 3 x^{3/2}.
\]

So the equation becomes

\[
x^2 + 9x + 2 \cdot 3 x^{3/2} = 121 \implies x^2 + 9x + 6 x^{3/2} = 121.
\]

We want to find the positive solution(s) \(x\).

To assist in conjecturing the answer, I will enumerate for some candidate \(x\) values and print those where the left side is close to 121, prioritizing exact powers or nice radicals when possible.

```python
# enumerator.py
import math

def lhs(x):
    # Compute x^2 + 9x + 6 * x^{3/2}
    return x**2 + 9*x + 6 * x**(1.5)

print("Enumerating x > 0 for lhs(x) = 121")

# We'll try rational candidates with small denominators,
# and perfect squares for easy sqrt(x) computation.
candidates = []
for m in range(1, 20):
    x = m  # integer candidates
    val = lhs(x)
    if abs(val - 121) < 1e-6:
        # Exact or very close to 121, print
        print(f"x={x} lhs={val}")

for m in range(1, 50):
    # try fractions of the form n^2 (perfect squares) to have exact sqrt
    x = (m/10)**2
    val = lhs(x)
    if abs(val - 121) < 0.5:
        # Show all with value close to 121 with 0.5 tolerance
        print(f"x={x:.3f} lhs={val:.3f}")

# Try to find:
# Since if we try x=4
# lhs(4) = 16 + 36 + 6*8 = 16+36+48=100 < 121
# x=5:
# 25 + 45 + 6 * 5^{1.5} = 25+45+6*sqrt(125)
# sqrt(125)=11.1803, 6*11.1803=67.08, sum=25+45+67.08=137.08 >121

# So solution lies between 4 and 5; let's do bisection search with tolerance.

def bisect(f, a, b, target, tol=1e-6):
    while b - a > tol:
        c = (a + b) / 2
        val = f(c)
        if val < target:
            a = c
        else:
            b = c
    return (a + b) / 2

root = bisect(lhs, 4, 5, 121)
print(f"\nApproximate root found by bisection: x = {root:.6f}, lhs = {lhs(root):.6f}")

# Try to recognize perfect squares or nice roots near this root
# sqrt(root) ~ sqrt(4.68) ~ 2.16, maybe exact form involves fraction squared.

# Let's try a few rational squares near root:
for p in range(19, 25):
    x = (p/10)**2
    val = lhs(x)
    if abs(val - 121) < 1e-3:
        print(f"Close candidate: x=({p}/10)^2={x:.4f} lhs={val:.6f}")
```
