The problem likely involves finding positive integers \( m, n \) such that \( m \) is not divisible by 3, and \( p(4,4) = \frac{m}{3^n} \), aiming to find \( m + n \). Without the exact definition of \( p(4,4) \), we'll interpret this as an enumeration or calculation problem involving powers of 3.

Since the goal is to assist in conjecturing and proving the answer, we'll try small \( n \) and compute the corresponding \( m \) values, ensuring \( m \) is positive, \( m \not\equiv 0 \pmod{3} \), and \( m/3^n \) matches some target value. We'll pick sample values and enumerate possible \( (m, n) \) pairs consistent with these conditions.

Below is a program to enumerate possible \( m, n \) values with \( n \) up to 10, \( m \) up to 100, filtering for \( m \not\equiv 0 \pmod{3} \), and print candidates \( m, n \) with their sum \( m+n \).

```python
# Enumerate pairs (m,n) with m,n > 0, m not divisible by 3,
# and print possible candidates of m/3^n for n in [1..10], m in [1..100].
# We don't know the exact value of p(4,4), so we print values of m/3^n for inspection,
# along with m+n to help identify patterns.

def main():
    max_n = 10
    max_m = 100
    seen_values = set()

    print("Enumerating (m, n) with m>0, n>0, 3 âˆ¤ m, m in [1..100], n in [1..10]:")
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        for m in range(1, max_m + 1):
            if m % 3 == 0:
                continue  # skip if m divisible by 3
            val = m / (3 ** n)
            # print if value not seen before (avoid too much repetition)
            key = (m, n)
            if key not in seen_values:
                seen_values.add(key)
                print(f"m={m}, n={n}, m/3^{n} = {val:.8f}, sum m+n={m + n}")

    main()
