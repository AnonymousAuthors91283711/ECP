Ground Truth Answer: fun n => n / 2 + 1
Proposed Answer: fun n => if n = 3 then 1 else n / 2
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the smallest degree k such that every n-vertex regular graph with degree k must contain a triangle (3 vertices all connected to each other).

2. The ground truth answer is `n/2 + 1` (integer division).

3. The proposed answer is `if n = 3 then 1 else n/2`.

Analysis:
- For n=3: The ground truth gives 2 (3/2+1=2), while proposed gives 1. Actually, for n=3, any 1-regular graph (just one edge) doesn't contain a triangle, but a 2-regular graph (complete graph K₃) does contain a triangle. So the correct answer should be 2, not 1.
- For n=4: Both give 2 (4/2+1=3 vs 4/2=2). The correct answer is 2 (a 4-cycle is 2-regular and triangle-free, but any 3-regular graph on 4 vertices is complete and has triangles).
- For n=5: Ground truth gives 3 (5/2+1=3), proposed gives 2. The correct answer is 3 (the 5-cycle is 2-regular and triangle-free, but any 3-regular graph on 5 vertices must contain a triangle).

The proposed answer is incorrect for n=3 and n=5, but correct for n=4. The ground truth answer appears correct in all cases.
