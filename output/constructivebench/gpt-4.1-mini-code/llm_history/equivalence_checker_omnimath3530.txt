noncomputable abbrev omnimath3530_answer : Set ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3530 (x : ℝ) : 
  x^3 < x^2 ↔ x ∈ omnimath3530_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {x | x < 0 ∨ 0 < x ∧ x < 1}
Proposed Answer: {x : ℝ | x < 0 ∨ (0 < x ∧ x < 1)}
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is exactly equivalent to the ground truth answer. Both expressions describe the set of real numbers \( x \) where either \( x < 0 \) or \( 0 < x < 1 \). The only difference is the explicit type annotation \( x : \mathbb{R} \) in the proposed answer, which does not affect the meaning of the set. The logical structure and conditions are identical.
