theorem olympiadbench3033 (S M distance : ℝ) (hS : S = 15) (hM : M = 10) (hd : distance = 100) :
  ∃ t : ℝ, S * t + M * t = distance ∧ S * t = olympiadbench3033_answer S M distance := by sorry. Enumerated answers: S = 15, M = 10, distance = 100
t = 4 = 4.000000
S * t = 60 = 60.000000
Alternative t: 4 = 4.000000, (S+M)*t = 100
S*t = 60
Alternative t: 4 = 4.000000, (S+M)*t = 100
S*t = 60
Alternative t: 4 = 4.000000, (S+M)*t = 100
S*t = 60. Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ → ℝ → ℝ
