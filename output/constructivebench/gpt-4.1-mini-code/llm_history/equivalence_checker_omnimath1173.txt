Ground Truth Answer: (8, 8)
Proposed Answer: (27, 84)
Let's evaluate the proposed answer (27, 84) against the conditions in the problem:

1. Check positivity: 27 > 0 and 84 > 0 ✔
2. Check x + y = k₁²: 27 + 84 = 111, which is not a perfect square ❌
3. Check x² + y² = k₂²: 729 + 7056 = 7785, not a perfect square ❌
4. Check x³ + y³ = k₃²: 19683 + 592704 = 612387, not a perfect square ❌

The ground truth answer (8,8) satisfies:
1. 8 + 8 = 16 = 4² ✔
2. 64 + 64 = 128 (not a perfect square, but wait - this suggests the ground truth might also be incorrect)
Wait, this reveals a problem - the ground truth (8,8) doesn't actually satisfy all conditions either since 8² + 8² = 128 isn't a perfect square.

However, the proposed answer (27,84) clearly fails all the required conditions beyond positivity, while the ground truth at least satisfies the first and third conditions (8+8=16=4² and 8³+8³=1024=32²).

Given this, the proposed answer is completely wrong while the ground truth is partially correct but not fully satisfying all conditions.
