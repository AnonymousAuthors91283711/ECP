The problem asks to find real numbers \( x \) satisfying 
\[
\log_2\left(\log_2(2x - 2)\right) = 2
\]
with the constraints
\[
2x - 2 > 0 \quad\text{and}\quad \log_2(2x - 2) > 0.
\]
Our goal is to enumerate possible \( x \) values meeting these conditions exactly.

We start by rewriting the equation:

\[
\log_2(\log_2(2x - 2)) = 2
\implies \log_2(2x - 2) = 2^2 = 4
\implies 2x - 2 = 2^4 = 16
\implies 2x = 18
\implies x = 9.
\]

We will write a script that enumerates candidates for \( x \) and checks these conditions. Although we know the analytic solution is \( x=9 \), the program will confirm this by enumeration over a sensible domain, prioritizing exact satisfaction of the conditions.

```python
# Enumerate possible x values solving log2(log2(2x - 2)) = 2 with constraints

import math

def is_integer_close(val, tol=1e-12):
    return abs(val - round(val)) < tol

# We know 2x-2 must be positive and log2(2x - 2) must be positive
# So 2x - 2 > 0 => x > 1
# log2(2x - 2) > 0 => 2x - 2 > 1 => x > 1.5

print("Enumerating candidates x where log2(log2(2x-2))=2 (exact)...")

# Enumerate x as rational candidates that make 2x-2 a power of two
# since log2(2x - 2) must be an integer (for exactness),
# we try powers of two for 2x - 2 within a reasonable range

for pow1 in range(1, 20):  # log2(2x - 2) = pow1
    val_inner = 2 ** pow1  # 2x-2 = val_inner
    x_candidate = (val_inner + 2) / 2
    if x_candidate <= 1.5:
        continue

    # Check if log2(log2(2x-2)) = 2
    # so log2(pow1) == 2 means pow1 == 4
    # so only pow1 == 4 satisfies the original equation

    # print all candidates with log2(2x - 2) == pow1
    print(f"x={x_candidate}, 2x-2={val_inner}, log2(2x-2)={pow1}")

    if pow1 == 4:
        print(f"--> Candidate solution for the equation: x={x_candidate}")

# Explicitly show the extremal candidate (only candidate matching the equation)
print("\nConjectured exact answer is x=9.")
```
