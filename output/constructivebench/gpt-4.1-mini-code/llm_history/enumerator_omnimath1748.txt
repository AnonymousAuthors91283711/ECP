The problem is looking for the smallest integer \( b > 1 \) such that the sum \(1 + b + b^2 + b^3\) is a perfect square.

We can check \( b \) from 2 up to some limit (say 100) to find such \( b \).

```python
# Enumerate integers b > 1 for which 1 + b + b^2 + b^3 is a perfect square,
# and print all cases found. Then print the smallest such b.

def is_square(n):
    x = int(n**0.5)
    return x*x == n

candidates = []
for b in range(2, 101):
    s = 1 + b + b**2 + b**3
    if is_square(s):
        print(f"b={b}, sum=1+b+b^2+b^3={s} which is {int(s**0.5)}^2")
        candidates.append(b)

if candidates:
    print(f"Smallest b with 1 + b + b^2 + b^3 a perfect square: {min(candidates)}")
else:
    print("No such b found up to 100")
```
