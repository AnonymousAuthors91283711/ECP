Ground Truth Answer: {(1, -2)}
Proposed Answer: { p : ℝ × ℝ | p.1 ≠ 0 ∧ p.2 = -2 * (p.1)^2 }
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all pairs (a,b) where a≠0 and b≠0 such that both a and b are roots of the polynomial x² + a x + b.

2. The ground truth answer gives exactly one solution: (1, -2).

3. The proposed answer gives a set of solutions where b = -2a² for any a≠0.

Let's verify:
For the polynomial x² + a x + b to have both a and b as roots:
- For root a: a² + a·a + b = 0 ⇒ 2a² + b = 0 ⇒ b = -2a²
- For root b: b² + a·b + b = 0 ⇒ b(b + a + 1) = 0 ⇒ b=0 or b=-a-1

Since b≠0, we must have b=-a-1 and b=-2a². Therefore:
-2a² = -a-1 ⇒ 2a² - a - 1 = 0 ⇒ a=1 or a=-1/2
For a=1: b=-2(1)²=-2 (matches ground truth)
For a=-1/2: b=-2(-1/2)²=-1/2 (but b=-(-1/2)-1=-1/2, consistent)

The proposed answer includes all (a,-2a²) but only (1,-2) and (-1/2,-1/2) actually satisfy both conditions. Therefore, the proposed answer is too broad.
