The problem concerns triples of points on a 999x999 grid with certain coloring conditions (defined by function f returning Bool). We want to find the greatest possible size T of the set of all such triples that follow the pattern: same row (r1 = r2), consecutive columns (c2 = c3), with colors true/false/true in those positions respectively. The theorem claims the existence of a maximum, called olympiadbench2152_answer.

To help conjecture an upper bound or exact max T, we'll:
- Enumerate over small grids, for example 3x3 or 4x4, to count the maximum number of such triples for each possible Boolean function f.
- Since 2^(n^2) is huge to enumerate fully, limit to very small n (like 3 or 4).
- Print each f and the count of triples fitting the pattern for that f.
- Keep track of max counts found.
- Output the max found for the test grids.

This approach respects the requirements:
- prints partial results immediately,
- uses small examples,
- prioritizes exact (integral) counts,
- finds max count and prints it.

```python
# Enumerate on small grids n x n
# For each f : {0,...,n-1}x{0,...,n-1} â†’ {True,False}
# Count triples ((r1,c1),(r2,c2),(r3,c3)) where:
# r1 = r2, c2 = c3, f(r1,c1)=True, f(r2,c2)=False, f(r3,c3)=True

from itertools import product

def count_triples(n, f):
    count = 0
    # r1=r2 means row fixed, iterate over rows
    for r in range(n):
        # possible (c1,c2,c3) with c2=c3
        for c1 in range(n):
            for c2 in range(n):
                c3 = c2
                if f[(r,c1)] and (not f[(r,c2)]) and f[(r,c3)]:
                    count += 1
    return count

def main():
    n = 3  # small grid for enumeration
    cells = [(r,c) for r in range(n) for c in range(n)]
    max_count = -1
    max_fs = []
    total_fs = 2**(n*n)
    print(f"Enumerating all {total_fs} functions f on {n}x{n} grid")
    for i, bits in enumerate(product([False,True], repeat=n*n)):
        f = dict(zip(cells, bits))
        T = count_triples(n, f)
        print(f"Function {i+1}/{total_fs} count = {T}")
        if T > max_count:
            max_count = T
            max_fs = [f]
        elif T == max_count:
            max_fs.append(f)
        if i >= 511:  # limit output to avoid too much printing
            print("... enumeration truncated at 512 functions ...")
            break
    print(f"Max count encountered: {max_count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
