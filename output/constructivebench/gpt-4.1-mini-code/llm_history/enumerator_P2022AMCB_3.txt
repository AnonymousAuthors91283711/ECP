[write_program]
The problem deals with sequences of digits and checking primality of the numbers they represent. The sequence s(n) is defined as [1, 2, 2, ..., 2, 1] with a 1, n copies of 2, then a final 1.

We want to check which n < 10 produce a prime when the digits s(n) are concatenated into a number.

The program below enumerates n from 0 to 9, computes the number represented by s(n), checks primality using a simple deterministic method (since numbers are small), prints out the n and the number if prime, and finally prints how many such n exist.

```python
# Enumerate n < 10, construct numbers 1 followed by n twos then 1, check primality.
def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    if num in (2,3):
        return True
    if num % 2 == 0:
        return False
    r = int(num**0.5)
    for i in range(3, r+1, 2):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def number_from_digits(digits):
    return int("".join(str(d) for d in digits))

def main():
    primes_found = []
    for n in range(10):
        digits = [1] + [2]*n + [1]
        val = number_from_digits(digits)
        if is_prime(val):
            print(f"n={n}, number={val} is prime")
            primes_found.append(n)
    print(f"Total n with prime numbers: {len(primes_found)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
