The given theorem relates two real numbers g and p with the conditions:
g = p + 1 and 14 * (g + p) = 546.  
We want to find the value of g satisfying these conditions.

Enumerate possible solutions by choosing integer p values around plausible ranges,
then compute g and check constraints. We'll print each pair (p, g) and finally print the g value matching the theorem.

```python
# Enumerate p values and compute g from the system:
# g = p + 1 and 14 * (g + p) = 546
# => 14 * (p + 1 + p) = 546
# => 14 * (2p + 1) = 546
# => 2p + 1 = 546 / 14 = 39
# => 2p = 38
# => p = 19
# so g = p + 1 = 20

print("Enumerating p and g values satisfying the system:")
for p in range(10, 30):
    g = p + 1
    lhs = 14 * (g + p)
    if lhs == 546:
        print(f"Found solution: p = {p}, g = {g}")
print("\nTherefore, the answer g is 20")
```
