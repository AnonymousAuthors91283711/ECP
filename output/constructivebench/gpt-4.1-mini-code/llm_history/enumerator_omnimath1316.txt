The problem involves the polynomial \(p(x) = x^3 + x^2 - 333x - 1001\) with roots \(a, b, c\), and asks for the value of \(a^3 + b^3 + c^3\).

Using Viète's formulas for a cubic polynomial \(x^3 + px^2 + qx + r\):
- \(a + b + c = -p\)
- \(ab + bc + ca = q\)
- \(abc = -r\)

Here \(p = 1\), \(q = -333\), \(r = -1001\), so:
- \(a + b + c = -1\)
- \(ab + bc + ca = -333\)
- \(abc = 1001\)

From the identity:
\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = (a+b+c)^3 - 3(a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca) + 3abc
\]

We can directly compute the value exactly.

To verify and support conjectures, I'll write a Python program that enumerates all integer triples \((a,b,c)\) with the given symmetric sums, print candidates, and compute \(a^3+b^3+c^3\). In practice, roots may be non-integers, so we will consider roots numerically.

However, since we can compute from the identity above, the program will print that exact evaluation to align with the problem's style.

```python
# Compute a^3 + b^3 + c^3 using Viète's formulas for the polynomial x^3 + x^2 -333x -1001
def main():
    p = 1
    q = -333
    r = -1001
    
    s1 = -p      # a + b + c
    s2 = q       # ab + bc + ca
    s3 = -r      # abc
    
    # Formula: a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = (a+b+c)^3 - 3(a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca) + 3abc
    res = s1**3 - 3*s1*s2 + 3*s3
    
    print(f"Sum of roots s1 = {s1}")
    print(f"Sum of products s2 = {s2}")
    print(f"Product of roots s3 = {s3}")
    print(f"a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = {res}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
