The problem involves real numbers \(x, y\) satisfying 
\[
\frac{(x - 2013)(y - 2014)}{(x - 2013)^2 + (y - 2014)^2} = -\frac{1}{2}.
\]
We want to find possible values of \(x + y\).

Rewrite with \(a = x - 2013\), \(b = y - 2014\):
\[
\frac{ab}{a^2 + b^2} = -\frac{1}{2}.
\]
We want \(x + y = (a + b) + (2013 + 2014) = a + b + 4027.\)

To solve, fix \(b \neq 0\) and compute \(a\) satisfying the equation. We will enumerate \(b\) and calculate corresponding \(a\), then print \(x + y\).

```python
# Enumerate candidate pairs (a,b) with b in a small range,
# find a from the equation a*b/(a^2+b^2) = -1/2, then print x+y = a+b+4027.

def main():
    c = 4027
    # Try b in integers from -20 to 20, excluding 0 to avoid division by zero.
    for b in range(-20, 21):
        if b == 0:
            continue
        # Let a = ?
        # Equation: ab/(a^2 + b^2) = -1/2
        # Multiply both sides: 2ab = -(a^2 + b^2)
        # => a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 0
        # Notice this is (a + b)^2 = 0 -> a = -b
        # So the only solution is a = -b.
        a = -b
        x_plus_y = a + b + c
        print(f"a={a}, b={b} => x+y = {x_plus_y}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This will print all candidates \(x + y\) found for chosen \(b\), immediately as discovered. The key here is identifying the quadratic form reduces to \(a = -b\), thus \(x + y = 4027\) for all such pairs.
