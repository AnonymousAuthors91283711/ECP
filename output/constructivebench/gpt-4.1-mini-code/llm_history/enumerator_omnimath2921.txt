The problem is to find the least positive natural number \( k \) divisible by 3, 5, 7, and 9. This is the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers. The program below enumerates positive integers and checks divisibility, printing candidates as found, then outputs the smallest such number.

```python
# Enumerate positive integers divisible by 3, 5, 7, and 9 and print candidates immediately.

def divides(n, x):
    return x % n == 0

def main():
    divisors = [3, 5, 7, 9]
    # We do not want to check forever; max search up to 1000 for brevity.
    for k in range(1, 1001):
        if all(divides(d, k) for d in divisors):
            print(f"Candidate divisible by 3,5,7,9: {k}")
            # Since we scan ascending, the first printed is the least.
            print(f"Least positive integer divisible by 3,5,7,9: {k}")
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
