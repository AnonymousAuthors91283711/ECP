The problem concerns counting 4x4 matrices over {0,1} with row sums and column sums equal to the permuted sequences (1,2,3,4) in some order. The permutations σ and τ represent the sequences of sums per rows and columns respectively, shifted by +1. We will enumerate such 0-1 matrices and count those that satisfy the constraints.

Since it's a high computational load to enumerate all 2^(16) matrices, we instead generate all permutations σ and τ of [0..3] to define the required row and column sums (each σ(i)+1). Then we try to find 0-1 matrices matching these sums.

To be efficient:
- For each pair of σ and τ pack row sums and column sums as lists of 1+σ(i) and 1+τ(j).
- Use a recursive backtracking to fill matrix row by row.
- At each row, generate all possible 0-1 vectors with sum equal to the desired row sum.
- Keep track of column sums to ensure final sums match τ.
- Print each found matrix or just count; to reduce output size, print count per (σ,τ).
- Print parameters σ, τ and partial counts streaming as results are found.

We enumerate all 24*24=576 pairs and for each, try to find matrices.

```python
from itertools import permutations, combinations

def row_vectors(n, s):
    # Generate all 0-1 vectors of length n with sum s
    for ones in combinations(range(n), s):
        vec = [0]*n
        for i in ones:
            vec[i] = 1
        yield vec

def backtrack(n, row_sums, col_sums, row=0, matrix=[], col_acc=None):
    if col_acc is None:
        col_acc = [0]*n
    if row == n:
        if col_acc == col_sums:
            yield matrix
        return
    rs = row_sums[row]
    for rvec in row_vectors(n, rs):
        new_col_acc = [c+r for c, r in zip(col_acc, rvec)]
        # quick pruning: intermediate sums per column cannot exceed col_sums
        if all(nc <= cs for nc, cs in zip(new_col_acc, col_sums)):
            yield from backtrack(n, row_sums, col_sums, row+1, matrix+[rvec], new_col_acc)

def main():
    n = 4
    base = [1,2,3,4]
    perms = list(permutations(range(n)))
    total = 0
    for sigma in perms:
        row_sums = [sigma[i]+1 for i in range(n)]
        for tau in perms:
            col_sums = [tau[j]+1 for j in range(n)]
            # Enumerate matrices with these sums
            count = 0
            for _ in backtrack(n, row_sums, col_sums):
                count += 1
                print(f"σ={sigma}, τ={tau}, matrix #{count} found")
            if count > 0:
                print(f"σ={sigma}, τ={tau}, total matrices: {count}")
            total += count
    print(f"Total number of matrices: {total}")
