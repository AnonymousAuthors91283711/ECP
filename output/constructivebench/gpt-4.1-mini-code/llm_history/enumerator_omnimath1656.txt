The problem involves calculating a probability related to selecting pairs from two groups of colored items (blue and red). The expression given is:

\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{2 \times (blue \times (blue - 1) + red \times (red - 1))}{total \times (total - 1)} \]

where \( total = blue + red \).

We want to enumerate this probability for various small values of blue and red, then print each exact value as a simplified fraction using Python's `fractions.Fraction`. This allows conjecturing about the pattern or testing the formula.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Enumerate small sample values for blue and red
max_val = 10  # limit to keep output short
for blue in range(1, max_val + 1):
    for red in range(1, max_val + 1):
        total = blue + red
        favorable = 2 * (blue * (blue -1) + red * (red -1))
        possible = total * (total -1)
        prob = Fraction(favorable, possible)
        print(f"blue={blue}, red={red}, probability={prob}")
```
