The problem likely asks to find all pairs of positive integers \((m,n)\) such that \((m n - 1) \mid (n^2 - n + 1)^2\). We'll enumerate pairs with small positive integers \(m,n\) up to some limit, check divisibility, and print all pairs that satisfy the condition.

```python
# Enumerate pairs (m, n) of positive integers with m,n <= 50,
# and print those where (m*n -1) divides (n^2 - n +1)^2 exactly.

def main():
    limit = 50
    for m in range(1, limit + 1):
        for n in range(1, limit + 1):
            divisor = m * n - 1
            if divisor <= 0:
                continue
            val = (n**2 - n + 1)**2
            if val % divisor == 0:
                print(f"(m,n) = ({m},{n}), divides: {divisor} | {val}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
