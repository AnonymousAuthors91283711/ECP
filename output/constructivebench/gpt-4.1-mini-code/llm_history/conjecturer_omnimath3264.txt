abbrev omnimath3264_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath3264 (n : ℕ) (h : 0 < n) :
  (∀ m, Nat.Coprime m n → ∃ π : Equiv.Perm (Fin n), ∀ k, π (π k) ≡ m * k [MOD n]) ↔ n ∈ omnimath3264_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing n for the property:
n=1, trivially true
n=2 satisfies the condition
n=3 does NOT satisfy the condition
n=4 does NOT satisfy the condition
n=5 does NOT satisfy the condition
n=6 satisfies the condition
n=7 does NOT satisfy the condition. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
<<<{n : ℕ | n = 1 ∨ n = 2 ∨ n = 6}>>>
