Ground Truth Answer: 101 / 110
Proposed Answer: (10 / 11 : ℝ)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves a system of two equations with x and y defined in terms of each other through logarithmic functions.

2. The ground truth answer is 101/110 ≈ 0.918181818...

3. The proposed answer is 10/11 ≈ 0.909090909...

4. These are clearly different values (101/110 ≠ 10/11), with a difference of about 0.00909.

5. The problem asks for 10^(x-y), and the two answers give different values for this expression.

Since the proposed answer (10/11) is not equal to the ground truth answer (101/110), they are not equivalent.

<<<False>>>
