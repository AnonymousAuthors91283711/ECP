[write_program]
The problem asks to evaluate the sum over all divisors \(d\) of 2016:
\[
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{d \mid 2016} \frac{d^2}{d^2 + 2016}
\]
where \(n\) is the number of divisors of 2016.

To assist in conjecturing a closed form, I'll write a Python program to:
- Compute divisors of 2016.
- Print each term \(\frac{d^2}{d^2 + 2016}\) for each divisor \(d\).
- Compute and print the average value of these terms.
- Also print the count \(n\).

This will help to guess if the sum simplifies to something nice.

```python
import math
from fractions import Fraction

def divisors(n):
    divs = []
    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divs.append(i)
            if i * i != n:
                divs.append(n // i)
    return sorted(divs)

def main():
    N = 2016
    divs = divisors(N)
    n = len(divs)
    print(f"Number of divisors n = {n}\n")
    total = Fraction(0,1)
    for d in divs:
        val = Fraction(d*d, d*d + N)
        total += val
        print(f"Divisor: {d}, term: {val} ≈ {float(val):.6f}")
    average = total / n
    print(f"\nSum of terms = {total} ≈ {float(total):.6f}")
    print(f"Average = sum / n = {average} ≈ {float(average):.6f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
