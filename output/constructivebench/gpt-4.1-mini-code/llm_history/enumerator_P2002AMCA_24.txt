The problem asks for the number of real pairs (a, b) such that (a + i b)^{2002} = a - i b. Since the 2002-th power of a complex number equals its conjugate, analyzing the magnitude and argument leads to conditions on a and b. We enumerate integer (a,b) with small magnitude to find concrete solutions and guess the pattern or count.

```python
import cmath

n = 2002

print(f"Enumerating integer (a,b) with |a|,|b| ≤ 20 for solutions to (a+ib)^{n} = conjugate(a+ib):")
count = 0
limit = 20
for a in range(-limit, limit + 1):
    for b in range(-limit, limit + 1):
        z = complex(a, b)
        if z == 0:
            # (0)^{2002} = 0, conjugate(0) = 0, solution
            print(f"a={a}, b={b}, z=0 is a solution")
            count += 1
            continue
        lhs = z**n
        rhs = complex(a, -b)
        # Check exact equality with some numerical tolerance (very small since integer powers)
        if abs(lhs.real - rhs.real) < 1e-10 and abs(lhs.imag - rhs.imag) < 1e-10:
            print(f"a={a}, b={b}, (a+ib)^{n}={lhs}, conjugate={rhs} -> solution")
            count += 1
print(f"Count of solutions with |a|,|b| ≤ {limit}: {count}")

print("\nObservations: The zero solution is trivial. For |z|=0 or |z|=1 and arguments matching certain relations, solutions arise. The exact count likely relates to divisors of n.")
```
