The problem is to find the number of real solutions to the equation:
\[ \arctan(x) = x^2 - 1.6 \]

We want to enumerate all real solutions (roots) of this equation approximately to help conjecture the exact number of solutions. We'll test values in a reasonable range and refine to find where the function changes sign.

```python
import math

# Define the function f(x) = arctan(x) - (x^2 - 1.6)
def f(x):
    return math.atan(x) - (x**2 - 1.6)

# We'll scan integer and half-integer points in range -3 to 3 to detect sign changes
# Then use bisection method to locate roots accurately
def sign(x):
    return 1 if x > 0 else -1 if x < 0 else 0

def bisection(a, b, tol=1e-6, max_iter=50):
    fa, fb = f(a), f(b)
    if sign(fa) == 0:
        return a
    if sign(fb) == 0:
        return b
    if sign(fa) == sign(fb):
        return None
    for _ in range(max_iter):
        c = (a + b)/2
        fc = f(c)
        if abs(fc) < tol:
            return c
        if sign(fa) != sign(fc):
            b, fb = c, fc
        else:
            a, fa = c, fc
    return (a + b)/2

print("Searching for solutions of arctan(x) = x^2 - 1.6")

# Scan steps of 0.1 for better detection in roughly [-3,3]
xs = [i/10 for i in range(-30,31)]
roots = []

for i in range(len(xs)-1):
    a, b = xs[i], xs[i+1]
    fa, fb = f(a), f(b)
    if sign(fa)*sign(fb) <= 0:
        root = bisection(a, b)
        if root is not None:
            # To avoid duplicates, round roots to 7 decimals
            r = round(root,7)
            if not any(abs(r - rr) < 1e-6 for rr in roots):
                roots.append(r)
                print(f"Found root at x = {r}")

print(f"Total number of real solutions found: {len(roots)}")
```
