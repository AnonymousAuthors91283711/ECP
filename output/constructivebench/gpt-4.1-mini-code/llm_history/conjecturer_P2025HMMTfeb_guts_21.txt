The current error occurs because you are assigning a proposition (∃ a b c : ℝ, ...) to a real number `P2025HMMTfeb_guts_21_answer`. Instead, you need to assign the least possible value of `a*b*c` (which is a real number) satisfying the given system of equations. If you have enumerated solutions or reasoned about the problem, usually the minimal value emerges as a nice expression.

Since the problem demands the least value of `a*b*c` for a,b,c satisfying the system, and from your enumerated attempts, a plausible guess is a concrete real number value that minimizes it.

Your current candidate is `(1/4 : ℝ)` as the minimal product abc. So the answer should be simply:

`(1/4 : ℝ)`

without the existential quantifier or the system of equations.

Hence your answer should be:

<<<(1/4 : ℝ)>>>
