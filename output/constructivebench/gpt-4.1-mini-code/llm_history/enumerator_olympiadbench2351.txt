The problem gives a relationship between logarithms with base 10, namely log₁₀(x) = 3 + log₁₀(y), with x, y > 0. We are asked to find the exact value of x/y.

By properties of logarithms, log₁₀(x) - log₁₀(y) = 3, and log₁₀(x/y) = 3, so x/y = 10³ = 1000.

The Python enumerator will verify this by enumerating sample positive y and computing corresponding x satisfying the original equation, then print x/y to confirm all equal 1000.

```python
# Enumerate positive y values (integers 1 to 5)
# For each y, compute x using the relation log10(x) = 3 + log10(y)
# Then compute ratio x/y and print it to verify it equals 1000

import math

print("Enumerating sample values (y from 1 to 5):")
for y in range(1, 6):
    log_y = math.log10(y)
    log_x = 3 + log_y
    x = 10**log_x
    ratio = x / y  # Should be 10^3 = 1000
    print(f"y={y}, x={x:.6f}, x/y={ratio:.6f}")
print("Conjecture: x/y = 1000")
```
