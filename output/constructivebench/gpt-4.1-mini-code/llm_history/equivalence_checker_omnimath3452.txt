noncomputable abbrev omnimath3452_answer : Fin 3 → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3452 :
  (∀ i : Fin 3, omnimath3452_answer i < omnimath3452_answer (i + 1)) ∧
  (∀ x : ℝ, (x = Real.sqrt 2011 ∨ x = 2011 ∨ x = 2011 ^ 2) → (∃! i : Fin 3, x = omnimath3452_answer i)) :=
sorry

Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: fun i : Fin 3 => if i = 0 then Real.sqrt 2011 else if i = 1 then 2011 else 2011 ^ 2
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer correctly defines a function that maps:
- index 0 to Real.sqrt 2011
- index 1 to 2011
- index 2 to 2011^2

This satisfies both conditions of the theorem:
1. The values are strictly increasing since sqrt(2011) < 2011 < 2011^2
2. For any x being either sqrt(2011), 2011, or 2011^2, there exists exactly one index i where x equals the function's output

The ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's intentionally left incomplete), so we can only evaluate the proposed answer on its own merits, which are correct.
