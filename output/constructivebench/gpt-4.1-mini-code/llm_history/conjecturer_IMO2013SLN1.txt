abbrev IMO2013SLN1_answer : ℕ → ℕ := sorry
theorem IMO2013SLN1 (f : ℕ → ℕ) :
  (∀ m n : ℕ, m^2 + f n ∣ m * f m + n) ↔ f = IMO2013SLN1_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing linear candidates f(n) = a*n + b with 0 ≤ a,b ≤ 3
Candidate f(n) = 1*n + 0 passes tests for n,m ∈ [1..5]
Testing constant candidates f(n) = c with 1 ≤ c ≤ 5
Testing f(n) = n^2
Testing f(n)=n
Function f(n)=n passes tests for n,m ∈ [1..5]. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
<<<fun n : ℕ => n>>>
