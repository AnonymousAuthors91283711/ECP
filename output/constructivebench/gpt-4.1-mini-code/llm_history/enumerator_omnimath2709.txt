The problem is to find the value of (x - 3)^2 when x = -3. Let's write a Python program to enumerate this for various values of x around -3, immediately printing the exact squares for integer values. This helps confirm or conjecture the exact value for x = -3.

```python
# Enumerate (x - 3)^2 for integer x near -3, printing exact squares immediately.
def main():
    print("Enumerating (x - 3)^2 for x in range(-5, 5):")
    for x in range(-5, 5):
        val = (x - 3) ** 2
        print(f"x = {x}, (x - 3)^2 = {val}")
        if x == -3:
            print(f"Answer for x = -3: (x - 3)^2 = {val}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
