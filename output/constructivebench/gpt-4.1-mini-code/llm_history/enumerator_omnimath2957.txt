[write_program]
The problem defines natural numbers \(p, q, r, s\) such that \(p = q - 1\), \(q = r - 1\), \(r = s - 1\), and \(p + s = 109\). It asks for the value of \(q + r\).

By substitution,
- \(p = q - 1\)
- \(q = r -1\)
- \(r = s -1\)

Thus, \(p = q -1\), \(q = r -1\), \(r = s -1\).

Using these relations, the variables form an arithmetic sequence:
\[
p, q = p + 1, r = p + 2, s = p + 3
\]

Since \(p + s = 109\), we have:
\[
p + (p + 3) = 109 \Rightarrow 2p + 3 = 109 \Rightarrow 2p = 106 \Rightarrow p = 53
\]

Then:
\[
q = 54, \quad r = 55
\]
Hence,
\[
q + r = 109
\]

I will write a Python program to enumerate all possible \((p, q, r, s)\) satisfying these relations for \(p\) from 0 up to 60, check the sum \(p + s = 109\), and print \(q + r\).

```python
# Enumerate p,q,r,s such that p = q-1, q = r-1, r = s-1, and p + s = 109
# Then print q + r for all found solutions

def main():
    for p in range(0, 61):  # p up to 60 because p + s = 109 and s = p+3 => maximum p ~ 53
        q = p + 1
        r = q + 1
        s = r + 1
        if p + s == 109:
            print(f"p={p}, q={q}, r={r}, s={s} => q + r = {q + r}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
