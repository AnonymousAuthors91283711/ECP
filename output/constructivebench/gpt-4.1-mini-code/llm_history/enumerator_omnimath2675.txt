The problem states: For real numbers x, solve the equation x + √81 = 25. We want to find all x satisfying this equation. Since √81 = 9, the equation becomes x + 9 = 25, so x = 16. 

To illustrate enumeration and verification, the program will print the exact value found by computing √81 symbolically and determining x, then print a few values around x for checking.

```python
import math

def main():
    # Compute sqrt(81) exactly
    sqrt_81 = math.isqrt(81)  # math.isqrt(81)=9, exact integer sqrt
    print(f"sqrt(81) = {sqrt_81}")
    # Solve x + sqrt(81) = 25 for x
    x = 25 - sqrt_81
    print(f"x = 25 - sqrt(81) = {x}")
    # Verify equation for a few candidates near x
    for test_x in range(14, 19):
        lhs = test_x + math.sqrt(81)
        print(f"Testing x = {test_x}: x + sqrt(81) = {lhs}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
