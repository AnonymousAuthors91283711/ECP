The problem looks like it's asking for the sum of four digits m, n, p, q, each between 1 and 9, and to find the possible values of m+n+p+q. Since the digits range from 1 to 9, the minimum sum is 4 and the maximum sum is 36.

I'll write a Python program to enumerate all quadruples (m,n,p,q), satisfying 1 <= m,n,p,q <= 9, and print their sums as we find them. Then we'll collect unique sums and print all possible sums found. This may help conjecture the possible values of the sum in the theorem.

Since the problem doesn't specify more constraints, we just enumerate all quadruples and print sums.

```python
# Enumerate sums of 4 digits m,n,p,q with 1 <= m,n,p,q <= 9
# and print sums immediately when found.

def main():
    sums_found = set()
    for m in range(1, 10):
        for n in range(1, 10):
            for p in range(1, 10):
                for q in range(1, 10):
                    s = m + n + p + q
                    if s not in sums_found:
                        print(f"Sum found: {s} from ({m},{n},{p},{q})")
                        sums_found.add(s)
    print("\nAll possible sums:")
    for s in sorted(sums_found):
        print(s)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
