Ground Truth Answer: fun c => ((c^2 + c - 1) / c^2, c / (c - 1), c)
Proposed Answer: fun c : ℝ => (c^2 + 2*c, c + 2*c^2, c + 2*c^2)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for a condition when the minimum of three square root expressions equals the sum of three other square roots, under the constraint that x,y,z ≥ 1.

2. The ground truth answer provides a parameterization where:
   - x = (c² + c - 1)/c²
   - y = c/(c-1)
   - z = c

3. The proposed answer suggests a different parameterization:
   - x = c² + 2c
   - y = c + 2c²
   - z = c + 2c²

Key differences:
- The ground truth answer has a rational function structure, while the proposed answer is polynomial
- The ground truth answer maintains distinct forms for x,y,z, while the proposed answer makes y and z identical
- The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the original condition (the minimum of square roots won't equal the sum of other square roots)

Testing with c=2:
- Ground truth: x=5/4, y=2, z=2 → LHS = min(√(5/4 + 5), √(2+5), √(2+5)) = √(5/4 + 5) ≈ 2.5
RHS = √(1/4) + √1 + √1 = 2.5 → matches
- Proposed: x=8, y=10, z=10 → LHS = min(√(8+800), √(10+800), √(10+800)) ≈ 28.46
RHS = √7 + √9 + √9 ≈ 9.645 → doesn't match
