Ground Truth Answer: 973
Proposed Answer: 992
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a sequence with specific values for n=1 to 10 and a general pattern for n≥11.
2. For odd n≥11, seq(n) = n²
3. For even n≥11, seq(n) = n*(n+2)
4. We need to find the largest n where seq(n) < 1000, then compute n + seq(n)

Let's verify:
- For n=30 (even): seq(30) = 30*32 = 960 → 30+960 = 990
- For n=31 (odd): seq(31) = 31² = 961 → 31+961 = 992
- For n=32 (even): seq(32) = 32*34 = 1088 > 1000 (too big)
- For n=29 (odd): seq(29) = 29² = 841 → 29+841 = 870 (smaller than 992)

The maximum valid n is 31, giving 992. The ground truth answer 973 appears incorrect as it would require n=28 (seq(28)=28*30=840 → 28+840=868) or n=27 (seq(27)=729 → 27+729=756), both smaller than 992.
