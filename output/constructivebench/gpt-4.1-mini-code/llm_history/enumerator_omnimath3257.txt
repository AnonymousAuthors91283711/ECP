The problem suggests investigating, for given integers n and k ≤ n, the maximum size y of the intersection of a k-dimensional subspace V of ℝⁿ (functions Fin n → ℝ) with the set Z of 0-1 vectors in ℝⁿ. We want to find (and conjecture) the maximum number of such 0-1 vectors in any k-dimensional subspace.

We will enumerate small values of n and k, list all k-dimensional subspaces (via their bases), check which 0-1 vectors lie inside, and record the maximum intersection size found.

Due to complexity, we'll only sample small values (like n=3, k=1 or 2).

Instead of enumerating all subspaces, we will generate candidate bases as combinations of 0-1 vectors or small integer vectors to approximate the search.

Below is a Python program that prints parameters used, then enumerates some subspaces, and prints sizes of intersections immediately found, enabling conjecture of omnimath3257_answer(k).
