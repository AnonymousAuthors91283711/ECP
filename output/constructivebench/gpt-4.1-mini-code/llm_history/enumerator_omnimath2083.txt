# The problem roughly translates as follows:
# For n in (1, 99), we seek a natural number a ≤ n such that:
# 1) For every m ≤ n, if gcd(n+a, m) = 1 then m = 1 (i.e., n+a is "coprime only with 1" among [1..n] -- so all other m >1 share a factor with n+a).
# 2) For every b < a, there exist distinct m1,m2 ≤ n, both ≠1, such that gcd(n+b, m1) = gcd(n+b, m2) = 1.
# 
# The set is {k = n - a | such a,n satisfy above, 0 < n < 100}.
# The problem states there's a greatest such k and wants to find it.
#
# The code enumerates (n,a) and prints candidates k=n-a whenever conditions hold.
# To keep output short, only prints k and (n,a) that yield the property.
#
# Coprimality is checked via gcd.
#
# Note: m=1 is the trivial gcd=1 case. Condition 1 means among m ≤ n, only m=1 is coprime with n+a.
# Condition 2 means for all smaller b < a, there exist two distinct m1,m2 >1, with gcd(n+b,m1)=gcd(n+b,m2)=1.
# So "a" is minimal such that n+a has only 1 coprime with it in [1..n], but all smaller shifts n+b have at least two coprimes >1.
#
# We'll scan n=2..99, a=1..n, check conditions, print k=n-a if satisfied.
# Also remember max k and print it at end.
