The problem is to find all pairs of positive integers (k, n) such that (7^k - 3^n) divides (k^4 + n^2). To explore solutions, we will enumerate small values of k and n, compute 7^k - 3^n, check divisibility of k^4 + n^2 by this difference, and print all such pairs found.

```python
# Enumerate positive integers k, n from 1 to a small limit
# Check if (7^k - 3^n) divides (k^4 + n^2)
# Print all pairs (k, n) satisfying the condition

def main():
    max_val = 10  # limit search to small k, n values
    for k in range(1, max_val + 1):
        k4 = k**4
        pow7_k = 7**k
        for n in range(1, max_val + 1):
            pow3_n = 3**n
            diff = pow7_k - pow3_n
            if diff == 0:
                continue  # avoid division by zero
            val = k4 + n**2
            if val % diff == 0:
                print(f"(k, n) = ({k}, {n}), 7^{k} - 3^{n} = {diff}, divides {val}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
