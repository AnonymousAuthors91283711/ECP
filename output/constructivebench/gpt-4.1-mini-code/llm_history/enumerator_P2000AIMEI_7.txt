The problem relates positive real numbers \(x,y,z\) such that \(xyz = 1\), and two linear equations involving \(x,y,z\):
\[
x + \frac{1}{z} = 5, \quad y + \frac{1}{x} = 29,
\]
and we want to find positive coprime integers \(m,n\) such that
\[
z + \frac{1}{y} = \frac{m}{n}.
\]

We will enumerate possible positive integer pairs \((m,n)\) up to some reasonable upper bound by trying to solve the system numerically or symbolically with the given constraints and check if \(z + \frac{1}{y}\) matches any rational \(\frac{m}{n}\).

The approach:
1. Express \(y = \frac{1}{xz}\).
2. Given \(x + \frac{1}{z} = 5\), express \(z\) or \(x\) in terms of the other.
3. Given \(y + \frac{1}{x} = 29\), relate \(x,y\).
4. Numerically solve for \(x,z\) from these.
5. Compute \(S = z + \frac{1}{y}\).
6. Enumerate small coprime pairs \((m,n)\) and see if any \(\frac{m}{n}\) matches \(S\) within a small tolerance.
7. Print candidates and finally print the simplest exact fraction found or best rational approximation.

Since the system is nonlinear, we roughly solve it numerically once to find approximate \(x,z\), then compute \(S\). Then we enumerate possible coprime \((m,n)\) to approximate \(S\).

```python
from math import gcd, isclose

# Since xyz=1 and equations involve 1/x and 1/z, positive x,y,z >0.
# From equation:
# x + 1/z = 5
# y + 1/x = 29
# Also, y = 1/(x*z)

# We want to find m,n in N, coprime, so that:
# z + 1/y = m/n

# Let's isolate and numerically approximate x,z:
# Using substitution: y = 1/(x*z)
# From second eq: y + 1/x = 29 => 1/(x*z) + 1/x = 29 => (1+z)/ (x z) = 29
# From first eq: x + 1/z = 5

# From first eq: 1/z = 5 - x => z = 1/(5 - x)
# Substitute in above:
# (1 + z)/(x z) = 29
# (1 + 1/(5 - x)) / (x * 1/(5 - x)) =29
# ((5 - x) +1)/(x) = 29
# (6 - x)/x = 29
# 6/x -1 =29
# 6/x =30
# x = 6/30 = 1/5

# Wait this contradicts x + 1/z =5, so check carefully

# Alternate approach: From y + 1/x =29
# y = 29 - 1/x
# Also, y = 1/(x*z)
# So 1/(x*z) = 29 - 1/x
# Multiply both sides by x:
# 1/z = 29 x -1
# Also from first eq:
# x + 1/z =5 => 1/z =5 - x

# Equate:
# 1/z = 5 - x = 29 x -1
# So 5 - x = 29 x -1
# 5 +1 = 29 x + x
# 6 =30 x
# x = 0.2

# Then 1/z = 5 - 0.2= 4.8 => z = 1/4.8 = 5/24

# y = 1/(x*z)= 1 / (0.2*5/24) = 1 / (1/24) =24

# Now compute z + 1/y = 5/24 + 1/24 = 6/24 = 1/4

# So m=1, n=4, check gcd(1,4)=1, positive, etc.

def gcd_check(a,b):
    return gcd(a,b) == 1

m, n = 1, 4
print(f"Candidate fraction m/n = {m}/{n}")
print(f"Check gcd(m,n) = {gcd(m,n)}")
print(f"S = z + 1/y = {5/24} + {1/24} = {6/24} = {m}/{n}")
```
