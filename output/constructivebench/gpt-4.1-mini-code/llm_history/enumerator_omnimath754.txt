The problem appears to involve counting the number of ways to tile a length \(n\) with tiles of length 1 or 2. The recurrence given is exactly the Fibonacci sequence shifted by one index (tilingCount(0) = 1, tilingCount(1) = 1, and so on). We want to confirm tilingCount(10).

The Python program below prints all tilingCount(n) for n=0 to 10 by direct enumeration and confirms the value for n=10.

```python
# Enumerate tilingCount(n) = number of ways to tile length n with tiles of length 1 or 2
def tilingCount(n):
    dp = [1, 1]  # base cases: tilingCount(0)=1, tilingCount(1)=1
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        dp.append(dp[i-1] + dp[i-2])
        print(f"tilingCount({i}) = {dp[i]}")  # streaming results
    return dp[n]

print("Parameters: n from 0 up to 10")
print("tilingCount(0) = 1")
print("tilingCount(1) = 1")
answer = tilingCount(10)
print(f"Final answer: tilingCount(10) = {answer}")
```
