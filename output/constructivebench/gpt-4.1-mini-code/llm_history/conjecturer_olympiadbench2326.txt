The problem asks to find the set of all integers k ≠ 0 such that the quadratic equation kx² + 6x + k = 0 has two distinct real roots. For a quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0, the discriminant is Δ = b² - 4ac. The roots are real and distinct if and only if Δ > 0.

Here, a = k, b = 6, c = k. The discriminant is Δ = 36 - 4k². For two distinct real roots, we need 36 - 4k² > 0 → 9 - k² > 0 → k² < 9. Since k is an integer and nonzero, k ∈ {-2, -1, 1, 2}.

In Lean, the set of such k is {k : ℤ | k ≠ 0 ∧ k^2 < 9}. Equivalently, {k : ℤ | k ∈ {-2, -1, 1, 2}}.

Your original candidate tried to write an equality of sets directly inside the `abbrev`, which is a syntax error. Instead, you should simply define the answer as the set {k : ℤ | k ≠ 0 ∧ k^2 < 9} or explicitly as `{-2, -1, 1, 2}` using `Set.mem`.

Final proposed Lean definition for the answer set:

<<<{k : ℤ | k ≠ 0 ∧ k^2 < 9}>>>

Alternatively, if you want the finite explicit set:

<<<{ -2, -1, 1, 2 }>>>

(Note: `Set` notation with explicit elements in Lean is usually written as `{-2, -1, 1, 2}` or as the Finset `{ -2, -1, 1, 2 }` cast to a set.)

To keep things simple and general, the inequality form is preferable as a closed form.

Hence, your fixed answer should be:

<<<{k : ℤ | k ≠ 0 ∧ k^2 < 9}>>>
