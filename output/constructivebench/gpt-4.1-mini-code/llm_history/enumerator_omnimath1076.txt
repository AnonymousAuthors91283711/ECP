The problem seems to define `reach_prob m` as the probability of ever reaching state `m` starting from 0 in some unspecified stochastic process. The goal is to find the exact value of `reach_prob 20 - reach_prob 15`. Without the process details, I will interpret it as computing the probabilities for an example process, such as a simple symmetric random walk on nonnegative integers with absorption at 0.

I will enumerate probabilities assuming a simple symmetric random walk (with equal chance to step +1 or -1, starting at 0, reflecting or absorbing at 0). For each `m`, I will enumerate the approximate probability of reaching `m` starting from 0. To keep it meaningful, assume that if the random walk is absorbed at 0, it cannot reach positive states, so probabilities for positive `m` can be calculated as a rational number for hitting probability.

I will enumerate for parameters m=1 to 25, print reach_prob(m), then print the difference reach_prob(20)-reach_prob(15). This can help conjecture the value and check if it matches a pattern.

```python
# Enumerate reaching probability assuming a random walk on nonnegative integers starting at 0,
# with partial absorption at zero - the classic Gambler's ruin probabilities.
# Probability to reach m before returning 0 is 1/m for symmetric random walk.

def reach_prob(m):
    if m == 0:
        return 1.0  # Trivial
    # For symmetric random walk starting at 0, probability to reach m before returning to 0 is 1/m
    # But starting at 0 already, not sure. Instead start from 1 for better modeling.
    # Instead, probability starting at 0 to ever reach m is 1 if m=0 else 1 if walk is transient.
    # Here let's just use the classical Gambler's ruin formula:
    # Hitting m before 0 starting at k = k/m
    # Starting at 0, only allowed to go up?
    # For a simple symmetric walk starting at 0, probability of ever hitting m>0 is 1.

    # To make enumeration, let's approximate with probability = 1 (since walk is recurrent),
    # so we return 1 for all positive m > 0 to illustrate.

    # Alternatively, let's return 0 if m<=0 else 1 as a sample.

    if m > 0:
        return 1.0
    else:
        return 0.0

def main():
    print("Enumerating reach_prob(m) for m=1..25 assuming symmetric walk starting at 0")
    for m in range(1, 26):
        p = reach_prob(m)
        print(f"reach_prob({m}) = {p}")

    d = reach_prob(20) - reach_prob(15)
    print(f"reach_prob(20) - reach_prob(15) = {d}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This program enumerates reach probabilities under a simple model to assist conjecturing the difference. Replace with actual model specifics as needed.
