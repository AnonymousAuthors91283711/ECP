theorem omnimath293 (a b : ℕ) (ha : 0 < a) (hb : 0 < b) :
  (∃ k : ℕ, (a^3 * b - 1) = k * (a + 1)) ∧ (∃ m : ℕ, (b^3 * a + 1) = m * (b - 1)) ↔ (a, b) ∈ omnimath293_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating pairs (a,b) with 1 <= a,b <= 50 satisfying both divisibility conditions:
(a, b) = (1, 3)
(a, b) = (2, 2)
(a, b) = (3, 3). Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ)
<<<{(1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 3)}>>>
