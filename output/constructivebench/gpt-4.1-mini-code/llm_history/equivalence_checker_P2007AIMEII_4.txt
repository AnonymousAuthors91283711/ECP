theorem P2007AIMEII_4 :
  ∃ (w₁ w₂ : ℕ), -- widget and whoosit production rates per worker per hour
  (100 * w₁ = 300 ∧ 100 * w₂ = 200) ∧ -- first condition
  (2 * 60 * w₁ = 240 ∧ 2 * 60 * w₂ = 300) ∧ -- second condition

Ground Truth Answer: 450
Proposed Answer: 300
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes production rates for widgets (w₁) and whoosits (w₂) with three conditions:
   - First condition: 100 workers produce 300 widgets → 100*w₁=300 → w₁=3
   - Second condition: 2 hours * 60 workers produce 240 widgets → 120*w₁=240 → w₁=2
   - Third condition: 3 hours * 50 workers produce P2007AIMEII_4_answer whoosits → 150*w₂=answer

2. There's an inconsistency in the widget production rate:
   - From first condition: w₁=3
   - From second condition: w₁=2
   These contradict each other, making the problem unsolvable as stated.

3. The ground truth answer (450) would require w₂=3 (since 150*3=450)
4. The proposed answer (300) would require w₂=2 (since 150*2=300)

Since the problem conditions are contradictory, neither answer can be correct. However, the proposed answer (300) is based on the second condition's implied w₂ rate (from 120*w₂=300 → w₂=2.5, but this doesn't match the proposed answer's implied w₂=2).
