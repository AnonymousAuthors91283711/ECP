Let's try to find all real \( x \) such that 
\[
2 \log_2 (x-1) = 1 - \log_2 (x+2),
\]
with the domain restrictions \( x-1 > 0 \Rightarrow x > 1 \) and \( x+2 > 0 \Rightarrow x > -2 \). The combined domain is \( x > 1 \).

We can rewrite and simplify the equation to find \( x \). Then we'll enumerate possible \( x \) with decimal approximations for insight.

```python
import math

# Domain: x > 1
# Equation: 2*log2(x - 1) = 1 - log2(x + 2)

# Rearranged equation:
# 2*log2(x-1) + log2(x+2) = 1
# log2((x-1)^2) + log2(x+2) = 1
# log2((x-1)^2 * (x+2)) = 1
# (x-1)^2 * (x+2) = 2^1 = 2

def check_x(x):
    if x <= 1:
        return
    lhs = (x - 1)**2 * (x + 2)
    if abs(lhs - 2) < 1e-9:  # floating tolerance
        print(f"x = {x} approximately satisfies equation exactly.")

# Try rational and simple approximate values near domain >1 to find solutions
# As the equation is cubic in x: expand (x-1)^2*(x+2) = 2
# (x-1)^2 = x^2 - 2x +1
# So (x^2 - 2x +1)(x + 2) = 2
# x^3 + 2x^2 - 2x^2 - 4x + x + 2 = 2
# Simplify:
# x^3 - 3x + 2 = 2
# x^3 - 3x = 0
# x(x^2 -3) =0

# Roots are: x=0 and x = ±√3
# Only x=√3 is >1, so candidate is x=sqrt(3) approx 1.732

# Check this root

candidates = [math.sqrt(3)]
print("Testing candidate roots from equation analysis:")
for x in candidates:
    print(f"x = {x} (approx)")
    check_x(x)

# For more approximation and enumeration, print values near that
print("\nEnumerate values x > 1 with step 0.1 to approximate solutions:")
for i in range(11, 21):
    x = i / 10
    lhs = (x - 1)**2 * (x + 2)
    print(f"x = {x:.1f}, (x-1)^2*(x+2) = {lhs:.6f}")

print("\nConfirming exact solution:")
x = math.sqrt(3)
value = (x-1)**2 * (x+2)
print(f"x = sqrt(3) ≈ {x}, (x-1)^2*(x+2) = {value} (should be 2)")
```
