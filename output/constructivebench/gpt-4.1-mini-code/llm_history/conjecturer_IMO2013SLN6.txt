The error stems from the misuse of commas inside the lambda function and the misplaced conjunction ∧ relative to the disjunction ∨. Instead of writing `f = λ x, c ∧ c = -2 ∨ ...`, the correct way is to say `f = λ x, c` where c is one of `-2, -1, 0, 1, 2`. So we want to express that f is a constant function with value c, and c belongs to the set `{ -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 }`.

In Lean, that can be expressed as:

```lean
{ f | ∃ c ∈ ({-2, -1, 0, 1, 2} : Set ℤ), f = λ x, c }
```

This says that f is exactly the constant function with value c and c is one of the specified integers.

This matches the enumerated answers where only the constant functions with these values satisfy the given functional equation.

Hence I propose this corrected answer.

The syntax error arises from trying to use the notation `∃ c ∈ ({-2, -1, 0, 1, 2} : Set ℤ), ...` which Lean does not parse as expected inside a set comprehension `{ f | ... }`. The correct syntax requires using `∃ c, c ∈ {...} ∧ ...` for the membership condition.

Also, since the intended answer set is those functions `f` from ℚ to ℤ which are constant functions taking value in the set `{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}`, the cleanest way is to write:

```lean
{ f | ∃ c, c ∈ ({-2, -1, 0, 1, 2} : Set ℤ) ∧ ∀ x : ℚ, f x = c }
```

instead of using `f = λ x, c`, we use `∀ x, f x = c` since function equality is extensionality in Lean.

Hence the corrected and fully Lean-parsable expression is:

<<<{ f : ℚ → ℤ | ∃ c : ℤ, c ∈ ({-2, -1, 0, 1, 2} : Set ℤ) ∧ ∀ x : ℚ, f x = c }>>>
