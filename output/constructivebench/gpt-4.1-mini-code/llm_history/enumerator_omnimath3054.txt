The problem is about finding digits \(a, b\) with \(1 \leq a \leq 9\), \(0 \leq b \leq 9\) such that swapping the digits forms numbers \(x = 10a + b\) and \(y = 10b + a\), and \(y - x = 54\). We want to find the unique \(d = |a - b|\) with \(d \leq 9\) satisfying this.

We enumerate all possible \(a, b\), check the difference condition, and print the values and \(|a-b|\). We keep track of all candidate \(d\), then display the unique \(d\) involved.

```python
# Enumerate digits a (1 to 9) and b (0 to 9),
# compute x=10a+b, y=10b+a,
# check y - x = 54,
# print each (a,b,x,y,d=|a-b|) found,
# finally print the unique d values.

def main():
    candidates = set()
    for a in range(1, 10):
        for b in range(0, 10):
            x = 10 * a + b
            y = 10 * b + a
            diff = y - x
            if diff == 54:
                d = abs(a - b)
                candidates.add(d)
                print(f"a={a}, b={b}, x={x}, y={y}, y-x={diff}, d=|a-b|={d}")
    print("Candidate d values:", sorted(candidates))
    if len(candidates) == 1:
        print(f"Unique d = {next(iter(candidates))}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
