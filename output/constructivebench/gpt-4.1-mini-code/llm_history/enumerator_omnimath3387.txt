The problem is to find the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that there exists a positive integer \( v \) satisfying all of these:
- \( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \frac{v-k}{60} = \frac{2}{3} \)
- \( v - (n-1) > 0 \)
- and \( v - (n-1) < v \) (which is trivially true for positive \( n > 0 \) and \( v > 0 \))

The key equation boils down to:
\[
\frac{1}{60} \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (v-k) = \frac{2}{3}
\Rightarrow \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (v-k) = 40
\]
This is an arithmetic sum with \( n \) terms starting at \( v \) and decreasing by 1 each time:
\[
\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (v-k) = n v - \frac{n (n-1)}{2} = 40
\]
Given \( n > 0 \), \( v > 0 \), and \( v-(n-1) > 0 \),
we want to find all possible pairs \((n,v)\) with the above conditions and output all such \( n \) and corresponding \( v \), then determine the minimal \( n \).

We will write a Python program enumeration that tries small \( n \) values, calculates \( v \) as \( (40 + n(n-1)/2) / n \), verifies if \( v \) is an integer and \( v-(n-1) > 0 \).

```python
# Enumerate (n,v) satisfying:
# sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (v-k)/60 = 2/3
# i.e., n*v - n(n-1)/2 = 40
# with n>0, v>0, and v-(n-1)>0

def main():
    found = []
    print("Searching for pairs (n,v) with n > 0, v > 0 satisfying sum = 2/3...")
    for n in range(1, 30):  # arbitrary upper bound for n
        numerator = 40 + n*(n-1)//2
        if numerator % n == 0:
            v = numerator // n
            if v > 0 and v - (n-1) > 0:
                # Confirm sum explicitly:
                s = sum((v - k) / 60 for k in range(n))
                if abs(s - 2/3) < 1e-12:
                    print(f"n={n}, v={v}, sum={s}")
                    found.append(n)
    if found:
        min_n = min(found)
        print(f"Minimum n found: {min_n}")
    else:
        print("No solutions found.")

    main()
