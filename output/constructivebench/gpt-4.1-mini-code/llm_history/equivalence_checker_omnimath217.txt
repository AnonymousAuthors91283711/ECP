Ground Truth Answer: fun (n, part_i) => 
    if part_i then 
      ∃ (S : Finset ℕ), S.card = n ∧ (∀ t ⊆ S, t.Nonempty → ∃ k : ℕ, (∏ x ∈ t, x) = k ^ t.card)
    else 
      ¬∃ (S : Set ℕ), S.Infinite ∧ (∀ (t : Finset ℕ), t.Nonempty → (∀ x ∈ t, x ∈ S) → ∃ k : ℕ, (∏ x ∈ t, x) = k ^ t.card)
Proposed Answer: fun x : ℕ × Bool => (x.2 = false ∧ x.1 = 0) ∨ (x.2 = true ∧ x.1 > 0 ∧ x.1 % 2 = 1 ∧ x.1 < 8)
Let me analyze the two answers:

1. The ground truth answer defines a proposition that:
   - For true case: There exists a finite set S of natural numbers with cardinality n where every nonempty subset has a product that's a perfect power of its size
   - For false case: There's no infinite set S where every finite nonempty subset has a product that's a perfect power of its size

2. The proposed answer claims:
   - For false case: x.1 must be 0 (matches ground truth)
   - For true case: x.1 must be odd and less than 8 (this is incorrect)

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
- The ground truth doesn't restrict n to odd numbers < 8 for the true case
- The condition about products of subsets is completely missing in the proposed answer
- The ground truth's condition is much more sophisticated than just checking parity and size
