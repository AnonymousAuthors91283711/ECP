The problem is to find the minimal value abc of abc = a*b*c subject to the system:
a²(b+c) = 1,
b²(c+a) = 2,
c²(a+b) = 5,
with real a,b,c. We want to enumerate possible triples (a,b,c) or at least test rational/positive values that satisfy the system approximately and print the resulting product abc.

Let's try small positive rational values for a,b,c that roughly satisfy the equations and compute abc. Since these are nonlinear, we'll check candidates a,b,c with denominators up to 10 to keep output short.

```python
import itertools

# Enumerate rational triples (a,b,c) with values in {i/10 for i in 1..10}
vals = [i/10 for i in range(1, 11)]
epsilon = 1e-5  # tolerance for checking equations

print("Enumerating candidates for (a,b,c) in positive rationals with denominator ≤ 10:")

min_prod = None
min_abc = None
for a, b, c in itertools.product(vals, repeat=3):
    # check all three equations
    eq1 = abs(a**2 * (b + c) - 1)
    eq2 = abs(b**2 * (c + a) - 2)
    eq3 = abs(c**2 * (a + b) - 5)
    if eq1 < epsilon and eq2 < epsilon and eq3 < epsilon:
        abc = a * b * c
        print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, abc={abc}")
        if min_abc is None or abc < min_abc:
            min_abc = abc
            min_prod = (a, b, c)

if min_prod is not None:
    print(f"Minimal abc found: a={min_prod[0]}, b={min_prod[1]}, c={min_prod[2]}, abc={min_abc}")
else:
    print("No exact solutions found with denominator ≤ 10.")
```
This will enumerate triples with increments of 0.1, print those nearly satisfying the system, and output the minimal product found. This provides concrete examples and candidates to conjecture the minimal value.
