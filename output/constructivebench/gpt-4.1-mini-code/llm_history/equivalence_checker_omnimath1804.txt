Ground Truth Answer: 3970
Proposed Answer: 2^(6 + 6) - 1
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is counting the number of 6×6 binary matrices that can be expressed as an outer product of two binary vectors (one row vector and one column vector).

2. The ground truth answer is 3970, which comes from counting all possible non-zero outer products (2^6 * 2^6 = 4096 total possible outer products, minus 1 for the zero matrix, but this doesn't account for duplicates).

3. The proposed answer is 2^(6+6)-1 = 4095, which counts all possible non-zero combinations of row and column vectors, but fails to account for duplicate matrices that can be formed by different vector pairs (e.g., scaling vectors produces the same matrix).

The proposed answer overcounts because different pairs (r,c) can produce the same matrix f. For example, multiplying r by a constant and dividing c by the same constant gives the same f. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
