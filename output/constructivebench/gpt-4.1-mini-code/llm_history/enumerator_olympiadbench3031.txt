The problem is about finding \( K \) such that the product of all divisors of \( n = 2^{20} \) equals \( 2^K \).

Recall the product of all divisors of \( n \) is \( n^{d/2} \) where \( d \) is the number of divisors of \( n \).

For \( n=2^{20} \), divisors are \( 2^0, 2^1, \dots, 2^{20} \), so \( d = 21 \).

So product = \( (2^{20})^{21/2} = 2^{20 \cdot 21/2} = 2^{210} \).

Let's verify this formula for small powers and output the exponents \( K \).

```python
# Enumerate product of divisors for powers of 2^T for small T, printing the exponent K in 2^K
# The product is (2^T)^{(T+1)/2} = 2^{T*(T+1)/2}
for T in range(1, 11):
    n = 2 ** T
    d = T + 1  # number of divisors of 2^T is T+1
    K = T * d // 2
    print(f"T={T}, n=2^{T}={n}, number of divisors d={d}, product divisor exponent K={K}")

# For the given T=20 case, print special line
T = 20
d = T + 1
K = T * d // 2
print(f"For T={T} => K = {K}")
```
