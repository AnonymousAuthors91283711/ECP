[write_program]
This problem involves counting subsets of the first 15 Fibonacci numbers (from F(2) to F(16)) such that the sum of the chosen subset equals the sum of the remaining elements. We want to find the number of such subsets.

I will write a Python program that:
- Computes the first 15 Fibonacci numbers starting from F(2).
- Enumerates all subsets (using bitmasks).
- Computes sums for chosen and unchosen subsets.
- Prints each subset sum equality found.
- Counts total solutions and outputs the count at the end.

This will help conjecture the answer (omnimath1522_answer).

```python
# Enumerate subsets of first 15 Fibonacci numbers F(2) to F(16)
# Find subsets where sum(chosen) = sum(unchosen)

def fib(n):
    # F(0)=0, F(1)=1
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a

def main():
    n = 15
    # Compute F(2) to F(16)
    fibs = [fib(i) for i in range(2, 2 + n)]
    total_sum = sum(fibs)
    if total_sum % 2 != 0:
        print("No equal partition possible since sum is odd:", total_sum)
        return
    half = total_sum // 2

    count = 0
    # Enumerate all subsets with bitmask
    for mask in range(1 << n):
        s = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if mask & (1 << i):
                s += fibs[i]
        if s == half:
            count += 1
            # Print exact subset indices (0-based)
            chosen = [i for i in range(n) if mask & (1 << i)]
            print(f"Subset with equal sum found: indices {chosen}, sum = {s}")
    print("Total subsets with equal sum:", count)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
