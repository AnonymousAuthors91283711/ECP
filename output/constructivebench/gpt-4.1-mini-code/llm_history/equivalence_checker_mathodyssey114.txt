Ground Truth Answer: 13/288
Proposed Answer: 65 / 2400
Let me analyze the equivalence between the proposed answer (65/2400) and the ground truth answer (13/288).

First, let's simplify both fractions:
- 65/2400 simplifies to 13/480 (dividing numerator and denominator by 5)
- 13/288 is already in simplest form

Now compare 13/480 and 13/288:
- These are clearly different fractions (480 ≠ 288)
- 13/288 ≈ 0.0451389
- 13/480 ≈ 0.0270833

The proposed answer is significantly smaller than the ground truth answer. They are not equivalent.
