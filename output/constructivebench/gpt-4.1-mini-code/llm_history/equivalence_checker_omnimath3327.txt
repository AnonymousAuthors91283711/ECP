Ground Truth Answer: 90
Proposed Answer: (120 : ℝ)
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem is about finding a unique speed (v) where:
   - A truck passes a point at 60 mph with 1/4 mile spacing
   - Cars pass at 75 mph with 3 seconds spacing
   - We need to find v such that exactly 2 cars pass per truck

2. The ground truth answer is 90 mph, which makes sense because:
   - Relative speed to trucks: 90-60 = 30 mph
   - Time between trucks: (1/4)/30 = 1/120 hours = 30 seconds
   - Relative speed to cars: 90-75 = 15 mph
   - Car spacing: 75*(3/3600) = 1/16 miles
   - Time to pass cars: (1/16)/15 = 1/240 hours = 15 seconds
   - Cars per truck: 30/15 = 2 (matches requirement)

3. The proposed answer is 120 mph:
   - Relative speed to trucks: 120-60 = 60 mph
   - Time between trucks: (1/4)/60 = 1/240 hours = 15 seconds
   - Relative speed to cars: 120-75 = 45 mph
   - Car spacing: 1/16 miles (same)
   - Time to pass cars: (1/16)/45 ≈ 5 seconds
   - Cars per truck: 15/5 = 3 (doesn't match requirement of 2)

The proposed answer of 120 mph doesn't satisfy the condition that exactly 2 cars pass per truck.
