The problem involves starting with multisets of integers and applying either of two operations repeatedly:
1. Replace two elements `a` and `b` by their sum `a+b`.
2. Replace an even element `a` by two halves `a/2` and `a/2`.

We start from `{51, 49, 5}` and ask if we can reach a multiset of 105 ones using these operations any number of times. 

This is a complicated combinatorial problem involving partitioning and merging numbers. To enumerate candidates, we can simulate sequences of steps for small cases and print reachable multisets, particularly tracking the number and sum of elements.

Our python program will:
- Represent piles as sorted tuples.
- From a starting multiset, generate next multisets by applying either operation.
- Use BFS/DFS with a set to avoid revisiting multisets.
- Stop searching after a maximum depth or if the size of the smallest element is 1.
- Print newly reached multisets with their parameters.

We'll start with the initial pile `{51,49,5}` and add prints when we find piles with many 1's.

```python
from collections import deque, Counter
from itertools import combinations_with_replacement

def enumerate_reachable(max_steps=20):
    start = tuple(sorted([51,49,5]))
    target_len = 105
    target = tuple([1]*target_len)

    visited = set()
    queue = deque()
    queue.append((start,0))
    visited.add(start)

    while queue:
        piles, steps = queue.popleft()

        if piles == target:
            print("Reached target multiset:", piles)
            continue

        if steps >= max_steps:
            continue

        c = Counter(piles)

        # Operation 1: choose two elements a,b and replace by a+b
        elements = list(piles)
        n = len(elements)
        # Use combinations with replacement to consider a==b case if multiple
        # only if count[a]>=2 when a==b
        seen_pairs = set()
        for i in range(n):
            a = elements[i]
            for j in range(i,n):
                b = elements[j]
                if a == b and c[a]<2:
                    continue
                pair = (a,b)
                if pair in seen_pairs:
                    continue
                seen_pairs.add(pair)
                # build next multiset
                next_counter = c.copy()
                next_counter[a] -= 1
                if next_counter[a]==0:
                    del next_counter[a]
                next_counter[b] -= 1
                if next_counter[b]==0:
                    del next_counter[b]
                s = a+b
                next_counter[s] += 1
                next_piles = tuple(sorted(next_counter.elements()))
                if next_piles not in visited:
                    visited.add(next_piles)
                    print(f"Step {steps+1}: Merge {a} and {b} -> {s}, Next piles: {next_piles}")
                    queue.append((next_piles, steps+1))

        # Operation 2: choose even element a and replace by two halves
        for a in list(c):
            if a%2==0 and c[a]>=1:
                next_counter = c.copy()
                next_counter[a] -= 1
                if next_counter[a]==0:
                    del next_counter[a]
                half = a//2
                next_counter[half] += 2
                next_piles = tuple(sorted(next_counter.elements()))
                if next_piles not in visited:
                    visited.add(next_piles)
                    print(f"Step {steps+1}: Split {a} into {half} and {half}, Next piles: {next_piles}")
                    queue.append((next_piles, steps+1))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Starting enumeration from {51,49,5} aiming for 105 ones, max 20 steps")
    enumerate_reachable()
```

This program enumerates reachable multisets up to 20 steps from the start multiset and prints each new state when discovered. It helps conjecturing the (im)possibility of reaching 105 ones through the given operations.
