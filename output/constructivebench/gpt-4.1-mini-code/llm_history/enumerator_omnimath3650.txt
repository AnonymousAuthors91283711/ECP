The problem is to find pairs of positive integers \( (a,b) \) such that:
- \(\gcd(a,b) = \prod_{i=1}^{50} i\),
- \(\mathrm{lcm}(a,b) = \prod_{i=1}^{50} i^2\).

We need to enumerate all such pairs (or at least those satisfying conditions for smaller ranges) to conjecture how many there are.

Key observations:
- Let \(G = \prod_{i=1}^{n} i\).
- The gcd is \(G\), and lcm is \(G^2\).
- By the identity \(a \times b = \gcd(a,b) \times \mathrm{lcm}(a,b)\), here \(a \times b = G \times G^2 = G^3\).
- Since \(G = \prod p^{e_p}\) for prime factorization, let \(a = G \times x\) and \(b = G \times y\) where \(\gcd(x,y) = 1\) and \(x \times y = G\).
- Therefore, the problem reduces to finding coprime pairs \(x,y\) with product \(G\).

So the problem reduces to counting the number of coprime pairs \((x,y)\) such that \(x \times y = G\).

Since \(G\) is the factorial, factor it into primes for some smaller \(n\), find the factorization, and find coprime pairs (pairs of divisors of \(G\) with gcd 1 and product \(G\)).

To keep output small and efficient, we'll implement it for smaller \(n\), like \(n=5,10,15\), and print the parameters and the count of such pairs.

We'll also print all pairs (a,b) for \(n=5\), which is small enough.
