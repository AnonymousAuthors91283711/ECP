The sequence is defined by \(a_{n+1} = a_n^3 - 3a_n^2 + 3\). We want to find all real \(x\) such that \(a_0 = x = a_{2007}\).

We will enumerate possible \(a_0 = x\) in a reasonable range (say integers within -10 to 10) and track the orbit up to 2007 steps, printing those initial values which satisfy \(a_{2007} = a_0\).

```python
# Enumerate integer candidates x in [-10,10], checking if after 2007 iterations
# a_{n+1} = a_n^3 - 3 a_n^2 + 3, we have a_2007 = a_0 = x.
# Print such x immediately.
# This should reveal fixed points and any periodic points of period dividing 2007.
# Use a dict to store visited values to detect cycles quickly and avoid computing all 2007 steps.

def f(x):
    return x**3 - 3*x**2 + 3

def iterate(x0, steps=2007):
    x = x0
    for _ in range(steps):
        x = f(x)
    return x

def main():
    print("Checking integer initial values from -10 to 10:")
    candidates = []
    for x0 in range(-10, 11):
        x2007 = iterate(x0, 2007)
        if abs(x2007 - x0) < 1e-14:
            print(f"Initial x = {x0}, a_2007 = {x2007}, satisfies a_0 = a_2007.")
            candidates.append(x0)
    if candidates:
        print("Candidates found:", candidates)
    else:
        print("No integer candidates found.")
        
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
