theorem omnimath741 :
  let S := {n | n ∈ Icc 1 2024 ∧ Nat.gcd (99 + n) (99 * n + 1) = 1 ∧ Nat.gcd (101 + n) (101 * n + 1) = 1}
  (Set.ncard S : ℚ) / 2024 = omnimath741_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 96 / 595
Proposed Answer: 191/2024
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is counting numbers n from 1 to 2024 that satisfy two gcd conditions:
   - gcd(99 + n, 99n + 1) = 1
   - gcd(101 + n, 101n + 1) = 1

2. The ground truth answer is 96/595 ≈ 0.16134
3. The proposed answer is 191/2024 ≈ 0.09437

The two answers are significantly different (nearly 40% relative difference). The proposed answer is much smaller than the ground truth answer, suggesting it's counting far fewer numbers that satisfy the conditions.

Since the answers are numerically different and there's no obvious simplification that would make them equivalent, we should conclude they're not the same.
