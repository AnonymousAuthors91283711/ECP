Ground Truth Answer: (5, 247)
Proposed Answer: (32, 2079)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about calculating a probability ratio (even_arrangements/total_arrangements) in reduced form.

2. The ground truth answer is (5, 247), meaning the simplified fraction is 5/247.

3. The proposed answer is (32, 2079), meaning the simplified fraction is 32/2079.

4. Let's check if these fractions are equivalent:
   - 5/247 ≈ 0.0202429
   - 32/2079 ≈ 0.0153920
   These are clearly different values.

5. The proposed answer is not equivalent to the ground truth answer, and it's not just a matter of different domains/constraints - the values themselves are different.
