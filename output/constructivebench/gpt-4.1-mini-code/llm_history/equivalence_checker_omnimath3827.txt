sorry

Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ a b : ℝ, f = (fun x => a * x + b) ∧ ((a = 0 ∧ b = 0) ∨ (a = 1 ∧ b = -1)) }
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer captures some correct solutions (the zero function when a=0, b=0 and the identity-minus-one function when a=1, b=-1), but it's incomplete as it doesn't consider all possible solutions to the functional equation. The functional equation f(x*y) = f(x)*f(y) + f(f(x+y)) might have other solutions not covered by this form, so the answer is partially correct but not fully comprehensive.
