The problem appears to involve simplifying the product \(2 \times \frac{1}{3} \times 3 \times \frac{1}{2}\). To explore this, I will write a short Python program to enumerate partial products of the sequence and print results as exact fractions, verifying simplification step-by-step.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Sequence of factors to multiply
factors = [2, Fraction(1, 3), 3, Fraction(1, 2)]

product = Fraction(1, 1)
print("Partial products:")
for i, f in enumerate(factors, start=1):
    product *= f
    print(f"After multiplying element {i}: {product} (approx {float(product)})")

print("\nFinal product as exact fraction:", product)
print("Final product as float:", float(product))
```
This program computes the product stepwise and prints exact fractions to aid understanding.
