The problem is about finding the greatest number \( k \) of voters who unanimously rank some candidate in a certain position across all voters, given rankings with possibly different numbers of candidates (\(N\)) and voters (2019). To assist in conjecturing the answer, we enumerate achievable numbers of such unanimous positions \(k\) by constructing candidate rankings and counting their unanimous votes. We'll try small \(N\) and enumerate possible \(k\).

```python
# Enumerate numbers of positions k achievable where a candidate is unanimously ranked there
# votes: a list of rankings (per voter), each ranking is a permutation of candidates
# A unanimous position is a position j where all voters have the same candidate

from itertools import permutations

def count_unanimous_positions(rankings):
    n_voters = len(rankings)
    n_positions = len(rankings[0])
    k = 0
    for pos in range(n_positions):
        # Check candidate in position pos for all voters
        c = rankings[0][pos]
        if all(r[pos] == c for r in rankings):
            k += 1
    return k

def main():
    n_voters = 3  # small sample since 2019 is large
    candidates = [0,1,2]  # small candidate set to keep computations small

    seen = set()
    # Enumerate all possible rankings per voter
    perms = list(permutations(candidates))
    # Enumerate all vote profiles (for small n_voters = 3)
    import sys
    for vote1 in perms:
        for vote2 in perms:
            for vote3 in perms:
                rankings = [vote1, vote2, vote3]
                k = count_unanimous_positions(rankings)
                if k not in seen:
                    seen.add(k)
                    print(f"Number of unanimous positions k = {k} found with rankings:")
                    for i, r in enumerate(rankings):
                        print(f"Voter {i+1}: {r}")
                    sys.stdout.flush()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
