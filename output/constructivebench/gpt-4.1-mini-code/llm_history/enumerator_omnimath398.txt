The problem asks to find the exact value of the sum of cubes of the first 2001 natural numbers:
\[
\sum_{n=1}^{2001} n^3.
\]
We know the formula for the sum of cubes:
\[
\sum_{n=1}^m n^3 = \left(\frac{m(m+1)}{2}\right)^2.
\]
I will write a Python program enumerating the sum of cubes for some small values \(m\), printing the exact values, and also compute it for \(m=2001\) using the formula.

```python
def sum_cubes(m):
    # Use the known formula for exact sum of cubes.
    val = (m * (m + 1) // 2) ** 2
    print(f"Sum of cubes 1^3 to {m}^3 = {val}")
    return val

# Sample values
for m in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100]:
    sum_cubes(m)

# Compute for 2001 as requested
sum_cubes(2001)
```
