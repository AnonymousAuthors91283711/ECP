Ground Truth Answer: 502
Proposed Answer: 503
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves evaluating a product from n=0 to 501 (since Finset.range 502 gives {0,1,...,501}) of the expression (4*(n+2))/(4*(n+1)).

2. The expression simplifies to (n+2)/(n+1) since the 4's cancel out.

3. The product becomes a telescoping product:
   (2/1) * (3/2) * (4/3) * ... * (503/502)

4. Most terms cancel out, leaving just 503/1 = 503 in the numerator and 1 in the denominator.

5. Therefore, the correct answer should be 503, not 502.

The ground truth answer claims 502, but the correct answer is indeed 503 as shown in the proposed answer. The ground truth appears to be off by 1.
