Ground Truth Answer: 14
Proposed Answer: 8 * 60 - (7 * 60 + 30 + 16)
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is the expression `8 * 60 - (7 * 60 + 30 + 16)`, which simplifies to `480 - (420 + 30 + 16) = 480 - 466 = 14`. This matches exactly with the ground truth answer of `14`. Therefore, the two answers are equivalent.
