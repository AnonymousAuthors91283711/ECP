[write_program]
The problem seems to involve verifying or finding a value for an expression involving fractions. We can write a python program to compute the expression exactly as rational fractions and enumerate values for similar expressions to assist in conjecturing the true answer.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Evaluate the expression 1/4 + (1/3) * ((3/4) - 1/4) exactly
frac1 = Fraction(1,4)
frac2 = Fraction(1,3)
frac3 = Fraction(3,4)
frac4 = Fraction(1,4)

# Calculate inner difference
diff = frac3 - frac4

# Calculate total expression
result = frac1 + frac2 * diff

print("Expression:")
print("1/4 + (1/3) * ((3/4) - 1/4) =", result)

# Additional enumeration to help conjecture patterns
# Enumerate values of form 1/a + (1/b)*((c/d) - (e/f)) for small denominators
print("\nEnumerating similar expressions for small denominators:")
for a in range(2,5):
    for b in range(2,5):
        for c in range(1,5):
            for d in range(1, 6):
                for e in range(1,5):
                    for f in range(1,6):
                        if d != 0 and f != 0:
                            try:
                                val = Fraction(1,a) + Fraction(1,b)*(Fraction(c,d)-Fraction(e,f))
                                print(f"1/{a} + 1/{b}*(({c}/{d}) - {e}/{f}) = {val}")
                            except ZeroDivisionError:
                                continue
```
