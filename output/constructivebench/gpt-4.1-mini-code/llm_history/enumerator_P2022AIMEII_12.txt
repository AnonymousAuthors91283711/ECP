This problem involves minimizing the sum \( s = a+b \) subject to constraints involving \( a, b, x, y \), and a unit disk constraint on \( x, y \). The key relations are linear in \( a, b, x, y \):

- \( a > 4 \),
- \( b > 1 \),
- \( x + 4y = a \),
- \( 5x + y = b \),
- \( x^2 + y^2 \leq 1 \),
- and \( s = a + b \).

To explore numerically, we can try points \((x,y)\) on the unit circle (and inside) and get corresponding \(a, b\), then check constraints, and print \(s\). We're interested in the minimum \( s \).

We enumerate over discretized \(x,y \in [-1,1]\), check \( x^2 + y^2 \leq 1\), compute \(a,b\), check \(a>4, b>1\), and print \(s\). Then we keep track of the minimal \( s \) found.

```python
import math

def main():
    min_s = None
    # Discretize x,y in unit disk with step 0.05 for efficiency and coverage
    step = 0.05
    xs = [i*step for i in range(-20, 21)]  # -1 to 1
    ys = [i*step for i in range(-20, 21)]

    for x in xs:
        for y in ys:
            if x*x + y*y <= 1 + 1e-12:  # inside unit circle
                a = x + 4*y
                b = 5*x + y
                if a > 4 and b > 1:
                    s = a + b
                    print(f"s = {s:.6f} for (x,y)=({x:.2f},{y:.2f}), a={a:.6f}, b={b:.6f}")
                    if min_s is None or s < min_s:
                        min_s = s
    if min_s is not None:
        print(f"Minimum s found (approx): {min_s:.6f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
