. Enumerated answers: Checking rational α = p/q with 1 ≤ p ≤ 12, 1 ≤ q ≤ 12, gcd(p,q)=1
α = 2/1 passes divisibility for n=1..12
α = 4/1 passes divisibility for n=1..12
α = 6/1 passes divisibility for n=1..12
α = 8/1 passes divisibility for n=1..12
α = 10/1 passes divisibility for n=1..12
α = 12/1 passes divisibility for n=1..12. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
<<<{α : ℝ | ∃ k : ℤ, α = 2 * k}>>>
