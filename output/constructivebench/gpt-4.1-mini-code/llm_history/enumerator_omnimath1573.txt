The problem involves finding positive integers \( k \) such that for some \( m \), there exists a set \( S \subseteq \mathbb{N} \) for which the number of finite subsets \( T \subseteq S \) with sum \( n \) is exactly \( k \), for all \( n > m \). We want to find all such values of \( k \).

To explore and conjecture about possible values of \( k \), we can:
- Enumerate finite sets \( S \subseteq \{1, \dots, M\} \) for a small \( M \).
- For each \( S \), for each \( n \) up to some limit, count how many subsets of \( S \) sum to \( n \).
- Observe counts that remain stable and repeatedly appear for large \( n \).
- Collect values \( k \) that appear as stable counts.

Since enumerating all subsets for large \( S \) or large \( n \) is expensive, we limit \( M \) and \( n \) to small values (e.g., \( M=10 \), \( n \leq 50 \)).

This enumeration will print candidates for \( k \) and the sets \( S \) that realize them, to assist conjecturing the answer type.

```python
from itertools import combinations
from collections import defaultdict

def subsets_sums(S, max_sum):
    # Count how many subsets of S sum to each value <= max_sum
    count = [0]*(max_sum+1)
    count[0] = 1
    for x in S:
        for s in range(max_sum - x, -1, -1):
            if count[s] > 0:
                count[s+x] += count[s]
    return count

def main():
    MAX_M = 10  # max element in S
    MAX_N = 50  # max n to check sums for
    candidates = defaultdict(list)  # maps k to list of S's that realize count k for some stable range

    # Enumerate subsets S of {1,...,MAX_M} with size 2 to 5 (avoid empty or singletons)
    for size in range(2, 6):
        for S in combinations(range(1, MAX_M+1), size):
            sums_count = subsets_sums(S, MAX_N)
            # We check if the counts stabilize at some constant k for n in last 10 values near MAX_N
            tail = sums_count[MAX_N-9:MAX_N+1]
            # Consider k valid if all counts in tail equal and > 0 (so subset sums always count k)
            if len(tail) == 10 and len(set(tail)) == 1 and tail[0] > 0:
                k = tail[0]
                print(f"Candidate k={k} from set S={S} with stable sum counts at sums near {MAX_N}")
                candidates[k].append(S)

    print("\nSummary of candidate k values found:")
    for k in sorted(candidates):
        print(f"k={k} from sets: {candidates[k]}")

if __name__=="__main__":
    main()
