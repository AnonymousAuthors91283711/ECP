The problem is about finding the smallest natural number \( n \) such that there exists a family \( f \) of subsets of an 8-element set (specifically subsets of \(\text{Fin } 8\)) indexed by \(\text{Fin } n\), each with size 2 or 3, and every pair \(\{x,y\}\) from the 8-element set is contained in exactly one of these subsets. We want to find the minimal \( n \).

This corresponds to a set system (a hypergraph) on 8 vertices with edges of size 2 or 3 covering each pair exactly once.

We will try to enumerate small values of \( n \) and check if it's possible to cover all pairs exactly once with \( n \) subsets of size 2 or 3.

There are \(\binom{8}{2} = 28\) pairs in total.

Each subset of size 2 covers 1 pair; each of size 3 covers 3 pairs.

So the total pairs covered by \( n \) subsets where each has size 2 or 3 must be exactly 28, with every pair covered exactly once.

We can try to find possible combinations of 2-subsets and 3-subsets that sum to 28 pairs:

Let \(x\) = number of subsets of size 2, \(y\) = number of subsets of size 3.

Then:

\[ x + 3y = 28 \quad \text{and} \quad x + y = n \]

We want to try reasonable \(n\) values to see which ones \(n = x+y\) can work with integral \(x,y \geq 0\).

Potential pairs \((x,y)\):

- \(y=0 \to x=28 \to n=28\)
- \(y=1 \to x=25 \to n=26\)
- \(y=2 \to x=22 \to n=24\)
- ...
- \(y=9 \to x=1 \to n=10\)

Since \(n\) is the total number of subsets, minimal \(n\) is found by minimizing \(x+y = n\) with \(x+3y=28\).

Now, enumerate possible values for \(n\) from 10 upwards to 28 and check feasibility.

We output tentative values of \(n\) along with \((x,y)\) combinations.

Given the problem complexity, we attempt enumeration only for small \(n\), focusing on the possible distributions of edges.

```python
# Enumerate possible (x,y) where x = #2-subsets, y = #3-subsets, x+3y=28, n=x+y
# For each n in range from smallest to largest, print possible decompositions

def main():
    total_pairs = 28  # number of pairs in 8 elements
    print("All (x,y,n) with x+3y=28 and n=x+y:")
    for y in range(total_pairs // 3 + 1):
        x = total_pairs - 3*y
        n = x + y
        if x >= 0:
            print(f"x={x}, y={y}, n={n}")
    print("\nMinimal n candidates from above:")
    # minimal n is min x+y
    n_candidates = [x + y for x, y in ((total_pairs - 3*y, y) for y in range(total_pairs // 3 +1)) if total_pairs -3*y >= 0]
    print(min(n_candidates))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code outputs the possible distributions \((x,y)\) of subsets of size 2 and 3 with total pairs exactly 28 and identifies the minimal possible number \(n\). This helps in conjecturing the minimal \(n\).

Further refinements would involve checking explicit coverings but this is too large for enumeration here.
