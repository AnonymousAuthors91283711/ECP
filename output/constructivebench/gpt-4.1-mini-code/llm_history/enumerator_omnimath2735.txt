The problem involves finding a natural number \( n \) such that \( 3n = 9 + 9 + 9 \). This simplifies to \( 3n = 27 \), so \( n = 9 \). To assist in conjecturing this, we can programmatically check values of \( n \) such that \( 3n = 27 \) within a reasonable range.

```python
# Enumerate natural numbers n where 3*n = 27 and print them.
target = 9 + 9 + 9  # 27
for n in range(target + 1):
    if 3 * n == target:
        print(f"Found n: {n}")
print("Minimum n satisfying 3n=27 is 9")
```
