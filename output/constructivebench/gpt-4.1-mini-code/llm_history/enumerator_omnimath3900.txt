The problem deals with a function \( f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \) such that:

1. The number of divisors of \( f(x) \) is exactly \( x \).
2. For all \( x, y \), \( f(xy) \) divides \((x-1) \cdot y^{xy - 1} \cdot f(x) \).

The challenge is to hypothesize what \( f \) might be.

We will enumerate values of \( f(x) \) that have exactly \( x \) divisors, for \( x = 1 \) to 10 or so, then test divisibility conditions for small pairs \( (x,y) \).

We will print \( x \), all \( f(x) \) candidates with exactly \( x \) divisors, and then test the divisibility condition for a few values.

```python
# Enumerate numbers with exactly n divisors up to a limit
def divisors_count(n):
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5)+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 2 if i*i != n else 1
    return count

# For each x, find numbers with exactly x divisors up to some limit
max_x = 10
max_val = 5000  # moderate limit for checking divisor counts

# Store candidate f(x) for each x
candidates = {}

print("Candidates for f(x) with exactly x divisors:")
for x in range(1, max_x+1):
    cands = []
    for val in range(1, max_val+1):
        if divisors_count(val) == x:
            cands.append(val)
            if len(cands) <=5:
                print(f"x={x}, f(x)={val}")
    candidates[x] = cands

print("\nTesting divisibility condition f(xy) | (x-1)*y^{xy-1}*f(x) for small x,y:")

def power(base, exp):
    # safe power for int
    return base ** exp

for x in range(1, 5):
    for y in range(1, 5):
        xy = x*y
        # Enumerate over candidate f(xy) and f(x)
        fxy_candidates = candidates.get(xy, [])
        fx_candidates = candidates.get(x, [])
        if not fxy_candidates or not fx_candidates:
            continue
        # We'll try all pairs and print those that satisfy divisibility condition
        for fxy in fxy_candidates:
            for fx in fx_candidates:
                divisor_expr = (x-1) * (y**(xy-1)) * fx if x>1 else 0  # (x-1)=0 for x=1 means divisor_expr=0
                if divisor_expr == 0:
                    # division by zero problem; skip as x=1 case trivial?
                    continue
                if divisor_expr % fxy == 0:
                    print(f"x={x}, y={y}, f(xy)={fxy}, f(x)={fx}, divides {divisor_expr}")

# Narrow down observations: for x=1, divisor count=1, only f(1)=1
print("\nObservations:")
print("f(1)=1 because only 1 has exactly 1 divisor")
print("Try f(x) = x's factorial or powers? Or maybe f(x) = some function related to x's divisors.")

```
This enumerator explores divisor counts and checks the divisibility condition; reviewing output may help conjecture the exact formula for \( f \).
