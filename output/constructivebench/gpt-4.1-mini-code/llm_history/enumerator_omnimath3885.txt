The problem concerns functions \( f: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z} \) satisfying, for all integers \(a, b\),
\[
f^{a^2 + b^2}(a+b) = a f(a) + b f(b),
\]
where \(f^n\) denotes the \(n\)-th iterate of \(f\). Our goal is to enumerate possible functions \(f\) that satisfy this property for small integers \(a, b\).

We will:
- Test several candidate functions \(f\), including linear functions \(f(x) = c x\) for some integer \(c\).
- Verify the constraint for small \(a, b\) and detect whether it holds.
- Print out functions \(f(x) = c x\) that satisfy the constraint for all tested \(a, b\).

This might help conjecture the form of all such \(f\).

```python
# Enumerator to identify integer-valued functions f: Z->Z satisfying
# f^[a^2 + b^2](a+b) = a f(a) + b f(b) for all integers a,b.
# We test functions f(x) = c*x for integer c in a modest range,
# and verify the equation for small |a|, |b| <= 3.

def iterate_f(f, x, n):
    # Computes f iterated n times on x
    for _ in range(n):
        x = f(x)
    return x

def main():
    # Candidates f(x) = c*x for c in [-3..3]
    candidates = range(-3, 4)
    tested_pairs = [(a, b)
                    for a in range(-3,4)
                    for b in range(-3,4)]
    tested_pairs = [p for p in tested_pairs if p != (0,0)]  # exclude (0,0) as trivial

    for c in candidates:
        def f(x): return c*x
        # Check the condition for all tested (a,b)
        failed = False
        for a, b in tested_pairs:
            n = a*a + b*b
            lhs = iterate_f(f, a + b, n)
            rhs = a*f(a) + b*f(b)
            if lhs != rhs:
                failed = True
                break
        if not failed:
            print(f"Function f(x) = {c}*x satisfies the condition for |a|,|b|<=3")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
