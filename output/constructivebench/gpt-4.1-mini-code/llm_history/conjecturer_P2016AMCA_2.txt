theorem P2016AMCA_2 (x : ℝ) : 
  (10 : ℝ)^x * (100 : ℝ)^(2*x) = (1000 : ℝ)^5 ↔ x = P2016AMCA_2_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Checking candidates for x where 10^x * 100^(2x) = 1000^5
x = 12/4 = 3.0 satisfies the equation (approx).
x = 15/5 = 3.0 satisfies the equation (approx).
x = 18/6 = 3.0 satisfies the equation (approx).
x = 21/7 = 3.0 satisfies the equation (approx).
x = 24/8 = 3.0 satisfies the equation (approx).
x = 27/9 = 3.0 satisfies the equation (approx).
By rewriting with exponents, exact x = 3 is the solution.
x = 3. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<3>>>
