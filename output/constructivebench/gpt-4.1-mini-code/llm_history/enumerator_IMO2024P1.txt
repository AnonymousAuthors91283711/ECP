The problem involves finding all real numbers \(\alpha\) such that for every positive integer \(n\), the integer \(n\) divides the sum of the floor of \((i+1)\alpha\) from \(i=0\) to \(n-1\).

To get insight, let's enumerate this condition for some small sample values of \(\alpha\) and \(n\), and print values that satisfy the divisibility condition:

```python
# Enumerate candidates for alpha and test divisibility condition
# Condition: for all n in 1..N, n divides sum_{i=0}^{n-1} floor((i+1)*alpha)

from math import floor

MAX_N = 10  # Check n from 1 to 10
STEP = 0.25  # Step size for alpha enumeration

print("Enumerating alpha candidates that satisfy divisibility for n=1..", MAX_N)
for numerator in range(1, 21):  # small numerator for rational alpha candidates
    for denominator in range(1, 21):
        alpha = numerator / denominator
        divisible_all = True
        for n in range(1, MAX_N + 1):
            s = 0
            for i in range(n):
                s += floor((i+1)*alpha)
            if s % n != 0:
                divisible_all = False
                break
        if divisible_all:
            print(f"Possible alpha: {alpha} = {numerator}/{denominator}")

# Also check a few integers and zero
for alpha in [0, 1, 2, 3, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5]:
    divisible_all = True
    for n in range(1, MAX_N + 1):
        s = sum(floor((i+1)*alpha) for i in range(n))
        if s % n != 0:
            divisible_all = False
            break
    if divisible_all:
        print(f"Possible alpha: {alpha} (tested as float)")

# The output shows rational values of alpha with small denominators that satisfy the condition for n up to 10.
```

This program tests many rational candidates for \(\alpha\) and prints those that satisfy the divisibility condition for all \(n\) up to 10, aiming to help conjecture the exact answer set.
