The problem involves a function on integers \( x \) with a condition that \( 3x + 1 \) is even. Since \( 3x+1 \) even means \( 3x \equiv -1 \equiv 1 \pmod{2} \), and \(3x\) mod 2 depends on \(x\) mod 2. So \(3x+1\) even implies \(x\) is odd (since odd times 3 is odd, plus 1 = even).

The goal is to find a function \( f:\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z} \) such that given \(3x+1\) even (x odd), \( f(x) \) is odd.

We can enumerate \(x\) in some range, check the hypothesis and see what should \(f(x)\) be to satisfy the theorem predicate.

```python
# Enumerate integers x, check if 3x+1 is even, then find candidates for f(x) odd.

def omnimath3405_answer(x):
    # unknown function; let's try to find one making result odd
    # try f(x) = x or x+1 or other simple expressions
    candidates = [x, x+1, x-1, 2*x+1, 2*x-1]
    # return first candidate which is odd
    for c in candidates:
        if c % 2 == 1:
            return c
    return None

print("Enumerating x in [-10..10], show x with 3x+1 even and f(x) odd:")
for x in range(-10, 11):
    if (3*x + 1) % 2 == 0:
        fx = omnimath3405_answer(x)
        if fx is not None and fx %2 ==1:
            print(f"x={x}, 3x+1={3*x+1} even, f(x)={fx} odd")
```

This will print examples of \(x\) with the condition and a function value odd, for plausible guesses of the mysterious function. The program can be extended to other formulas as needed.
