[write_program]
The problem involves analyzing digits of numbers of the form \( n \cdot 5^m \) in base 10, and checking for the appearance of the digit 5 in them for sufficiently large \( m \).

We will test small values of \( n \), for example from 1 to 20, and for each \( n \), find the smallest \( k \) such that for all \( m \geq k \), the number \( n \cdot 5^m \) contains digit 5.

The program will print:
- The current \( n \).
- For each \( n \), the candidates for \( k \).
- If no such \( k \) exists up to some threshold (say 30), we print that no \( k \) was found.

This will help conjecture the nature of the solution.

```python
# Enumerate n from 1 to 20
# For each n, find k such that for all m >= k, digit 5 appears in n*5^m

def has_digit_5(x):
    return '5' in str(x)

def test_n(n, max_m=30):
    # For m from 0 to max_m, record if digit 5 appears in n*5^m
    appearances = [has_digit_5(n * 5**m) for m in range(max_m+1)]
    # Find minimal k such that for all m >= k, appearances[m] == True
    for k in range(max_m+1):
        if all(appearances[m] for m in range(k, max_m+1)):
            return k
    return None

print("n, minimal k or None (if not found up to max_m=30)")

for n in range(1, 21):
    k = test_n(n)
    print(f"{n}: k={k}")
```
