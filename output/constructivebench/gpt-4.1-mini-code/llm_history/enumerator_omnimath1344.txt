[write_program]
The problem involves real variables \(x, y, \theta\) with positive \(x,y\) and \(\theta\) not a multiple of \(\pi/2\). There are two equations involving trigonometric expressions and powers of \(x,y\). We want to find the value of \(x/y + y/x\).

To investigate, I will write a Python program that:

- Selects sample values of \(\theta\) avoiding multiples of \(\pi/2\).
- For some small integer values of \(x,y>0\), checks if the first equation approximately holds (since it's an equality with transcendental functions).
- If it does, checks the second equation.
- If both hold approximately, print the value \(x/y + y/x\).

This enumeration might discover some candidate values or patterns to conjecture the closed form value.

We will try \(x,y\) in a small integer range (e.g. 1 to 10) and \(\theta\) a few angles (e.g. \(\pi/6, \pi/4, \pi/3, \pi/5\)) ensuring no division by zero or invalid values.

```python
# Enumerate candidate values for x/y + y/x satisfying given equations approximately
import math

def approx_eq(a, b, tol=1e-7):
    return abs(a - b) < tol

def main():
    # Sample theta values avoiding multiples of pi/2
    thetas = [math.pi/6, math.pi/4, math.pi/3, math.pi/5]
    print("theta values used (radians):", thetas)
    found = set()
    for theta in thetas:
        sin_theta = math.sin(theta)
        cos_theta = math.cos(theta)
        sin_2theta = math.sin(2*theta)
        for x in range(1, 11):
            for y in range(1, 11):
                # Check x,y > 0
                # Check first equation: sin(theta)/x â‰ˆ cos(theta)/y
                lhs1 = sin_theta / x
                rhs1 = cos_theta / y
                if approx_eq(lhs1, rhs1):
                    # Check second equation:
                    lhs2 = (cos_theta **4) / (x **4) + (sin_theta **4) / (y **4)
                    denom = (x**3)*y + (y**3)*x
                    if denom == 0:
                        continue
                    rhs2 = 97 * sin_2theta / denom
                    if approx_eq(lhs2, rhs2):
                        val = x / y + y / x
                        # To avoid printing duplicates due to approximate equality
                        val_rnd = round(val, 7)
                        if val_rnd not in found:
                            found.add(val_rnd)
                            print(f"x={x}, y={y}, theta={theta:.6f} => x/y + y/x = {val_rnd}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
