Total count: 0. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The inequality log(x-40) + log(60-x) < 2 is equivalent to log((x-40)(60-x)) < 2, or (x-40)(60-x) < e². The quadratic (x-40)(60-x) attains maximum 100 at x=50. Since e² ≈ 7.389, which is much smaller than values for most x in (40,60), no integer x satisfies the inequality. Thus the answer is 0.
