abbrev omnimath52_answer : Set (ℕ × ℕ) := sorry
theorem omnimath52 (a n : ℕ) (ha : a > 0) (hn : n > 0) :
  n ∣ ((a + 1)^n - a^n) ↔ (a, n) ∈ omnimath52_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: { (a, n) | n = 1 ∧ a > 0 }
Proposed Answer: { (a, n) | n = 1 }
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for pairs (a,n) where n divides (a+1)^n - a^n, with constraints a>0 and n>0.

2. Ground truth answer says this only happens when n=1 (and maintains the a>0 condition).

3. Proposed answer says this happens when n=1, but doesn't maintain the a>0 condition.

The key observations:
- For n=1, (a+1)^1 - a^1 = 1, and 1 divides 1 for any a (including a=0)
- But the problem specifies a>0 and n>0 as conditions
- The ground truth maintains these conditions in the answer
- The proposed answer drops the a>0 condition

While mathematically the proposed answer is correct for the general case (without the a>0 constraint), it doesn't match the exact conditions specified in the problem. Therefore:
