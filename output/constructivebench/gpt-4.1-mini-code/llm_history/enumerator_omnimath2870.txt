The problem involves a rational number answer and a theorem statement. To assist in conjecturing the true answer, let's enumerate rational numbers with small denominators between 0 and 1 and print those that might be relevant near 11/120 (~0.091666...). This will help narrow down the value by listing rationals close to the conjectured answer.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Enumerate fractions with denominators up to 20 between 0 and 1
# Print each fraction and its float value
# Highlight fractions near 11/120 to assist conjecture
target = Fraction(11, 120)
threshold = Fraction(5, 120)  # +/- 5/120 around the target

print(f"Target fraction: {target} ≈ {float(target):.6f}")

for denom in range(1, 21):
    for num in range(0, denom + 1):
        frac = Fraction(num, denom)
        diff = abs(frac - target)
        if diff <= threshold:
            print(f"Candidate fraction: {frac} ≈ {float(frac):.6f}")
```
