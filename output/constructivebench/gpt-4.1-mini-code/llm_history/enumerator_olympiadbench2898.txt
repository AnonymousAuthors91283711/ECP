The problem involves real numbers \(x, y, z, T\) with certain multiplicative relations and \(T = 4 \sqrt{5}\). We want to explore possible \(x\) satisfying the system:

\[
\begin{cases}
xy = \sqrt{5} \\
yz = 5 \\
xz = T = 4\sqrt{5}
\end{cases}
\]

By substitution:

From \(xy = \sqrt{5}\), \(y = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{x}\).

From \(yz = 5\), \(z = \frac{5}{y} = \frac{5}{\sqrt{5}/x} = x \sqrt{5}\).

Check \(xz = 4 \sqrt{5} \implies x \cdot z = x \cdot (x \sqrt{5}) = x^2 \sqrt{5} = 4 \sqrt{5} \implies x^2 = 4 \implies x = \pm 2\).

So \(x = \pm 2\). Let's verify and enumerate this in a small Python program that prints all valid \(x\) values satisfying the constraints exactly.

```python
# Enumerate possible x given the constraints:
# x*y = sqrt(5), y*z = 5, x*z = 4*sqrt(5)
# We consider that all numbers are real

import math

sqrt5 = math.sqrt(5)
T = 4 * sqrt5

# We'll enumerate values of x over a small domain since the problem is constrained
# but here we solve algebraically: 
# From x*y = sqrt(5), y = sqrt(5)/x
# From y*z = 5, z = 5/y = 5 * x / sqrt(5) = x * sqrt(5)
# From x*z = 4*sqrt(5), x * z = x * x * sqrt(5) = x^2 * sqrt(5) = 4 * sqrt(5) => x^2 = 4 => x = ±2

candidates = [2, -2]

for x in candidates:
    y = sqrt5 / x
    z = 5 / y
    lhs1 = x * y
    lhs2 = y * z
    lhs3 = x * z
    print(f"x = {x}")
    print(f"x*y = {lhs1}")
    print(f"y*z = {lhs2}")
    print(f"x*z = {lhs3}")
    print("---")

print("Extremal solutions for x: ±2")
```

This lists all valid \(x\) values conforming to the problem, enabling conjecture and further proof.
