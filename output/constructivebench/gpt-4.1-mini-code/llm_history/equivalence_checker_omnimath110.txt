Ground Truth Answer: { (0, 0) } ∪ { (f, g) | f = g ∧ f 0 = 0 }
Proposed Answer: {(λ x => 0, λ x => 0), (λ x => -1, λ x => x - 1), (λ x => 1, λ x => -x + 1), (λ x => x, λ x => x)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers carefully.

The functional equation is: ∀ x y, f (x + y * g x) = g x + x * f y

Ground Truth Answer gives us two cases:
1. The zero function pair (0,0)
2. All pairs where f = g and f(0) = 0

Proposed Answer gives four specific function pairs:
1. (0,0) - matches first case of ground truth
2. (-1, x-1) - f ≠ g here
3. (1, -x+1) - f ≠ g here
4. (x,x) - matches second case of ground truth (with f(0)=0)

The proposed answer includes two pairs that don't satisfy f = g, which violates the ground truth condition. Also, it's missing many other possible solutions where f = g and f(0)=0 (like (2x,2x), (x²,x²), etc.).
