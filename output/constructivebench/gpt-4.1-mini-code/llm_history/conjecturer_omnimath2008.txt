. Enumerated answers: Enumerating solutions n with 1 ≤ n ≤ 100...
n = 1, sum_1^n = 1, 15 * sum_(n+1)^2 squares = 60, divisible: yes
n = 2, sum_1^n = 3, 15 * sum_(n+1)^4 squares = 375, divisible: yes
n = 4, sum_1^n = 10, 15 * sum_(n+1)^8 squares = 2610, divisible: yes
n = 5, sum_1^n = 15, 15 * sum_(n+1)^10 squares = 4950, divisible: yes
n = 9, sum_1^n = 45, 15 * sum_(n+1)^18 squares = 27360, divisible: yes
n = 14, sum_1^n = 105, 15 * sum_(n+1)^28 squares = 100485, divisible: yes
n = 29, sum_1^n = 435, 15 * sum_(n+1)^58 squares = 872610, divisible: yes
Minimal such n found (up to 100) is the first printed above.. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
<<<{1, 2, 4, 5, 9, 14, 29}>>>
