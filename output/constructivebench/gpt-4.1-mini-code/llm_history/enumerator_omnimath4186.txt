The problem involves functional equations with two real functions \( f, g: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) satisfying:
\[
f(x + g(y)) = x f(y) - y f(x) + g(x)
\]
for all real \( x, y \).

The theorem claims a characterization of all such pairs \((f,g)\) in terms of a parameter \( t \neq -1 \) and a family of function pairs \((f_t, g_t)\).

To explore the solutions and conjecture the form of \( f, g \), we numerically test simple candidate functions and parameter values. We will attempt to find \( (f,g) \) that satisfy the functional equation for various inputs \( x,y \), and conjecture the underlying parameterization using a sampled parameter \( t \).

Below is a Python enumerator that:
- defines candidate \( f, g \) forms parameterized by \( t \),
- samples \( t \) values (excluding -1),
- tests the functional equation on a grid of \( x,y \) values,
- prints candidates that satisfy the equation (up to some numerical tolerance).

This will help conjecture the form of \( f,g \) and validate the theorem statement about parameter \( t \).

```python
import math

def approx_eq(a, b, tol=1e-9):
    return abs(a - b) < tol

def try_fg(t):
    # Define candidate f,g depending on parameter t != -1
    # Inspired by linear forms: f(x) = A(t)*x, g(x) = B(t)*x
    # We'll try f(x) = x/(t+1), g(x) = t * x / (t+1)
    # This form matches patterns from rearranging the equation
    
    if t == -1:
        return None  # exclude t = -1
    
    def f(x):
        return x / (t + 1)
    
    def g(x):
        return t * x / (t + 1)
    
    # Test the functional equation on some x,y
    for x in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
        for y in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
            lhs = f(x + g(y))
            rhs = x * f(y) - y * f(x) + g(x)
            if not approx_eq(lhs, rhs):
                return None
    return (f, g)

def main():
    print("Testing candidate functions parameterized by t (excluding t=-1):")
    ts = [-2, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1, 2]
    for t in ts:
        fg = try_fg(t)
        if fg is not None:
            f, g = fg
            # Print functional forms for examination
            print(f"t = {t}: f(x) = x / ({t}+1), g(x) = {t} * x / ({t}+1) satisfies the equation.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This outputs candidate parameter values and functional forms satisfying the equation for chosen test points, helping to discover and verify the parameterized family of solutions.
