The problem involves a formula for `olympiadbench2257_answer(i, j)` defined for positive integers `i` and `j`. The formula appears to produce a number based on `i` and `j`. We want to verify and explore values for small `i`, `j` to understand the pattern.

The formula given is:
```
olympiadbench2257_answer(i, j) = 4 + 3*(i-1) + (3 + 4*(i-1))*(j-1)
```

We will write a Python program to enumerate values for `i, j` ranging from 1 to 5, print these values immediately as they are computed, and confirm if they follow the given formula.

```python
# Enumerate olympiadbench2257_answer(i,j) for 1 <= i,j <= 5 using the provided formula.
def olympiadbench2257_answer(i, j):
    return 4 + 3*(i-1) + (3 + 4*(i-1))*(j-1)

print("Enumerating olympiadbench2257_answer(i,j) for 1 <= i,j <= 5:")
for i in range(1, 6):
    for j in range(1, 6):
        ans = olympiadbench2257_answer(i, j)
        print(f"i={i}, j={j} => {ans}")
```
This program will help conjecture the structure of the values by showing them outright.
