This problem involves finding real numbers \(a, b, c\) and three distinct roots \(x_1, x_2, x_3\) such that
\[
x_i^6 - 10x_i^5 + 29x_i^4 - 4x_i^3 + a x_i^2 = b x_i + c
\]
for \(i=1,2,3\), and for all other \(x\), the polynomial difference
\[
x^6 - 10x^5 + 29x^4 - 4x^3 + a x^2 - (b x + c) > 0.
\]

This means the polynomial
\[
f(x) = x^6 - 10x^5 + 29x^4 - 4x^3 + a x^2 - b x - c
\]
has exactly three distinct real roots \(x_1, x_2, x_3\), and is positive elsewhere. Since it is a degree 6 polynomial, the shape is likely "above" the line \(b x + c\) except touching it at those three points.

We want to find the maximum of the roots \(x_i\).

To assist in conjecturing, let's enumerate triples \((x_1,x_2,x_3)\) of roots on some small integer or rational values, determine \(a,b,c\) accordingly, and check the positivity condition approximately.

We'll try simple integer triples \(x_1 < x_2 < x_3\) from a small range, solve for \(a,b,c\) such that the polynomial matches the line at those points, then verify the positivity on a grid. For computational feasibility and output length, a tiny range is used.

The program prints candidate triples and the corresponding maximum root found.

# Given roots x1,x2,x3 (distinct), solve for a,b,c from the system:

            continue
        val = base_poly(x) + a*x**2 - b*x - c
        if val <= 0:
            return False
    return True

                if abc is None:
                    continue
                a,b,c = abc
                if is_positive_outside_roots(a,b,c,(x1,x2,x3)):
                    max_root = max(x1,x2,x3)
                    print(f"Roots: {(x1,x2,x3)}, a={a:.3f}, b={b:.3f}, c={c:.3f}, max root={max_root}")
                    candidates.append(max_root)
    if candidates:
        print(f"Maximum of max roots found: {max(candidates)}")
    else:
        print("No valid triple found.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This code enumerates possible integer triples of roots, computes parameters, and checks positivity condition numerically, printing each valid solution immediately.
