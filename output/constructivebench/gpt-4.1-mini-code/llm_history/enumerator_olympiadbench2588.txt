This problem defines two sequences \(A_k\) and \(B_k\) related by linear recurrences involving each other. We want to find \(A_4\) given initial conditions on \(A_0, A_1, A_2, A_3\). The sequences are over \(\mathbb{R}\).

We will enumerate values of \(A_k\) and \(B_k\) for some sample indices using the recurrence relations, starting with the known initial values of \(A_k\) at indices 0,1,2,3, and using the functional equations for all integers \(k\). Since there are infinitely many, we restrict to some range.

To keep \(B_k\) values manageable and consistent, we start by guessing \(B_k = 0\) initially and update accordingly using the equations iteratively until steady values emerge.

We print all values \(A_k\) and \(B_k\) obtained for \(k=0\) to 5 and watch the pattern to conjecture \(A_4\).

```python
# Enumerate A_k and B_k for k=0..5 according to the recurrences:
# A_k = (A_{k-1} + A_{k+1} + B_k) / 3
# B_k = (B_{k-1} + B_{k+1} + A_k) / 3
# Given initial A_0 = A_1 = A_2 = 0, A_3 =1
# No initial B_k provided; start with zeros

def main():
    from fractions import Fraction

    # We'll work with rational numbers to keep exactness
    # Initialize A and B dictionaries with known values
    A = {0: Fraction(0), 1: Fraction(0), 2: Fraction(0), 3: Fraction(1)}
    # Initialize B with zeros for k=0..5 (we will extend as needed)
    B = {k: Fraction(0) for k in range(6)}

    # To solve the system, note that the relations can be rearranged:
    # 3*A_k = A_{k-1} + A_{k+1} + B_k
    # 3*B_k = B_{k-1} + B_{k+1} + A_k
    # This suggests a linear system we can try to solve iteratively

    # Since A and B are defined on all integers, but we only consider k in [0..5]
    n = 6

    # For k in [0..5], impose boundary conditions for A and iterative update B
    # Since A_0,1,2,3 fixed, and others unknown, solve for A_4, A_5 and all B_k

    # We'll perform iterative relaxation for A and B starting from known A and zero B.
    # But given 4 known A values, let's try to express A_4 and A_5 in terms of B_k

    # We'll apply the recurrences as equations:
    # For k in 1..4:
    # A_k = (A_{k-1} + A_{k+1} + B_k)/3  => 3*A_k - A_{k-1} - A_{k+1} = B_k
    # Similarly, for k in 1..4:
    # B_k = (B_{k-1} + B_{k+1} + A_k)/3  => 3*B_k - B_{k-1} - B_{k+1} = A_k

    # Let's represent unknowns as a vector x = [A_4, A_5, B_0,...,B_5]
    # But since we want just A_4, and we have no info about A_5 or B_k,
    # let's just try to solve for A_4 assuming outside values zero or equal 
    # to nearest known values (boundary conditions).

    # For this exercise, let's try to numerically approximate A and B up to k=5 by iterative update:

    # Initialize unknown A_k for k=4,5 as zero
    if 4 not in A:
        A[4] = Fraction(0)
    if 5 not in A:
        A[5] = Fraction(0)

    # Iterate updates 20 times
    for _ in range(20):
        A_new = A.copy()
        B_new = B.copy()
        # Update A for k=1..4 (to keep within known indices)
        for k in range(1,5):
            a_left = A.get(k-1,Fraction(0))
            a_right = A.get(k+1,Fraction(0))
            b_k = B.get(k,Fraction(0))
            A_new[k] = (a_left + a_right + b_k) / 3
        # Keep known A fixed
        A_new[0] = Fraction(0)
        A_new[1] = Fraction(0)
        A_new[2] = Fraction(0)
        A_new[3] = Fraction(1)
        # Update B for k=1..4
        for k in range(1,5):
            b_left = B.get(k-1,Fraction(0))
            b_right = B.get(k+1,Fraction(0))
            a_k = A.get(k,Fraction(0))
            B_new[k] = (b_left + b_right + a_k) / 3
        B = B_new
        A = A_new

    # Print the results for k=0..5
    print("k\tA_k\t\tB_k")
    for k in range(6):
        print(f"{k}\t{float(A[k]):.6f}\t{float(B[k]):.6f}")
    print(f"\nConjectured A_4 = {float(A[4]):.6f}")
