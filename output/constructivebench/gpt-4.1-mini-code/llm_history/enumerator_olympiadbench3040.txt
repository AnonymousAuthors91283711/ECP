[write_program]
The problem involves sums of arithmetic series and a given fraction equality involving sums of multiples of integers from 1 to n. The goal is to find the value of another fraction involving sums over the same range. To assist in conjecturing the answer, I will write a Python program that:

- Iterates over reasonable values of n (positive integers).
- Checks the given fraction condition (3 * sum_i / 5 * sum_i == 4/11).
- When the condition holds exactly, computes the target fraction and prints it.
- Prints parameters and values found, prioritizing exact rational outputs.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# We try n from 1 to 100 to find exact matches for the given fraction condition
for n in range(1, 101):
    sum_3i = sum(3 * i for i in range(1, n + 1))
    sum_5i = sum(5 * i for i in range(1, n + 1))
    # Construct fractions exactly
    frac_given = Fraction(sum_3i, sum_5i)
    if frac_given == Fraction(4, 11):
        sum_2i = sum(2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1))
        sum_4i = sum(4 * i for i in range(1, n + 1))
        frac_target = Fraction(sum_2i, sum_4i)
        print(f"n = {n}")
        print(f"(sum 3*i)/(sum 5*i) = {frac_given}")  # Should be 4/11
        print(f"(sum 2*i)/(sum 4*i) = {frac_target}")
```
This will print any n satisfying the condition and the corresponding answer. Since all sums are arithmetic series, efficient formulas could be used as an optimization.
[refine_program]
The problem is to find all positive integers n such that the ratio of the sums (∑3i)/(∑5i) equals 4/11, and then compute the ratio (∑2i)/(∑4i) for those n.

The given program tries n from 1 to 100 and sums up scaled arithmetic sequences directly. However, the sums ∑3i and ∑5i for i=1 to n can be expressed as 3 * n(n+1)/2 and 5 * n(n+1)/2 respectively, so their ratio is always (3 * n(n+1)/2) / (5 * n(n+1)/2) = 3/5, which can never be 4/11 for any n. Therefore, no n satisfies the given condition, so the program output is empty.

The failure is conceptual: the original problem likely requires a more sophisticated interpretation, or maybe the problem involves finite sums over 1 to n but with different coefficients or conditions.

The direct exact sums given lead to fixed ratios independent of n, so the ratio can't equal 4/11.

Thus, the program is correct but the problem doesn't have solutions in the tested range, which is consistent with the output.

But since the program outputs nothing, the user expected something.

If the problem aims to verify or find the answer olympiadbench3040_answer based on the given conditions, the program should:

- Recognize the sums as arithmetic series.

- Solve algebraically for n (if possible).

Here's a quick algebraic insight:

Sum_{i=1 to n} i = n(n+1)/2

Therefore:

(∑ 3i) / (∑ 5i) = (3 * n(n+1)/2) / (5 * n(n+1)/2) = 3/5

Given ratio is 4/11, which is not equal 3/5.

No solution for n here, unless the problem interprets the sums differently.

Same for the target ratio:

(∑ 2i)/(∑ 4i) = (2 * n(n+1)/2)/(4 * n(n+1)/2) = 2/4 = 1/2

So if the condition never holds, the conclusion is always 1/2.

Hence, the correct answer is 1/2.

The program is correct but the interpretation or
[refine_program]
The provided "program" is actually incomplete and contains no code to compute or verify the problem conditions or to generate any outputs. It just states the problem in a logical framework (Lean theorem prover syntax) and no enumeration or checking code is present. Hence, it cannot be accepted.

The problem involves sums of arithmetic progressions scaled by constants and equalities of their ratios; this is a straightforward algebraic problem and can be handled efficiently in Python by enumerating small values of n and checking the given condition.

The solution approach is:

- For n from 1 to some small limit (e.g., 1000), calculate sum_i 3i and sum_i 5i for i=1 to n, and check if their ratio is exactly 4/11.

- For such n (there will only be one or a few), calculate the other ratio and print it.

This aligns well with problem requirements: streaming answers immediately on discovery.

Therefore, the original submission is rejected, and I will provide a corrected program that meets all requirements.

    return factor * n * (n + 1) // 2

target_ratio = Fraction(4, 11)
max_n = 1000  # search limit

for n in range(1, max_n + 1):

        print(f"n = {n}")

        denominator2 = sum_multiplied(n, 4)
        if denominator2 == 0:
            continue
        ratio2 = Fraction(numerator2, denominator2)
        print(f"Answer (∑2i/∑4i) = {ratio2} = {float(ratio2):.6f}")
