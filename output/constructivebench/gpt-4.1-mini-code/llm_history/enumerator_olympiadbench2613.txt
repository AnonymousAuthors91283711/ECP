[write_program]
The problem defines a recurrence relation u(n+2) = 3*u(n+1) - u(n), with initial condition values u(3) = 5 and u(6) = 89, and asks to find u(7).

We want to write a program to enumerate u(n) using the recurrence for n >= 1, trying different initial values u(1), u(2) to match u(3) = 5 and u(6) = 89, then print u(7).

Plan:
- Loop over reasonable integer candidates for u(1) and u(2) (say -10 to 10).
- Use recurrence to compute u(3) - u(6).
- Check if matches given values.
- If yes, print u(1), u(2), and then u(7).

This enumerator might find multiple or unique solutions. We then output u(7).

```python
# Enumerate integer initial values for u(1), u(2)
# and use recurrence u(n+2) = 3*u(n+1) - u(n) to find u(7)
# given u(3) = 5 and u(6) = 89

def recur(u1, u2, n):
    u = [0, u1, u2]  # index from 1 for convenience
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        u.append(3*u[i-1] - u[i-2])
    return u

def main():
    found = 0
    for u1 in range(-10, 11):
        for u2 in range(-10, 11):
            u = recur(u1, u2, 7)
            if u[3] == 5 and u[6] == 89:
                print(f"u(1)={u1}, u(2)={u2} => u(7)={u[7]}")
                found += 1
    if found == 0:
        print("No solutions found with u(1), u(2) in [-10,10]")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
