The problem asks to find the greatest real number \( r \) such that there exists a complex number \( z \) with \(|z|=1\) (i.e., \(z\) lies on the unit circle) satisfying:

\[
r = \frac{| \sqrt{17} - z|}{|i \sqrt{19} - z|}
\]

We want to analyze the ratio of distances from two fixed points \( \sqrt{17} \) (on the real axis) and \( i \sqrt{19} \) (on the imaginary axis) to points \( z \) on the unit circle.

To assist, let's enumerate the value of the ratio for various points on the unit circle, discretized into many points (using \(z = e^{i\theta}\), \(\theta \in [0, 2\pi]\)). We'll print all ratio values found and also the maximum value observed.

This can help conjecture the value and behavior of the maximum.

```python
import math
import cmath

def main():
    sqrt17 = math.sqrt(17)
    sqrt19 = math.sqrt(19)
    max_r = 0
    # Check 1000 values on unit circle
    for k in range(1000+1):
        theta = 2*math.pi*k/1000
        z = complex(math.cos(theta), math.sin(theta))
        numerator = abs(complex(sqrt17, 0) - z)
        denominator = abs(complex(0, sqrt19) - z)
        r = numerator/denominator
        print(f"r = {r:.8f} at theta={theta:.5f}")
        if r > max_r:
            max_r = r
    print(f"Maximum ratio found: {max_r:.8f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
