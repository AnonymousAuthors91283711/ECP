This problem involves characterizing natural numbers \( n \) such that \( \frac{1}{n} \) has a certain decimal expansion pattern involving two distinct digits \( a \neq b \) and an infinite sum. To explore the condition experimentally, I'll:

1. Iterate over pairs \( (a,b) \) of digits 0 to 9, \( a \neq b \).
2. For each pair, compute the decimal value formed by \( a/10 + b/100 + \sum_{k=0}^\infty (a/10^{2k+3} + b/10^{2k+4}) \), which is a geometric series.
3. Find the denominator \( n = 1 / \) that decimal value, if it is close to a natural number.
4. Collect such \( n \) values and their corresponding digits \( a,b \).
5. Print results immediately to aid conjecture.

I'll implement this and output all such \( n \leq 1000 \) found, as the problem likely deals with small \( n \).

```python
# Enumerate n in natural numbers for which 1/n equals a decimal formed by digits a,b as described.
# We use the sum formula for the infinite geometric series involved.

def decimal_value(a, b):
    # S = a/10 + b/100 + sum_{k=0}^\infty (a/10^{2k+3} + b/10^{2k+4})
    # Group the geometric series:
    # sum_a = a/(10^3) + a/(10^5) + ... = a/(10^3) * 1/(1 - 1/100) = a/(10^3) * 100/99 = a/(10) * 1/99
    # Similarly sum_b = b/(10^4) + b/(10^6) + ... = b/(10^4) * 1/(1 - 1/100) = b/(10^4) * 100/99 = b/(100) * 1/99
    # So total sum = a/10 + b/100 + a/10*1/99 + b/100*1/99 = a/10*(1+1/99) + b/100*(1+1/99)
    # = a/10*(100/99) + b/100*(100/99) = (100/99)*(a/10 + b/100)

    from fractions import Fraction
    base = Fraction(a,10) + Fraction(b,100)
    total = base * Fraction(100,99)
    return total  # Fraction

                continue
            val = decimal_value(a,b)
            # val = 1/n => n = 1/val
            # We check if 1/val is a natural number <=1000
            n_frac = Fraction(1,1)/val
            if n_frac.denominator == 1 and 1 <= n_frac.numerator <= 1000:
