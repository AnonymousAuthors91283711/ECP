The problem is to find the cardinality of the set of all nonempty subsets of \( \text{Fin } 3 \times \text{Fin } 2 \).

- \(\text{Fin } 3\) is the set \(\{0,1,2\}\), and \(\text{Fin } 2\) is \(\{0,1\}\).
- The Cartesian product \(\text{Fin } 3 \times \text{Fin } 2\) has \(3 \times 2 = 6\) elements.
- The set of all subsets of a 6-element set has size \(2^6 = 64\).
- The nonempty subsets are all subsets except the empty set, so there are \(64 - 1 = 63\).

To verify and illustrate this with Python, we enumerate all subsets of a 6-element set, check that the count of nonempty subsets is \(63\).

```python
# Enumerate all subsets of Fin 3 x Fin 2 (6 elements) and count nonempty subsets
from itertools import chain, combinations

# Elements of Fin 3 x Fin 2
elements = [(i, j) for i in range(3) for j in range(2)]

def all_subsets(iterable):
    "Generate all subsets (the powerset)"
    s = list(iterable)
    return chain.from_iterable(combinations(s, r) for r in range(len(s)+1))

count = 0
for subset in all_subsets(elements):
    if subset:
        print(subset)
        count += 1

print("Total nonempty subsets:", count)
print("Expected:", 2**len(elements) - 1)
```
This enumerates all 63 nonempty subsets and prints their tuples, then prints the total count and expected count.
