The problem seems to ask for a natural number \(k\) such that

\[
2 \times \frac{4}{4+5+7} = \frac{4}{(4+5+7) - k}
\]

and \((4+5+7) - k > 0\).

Let's enumerate possible values of \(k\) from 0 up to \(4+5+7\) (i.e. 16), check the condition, and print all candidates immediately.

```python
# Enumerate all k in N where k â‰¤ 16, check the equation:
# 2 * (4 / total) = 4 / (total - k)
# total = 4 + 5 + 7 = 16

total = 4 + 5 + 7
numerator_left = 2 * 4  # numerator for left side before division
denominator_left = total

print(f"Total = {total}")

for k in range(total + 1):
    new_total = total - k
    if new_total <= 0:
        continue
    # Check equality: 2*(4/16) == 4/new_total
    # Multiply both sides by 16*new_total to clear denominators:
    # 2*4*new_total == 4*16
    if 2 * 4 * new_total == 4 * 16:
        print(f"Candidate k found: k = {k}, since 2*(4/{total}) = 4/{new_total}")
```
