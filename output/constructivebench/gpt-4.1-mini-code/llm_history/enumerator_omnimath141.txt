[write_program]
The given snippet appears incomplete and more like a Lean theorem statement than a full problem statement. Since no explicit math problem is stated, I'll demonstrate a Python program enumerating a typical math property involving natural numbers starting from 2, to aid in conjecturing something like "For n ≥ 2, a property P(n) holds." For example, let's investigate properties of n such as primality, number of divisors, or perfect squares to help conjecture.

The program will:
- Iterate n from 2 to 20 (small samples).
- Print n and some properties: whether n is prime, sum of divisors, is perfect square.
- This enumeration can assist in conjecturing a property about the natural number n ≥ 2.

```python
# Enumerate natural numbers n ≥ 2, printing some of their properties to assist conjecture.

def is_prime(x):
    if x < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(x**0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def sum_of_divisors(x):
    return sum(d for d in range(1, x+1) if x % d == 0)

def is_perfect_square(x):
    r = int(x**0.5)
    return r*r == x

print("n | prime? | sum_of_divisors | perfect_square?")
for n in range(2, 21):
    p = is_prime(n)
    s = sum_of_divisors(n)
    ps = is_perfect_square(n)
    print(f"{n} | {p} | {s} | {ps}")
```
