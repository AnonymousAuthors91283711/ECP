The problem defines a sequence and considers indices \( n \) for which the count of 'X' and 'Y' in the prefix of length \( n \) satisfies \( x = 2y \) or \( y = 2x \). We want to find which of the given numbers [9, 18, 36, 72] satisfy these conditions and sum them.

We enumerate these \( n \) values, count 'X' and 'Y' in the prefix of length \( n \), check the condition, print all valid \( n \), then print their sum to assist in conjecturing the answer.

```python
# Enumerate n in [9,18,36,72], count X and Y in prefix of seq of length n
# Check condition x=2y or y=2x and print valid n, finally print sum

seq = ['X']*6 + ['Y']*24 + ['X']*96  # length 126
candidates = [9, 18, 36, 72]
valid_ns = []
for n in candidates:
    prefix = seq[:n]
    x_count = prefix.count('X')
    y_count = prefix.count('Y')
    if x_count == 2 * y_count or y_count == 2 * x_count:
        print(f"Valid n: {n} with x={x_count}, y={y_count}")
        valid_ns.append(n)
print("Sum of valid n:", sum(valid_ns))
```
