The problem revolves around characterizing those natural numbers \( r \) such that for any finite set \( s \) of powers of two, and any \( a \), there exists a finite set of powers of two, "stations", whose sum \( bus \) is congruent to \( a \) modulo \( r \) and contains \( s \) as a subset.

We want to enumerate candidates for \( omnimath4336_answer \), i.e., values of \( r \) for which the described property holds.

We can test various small values of \( r \), and for each \( r \), check if for all sets \( s \) of powers of two (up to some small size), and all \( a \in [0, r-1] \), we can find a suitable \( bus \) congruent to \( a \) modulo \( r \), containing \( s \), and consisting of powers of two.

We try small \( r \) from 1 to 20, small \( s \) (sets of powers of two) of size 0 to 2 or so, and for each \( a \) in \( [0, r-1] \), we try to build "stations", containing \( s \), so that their sum mod \( r \) is \( a \).

The stations sums are sums of powers of two. Since we only need existence, we can use brute force by choosing subsets of powers of two up to some limit to check sums mod \( r \).

We print all \( r \) for which all checks pass.

Below is an enumerator that attempts this.

This program enumerates candidate \( r \) from 1 to 20; for each \( r \), it verifies that for all small subsets \( s \) of powers of two (size up to 2), and for all residues \( a \) modulo \( r \), there exists a set of powers of two (stations) containing \( s \) with sum congruent to \( a \mod r \).

By running this enumerator, one can conjecture which \( r \) satisfy the property \( r \in omnimath4336_answer \).
