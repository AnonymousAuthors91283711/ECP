The problem is to find all positive integers \( N \) such that:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{N}{3} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{N}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{N}{7} \right\rfloor - \left\lfloor \frac{N}{35} \right\rfloor
\]
and then identify the greatest such \( N \).

Below is a Python program that enumerates \( N \) up to some upper bound (like 200), prints all \( N > 0 \) that satisfy the equality, and then prints the greatest one found. This approach assists in conjecturing the true maximal solution.

```python
# Enumerate candidate N to satisfy floor(N/3) = floor(N/5) + floor(N/7) - floor(N/35)
# Print each N immediately when found and finally output the maximum.

def floor_div(n, d):
    # integer division works as floor for positive n
    return n // d

def check_condition(N):
    left = floor_div(N, 3)
    right = floor_div(N, 5) + floor_div(N, 7) - floor_div(N, 35)
    return left == right

def main():
    max_N = 200  # upper bound; adjust if needed
    candidates = []
    for N in range(1, max_N + 1):
        if check_condition(N):
            print(f"N = {N} satisfies the equation")
            candidates.append(N)
    if candidates:
        greatest = max(candidates)
        print(f"Greatest N found: {greatest}")
    else:
        print("No N found that satisfy the equation up to", max_N)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
