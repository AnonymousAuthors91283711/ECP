The problem asks us to find the least natural number s such that there exist positive integers x, y, z satisfying:
- \(x \cdot y + z = 160\)
- \(s = x + y \cdot z\)

We want to find the minimal s with \(x,y,z > 0\) fulfilling the above, and also enumerate candidate s values.

We will:
- Enumerate all \(x,y,z\) with \(1 \leq x,y,z \leq 160\) (or less since \(x \cdot y \leq 160\))
- Check if \(x \cdot y + z = 160\)
- Compute \(s = x + y \cdot z\)
- Print each s found immediately
- Track the minimum s

```python
# Enumerate all positive integers x,y,z with x*y+z=160 and find s = x + y*z
# Print each s immediately and then output the minimal s found

def main():
    limit = 160
    min_s = None
    # x,y>=1 and x*y+z = 160 => z = 160 - x*y > 0 => x*y < 160
    for x in range(1, limit+1):
        for y in range(1, (limit//x)+1):  # y max so that x*y<160
            xy = x*y
            if xy >= limit:
                continue
            z = limit - xy
            if z <= 0:
                continue
            s = x + y*z
            print(f"s = {s} for x={x}, y={y}, z={z}")
            if min_s is None or s < min_s:
                min_s = s
    print(f"Minimum s = {min_s}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
