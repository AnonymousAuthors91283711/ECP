The problem asks us to characterize all functions \( f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) satisfying the functional equation
\[
f(x f(y) + y) + f(-f(x)) = f(y f(x) - y) + y, \quad \forall x,y \in \mathbb{R}.
\]
Since this is a complicated functional equation, we can try enumerating candidates by testing simple families of functions: linear functions \(f(x) = a x + b\), constant functions \(f(x) = c\), and some piecewise or simple polynomial functions, evaluating the residual of the equation at sample points.

Our program will:
- Iterate over simple candidate functions.
- For each candidate, check the functional equation at some sample points.
- Print candidate functions which satisfy the functional equation at all sample points exactly.

This approach could help conjecture solutions and maybe indicates whether linear solutions or constant solutions are possible.

```python
# enumerator.py
import math

# We test candidates f defined on R -> R.
# We'll test three types of simple functions:
# 1) constant f(x) = c
# 2) linear f(x) = a x + b
# For selected a, b, c in a small range of rationals.
# We'll check the functional equation at a few rational points (x,y).

def approx_equal(a,b,eps=1e-12):
    return abs(a-b) < eps

def test_candidate(f, samples):
    # Check equation f(x f(y) + y) + f(-f(x)) == f(y f(x) - y) + y for all samples (x,y)
    for x,y in samples:
        left = f(x * f(y) + y) + f(-f(x))
        right = f(y * f(x) - y) + y
        if not approx_equal(left, right):
            return False
    return True

def make_linear(a,b):
    return lambda x: a*x + b

def make_constant(c):
    return lambda x: c

def main():
    # sample points to check equation
    samples = [(-1, -1), (-1,0), (-1,1), (0,-1), (0,0), (0,1), (1,-1), (1,0), (1,1)]
    print("Testing constant functions f(x)=c")
    for c in [-1,0,1,2]:
        f = make_constant(c)
        if test_candidate(f,samples):
            print(f"Candidate: f(x) = {c}")

    print("Testing linear functions f(x) = a x + b")
    # small integer ranges for a,b
    for a in range(-3,4):
        for b in range(-3,4):
            f = make_linear(a,b)
            if test_candidate(f,samples):
                print(f"Candidate: f(x) = {a}*x + {b}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
