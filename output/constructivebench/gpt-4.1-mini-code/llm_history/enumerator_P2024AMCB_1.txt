The problem appears to involve finding a natural number \(n\) satisfying the condition \(\exists k: k = 1013 \land n - k + 1 = 1010.\) 
This simplifies to \(n - 1013 + 1 = 1010 \Rightarrow n = 1013 - 1 + 1010 = 2022.\)

The program will enumerate \(k\) values around 1013 to verify \(n\) satisfying the equation and print each such \(n.\)

```python
# Enumerate candidate k values around 1013 to find n satisfying n - k + 1 = 1010 with k=1013
def main():
    k_target = 1013
    required_val = 1010
    # We'll check k in a small range around 1013 for demonstration, though only k=1013 is given
    for k in range(1000, 1026):
        if k == k_target:
            n = k - 1 + required_val
            print(f"k={k}, n={n}")  # Print immediately when found

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
