The problem involves evaluating a double sum over a fixed range with a piecewise-defined function p(n), and summing p(a)*p(b) over pairs (a,b) with a+b = 12 or 20. We want to enumerate the values contributing to the sum to conjecture or confirm the answer.

We'll:
- Define p(n) per the problem statement
- Loop over a,b in [1..17]
- Check if a+b=12 or 20, then compute p(a)*p(b)
- Print each nonzero product term found (to see contributions)
- Finally sum and print the total sum to conjecture the answer

This will help verifying the rational sum.

```python
# Enumerate pairs (a,b) in [1..17], summing p(a)*p(b)
# where p(a) = 1/2 if a=17, else 1/32 if 1 <= a <=16, else 0.

def p(n):
    if n == 17:
        return 1/2
    elif 1 <= n <= 16:
        return 1/32
    else:
        return 0

def main():
    total = 0
    print("Contributions p(a)*p(b) for a+b=12 or 20:")
    for a in range(1, 18):
        for b in range(1, 18):
            s = a + b
            if s == 12 or s == 20:
                val = p(a) * p(b)
                if val != 0:
                    print(f"a={a}, b={b}, p(a)*p(b)={val}")
                total += val
    print(f"Total sum = {total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
