Ground Truth Answer: 91
Proposed Answer: 56
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding log₃(x₁₄) given:
   - A strictly increasing sequence xₙ where each term is a power of 3
   - The sum of logs (base 3) of the first 8 terms is 308
   - The log (base 3) of the sum of first 8 terms is between 56 and 57

2. The ground truth answer is 91, which suggests x₁₄ = 3⁹¹

3. The proposed answer is 56, which would mean x₁₄ = 3⁵⁶

Key observations:
- The sequence is strictly increasing powers of 3, so the exponents must be strictly increasing natural numbers
- The sum of first 8 exponents is 308 (from the log sum condition)
- The proposed answer 56 is actually the lower bound given in h_bound, not the solution for x₁₄
- There's no mathematical connection shown between the given conditions and the proposed answer

Conclusion: The proposed answer is incorrect and not equivalent to the ground truth answer. It appears to be mistakenly using one of the given bounds as the solution.
