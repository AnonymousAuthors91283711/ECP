The problem deals with three-digit odd numbers \( m \) where the digits are distinct, the first digit is not equal to the second and third, the second and third digits are different, and the product of the first two digits equals the third digit. We want to find all such numbers \( m \) in the range 100 to 999.

We will enumerate all odd numbers \( m \) in this range, extract the digits, check the constraints, and print those that satisfy the conditions.

```python
# Enumerate all three-digit odd numbers with distinct digits (no repetition),
# where the third digit equals the product of the first two digits.
# Print each number found immediately.

def digits(n):
    return [n // 100, (n // 10) % 10, n % 10]

for m in range(101, 1000, 2):  # odd numbers between 100 and 999 inclusive
    ds = digits(m)
    d0, d1, d2 = ds
    # Check distinct digits
    if d0 != d1 and d0 != d2 and d1 != d2:
        # Check product condition
        if d2 == d1 * d0:
            print(m)
```

The original program appears logically sound: it correctly iterates over all three-digit odd numbers with distinct digits and checks if the last digit is the product of the first two digits. However, the output is empty because the product of the first two digits must be a single digit (i.e., less than 10) to match the last digit. Also, since the last digit is odd, the product must be odd, restricting the search space further.

Additionally, the digits function uses integer division that, while workable, can be simplified or explicitly converted. The original program also checks all odd numbers from 101 to 999 blindly but can be improved by recognizing that the last digit equals d0*d1 (product), so d0 and d1 must be digits from 1 to 9 whose product is less than 10.

By enumerating d0 and d1 (the first two digits), we can immediately compute d2, then check all conditions including distinctness, and finally reconstruct the number and check if it's odd and in range.

Hence, the original program correctly implements the problem but inefficiently, and since it produces no output, it should be rejected. The corrected program replaces the iteration with digit-based enumeration, prints the results immediately, and stays within output limits.

```python
# Enumerate all three-digit odd numbers m=100*d0 + 10*d1 + d2 with distinct digits,
# d2 = d0 * d1, odd digits, and 100 ≤ m ≤ 999.

for d0 in range(1, 10):          # hundreds digit, nonzero
    for d1 in range(0, 10):      # tens digit
        d2 = d0 * d1
        if d2 < 10:
            # digits must be distinct
            if len({d0, d1, d2}) == 3:
                m = 100*d0 + 10*d1 + d2
                # check number is odd and three-digit
                if 100 <= m <= 999 and m % 2 == 1:
                    print(m)
```

The original program logically captures the conditions from the problem: 3-digit odd numbers with distinct digits, where the digits satisfy d2 = d0 * d1. However, it prints no results, indicating no solutions or a bug.

On close inspection, the problem requires d2 = ds[2] = ds[1] * ds[0], i.e., the units digit equals tens * hundreds digits, whereas the code computes d2 = d0 * d1, assigning the hundreds digit to d0 and tens digit to d1, consistent with place values. This seems correct.

The code ensures distinctness of d0, d1, d2 digits, and oddness of m, as required.

The problem includes a condition that ds.get! 0 ≠ ds.get! 1, ≠ ds.get! 2, ds.get! 1 ≠ ds.get! 2, which the code checks via distinctness.

The code failed to print anything. Let's reason why.

Note that d2 = d0 * d1 must be a digit (0–9). For d0 in [1..9] and d1 in [0..9], if d2 = d0 * d1 < 10 and digits distinct, then check m odd.

If d2 < 10, and d2 = d0 * d1, so the other conditions apply.

Let’s try to find possible values manually:

- If d1=0, d2=0. Then m=100*d0+0+0=100*d0, units digit 0, not odd.

- For d2 odd, d2 must be an odd digit (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).

- d2 = d0 * d1 odd digit < 10

For example, d0=1:

- d1=1 → d2=1 → digits: {1,1,1} not distinct, no.

- d1=3 → d2=3 → digits {1,3,3}, no.

- d1=5 → d2=5 → digits {1,5,5}, no.

- d1=7 → d2=7 → digits {1,7,7}, no.

- d1=9 -> d2=9 -> {1,9,9}, no.

No success as digits not distinct.

Try d0=3:
