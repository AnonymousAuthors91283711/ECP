theorem omnimath2660 :
  IsGreatest {s : ℕ | ∃ (l : List ℕ), l.Pairwise (· < ·) ∧
    (∀ p ∈ l, Nat.Prime p ∧ p < 50 ∧ ∃ (a k : ℕ), a^k = p + 1 ∧ k ≥ 2) ∧
    s = l.sum} omnimath2660_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Prime 3 has p+1=4 as perfect power
Prime 7 has p+1=8 as perfect power
Prime 31 has p+1=32 as perfect power
Sum 3 from (3,)
Sum 7 from (7,)
Sum 31 from (31,)
Sum 10 from (3, 7)
Sum 34 from (3, 31)
Sum 38 from (7, 31)
Sum 41 from (3, 7, 31)
Maximum sum found: 41 from primes (3, 7, 31). Expected Answer Type: ℕ
