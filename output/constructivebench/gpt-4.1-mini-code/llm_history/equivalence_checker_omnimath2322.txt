Ground Truth Answer: 103
Proposed Answer: 108
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest number n > 101 where the rightmost non-zero digit of n! matches the rightmost non-zero digit of 101!.

2. The rightmost non-zero digit is determined by the factors after removing all trailing zeros (factors of 10).

3. For factorials, the rightmost non-zero digit cycles in a particular pattern after certain points due to the accumulation of factors of 5 and 2.

4. Calculating the rightmost non-zero digit for 101! and comparing with subsequent factorials:
   - 101! has a certain number of trailing zeros (which we remove)
   - The remaining product's last digit is what we're comparing
   - We need to find the next n > 101 where this digit repeats

5. The ground truth answer is 103, meaning that 103! is the first factorial after 101! that has the same rightmost non-zero digit.

6. The proposed answer is 108, which would mean the pattern repeats much later.

After checking the actual calculations (or known properties of factorial digits), we can see that the pattern actually repeats at 103, not 108. The proposed answer is incorrect.
