This problem relates to functions \( f: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z} \) that are strictly monotone and satisfy an inequality involving the function \(\omega\) defined on integers, which counts the number of prime factors greater than \(10^{100}\).

We'll interpret and simplify the problem to enumerate candidate functions \( f \) on a small domain to get a sense of what functions satisfy the condition. Because prime factors > \(10^{100}\) are very large primes, for small integers, the count \(\omega\) will always be zero. So we can't observe differences strictly from that threshold on a small range unless numbers are quite large.

Hence, we'll do the following:
- Enumerate strictly increasing integer functions on a small domain \(\{-2,-1,0,1,2\}\).
- For each, check the condition for all pairs \(a > b\).
- For checking \(\omega\), count the number of prime factors greater than \(10^{100}\), which will be zero for "usual" prime factors, so we expect \(\omega(x) = 0\) for smaller numbers.
- To create differences with large prime factors, try defining outputs as multiples of a large prime (e.g. a prime larger than \(10^{100}\)), but we can't factor such huge primes easily in Python, so instead, we will assume no large prime factors appear for these small samples.

Thus, the code will:
- Define \(\omega\) as counting prime factors greater than \(10^{100}\) using sympy for factorization.
- Enumerate strictly increasing functions on domain \(\{-2,-1,0,1,2\}\) with outputs in a small integer range (e.g. \(-10\) to \(10\)).
- For each candidate function, verify the condition for all pairs \(a > b\):

  \[
  \omega(f(a) - f(b)) \leq \omega(a - b).
  \]

Because \(a-b\) ranges over \(-4\) to \(4\) (excluding \(0\)), and none have large prime factors, the right side \(\omega(a-b) = 0\), so \(f(a)-f(b)\) must also have zero large prime factors.

This suggests to check whether the differences \(f(a) - f(b)\) have factors > \(10^{100}\), which for the chosen ranges will be zero.

In short, this will characterize all strictly increasing functions \(f\) with small outputs, as all differences have zero large prime factors.

This trial will produce candidate functions; from those, conjecture the allowed functions under the problem condition.

```python
# Enumerator for strictly increasing integer functions f on domain D = {-2,-1,0,1,2}
# Checking condition: for all a > b, omega(f(a)-f(b)) <= omega(a-b)
# omega(x) = number of prime factors of |x| > 10^100
# For small integers, omega = 0 almost surely.
# Use sympy for prime factorization. Only print candidate functions.

from sympy import primefactors
from itertools import product

# Threshold large prime
THRESHOLD = 10**100

# Domain
D = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]

def omega(n):
    """Count prime factors > THRESHOLD with multiplicity 1 (distinct primes)"""
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    n = abs(n)
    pf = primefactors(n)
    return sum(1 for p in pf if p > THRESHOLD)

# Compute omega(a-b) for all a > b in D
diff_omega = {}
for a in D:
    for b in D:
        if a > b:
            diff_omega[(a,b)] = omega(a - b)

# Enumerate strictly increasing functions f: D -> [-10,10]
vals = range(-10,11)
count = 0

for outputs in product(vals, repeat=len(D)):
    # Check strict increasing
    if all(outputs[i] < outputs[i+1] for i in range(len(D)-1)):
        # Check omega inequality for all pairs a>b
        failed = False
        for a in D:
            for b in D:
                if a > b:
                    left = omega(outputs[D.index(a)] - outputs[D.index(b)])
                    right = diff_omega[(a,b)]
                    if left > right:
                        failed = True
                        break
            if failed:
                break
        if not failed:
            count += 1
            print(f"f: {dict(zip(D, outputs))}")

print(f"Total candidate functions found: {count}")
```
