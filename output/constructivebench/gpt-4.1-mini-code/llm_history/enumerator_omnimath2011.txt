The problem involves counting the number of configurations of a 20×16 Boolean matrix, where each entry is determined by XORing (≠) a row flip and a column flip Boolean value. Essentially, it's the number of distinct matrices attainable by flipping selected rows and columns of an all-zero matrix.

Key insights:
- A configuration is determined by the choice of row flips (2^20 possibilities) and column flips (2^16 possibilities).
- However, flipping all rows and columns might produce duplicate configurations, so we must consider how many configurations are unique.
- Since flipping all rows and all columns simultaneously returns the original matrix (because (not x) != (not y) = x != y), the total number of distinct configurations should be less than 2^(20+16).

We will:
- Enumerate all pairs of row_flips and col_flips (or a suitable subset),
- For each pair, construct the configuration matrix as a tuple or hashable object,
- Use a set to keep track of unique configurations,
- Print each new unique configuration size (to verify counting),
- Finally, output the total count of unique configurations.

Since the problem size is large (2^36 possibilities), enumerating all is impossible. Instead, we will attempt smaller sample sizes (like 2x2, 3x3, etc.) to enumerate and conjecture a formula for the count.

```python
# Enumerate distinct configurations of row-flips and col-flips for small n x m
# configuration(i,j) = row_flips[i] != col_flips[j]
# Print the number of distinct configurations found for sampled sizes
# to help conjecture the answer for (20 x 16).

def config_key(row_flips, col_flips):
    # Represent the matrix as a tuple of tuples of bools for hashing
    return tuple(tuple(row_flips[i] != col_flips[j] for j in range(len(col_flips))) for i in range(len(row_flips)))

def enumerate_configs(n, m):
    from itertools import product
    seen = set()
    count = 0
    total = 2**(n + m)
    # Iterate over all row_flips and col_flips combinations
    for row_bits in product((False, True), repeat=n):
        for col_bits in product((False, True), repeat=m):
            key = config_key(row_bits, col_bits)
            if key not in seen:
                seen.add(key)
                count += 1
                print(f"Unique config #{count} for size {n}x{m}")
            if count > 20: # limit output to avoid excess verbosity
                break
        if count > 20:
            break
    print(f"Total unique configurations for size {n}x{m}: {len(seen)}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Enumerating configurations for small sizes to conjecture count...")
    for (n,m) in [(2,2), (3,2), (3,3), (4,3)]:
        print(f"Parameters: n={n}, m={m}")
        enumerate_configs(n, m)
