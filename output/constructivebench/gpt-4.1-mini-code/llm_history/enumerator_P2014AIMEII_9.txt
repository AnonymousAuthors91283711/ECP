The problem counts subsets of {0,...,9} with at least 3 elements including a 3-term consecutive triple mod 10. We enumerate subsets by size and presence of such triples.

```python
from itertools import combinations

n = 10
triplets = [{i, (i+1)%n, (i+2)%n} for i in range(n)]

def has_triple(s):
    for t in triplets:
        if t.issubset(s):
            return True
    return False

count = 0
print("Enumerating sets with a 3-term consecutive triple mod 10, size >= 3:")
for size in range(3, n+1):
    for s in combinations(range(n), size):
        sset = set(s)
        if has_triple(sset):
            print(f"Set {s} has triple")
            count += 1

print(f"Total count: {count}")
```
