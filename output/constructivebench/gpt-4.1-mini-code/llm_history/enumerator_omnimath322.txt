The problem involves a 3x3 matrix of distinct positive integers summing to 74. For each cell, a "newgrid" value is calculated as the sum of its distinct neighbors (up, down, left, right), ignoring out-of-bound neighbors. The condition is that exactly 4 cells in newgrid equal 23. The goal is to find the value at the center cell (1,1).

The program below tries small positive integers from 1 upwards, ensuring distinct values across the grid with sum 74. It then computes the newgrid and counts how many cells have value 23. Whenever exactly 4 such cells are found, the program prints the center cell's value grid[1][1].

To control execution time, the program samples partial grids using backtracking with pruning on sums and distinctness, printing each full candidate's center value once conditions are met.

```python
from itertools import permutations

# We search for 9 distinct positive integers summing to 74, arranged in a 3x3 grid,
# with exactly 4 cells in newgrid equal to 23.

# The neighbors for a cell (i,j) in 3x3 grid:
# up: (i-1, j) if i>0
# down: (i+1, j) if i<2
# left: (i, j-1) if j>0
# right: (i, j+1) if j<2

def neighbors(i,j):
    result = []
    if i>0: result.append((i-1,j))
    if i<2: result.append((i+1,j))
    if j>0: result.append((i,j-1))
    if j<2: result.append((i,j+1))
    return result

# Since sum is fixed 74, generate candidate tuples of 9 distinct positive integers summing 74.
# Min 1, max can't exceed 74-(sum of others>=1)
# To reduce search, pick integers from 1 to 30 (somewhat arbitrary but manageable).

# We'll generate all permutations of subset of size 9 of numbers 1..30 summing to 74.

# Generate all subsets of size 9 from range(1,31) with sum 74.

# To reduce output: print only on discovery of valid grid.

from itertools import combinations

def sum_is_74(comb):
    return sum(comb)==74

# Precompute all distinct 9-element combinations with sum 74 (can be slow, so limit numbers)

candidates = [c for c in combinations(range(1,31),9) if sum_is_74(c)]

print(f"Found {len(candidates)} combinations of 9 distinct integers in [1..30] summing to 74.")

# For each candidate, check all permutations (up to 9! = 362,880, so limit permutations)

max_perm_per_candidate = 5000

found_count = 0

for comb in candidates:
    # To reduce work, check some permutations only
    for idx, p in enumerate(permutations(comb)):
        if idx>=max_perm_per_candidate:
            break
        grid = [p[i*3:(i+1)*3] for i in range(3)]
        # Check distinctness already guaranteed
        # Compute newgrid according to the problem definition
        newgrid = [[0]*3 for _ in range(3)]
        for i in range(3):
            for j in range(3):
                total = 0
                for (ni,nj) in neighbors(i,j):
                    total += grid[ni][nj]
                newgrid[i][j] = total
        count_23 = sum(newgrid[i][j]==23 for i in range(3) for j in range(3))
        if count_23==4:
            found_count +=1
            print(f"Candidate {found_count}: center value = {grid[1][1]}")
