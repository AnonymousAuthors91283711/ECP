The problem describes functions \( f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) satisfying a functional equation involving \( f(x^4 + y) = x^3 f(x) + f(f(y)) \), and a property \(P\) restricting the number of zeros of \(f\) to some natural number \(n\).

We can interpret this informally to explore possible functions \(f\) satisfying the functional equation and having exactly \(n\) zeros. To gain insight, let's enumerate candidate functions defined on some small sample points, checking the key conditions like the zeros count and the equation for some small values.

Because the domain is \(\mathbb{R}\), we can't test all points, but we can try sample values \(x, y\) and guess possible zeros. We must focus on some known simple functions (e.g., zero function, constant function, polynomials) and check the equation.

To maximize simplicity and utility within 400 tokens, the program will:

- Test a few sample candidate \(f\) as polynomials or piecewise linear functions on a finite subset (e.g., \{-2,-1,0,1,2\}).
- For each candidate, count approximate zeros (we use equality testing on finite points).
- Check if the functional equation holds for sample \(x,y\).
- Print each candidate with zeros count and equation verification.

This approach doesn't guarantee a proof but enumerates likely solutions and partial evidence.

```python
# Enumerate simple candidate functions f: R->R on sample points
# Check zero counts and functional eq f(x^4 + y) = x^3 f(x) + f(f(y))
# on sample x,y in [-2,-1,0,1,2]. Output candidates with zero count + eq check.

points = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]
import math

def zero_count(f, pts):
    return sum(1 for t in pts if abs(f(t)) < 1e-8)

def check_eq(f, xs, ys):
    # Check functional eq on sample xs, ys, return True if holds on all
    for x in xs:
        for y in ys:
            lhs = f(x**4 + y)
            rhs = x**3 * f(x) + f(f(y))
            if abs(lhs - rhs) > 1e-6:
                return False
    return True

# Candidate functions (defined on R):
# For simplicity, define f by a formula or dictionary on points, 
# here using polynomials: zero, identity, constant, cubic, etc.

def f_zero(x): return 0
def f_id(x): return x
def f_const1(x): return 1
def f_cub(x): return x**3
def f_quad(x): return x**2
def f_neg_cub(x): return -x**3

    ("zero", f_zero),
    ("identity", f_id),
    ("const1", f_const1),
    ("cubic", f_cub),
    ("quadratic", f_quad),
    ("neg_cubic", f_neg_cub),

for name, f in candidates:
    zc = zero_count(f, points)
    eq_holds = check_eq(f, points, points)
    print(f"Function {name}: zeros={zc}, eq holds? {eq_holds}")
