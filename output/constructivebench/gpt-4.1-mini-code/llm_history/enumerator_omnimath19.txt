The problem is about finding the minimal size \( k \) of a subset \( B \subseteq X \) such that \( B \cup f(B) = X \), where \( X \) is a finite set of size 100, and \( f: X \to X \) has no fixed points and satisfies that every 40-element subset \( A \) intersects its image \( f(A) \).

I will enumerate candidates for \( k \) for small sample sets with \( |X| = 6 \) instead of 100 to observe behavior. I will randomly generate some \( f \) with no fixed points, and verify the intersection condition for subsets of size 3 (half of 6, approximating 40 for 100). Then, I will try to find minimal \( k \) such that there is a \( B \subseteq X \) with \( |B| = k \) and \( B \cup f(B) = X \).

This will help conjecture the minimal \( k \), although it won't solve the problem for real size 100, but offers computational experimentation.

    # Condition: no fixed points
    if any(f[x] == x for x in X):
        return False
    # For all subsets A with size 3 (approximate 40/100 of size 6),
    # A and f(A) intersect
    for A in itertools.combinations(X, 3):
        A_set = set(A)
        fA_set = set(f[x] for x in A)
        if A_set.isdisjoint(fA_set):
            return False
    return True

            fB_set = set(f[x] for x in B)
            if B_set.union(fB_set) == set(X):
