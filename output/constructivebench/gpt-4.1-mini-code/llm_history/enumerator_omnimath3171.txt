The problem defines a function A(k) counting certain odd divisors d of k with d^2 < 2k, then considers the alternating series summing (-1)^(k-1)*A(k)/k. We want to explore the behavior of the partial sums of this series to guess or approach the value of the sum.

I will:
- Enumerate k up to a small threshold (e.g., 40).
- Compute A(k) exactly.
- Compute partial sums of the series.
- Print each term and partial sum immediately.

This approach may help conjecture about the sum omnimath3171_answer and understand the pattern of A(k) and the series.

```python
import math

def divisors(n):
    divs = set()
    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n))+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divs.add(i)
            divs.add(n // i)
    return divs

def A(k):
    # Count odd divisors d of k with d^2 < 2*k
    return sum(1 for d in divisors(k) if d % 2 == 1 and d*d < 2*k)

max_k = 40
partial_sum = 0.0

print(f"Enumerating terms for k in 1..{max_k}:")
for k in range(1, max_k+1):
    Ak = A(k)
    term = ((-1)**(k-1)) * Ak / k
    partial_sum += term
    print(f"k={k}, A(k)={Ak}, term={term:.6f}, partial_sum={partial_sum:.6f}")
```
