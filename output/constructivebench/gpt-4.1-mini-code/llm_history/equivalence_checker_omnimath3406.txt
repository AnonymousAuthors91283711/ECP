abbrev omnimath3406_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath3406 :
  let apples := 12
  let bananas := 15 + 3
  bananas / (apples + bananas) = omnimath3406_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 3/5
Proposed Answer: (18 : ℚ) / (12 + 18)
Let's analyze this step by step:

1. The problem defines:
   - apples = 12
   - bananas = 15 + 3 = 18
   - The expression to evaluate is bananas / (apples + bananas)

2. Substituting the values:
   - 18 / (12 + 18) = 18/30

3. Simplifying 18/30:
   - Divide numerator and denominator by 6 → 3/5

4. The ground truth answer is 3/5 (simplified form)
5. The proposed answer is (18 : ℚ) / (12 + 18) which equals 18/30 (unsimplified form)

The two answers are mathematically equivalent (18/30 = 3/5), just in different forms. The proposed answer shows the unsimplified form with explicit rational number typing, while the ground truth shows the simplified form.
