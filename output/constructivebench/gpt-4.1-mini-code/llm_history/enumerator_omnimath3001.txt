[write_program]
The expression to evaluate is 2 + 3 * 5 + 2. We'll write a Python program that prints intermediate calculations and the final value.

```python
# Enumerate the expression components and print the final sum
def main():
    a = 2
    b = 3
    c = 5
    d = 2
    product = b * c
    print(f"3 * 5 = {product}")
    total = a + product + d
    print(f"2 + {product} + 2 = {total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
