This problem asks for the count of integer values c such that the quartic equation has exactly 12 real roots when we consider all roots from the equation \(x^4 - 2cx^2 + (c+1) = 0.\)

The enumerated data shows the count of real roots at various integer values of c. Observing the data:
- For \(c = 2, 3, \ldots, 10\), the equation has 4 real roots.
- For other c, the number of real roots is less or not matching 12.

The set described involves the total count of x in ℝ such that the polynomial equals zero and this count is 12. Given the polynomial is quartic, having exactly 12 distinct real roots is impossible because a quartic polynomial has at most 4 real roots.

Hence, the condition of "having exactly 12 real roots" likely means counting the multiplicities in some way or considering solutions in a complex setting that sum to 12, or maybe the problem is misinterpreted.

Since the enumeration only gives counts less than 12 and nothing equals 12, the set described is empty; thus, its cardinality is zero.

Therefore, the correct answer is 0.
