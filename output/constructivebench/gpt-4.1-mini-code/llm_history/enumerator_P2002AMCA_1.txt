The problem involves finding the sum of the roots of a polynomial formed by \((2X+3)(X-4) + (2X+3)(X-6)\). We can factor and simplify it, then find the roots, sum them, and output the sum exactly.

```python
# Enumerate roots and their sum of the polynomial ((2X + 3)(X - 4) + (2X + 3)(X - 6)) over rationals

from sympy import symbols, simplify, roots

X = symbols('X')
# Define the polynomial symbolically
poly = (2*X + 3)*(X - 4) + (2*X + 3)*(X - 6)
simplified_poly = simplify(poly)  # Should factor common (2X + 3)

# Compute roots with multiplicity
rts = roots(simplified_poly, X)

# Output roots and their sum immediately
print("Polynomial:", simplified_poly)
for root, mult in rts.items():
    print(f"Root: {root}, multiplicity: {mult}")

# Sum roots counting multiplicities
total_sum = sum(root * mult for root, mult in rts.items())
print("Sum of roots:", total_sum)
```
