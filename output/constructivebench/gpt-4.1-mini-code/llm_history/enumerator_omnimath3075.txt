The problem seems to be about counting the pairs \((r,f)\), where \(r,f \in \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}\), such that \(8 + r > 10 + f\), i.e., \(r - f > 2\). I will enumerate all such pairs and compute the ratio of their count to the total of 36 pairs.

```python
# Enumerate pairs (r,f) with r,f in 1..6 and compute fraction of pairs where r - f > 2

def main():
    Robbie = range(1, 7)
    Francine = range(1, 7)
    total = 0
    favorable = 0

    for r in Robbie:
        for f in Francine:
            total += 1
            if r - f > 2:
                favorable += 1
                print(f"Favorable pair: (r={r}, f={f})")

    print(f"Total pairs: {total}")
    print(f"Favorable pairs: {favorable}")
    # Exact fraction:
    from fractions import Fraction
    frac = Fraction(favorable, total)
    print(f"Ratio favorable/total = {frac} = {float(frac):.5f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
