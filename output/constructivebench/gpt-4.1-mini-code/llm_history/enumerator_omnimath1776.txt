[write_program]
This problem deals with finding all complex roots of the quartic polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0\). We want to enumerate these roots exactly or numerically to help conjecture the explicit form of the solution set. The program will:

- Define the polynomial coefficients.
- Use NumPy's roots function to find numerical roots.
- Print roots immediately as found.
- Also verify results for various field extensions or try factorizations if possible (though for brevity we just show numeric roots).
- Use a small tolerance to identify roots and print clean approximations.

```python
# enumerator.py
import numpy as np

def main():
    # Polynomial coefficients for x^4 + 2x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + 1
    coeffs = [1, 2, 2, 2, 1]
    roots = np.roots(coeffs)
    print("Polynomial coefficients:", coeffs)
    print("Finding roots of x^4 + 2x^3 + 2x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0:")
    for i, r in enumerate(roots, 1):
        # Print roots in exact form if possible (here we print numeric)
        print(f"Root {i}: {r}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
