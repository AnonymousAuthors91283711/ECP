The problem counts the number of positive integer triples (a, b, c) with a + b + c = 66 and a < b < c. We want to enumerate such triples and count them.

We will:
- Enumerate all positive triples (a,b,c) with a+b+c=66 and a<b<c.
- Print each triple when found.
- Finally, print the total count (the answer).

```python
# Enumerate positive triples (a,b,c) with a+b+c=66 and a < b < c.

def main():
    total = 0
    n = 66
    for a in range(1, n):  # a positive
        # b must be > a
        for b in range(a+1, n):
            c = n - a - b
            # c must be > b and positive
            if c > b > a > 0:
                print(f"Triple: (a={a}, b={b}, c={c})")
                total += 1
    print(f"Total number of triples with a+b+c=66 and a<b<c: {total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
