The problem appears to deal with sharing a total sum of numbers 105, 125, and 175 into three equal shares and finding the difference between some transformed variables \( t \) and \( d \).

This code enumerates the total and shares, computes \( t \) and \( d \), and outputs their difference to conjecture the true answer.

```python
# Compute the sum of numbers 105, 125, and 175
a, b, c = 105, 125, 175
total = a + b + c

# Compute the equal share and then t, d variables as defined in the problem
share = total // 3
t = share - a
d = share - b

print("Parameters:")
print(f"a = {a}, b = {b}, c = {c}")
print(f"total = {total}, share = {share}")
print(f"t = share - a = {t}")
print(f"d = share - b = {d}")
print(f"t - d = {t - d}")
```
