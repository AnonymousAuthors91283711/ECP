Ground Truth Answer: 8 / (7 ^ (1/3))
Proposed Answer: 4 * ((100 / 4) / (7 + 100 / 4))^(1 / 3)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the maximum value of a cyclic sum of fractional expressions under constraints.

2. The ground truth answer is 8/(7^(1/3)), which simplifies to approximately 4.308.

3. The proposed answer is 4*((100/4)/(7+100/4))^(1/3). Let's simplify this:
   - 100/4 = 25
   - So it becomes 4*(25/(7+25))^(1/3) = 4*(25/32)^(1/3) ≈ 4*0.928 ≈ 3.712

The two answers are clearly different (4.308 vs 3.712). The proposed answer is incorrect as it gives a smaller value than the ground truth maximum.

The correct approach would be to set three variables to 0 and one to 100 (due to the cyclic nature and the form of the expression), which gives the ground truth answer.
