The problem is to count the number of integer pairs \((x,y)\) with \(1 \leq x \leq 100\), \(101 \leq y \leq 205\), such that \((3^x + 7^y) \mod 10 = 0\). We want to enumerate all pairs satisfying this condition and print them immediately when found, then print the total count.

Because the problem involves modular arithmetic with base 10, it suffices to analyze the last digits of powers of 3 and 7, which cycle periodically. We will utilize these cycles to efficiently check each pair.

```python
# Enumerate pairs (x,y) with 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, 101 ≤ y ≤ 205,
# satisfying (3^x + 7^y) % 10 == 0, and print them along with the final count.

def main():
    # Last digit cycles for 3^x (length 4)
    cycle3 = [3, 9, 7, 1]
    # Last digit cycles for 7^y (length 4)
    cycle7 = [7, 9, 3, 1]

    count = 0
    print("Enumerated pairs (x,y) with (3^x + 7^y) mod 10 = 0:")
    for x in range(1, 101):
        last_digit_3 = cycle3[(x - 1) % 4]
        for y in range(101, 206):
            last_digit_7 = cycle7[(y - 1) % 4]
            s = last_digit_3 + last_digit_7
            if s % 10 == 0:
                print(f"({x},{y})")
                count += 1
    print(f"Total count: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
