The problem involves four positive real numbers \(a, b, c, d\) with arithmetic and geometric constraints:
- They form an arithmetic sequence: \(b - a = c - b = d - c\)
- They satisfy a geometric condition: \(\frac{b}{a} = \frac{d}{b}\).

We want to find the value of \(\frac{a}{d}\).

We will:
- Enumerate sequences \((a,b,c,d)\) with \(a,b,c,d > 0\), in arithmetic progression, and check the geometric ratio condition.
- For some small integer triples \((a,d)\), find \(b, c\) from the arithmetic condition and verify the geometric condition.
- Print \(a/d\) immediately when conditions hold.

```python
# Enumerate small positive arithmetic progressions (a,b,c,d)
# with b/a = d/b, print a/d when conditions hold.

def approx_eq(x, y, tol=1e-10):
    return abs(x - y) < tol

print("# Enumerating candidate quadruples and printing a/d")

for a in [1,2,3,4,5]:
    for d in [1,2,3,4,5]:
        # arithmetic progression step r = (d - a)/3
        r = (d - a)/3
        b = a + r
        c = a + 2*r
        if a <= 0 or b <= 0 or c <= 0 or d <= 0:
            continue
        # Check geometric condition b/a = d/b
        if approx_eq(b/a, d/b):
            ratio = a/d
            print(f"a={a}, b={b:.6f}, c={c:.6f}, d={d}, a/d={ratio:.6f}")

# From the outputs we can conjecture the exact value of a/d in simplest form
```
