The problem involves counting integer points \((p.1, p.2) = (x,y)\) in the rectangle \(-9 \leq x \leq 6\), \(-2 \leq y \leq 8\) satisfying 
\[
(y+2)(6 - x) = (8 - y)(x + 9).
\]
We enumerate all integer pairs in the given ranges, check the equation exactly, and print each solution immediately. Finally, we print the total count (the cardinality).

```python
# Enumerate integer points (x,y) with -9 ≤ x ≤ 6, -2 ≤ y ≤ 8 satisfying
# (y+2)(6 - x) = (8 - y)(x + 9)
# Print each solution immediately and then print the total count.

def main():
    count = 0
    for x in range(-9, 7):  # 7 is 6+1 for inclusive range
        for y in range(-2, 9):
            left = (y + 2) * (6 - x)
            right = (8 - y) * (x + 9)
            if left == right:
                print(f"Solution: x={x}, y={y}")
                count += 1
    print(f"Total solutions: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
