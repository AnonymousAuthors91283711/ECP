The problem involves finding all real numbers \( A \) for which there exist two distinct complex numbers \( x_1 \neq x_2 \) satisfying
\[
x_1(x_1+1) = A = x_2(x_2+1)
\]
and
\[
x_1^4 + 3x_1^3 + 5x_1 = x_2^4 + 3x_2^3 + 5x_2.
\]

To explore this, note:
- The condition \( x_1(x_1+1) = x_2(x_2+1) \) means \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) are distinct roots of the quadratic polynomial \( z^2 + z - A = 0 \).
- We want to find all \( A \in \mathbb{R} \) such that for distinct roots \(x_1 \neq x_2\) of that quadratic, the second equality holds.

The program below numerically enumerates possible \(A\) from a sample range by:
- Computing roots \(x_1, x_2\) of \( z^2 + z - A = 0 \).
- Checking if \( x_1 \neq x_2 \) and the second condition holds (within numerical tolerance).
- Prints values when found.

This should help conjecture the explicit form of \( \text{omnimath346_answer} \).

```python
import cmath

def F(x):
    return x**4 + 3*x**3 + 5*x

print("Enumerating values of A with distinct roots x1,x2 of x^2+x - A=0 where F(x1)=F(x2):")

# Sample A values real from -5 to 5 with step 0.05
step = 0.05
seen = set()
for i in range(-100, 101):
    A = i * step
    # roots of z^2 + z - A = 0
    D = 1 + 4*A  # discriminant
    rootD = cmath.sqrt(D)
    x1 = (-1 + rootD)/2
    x2 = (-1 - rootD)/2
    if abs(x1 - x2) < 1e-12:
        continue
    f1 = F(x1)
    f2 = F(x2)
    # check equality within tolerance
    if abs(f1 - f2) < 1e-9:
        key = round(A, 6)
        if key not in seen:
            seen.add(key)
            print(f"A = {A:.6f}, x1 = {x1}, x2 = {x2}, F(x1) = {f1}, F(x2) = {f2}")

# Optionally we might try to print a candidate answer (like the set of found A's)
print("\nCandidates for omnimath346_answer:")
print(sorted(seen))
```
This enumeration outputs \(A\) and corresponding roots with the required conditions met, helping in finding the exact set \( \textrm{omnimath346\_answer} \).
