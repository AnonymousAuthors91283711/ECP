The problem concerns sequences of flips on a 4x4 grid, where each flip toggles a cell and its neighbors. The goal is to find all sequence lengths \( n \) for which there exists a sequence of flips (specified by \( f \)) so that every cell in the final grid is True.

A direct approach is to simulate the toggling on the 4x4 grid for sequences of length \( n \), for \( n \) up to some small number, and print those \( n \) for which the goal is achievable.

We model the grid as a 16-bit integer, where bit 0 corresponds to cell (0,0), bit 1 to (0,1), etc. toggling flips bits. We generate all possible flips (16 in total) and simulate all sequences of flips of length \( n \). To keep complexity manageable, we limit \( n \) up to about 5 or 6 and print \( n \) values where full true grid is reachable.

```python
# Enumerate all n (sequence lengths) for which there exists a sequence of flips on a 4x4 grid
# so that every cell is True at the end. Each flip toggles a cell and its neighbors.
# We print found n immediately.

def neighbors(i,j):
    for di,dj in [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)]:
        ni,nj = i+di,j+dj
        if 0 <= ni < 4 and 0 <= nj < 4:
            yield ni,nj

def cell_index(i,j):
    return i*4 + j

def flip_mask(i,j):
    # Bitmask for flipping cell (i,j) and its neighbors
    mask = 1 << cell_index(i,j)
    for ni,nj in neighbors(i,j):
        mask |= 1 << cell_index(ni,nj)
    return mask

def all_sequences(n, flips):
    # Generate all sequences of length n with flips selected from flips
    # To reduce complexity, generate sequences as numbers in base 16 with digits in [0..15]
    max_seq = 16**n
    for seq_num in range(max_seq):
        seq = []
        x = seq_num
        for _ in range(n):
            seq.append(x % 16)
            x //= 16
        yield seq[::-1]

def main():
    goal = (1 << 16) - 1  # All bits set (all True)
    flips = [flip_mask(i,j) for i in range(4) for j in range(4)]

    from itertools import product

    max_n = 5  # max length sequence to try, higher is too slow
    for n in range(1, max_n+1):
        found = False
        # Instead of generating all sequences (16^n), generate smartly by BFS on grid states to improve efficiency
        from collections import deque
        visited = set()
        q = deque()
        q.append((0,0)) # state=0 (all False), length=0
        while q:
            state, length = q.popleft()
            if length == n:
                if state == goal:
                    print(f"n = {n} achievable")
                    found = True
                    break
                continue
            for fmask in flips:
                nstate = state ^ fmask
                if (nstate,length+1) not in visited:
                    visited.add((nstate,length+1))
                    q.append((nstate,length+1))
        if found:
            # print immediately, continue to next n to find others if any
            pass
