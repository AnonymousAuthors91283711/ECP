Ground Truth Answer: 8
Proposed Answer: 20
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a situation where:
   - Initially, girls make up 40% of total students (2*total %5 = 0)
   - After 2 girls leave, girls make up 30% of the new total (which is total-2+2 = total, since 2 leave and 2 join)

2. The ground truth answer is 8, which would mean:
   - Initial girls: 2*8/5 = 3.2, but this isn't an integer
   - This contradicts the first condition (2*total %5 = 0)

3. The proposed answer is 20:
   - Initial girls: 2*20/5 = 8 (40% of 20)
   - After 2 leave: 6 girls out of 20 total (30% of 20)
   - This satisfies all conditions perfectly

The ground truth answer appears incorrect as it doesn't satisfy the first condition, while the proposed answer satisfies all conditions. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
