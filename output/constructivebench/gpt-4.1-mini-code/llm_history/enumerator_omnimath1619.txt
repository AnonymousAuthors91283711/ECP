The problem involves a set of numbers from 1 to 20 (excluding 0) and sums over their divisors within this set, summing the reciprocals of how many numbers each divides. We want to enumerate the values of 

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{20} \frac{1}{|\{ d \in \{1,...,20\} : k \mid d \}|}
\]

and conjecture the exact sum.

We will implement this in Python for \(n=20\), printing each term and the cumulative sum.

```python
# Enumerate terms sum_{k=1}^{20} 1 / |{d in 1..20 : k divides d}|
def divisors_count(k, n):
    # Count numbers d in 1..n divisible by k
    return n // k

n = 20
total = 0
for k in range(1, n+1):
    count = divisors_count(k, n)
    val = 1 / count
    total += val
    # Print k, divisor count, term (as fraction and decimal), and cumulative sum
    print(f"k={k}, count={count}, term=1/{count}={val:.6f}, cumulative sum={total:.6f}")

print(f"\nTotal sum for n={n} is approximately {total:.6f}")
```
