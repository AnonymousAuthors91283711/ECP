This problem involves finding real numbers \( p \) and \( q \) that describe the exact range of real numbers \( r \) for which a quadratic equation in \( x \) with coefficients dependent on \( r \) has two distinct negative roots \( x_1, x_2 \). The equation is characterized by the sum and product of roots conditions \( x_1 + x_2 = r + 7 \) and \( x_1 x_2 = r + 87 \).

We want to:
1. Enumerate values of \( r \) (say integers in a reasonable range) and check when such \( x_1, x_2 \) exist.
2. For each \( r \), try to find \( x_1, x_2 \) with the required constraints.
3. Determine the intervals (approximate) where these \( r \) lie.
4. Calculate \( p^2 + q^2 \).

We will print all \( r \) (in a small range) along with confirmation of the condition, then estimate \( p, q \), then print \( p^2 + q^2 \).

```python
# enumerator.py
from math import sqrt, isclose

def has_two_distinct_negative_roots(r):
    # Conditions:
    # x1 + x2 = r + 7
    # x1 * x2 = r + 87
    S = r + 7
    P = r + 87
    # Quadratic: x^2 - Sx + P = 0
    discriminant = S*S - 4*P
    if discriminant <= 0:
        return False
    root1 = (S - sqrt(discriminant))/2
    root2 = (S + sqrt(discriminant))/2
    # distinct negative roots
    if root1 < 0 and root2 < 0 and root1 != root2:
        return True
    return False

print("r values with two distinct negative roots x1,x2 such that x1+x2=r+7 and x1*x2=r+87:")
r_candidates = []
for r in range(-100, 100):  # test r from -100 to 99
    if has_two_distinct_negative_roots(r):
        print(f"r={r}")
        r_candidates.append(r)

if not r_candidates:
    print("No r found with those conditions.")
else:
    # Estimate p and q as min and max of such r
    p = min(r_candidates)
    q = max(r_candidates)
    print(f"Estimated interval: p = {p}, q = {q}")
    print("p^2 + q^2 =", p*p + q*q)
```
This code quickly enumerates integer values \( r \in [-100,99] \), checking the root conditions and printing all valid values. It then infers \( p, q \) and outputs \( p^2 + q^2 \). This might assist discovering the exact interval and answer.
