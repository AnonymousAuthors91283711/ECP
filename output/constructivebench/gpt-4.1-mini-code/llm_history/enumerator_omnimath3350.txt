The problem involves the expression \( 2 \sqrt{1.5 + \sqrt{2}} - (1.5 + \sqrt{2}) \). We want to explore possible simplified exact values or patterns by enumerating carefully chosen numerical approximations and possibly guessing an exact form. We will print the approximation and compare it to some rational/irrational guesses to find a match.

```python
import math

def try_simplify():
    # compute the expression value
    val = 2 * math.sqrt(1.5 + math.sqrt(2)) - (1.5 + math.sqrt(2))
    print(f"Value of expression: {val}")

    # try some simple rational/irrational candidates close to the value
    # e.g., test if close to -0.5, -1, sqrt(2)-3, or -sqrt(2)+1 etc.
    candidates = [
        (-0.5, "-1/2"),
        (-1.0, "-1"),
        (math.sqrt(2) - 3, "sqrt(2)-3"),
        (-math.sqrt(2) + 1, "-sqrt(2)+1"),
        (-math.sqrt(2)/2, "-sqrt(2)/2"),
        (-(1+math.sqrt(2))/2, "-(1+sqrt(2))/2")
    ]

    for cval, cname in candidates:
        diff = abs(val - cval)
        print(f"Compare to {cname}: difference = {diff:.8f}")

try_simplify()
```
