The problem is about finding integers \(m, n\) with \(\gcd(m,n)=1\), \(m<n\), and complex numbers \(z, w\) such that \(z^{13} = w\), \(w^{11} = z\), and the imaginary part of \(z\) equals \(\sin \left(\frac{m \pi}{n}\right)\), where \(n\) is the answer we want to determine.

From the equations \(z^{13} = w\) and \(w^{11} = z\), it follows that \(z^{143} = z\), so \(z\) is a 143rd root of unity. Then \(|z|=1\) and \(z = e^{2\pi i k/143}\) for some integer \(k\).

The imaginary part is \(\sin(2\pi k /143)\). We want this to be \(\sin(m\pi / n)\), so the fraction \(m/n\) should equal \(2k/143\) or \(1 - 2k/143\) (since \(\sin(x) = \sin(\pi - x)\)).

We can enumerate coprime pairs \(m, n\) with small \(n\), try to match \(m/n\) with \(2k/143\) or \(1 - 2k/143\) for \(k=1,\ldots,142\), and find possible \(n\). According to the problem, \(n\) is the minimal denominator with the property.

# We want to find coprime pairs (m, n), m < n, such that
# sin(m*pi/n) = sin(2*pi*k/143) or sin(m*pi/n) = sin(pi - 2*pi*k/143) = sin(2*pi*(143/2 - k)/143)
# for some integer k (1 <= k < 143).
#
# Since sin is periodic, we consider fractions m/n close to 2k/143 or to 1 - 2k/143.
#
# The problem likely asks for n, so we enumerate small n, find matching ratios.
