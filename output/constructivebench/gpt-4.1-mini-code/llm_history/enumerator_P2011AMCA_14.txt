Given the problem involves counting pairs \((a,b)\) with \(1 \leq a,b \leq 9\) that satisfy \(b > a^2 - b\), we rewrite the inequality as \(2b > a^2\). We enumerate all such pairs and print the fraction of pairs satisfying it.

```python
# Enumerate pairs (a,b) with 1 <= a,b <= 9 satisfying 2b > a^2,
# then print the fraction of such pairs among all 81 pairs.

def main():
    total = 0
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, 10):
        a_sq = a * a
        for b in range(1, 10):
            total += 1
            if 2 * b > a_sq:
                count += 1
                print(f"Pair satisfying condition: a={a}, b={b}")
    # Output the fraction as an exact rational number
    from fractions import Fraction
    frac = Fraction(count, total)
    print(f"Count = {count}, Total = {total}, Fraction = {frac} (exact)")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
