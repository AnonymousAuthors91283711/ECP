noncomputable abbrev omnimath990_answer : ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath990 (a : ℝ) (ha : 1 < a) :
  HasSum (fun i : ℕ => (a * i) / (a^i)) (omnimath990_answer a) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun a => (a / (1 - a))^2
Proposed Answer: fun a : ℝ => a / (a - 1)^2
Let's analyze the equivalence of the two answers:

1. Ground truth: (a / (1 - a))²
2. Proposed: a / (a - 1)²

First, let's rewrite the ground truth:
(a / (1 - a))² = a² / (1 - a)²

Now rewrite the proposed answer's denominator:
(a - 1)² = (1 - a)²

So the proposed becomes:
a / (1 - a)²

Comparing:
Ground truth: a² / (1 - a)²
Proposed: a / (1 - a)²

These are clearly different expressions. The proposed answer is missing a factor of 'a' in the numerator compared to the ground truth.
