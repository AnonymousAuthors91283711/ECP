The problem involves finding the minimum size of a finite set \( S \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^3 \) such that if two functions \( f, g: \mathbb{Z}^3 \to \mathbb{R} \) satisfy discrete harmonic conditions in each coordinate and agree on \( S \), then \( f = g \) everywhere. This is related to uniqueness sets for discrete harmonic functions on \(\mathbb{Z}^3\).

To explore this computationally, we can attempt small finite sets \( S \), check if the imposed equalities on \( S \) imply uniqueness of \( f \) and \( g \), by enumerating the space of harmonic functions restricted to a finite box, and verifying when equality on the chosen \( S \) forces equality everywhere on the box.

We will:
- Choose small boxes \(\{ (a,b,c): a,b,c \in [0,m] \}\) in \(\mathbb{Z}^3\).
- Enumerate subsets \(S\) of points in this box up to a chosen size \(n\).
- For each \(S\), test numerical linear algebra conditions to see if harmonic functions matching on \(S\) are identical.
- Print candidate sizes \(n\) as we find sets with uniqueness.

Due to complexity, we fix \(m=2\) (3x3x3 cube = 27 points) and test sets \(S\) of increasing size. We print found sizes where uniqueness holds.

```python
import itertools
import numpy as np

# Dimension of the cube in each direction
m = 2  # points from 0 to m on each axis: 3x3x3=27 points total

points = [(x,y,z) for x in range(m+1) for y in range(m+1) for z in range(m+1)]
n_points = len(points)

# Map point to index for matrix construction
index = {p:i for i,p in enumerate(points)}

# Construct the discrete Laplace linear system: f(p) = average of neighbors along each axis
# The harmonicity condition for point p (not on boundary) implies:
# 6*f(p) = sum of f(neighbors in +/- x,y,z directions)
# We use these equations for inner points; boundary points have no such constraint.

def neighbors(p):
    x,y,z = p
    nbrs = []
    for dx,dy,dz in [(1,0,0),(-1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,-1,0),(0,0,1),(0,0,-1)]:
        nx, ny, nz = x+dx, y+dy, z+dz
        if 0 <= nx <= m and 0 <= ny <= m and 0 <= nz <= m:
            nbrs.append((nx,ny,nz))
    return nbrs

# Build linear system A f = 0 for f harmonic in interior points.
A = np.zeros((n_points, n_points))
# For boundary points, no harmonicity constraint => zero row
for p,i in index.items():
    nbrs = neighbors(p)
    if len(nbrs) == 6:
        # interior point: 6 f(p) - sum f(nbr) = 0
        A[i,i] = 6
        for nb in nbrs:
            A[i,index[nb]] = -1
    else:
        # boundary point: no equation, row zero, f free
        A[i,i] = 0

# The nullspace of A gives the space of harmonic functions on the cube with free values at boundary.
# Since boundary rows zero, that means boundary values free; interior determined by boundary.

# For uniqueness, if two harmonic functions agree on set S, and also A f=0,
# the difference h = f-g is harmonic and zero on S.
# So zero values on S => h zero everywhere iff restriction matrix from nullspace basis to S is injective.

# Compute nullspace of A (numeric kernel)
def nullspace(A, tol=1e-10):
    u,s,vh = np.linalg.svd(A)
    null_mask = (s <= tol)
    null_space = np.compress(null_mask, vh, axis=0)
    return np.transpose(null_space)

N = nullspace(A)  # each column is a nullspace vector of length n_points

print(f"Total points: {n_points}, Nullity of A (dimension of harmonic space): {N.shape[1]}")

# Enumerate candidate sets S of size n increasing from 1 up to 7 (to limit output)
max_n = 7
found_sizes = set()

for n in range(1, max_n+1):
    # To keep computations fast, sample some sets randomly if too many subsets
    # but for small n total subsets count = C(27,n) manageable up to n=4/5
    # Let's limit exhaustive search for n<=3, random samples for n>3
    
    if n<=3:
        setsS = itertools.combinations(points, n)
    else:
        # sample random subsets
        import random
        setsS = (tuple(random.sample(points, n)) for _ in range(1000))
    
    for S in setsS:
        indices_S = [index[p] for p in S]
        # Restrict nullspace vectors to S: matrix dim (#S rows x nullity cols)
        M = N[indices_S, :]
        # Check if kernel of restriction is zero vector only
        # i.e. M has full column rank -> rank = dim nullspace
        rank = np.linalg.matrix_rank(M)
        if rank == N.shape[1]:
            print(f"Uniqueness set size candidate found: {n} with points {S}")
            found_sizes.add(n)
            break  # found for this n, go to next n

    if found_sizes:
        # Print minimal found size as current minimum candidate
        min_candidate = min(found_sizes)
        print(f"Minimal uniqueness set size candidate so far: {min_candidate}")

# Note: This is exploratory; the true minimal size might be larger.
```
This enumerator outputs candidate minimal sizes \( n \) of uniqueness sets \( S \) in the 3D discrete harmonic function setting. It prints each found candidate immediately. Adjusting parameters and increasing the search range helps conjecture the minimal cardinality.
