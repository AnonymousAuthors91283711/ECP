We want to analyze the function `fn n k` defined as iterating the process: replace the number k by the square of the sum of its digits in base 10, n times. Specifically, starting with k = 2^(1990), apply f1 repeatedly 1991 times.

This is a difficult problem because 2^(1990) is huge, but iterating f1 tends to produce much smaller numbers after a few iterations (likely converging quickly to some fixed points or cycles of the transformation).

Our approach:
- We'll explore smaller values of n and k = 2^m for some small m.
- We'll print intermediate values of fn(n,k) for small n and k to conjecture the behavior.
- This can help guess omnimath3926_answer without huge computation.

```python
# Enumerate fn(n,k) = iterating sum_of_digits squared starting from k
# For sample k = 2^m with small m, and n up to 20 to see patterns

def sum_of_digits_sq(x):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(x))**2

def fn(n, k):
    for _ in range(n):
        k = sum_of_digits_sq(k)
        print(f"fn step {_+1} = {k}")
    return k

def main():
    print("Testing fn(n, k) for n=0..20 and k=2^m with small m")
    for m in range(1, 11):
        k = 2**m
        print(f"\nk=2^{m} = {k}")
        val = k
        print(f"fn(0,k) = {val}")
        for n in range(1, 21):
            val = sum_of_digits_sq(val)
            print(f"fn({n},{k}) = {val}")
            # check if fixed point reached
            if n > 1 and val == prev_val:
                print(f"Fixed point reached at n={n}: {val}")
                break
            prev_val = val

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
