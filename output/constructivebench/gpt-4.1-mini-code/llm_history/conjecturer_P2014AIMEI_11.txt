abbrev P2014AIMEI_11_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem P2014AIMEI_11 :
  let totalPaths := 4^6
  let validPaths := 2 * (choose 6 3) * (choose 3 1) + 2 * (choose 6 1) * (choose 5 2) + 2 * (choose 6 0) * (choose 6 3)
  ∃ m n : ℕ, Coprime m n ∧ validPaths / totalPaths = m / n ∧ m + n = P2014AIMEI_11_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Total paths: 4096
2 * choose(6,3) * choose(3,1) = 120
2 * choose(6,1) * choose(5,2) = 120
2 * choose(6,0) * choose(6,3) = 40
Valid paths = 280
Probability = 35/512 in lowest terms
Sum m + n = 547. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
