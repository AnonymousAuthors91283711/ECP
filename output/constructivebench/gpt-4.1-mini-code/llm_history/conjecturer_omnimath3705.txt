Explanation: The original expression used `//` syntax, which is the syntax for a subtype and cannot be used directly inside a set comprehension like `{ ... | ... }`. Instead, we define the set `omnimath3705_answer` as the set of natural numbers `n` such that there exists a natural number `k` with the conditions given: `k > 0`, `n = k^3`, the last digit of `k` is not zero (`k % 10 ≠ 0`), and there exists a natural number `m` with `m^3 = k`. This matches the logical conditions specified in the theorem, capturing cubes `n=k^3` of positive integers `k` whose last digit is not zero and such that `k` itself is a perfect cube. This is a closed form set expression in Lean and compiles correctly.
