abbrev omnimath3456_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3456 :
  Real.sqrt (3 ^ 3 + 3 ^ 3 + 3 ^ 3) = omnimath3456_answer :=
sorry

Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: 9
Let me analyze this problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem is asking to evaluate √(3³ + 3³ + 3³)
2. First, let's compute the expression inside the square root:
   - 3³ = 27
   - So we have 27 + 27 + 27 = 81
3. Now take the square root: √81 = 9
4. The proposed answer is exactly 9

The ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" which typically means it's intentionally left blank in Lean proofs, but mathematically the correct answer is indeed 9.

Since the proposed answer matches exactly with the correct mathematical evaluation, the answers are equivalent.
