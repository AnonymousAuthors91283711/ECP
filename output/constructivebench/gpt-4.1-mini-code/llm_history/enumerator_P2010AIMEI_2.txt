The problem involves evaluating the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{999} (10^{k+1} - 1)\) modulo 1000. Since \(10^{k+1}\) grows quickly and we only care about modulo 1000, we can reduce terms modulo 1000 at each step. The problem is to find

\[
\left(\prod_{k=0}^{999} (10^{k+1} -1)\right) \mod 1000
\]

We will enumerate the terms, compute each \(10^{k+1}-1 \mod 1000\), multiply them modulo 1000, and print intermediate steps to conjecture a pattern.

```python
# Enumerate terms of the product ∏(10^(k+1)-1) for k=0..999 modulo 1000
# Print each term and cumulative product modulo 1000 to observe patterns

def mod_pow_10(exp, mod=1000):
    # Efficient mod for 10^exp mod 1000, noting periodicity
    # Since 10^3 = 0 mod 1000, for exp >= 3, 10^exp mod 1000 = 0
    if exp >= 3:
        return 0
    return pow(10, exp, mod)

def main():
    mod = 1000
    product = 1
    print("k term mod1000 product mod1000")
    for k in range(1000):
        power = mod_pow_10(k+1, mod)
        term = (power - 1) % mod
        product = (product * term) % mod
        # Print only the first 15 and some later steps to keep output brief
        if k < 15 or k in [999]:
            print(f"{k} {term} {product}")
    print(f"Final product mod {mod} after 1000 terms: {product}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
