abbrev omnimath246_answer : ℕ → ℕ → ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath246 (m n : ℕ) (h : m ≥ n) :
    (m + n)! / (m - n)! = omnimath246_answer m n := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun m n => ∏ i in Finset.Icc 1 n, (m^2 + m - i^2 + i)
Proposed Answer: fun m n => (Finset.Icc (m - n + 1) (m + n)).prod id
Let me analyze the problem and the two answers:

1. The problem is about finding an expression for (m + n)! / (m - n)! when m ≥ n.

2. Ground Truth Answer: This expresses the product of terms (m² + m - i² + i) for i from 1 to n.

3. Proposed Answer: This expresses the product of all integers from (m - n + 1) to (m + n).

Let's verify if they are equivalent:

The expression (m + n)! / (m - n)! can indeed be written as the product from (m - n + 1) to (m + n), since:
(m + n)! / (m - n)! = (m - n + 1) × (m - n + 2) × ... × (m + n)

The ground truth answer is also correct, as it's an alternative expression for the same product. We can show they're equivalent by:
- The product from (m - n + 1) to (m + n) can be rewritten as ∏_{k=1}^{2n} (m - n + k)
- This can be transformed into the form given in the ground truth answer

Therefore, the two answers are equivalent, just expressed differently.
