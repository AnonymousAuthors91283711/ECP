# The problem involves determining the winner given a number n, based on the remainder of n modulo 6.
# The criteria: 
# If n % 6 in {1, 3, 5}, winner is "Jenna"; otherwise, winner is "First player".
# We'll enumerate for small values including 2013, 2014, print n, n%6 and the winner.

```python
def winner(n):
    r = n % 6
    if r in {1,3,5}:
        return "Jenna"
    else:
        return "First player"

sample_ns = [2013, 2014]
for n in sample_ns:
    print(f"n={n}, n%6={n%6}, winner={winner(n)}")
# Additional enumeration from 1 to 12 to illustrate pattern
for n in range(1,13):
    print(f"n={n}, n%6={n%6}, winner={winner(n)}")
```
