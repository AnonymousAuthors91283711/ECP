The problem is to find all \( n \) such that \(\binom{T-3}{17} = \binom{T-3}{n}\) for fixed \( T = 43 \), \( n > 0 \), and \( n \neq 17 \). Because binomial coefficients are symmetric, \(\binom{m}{k} = \binom{m}{m-k}\), and we want all \( n \neq 17 \) with the same value as \(\binom{40}{17}\).

Let's enumerate possible \( n \) with \( 0 < n < 41 \), excluding \( n=17 \), and print those that match \(\binom{40}{17}\).

```python
from math import comb

T = 43
m = T - 3  # 40
target_k = 17
target = comb(m, target_k)

print(f"T = {T}, m = {m}, target k = {target_k}, target = C({m},{target_k}) = {target}")

# Enumerate n from 1 to m-1, exclude target_k, print if values match
for n in range(1, m):
    if n == target_k:
        continue
    val = comb(m, n)
    if val == target:
        print(f"n = {n} gives C({m},{n}) = {val}")

# Because n and m-n can give the same value, print the minimal such n
if target != 0:
    mirror_n = m - target_k
    if mirror_n != target_k:
        print(f"By symmetry, n = {mirror_n} gives C({m},{mirror_n}) = {target}")

# Summarize the answer: n = mirror_n is solution other than 17
print(f"The value of olympiadbench2777_answer is the n found above (excluding 17).")
```
