The problem is about finding the least sum \( s = \sum_{i=0}^7 (f(i,i) + 1) \) where \( f: (Fin 8 \times Fin 8) \to Fin 64 \) is a bijection such that for every pair \((i,j)\), the image values satisfy adjacency constraints along rows or columns: \( f(i,j)+1 \) equals either \( f(i+1,j) \) or \( f(i,j+1) \). Intuitively, this models a Hamiltonian path through a grid that steps right or down at each consecutive integer, and we want the sum of the diagonal elements' values plus 1.

We will enumerate such bijections for small values or subsets and output candidate sums. Given the huge search space (64! permutations), we must drastically reduce the scope. We interpret the condition: from each cell \((i,j)\), \( f(i,j)+1 \) is either to the right or down cell, so the function follows a path from the smallest value to the largest, incrementing by one, moving only right or down.

Hence, the path is a monotone path from \((0,0)\) to \((7,7)\), numbering cells from 0 to 63 in order along this path, with the rest of the grid filled somehow but forced by bijection and adjacency.

So the values along this path are increasing by 1 starting at 0, and from the condition, \(f\) is basically a standard Young tableau of shape \(8 \times 8\) corresponding to a linear extension of the poset induced by partial order on the grid with moves right or down. 

To minimize \( s = \sum_{i=0}^7 (f(i,i) + 1) \), we want the diagonal cells to have minimal possible values in the bijection.

The path has length 64 and can move either right or down at each step (from (0,0) to (7,7)), total 14 steps (7 right +7 down), thus number of such paths is \(\binom{14}{7} = 3432\).

For each of these 3432 paths (orderings of the first 64 values), we can compute the positions of the path indices in the diagonal and sum them.

Because here \(f\) is bijective, values outside are filled from 63 down to the values not assigned in path, but only the path determines values from 0 to 63 - so the value assigned to \((i,i)\) is the index of cell \((i,i)\) in the path.

Thus, \( f(i,i) = \) the position of \((i,i)\) in the path, so \( f(i,i) + 1 = \) the position (1-based) of diagonal cell \((i,i)\) in the path.

To minimize sum of \( (f(i,i)+1) \), want the diagonal cells to be as early as possible in the path.

The path starts at (0,0) and ends at (7,7), and we can only move right or down.

So the problem reduces to enumerating all monotone paths (length 15) from (0,0) to (7,7), record the positions of diagonal cells on the path, sum, and output minimal sums.

Let's write the program to enumerate all monotone paths from (0,0) to (7,7), output the sums of diagonal positions, print candidates as found, and finally print the minimal sum.

Because 3432 is small, it can be enumerated quickly.

```python
# Enumerate all monotone paths from (0,0) to (7,7)
# Each path has 14 moves: 7 rights (R) and 7 downs (D)
# The function f assigns value k to the k-th cell in path (starting at 0)
# f(i,j) = index of (i,j) in path
# We want sum over i=0..7 of (f(i,i)+1) = sum of positions of diagonal cells in path (1-based)
# Minimize this sum over all paths.

def main():
    n = 8
    total_steps = 2*(n-1)  # 14
    R_needed = n -1  #7 rights
    D_needed = n -1  #7 downs

    min_sum = None
    paths_seen = 0

    from sys import stdout

    # Each path can be represented as a sequence of R and D of length 14, with 7 R and 7 D.
    # We'll enumerate with recursion or lex order, but 3432 is small for simple recursion.

    def backtrack(path, r, d):
        nonlocal min_sum, paths_seen
        if r == R_needed and d == D_needed:
            # path complete
            # this path corresponds to positions in grid from (0,0)
            # reconstruct positions visited by moves:
            pos = [(0,0)]
            x,y=0,0
            for move in path:
                if move == 'R':
                    x +=1
                else:
                    y +=1
                pos.append( (x,y) )
            # For each diagonal cell (i,i), find its index in path positions
            # sum = sum of 1-based indices of diagonal cells
            pos_indices = {p:i for i,p in enumerate(pos)}  # cell -> index in path
            s = 0
            ok = True
            # diagonal has cells from (0,0) to (7,7)
            # Check all diagonal cells appear in path (they must since path ends at (7,7))
            for i in range(n):
                if (i,i) not in pos_indices:
                    ok = False
                    break
                s += pos_indices[(i,i)] + 1
            if ok:
                paths_seen += 1
                print(f"Sum for path {paths_seen}: {s}")
                stdout.flush()
                if (min_sum is None) or (s < min_sum):
                    min_sum = s
            return

        # prune and recurse
        # If more R moves remain
        if r < R_needed:
            backtrack(path + ['R'], r+1, d)
        # If more D moves remain
        if d < D_needed:
            backtrack(path + ['D'], r, d+1)

    backtrack([], 0, 0)
    print(f"Minimum sum of diagonal positions: {min_sum}")

if __name__=="__main__":
    main()
```
This program enumerates all monotone lattice paths from (0,0) to (7,7), for each path calculates the sum of the positions of the diagonal cells along the path and outputs the sums incrementally. Finally, it prints the minimal such sum. This aids conjecturing the minimal sum of \( s \) in the original problem.
