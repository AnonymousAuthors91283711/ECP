[write_program]
The problem involves two sequences \((a_n)\) and \((b_n)\) with initial terms \(a_1, a_2\) and \(b_1, b_2\), respectively, following the Fibonacci recurrence. We want to find the least number \(N\) such that there exist initial terms with \(a_1 < b_1\) and both sequences have the same 6th term \(N\).

To explore this, the program:
- Loops over small initial values \(a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2\).
- Calculates the 6th terms of each sequence.
- Prints matches with \(a_1 < b_1\) and equal 6th terms.
- Tracks minimal found \(N\).

This will enumerate possible values \(N\) and help conjecture the minimal such \(N\).

    elif n == 1:
        return a2
    else:
        s = [a1, a2]
        for i in range(2, n+1):
            s.append(s[i-1] + s[i-2])
        return s[n]

            if b1 <= a1:
                continue
            for b2 in range(max_val+1):

                        found.add((a1, a2, b1, b2, s_a6))
                        print(f"a1={a1}, a2={a2}, b1={b1}, b2={b2}, N={s_a6}")
