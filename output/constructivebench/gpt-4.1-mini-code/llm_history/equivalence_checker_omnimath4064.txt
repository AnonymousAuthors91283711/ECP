Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: fun p => {(p, p * 2, p * 2), (p * 2, p, p * 2), (p * 2, p * 2, p)}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer provides specific triples (p, 2p, 2p) and its permutations as solutions, which indeed satisfy the given conditions:
1. All components are positive
2. The sum condition holds since p + 2p + 2p = 5p < 2p*√p for p ≥ 3 (as √p > 2.5 for p ≥ 7)
3. The reciprocal condition holds since 1/p + 1/(2p) + 1/(2p) = 1/p

However, the proposed answer is incomplete because:
1. It doesn't cover all possible solutions (there might be other triples satisfying the conditions)
2. The ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (undefined), so we can't verify completeness
3. The inequality might not hold for small primes (p=2 gives 10 < 4√2 ≈ 5.66, which is false)

Thus, while the proposed answer contains correct solutions, it's not proven to be exhaustive.
