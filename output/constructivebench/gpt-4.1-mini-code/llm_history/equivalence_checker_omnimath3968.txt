theorem omnimath3968 :
  {(x, p) : ℕ × ℕ | x > 0 ∧ p > 0 ∧ p.Prime ∧ x ≤ 2 * p ∧ (x ^ (p - 1) ∣ (p - 1) ^ x + 1)} = omnimath3968_answer :=

Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {(x, p) : ℕ × ℕ | (x = 1 ∨ x = p) ∧ p.Prime}
<<<None>>>
Since the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's not provided), we cannot determine whether the proposed answer is equivalent to the correct solution. The proposed answer suggests that the solution set consists of pairs (x,p) where x is either 1 or p, and p is prime, but without knowing the actual solution, we can't verify its correctness.
