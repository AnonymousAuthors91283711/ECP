The problem involves finding the minimal number \( m \) such that for any family \( D \) of boolean matrices (functions from \( k \) to \( 2 \)), if \( m \le |D| \), there exists a \( k \times k \) boolean matrix \( M \) whose every row and every column function lies in \( D \).

To explore this for small \( k \), we enumerate subsets \( D \subseteq \{0,1\}^k \) with increasing size \( m \), then attempt to construct such an \( M \). Since \( k \times k \) matrices \( M \) are selections of \( k^2 \) boolean entries, and rows and columns must come from \( D \), the problem is nontrivial combinatorially.

We enumerate possible candidate \( D \) for small \( k=2,3 \), print \( m \) and whether the condition is satisfiable (exists such \( M \)), and conjecture the minimal \( m \). We print candidates found and eventually print minimal \( m \) observed.

Since full check is complex, we restrict to small \( k \) and prune unsatisfiable candidates early.

```python
# Enumerate minimal m for which any D of size >= m guarantees existence of a kxk boolean matrix M
# with all row and column vectors in D.

from itertools import product, combinations

def bool_vectors(k):
    return list(product([0,1], repeat=k))

def rows_cols(M):
    # M is kxk matrix: rows and columns as tuples
    k = len(M)
    rows = [tuple(M[i][j] for j in range(k)) for i in range(k)]
    cols = [tuple(M[i][j] for i in range(k)) for j in range(k)]
    return rows, cols

def has_M(D, k):
    # Try to find M: kxk matrix with rows and columns in D
    D_set = set(D)
    # Because rows must be in D, rows are from D
    # We'll try all tuples of rows in D: choose k rows with repetition allowed
    # But repetition allowed or not? Problem states no restriction, so repetition allowed
    # So all k-tuples of D elements as rows
    # For each candidate rows, check if columns also in D
    # Because k and |D| small, try all k-tuples with repetition from D
    from itertools import product
