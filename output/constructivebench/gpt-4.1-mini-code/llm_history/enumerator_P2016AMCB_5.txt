The problem snippet involves modular arithmetic: it wants to find `(4 + 919) % 7`. To help conjecture or verify the result, we'll enumerate `(4 + n) % 7` for relevant values of `n`, such as `919`, and print the modular result directly. The modular reduction of sums can be verified by calculation modulo 7.

Here's a simple Python program that prints the modular arithmetic result `(4 + 919) mod 7` immediately.

```python
# Enumerate the modular sum (4 + 919) % 7 directly
def main():
    a = 4
    n = 919
    mod = 7
    result = (a + n) % mod
    print(f"(4 + 919) % 7 = {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
