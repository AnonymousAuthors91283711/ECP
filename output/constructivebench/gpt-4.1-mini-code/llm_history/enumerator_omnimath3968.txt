[write_program]
The problem asks to find pairs \((x, p)\) of positive integers such that \(p\) is prime, \(x \leq 2p\), and \(x^{p-1}\) divides \((p-1)^x + 1\). We will enumerate pairs \((x,p)\) with small primes \(p\) and \(x \leq 2p\), checking the divisibility condition exactly.

```python
from sympy import isprime

# Enumerate primes p up to a small limit for efficiency
for p in [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]:
    print(f"Checking prime p={p}")
    for x in range(1, 2*p+1):
        # Compute powers exactly
        lhs = x**(p-1)
        rhs = (p-1)**x + 1
        if rhs % lhs == 0:
            print(f"Found (x, p) = ({x}, {p}) divides since {lhs} | {rhs}")
```
This script enumerates pairs \((x,p)\) as required, printing results immediately without approximation. The primes and x-range are small to keep runtime and output manageable.
