The problem involves counting numbers b between 5 and 2024 inclusive such that a certain condition on digits holds modulo 16. The condition involves digits of b in base 2024 and a fold operation. To understand the problem and guess the answer, we'll enumerate b in this range, compute the condition, and count how many satisfy it. Then we'll check the sum of digits of this count, in base 10.

```python
def digits_base(n, base):
    # Get digits of n in given base, most significant first
    if n == 0:
        return [0]
    digits = []
    while n > 0:
        digits.append(n % base)
        n //=base
    return digits[::-1]

def foldl_condition(b, base=2024):
    ds = digits_base(b, base)
    acc = 0
    for d in ds:
        acc = (acc * b + d) % 16  # mod 16 to keep number small
    return acc == 0

def digit_sum(n):
    return sum(int(c) for c in str(n))

def main():
    count = 0
    print("Enumerating b in [5..2024] testing condition...")
    for b in range(5, 2025):
        if foldl_condition(b):
            count += 1
            print(f"Valid b: {b}, current count: {count}")
    print("Final count =", count)
    print("Sum of decimal digits of count =", digit_sum(count))

if __name__=="__main__":
    main()
```
