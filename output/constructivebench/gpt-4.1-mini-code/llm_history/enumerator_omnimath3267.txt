The problem involves a Fibonacci-like sequence \(F\) defined by:
- \(F(1) = 1\),
- \(F(2) = 1\),
- \(F(m) = F(m-1) + F(m-2)\) for \(m \geq 3\),

and a polynomial \(p\) of degree 1008 that satisfies \(p(2n+1) = F(2n+1)\) for \(n=0, 1, \ldots, 1008\).

We want to conjecture natural numbers \(a, b\) (likely relatively small) such that
\[
p(2019) = F(a) - F(b).
\]

Since \(p\) agrees with \(F\) at 1009 odd integers \(1, 3, 5, \ldots, 2017\), the polynomial \(p\) is the unique polynomial of degree 1008 interpolating these points. Because \(2019 = 2 \cdot 1009 + 1\) just beyond the highest interpolation point, evaluating \(p(2019)\) can be done by Lagrange interpolation on the points \(\{(2n+1, F(2n+1))\}_{n=0}^{1008}\).

Our strategy:
- Compute Fibonacci numbers \(F(k)\) up to needed indices.
- Compute \(p(2019)\) by Lagrange interpolation on the 1009 points.
- Since direct exact polynomial interpolation with 1009 points may be heavy, reduce computations by trying smaller degrees first (to check pattern).
- For known Fibonacci identities, test values \(p(2019)\) and express as \(F(a)-F(b)\) for various \(a,b\).
- Print pairs \((a,b)\) and \(F(a)-F(b)\) where \(F(a)-F(b) = p(2019)\) numerically.

Because the problem is high complexity, we test small degree analogues to detect a pattern and conjecture the pair.
