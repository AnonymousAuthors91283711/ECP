The problem involves counting 5-element sets of subsets of a 6-element set, where the count of subsets containing each element is even. To explore this, we enumerate all 5-subset collections and check the parity conditions on element memberships.

```python
from itertools import combinations

# S is the set {0,...,5}
S = set(range(6))
all_subsets = []
for r in range(1, 7):
    all_subsets.extend(combinations(S, r))
all_subsets = list(map(frozenset, all_subsets))

# We'll consider all 5-element sets of subsets of S
# For each set s, check that for each element i âˆˆ S,
# the count of subsets containing i is even.

# Enumerate all 5-subsets of all nonempty subsets of S
count = 0
for s in combinations(all_subsets, 5):
    s_set = set(s)
    # For each element, count how many subsets contain it
    even_counts = True
    for i in S:
        c = sum(1 for subset in s_set if i in subset)
        if c % 2 != 0:
            even_counts = False
            break
    if even_counts:
        count += 1
        print(f"Found candidate set #{count}: {s_set}")

print("Total count satisfying condition:", count)
```
