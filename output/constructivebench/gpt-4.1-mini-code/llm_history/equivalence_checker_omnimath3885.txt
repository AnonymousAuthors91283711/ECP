Ground Truth Answer: { fun _ => 0, fun x => x + 1 }
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ c : ℤ, ∀ x : ℤ, f x = c * x}
Let's analyze the problem and answers:

1. The problem is about finding all integer functions f: ℤ → ℤ that satisfy the functional equation:
   f^(a² + b²)(a + b) = a*f(a) + b*f(b) for all integers a, b

2. Ground truth gives two specific solutions:
   - The zero function (f(x) = 0)
   - The successor function (f(x) = x + 1)

3. Proposed answer suggests all linear functions f(x) = c*x

Analysis:
- The zero function is included in both answers (c=0 case)
- The successor function is not linear (it's affine) and not captured by the proposed answer
- Testing the successor function: f^(n)(x) = x + n, and the equation becomes:
  (a + b) + (a² + b²) = a*(a + 1) + b*(b + 1) → a + b + a² + b² = a² + a + b² + b
  Which holds true, so it's a valid solution not captured by the proposed answer

Conclusion: The proposed answer is incomplete as it misses the successor function solution.
