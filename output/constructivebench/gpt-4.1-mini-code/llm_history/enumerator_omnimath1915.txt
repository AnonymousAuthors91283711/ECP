This problem asks about a complex number \( z \) with conditions on the distances \( |z - 1| = 2 \) and \( |z^2 - 1| = 6 \). We want to find the real part of \( z \).

To gain insight, we will:
- Enumerate candidate points \( z = x + yi \) with rational \( x, y \) near the circle \(|z - 1| = 2\).
- Check the second condition \(|z^2 - 1| = 6\).
- Print matching \( z \) and their real parts \(x\).

This helps us conjecture the exact \( \operatorname{Re}(z) \).

```python
import math

# Enumerate points (x,y) near circle |z-1|=2, x,y in rational steps
# Check |z^2 - 1| = 6 within small tolerance
tol = 1e-8
radius = 2
target_mod = 6

print("Enumerating candidates for z = x+iy:")
for ix in range(-10, 40):  # x in [-1,3.9] step=0.1
    x = ix * 0.1
    for iy in range(-30, 31):  # y in [-3,3]
        y = iy * 0.1
        # Check |z-1| = 2
        d1 = math.hypot(x - 1, y - 0)
        if abs(d1 - radius) < 1e-3:
            # Compute z^2 = (x+iy)^2
            zx2 = x * x - y * y
            zy2 = 2 * x * y
            # Check |z^2 -1| = 6
            d2 = math.hypot(zx2 - 1, zy2)
            if abs(d2 - target_mod) < 1e-3:
                print(f"z = {x:.3f} + {y:.3f}i  :  Re(z) = {x:.3f}")

# From enumerated values, exact Re(z) can be guessed as a simple rational.
```
This program enumerates candidates near circles with radius 2 centered at 1,0 and filters those whose squares satisfy the second condition approximately. The printed real parts help guess the exact answer.
