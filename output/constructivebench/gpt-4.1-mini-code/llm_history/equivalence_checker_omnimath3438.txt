Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: 125
Let's analyze the problem and proposed answer:

1. The problem shows a sum of five terms of "5 * 5" each: (5*5 + 5*5 + 5*5 + 5*5 + 5*5)
2. Each 5*5 equals 25
3. There are five such terms: 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25
4. The sum is 125

The proposed answer correctly calculates this sum as 125. Since the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's intentionally left blank in Lean), we can only evaluate the correctness of the proposed answer against the mathematical expression given.

The proposed answer of 125 is indeed correct for the given expression.
