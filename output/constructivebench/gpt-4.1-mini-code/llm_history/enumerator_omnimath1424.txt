The problem involves evaluating the expression:

8 * (9!) / 4 + 4 * (7!) / 2 + 4 * 6! + 4 * 4! + 3! + 2! + 2!

We will write a Python program to compute and print each term and the total sum, aiding understanding and verification.

```python
from math import factorial

def main():
    # Compute each term
    term1 = 8 * factorial(9) // (2 * 2)
    print(f"Term 1: 8 * (9!) / 4 = {term1}")

    term2 = 4 * factorial(7) // 2
    print(f"Term 2: 4 * (7!) / 2 = {term2}")

    term3 = 4 * factorial(6)
    print(f"Term 3: 4 * (6!) = {term3}")

    term4 = 4 * factorial(4)
    print(f"Term 4: 4 * (4!) = {term4}")

    term5 = factorial(3)
    print(f"Term 5: 3! = {term5}")

    term6 = factorial(2)
    print(f"Term 6: 2! = {term6}")

    term7 = factorial(2)
    print(f"Term 7: 2! = {term7}")

    total = term1 + term2 + term3 + term4 + term5 + term6 + term7
    print(f"Total sum = {total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
