[write_program]
This problem involves finding the least natural number \( n \) such that there exist natural numbers \( P, C \) satisfying:

\[
P - 2 = 3(C - 2), \quad P - 4 = 4(C - 4), \quad P + n = 2(C + n).
\]

We want to find all triples \((P,C,n)\) that satisfy these relations and determine the minimum \( n \).

The program will:
- Solve the first two equations to find possible \( (P, C) \).
- Then enumerate \( n \geq 0 \) and check when the third equation holds.
- Print any valid \( (P,C,n) \).
- Finally print the minimum \( n \).

```python
# Solve the system:
# P - 2 = 3(C - 2)  => P = 3C - 4
# P - 4 = 4(C - 4)  => P = 4C - 12
# Equate: 3C - 4 = 4C - 12 => C = 8
# Then P = 3*8 - 4 = 20
# So (P, C) = (20, 8) satisfy first two.

# Now find n with P + n = 2(C + n)
# => 20 + n = 2(8 + n) => 20 + n = 16 + 2n => 20 - 16 = 2n - n => 4 = n
# So n=4 works.

# Now let's write a program to confirm this and check if there are other solutions
# by enumerating n, P, C in a small range, printing all solutions, then reporting minimum n.

def main():
    print("Enumerating (P,C,n) with small values...")

    min_n = None
    for n in range(20):  # reasonable limit based on the problem scale
        # For each n, we try to find P,C satisfying:
        # P - 2 = 3(C - 2)
        # P - 4 = 4(C - 4)
        # (P + n) = 2(C + n)

        # From the first two:
        # P = 3C - 4 and P = 4C - 12 must be equal
        # So test all C in reasonable range:
        for C in range(1, 30):
            P1 = 3*C - 4
            P2 = 4*C - 12
            if P1 == P2:
                P = P1
                if P + n == 2*(C + n):
                    print(f"n={n}, P={P}, C={C}")
                    if min_n is None or n < min_n:
                        min_n = n
    if min_n is not None:
        print("Minimum n found:", min_n)
    else:
        print("No solutions found.")

    main()
