The problem gives a system of linear equations defining values \(a,b,c,d\), and asks about the value of \(a + 16b + 81c + 256d\) expressed as a reduced fraction \(\frac{m}{n}\), and the sum \(m+n\).

We can solve the linear system numerically, then find exact fractions, then check the coprimality and print \(m,n,m+n\). To find rational exact values, we'll solve the system symbolically, but since Python has no built-in symbolic solver, I will use numpy to solve for floating values, then convert to fractions.

We'll enumerate over fractions \(m/n\) near the computed value as a guess, but here direct solve and convert is best.

```python
from fractions import Fraction
import numpy as np
from math import gcd

# Coefficients matrices for system a,b,c,d
# Equations:
# a + b + c + d = 1
# a + 2b + 3c + 4d = 10
# a + 4b + 9c + 16d = 100
# a + 8b + 27c + 64d = 1000
A = np.array([
    [1,1,1,1],
    [1,2,3,4],
    [1,4,9,16],
    [1,8,27,64]
], dtype=float)

b = np.array([1,10,100,1000], dtype=float)

# Solve linear system
sol = np.linalg.solve(A,b)
a,b_,c,d = sol
print(f"Solution: a={a}, b={b_}, c={c}, d={d}")

# Compute target value: a + 16b + 81c + 256d
val = a + 16*b_ + 81*c + 256*d
print(f"Target value (approx.) = {val}")

# Convert to fraction with limited denominator for exactness discovery
f = Fraction(val).limit_denominator(10**6)
m, n = f.numerator, f.denominator

# Reduce fraction (should already be reduced)
g = gcd(m,n)
m //= g
n //= g

print(f"Fractional value = {m}/{n}")
print(f"Sum m+n = {m+n}")
```
This enumerates exact numerator, denominator candidates for the target and prints the final answer sum.
