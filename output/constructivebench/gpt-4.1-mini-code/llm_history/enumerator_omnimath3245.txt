The problem defines a sequence \(a_k\) with \(a_0 = \frac{5}{2}\) and recurrence \(a_k = (a_{k-1})^2 - 2\) for \(k \geq 1\), and asks for the infinite product \(\prod_{k=0}^\infty \left(1 - \frac{1}{a_k}\right)\).

We will explore this sequence numerically and symbolically where possible, printing terms and partial products to conjecture the infinite product. Specifically, we will:
- Generate terms \(a_k\) for \(k=0,1,\ldots,10\).
- Compute partial products \(\prod_{j=0}^k (1 - 1/a_j)\) for these terms.
- Use Python's `fractions.Fraction` for exact values and float approximations for larger values to avoid overflow.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Define initial term
a = [Fraction(5, 2)]  # a_0 = 5/2 exact

print("k\t a_k (exact) \t\t 1 - 1/a_k (approx) \t partial product (approx)")
partial_product = 1.0

for k in range(11):
    if k > 0:
        # Compute a_k = a_{k-1}^2 - 2 exactly
        a_k = a[k-1] * a[k-1] - 2
        a.append(a_k)

    # Compute 1 - 1/a_k as float for product approximation
    val = 1 - 1 / float(a[k])
    partial_product *= val

    print(f"{k}\t {a[k]} \t {val:.10f} \t {partial_product:.10f}")

print("\nConjecture: The infinite product converges to approximately {:.10f}".format(partial_product))
```
This will enumerate the terms and partial products, allowing conjecture on the limit.
