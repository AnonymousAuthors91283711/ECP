The problem is to find the least natural number \( n \) such that \(\frac{1}{2} < \frac{n}{9}\). This reduces to finding the smallest \( n \in \mathbb{N} \) with \( n > \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \), so the minimal \( n = 5 \).

To illustrate enumeration, I will enumerate values of \( n \) from 1 to 9, checking the inequality, and printing those fulfilling it, then explicitly print the minimal such \( n \).

```python
# Enumerate n in natural numbers 1 to 9
# Check 1/2 < n/9 <=> n/9 > 0.5 <=> n > 4.5
# Print all n satisfying this, then print minimal such n.

def main():
    print("Enumerating n where 1/2 < n/9")
    candidates = []
    for n in range(1, 10):
        # exact fractions used via integer comparisons to avoid float errors
        if n * 2 > 9:  # Cross multiply: n/9 > 1/2 => 2*n > 9*1
            print(f"n = {n} satisfies 1/2 < n/9")
            candidates.append(n)
    if candidates:
        print(f"Minimal n satisfying 1/2 < n/9 is {min(candidates)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
