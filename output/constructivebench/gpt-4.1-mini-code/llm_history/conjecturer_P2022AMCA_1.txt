theorem P2022AMCA_1 : 
  P2022AMCA_1_answer ∈ ({31/10, 49/15, 33/10, 109/33, 15/4} : Set ℚ) ∧
  (∀ q ∈ ({31/10, 49/15, 33/10, 15/4} : Set ℚ), q ≠ P2022AMCA_1_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating candidate answers (exact fractions):
Candidate: 31/10 = 3.100000
Candidate: 49/15 = 3.266667
Candidate: 33/10 = 3.300000
Candidate: 109/33 = 3.303030
Candidate: 15/4 = 3.750000

Excluded candidates (by theorem):
Excluded: 33/10 = 3.300000
Excluded: 49/15 = 3.266667
Excluded: 15/4 = 3.750000
Excluded: 31/10 = 3.100000

Answer candidate not excluded (possible solution):
Answer candidate: 109/33 = 3.303030. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
<<<109 / 33>>>
