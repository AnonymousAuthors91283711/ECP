The problem shows a sum of fractions with powers of 2 in numerator and denominator: 1/2 + 2/4 + 4/8 + 8/16. Simplify each term first: 1/2 + 2/4 + 4/8 + 8/16 = 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 2.0. Let me write a Python program to enumerate such sums for powers of two up to a small range to help conjecture the sum.

```python
# Enumerate sums of the form sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (2^k)/(2^{k+1}) = sum of 1/2 repeated n times = n/2

def main():
    max_n = 10
    for n in range(1, max_n+1):
        # Summing terms 2^k / 2^(k+1) = 1/2 each time
        s = 0
        for k in range(n):
            numerator = 2**k
            denominator = 2**(k+1)
            value = numerator / denominator
            s += value
            print(f"Term {k}: {numerator}/{denominator} = {value}")
        print(f"Sum of {n} terms: {s}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
