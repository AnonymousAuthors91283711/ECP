The problem asks for the maximum value of \((h+1)(v+1)\) subject to the linear Diophantine equation \(5h + 4v = 2007\) with nonnegative integers \(h,v\). We will enumerate possible pairs \((h,v)\) that satisfy the equation, then compute and print \((h+1)(v+1)\). Finally, we will identify and print the maximum such product.

```python
# Enumerate integer pairs (h,v) with h,v >= 0 such that 5h + 4v = 2007.
# For each pair, compute (h+1)*(v+1) and print values.
# Then print max of these values.

def main():
    total = 2007
    max_product = 0
    print(f"Enumerating solutions for 5h + 4v = {total}")
    for h in range(total // 5 + 1):
        remainder = total - 5 * h
        if remainder < 0:
            break
        if remainder % 4 == 0:
            v = remainder // 4
            product = (h + 1) * (v + 1)
            print(f"h={h}, v={v}, product={(h+1)*(v+1)}")
            if product > max_product:
                max_product = product
    print(f"Maximum product (h+1)(v+1) = {max_product}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
