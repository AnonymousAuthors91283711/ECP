The problem involves finding real numbers \( x \) such that:

\[
2^x + 2^{x^3} = 2 \cdot 2^{x^2}
\]

and

\[
2^x \neq 2^{x^2} \quad \text{or} \quad 2^{x^2} \neq 2^{x^3}
\]

We want to find all real \( x \) satisfying the equation but not all three exponents equal. The equation simplifies to:

\[
2^x + 2^{x^3} = 2^{x^2 + 1}
\]

I will enumerate values of \( x \) over some rational and integer values in a reasonable range, checking the equation with a tolerance to detect exact or near-exact solutions and print those solutions immediately.

```python
import math

# We try values in range -3 to 3 with small increments to detect interesting solutions
# Also check if the 'unequal' condition holds.

def close(a, b, tol=1e-12):
    return abs(a - b) < tol

def test_x(x):
    e_x = 2**x
    e_x2 = 2**(x**2)
    e_x3 = 2**(x**3)
    left = e_x + e_x3
    right = 2 * e_x2
    if close(left, right):
        unequal = (not close(e_x, e_x2)) or (not close(e_x2, e_x3))
        if unequal:
            print(f"x = {x:.6f}, 2^x={e_x:.6f}, 2^(x^2)={e_x2:.6f}, 2^(x^3)={e_x3:.6f}")

print("Enumerating candidates for x in [-3,3] with step 0.01:")
step = 0.01
x = -3.0
while x <= 3.0:
    test_x(x)
    x += step

# Check some specific rational values explicitly (from -5 to 5)
print("\nChecking integer values from -5 to 5 exactly:")
for xi in range(-5, 6):
    test_x(xi)
```

This script enumerates candidate values of \( x \) that satisfy the given equation approximately and meet the distinctness condition, printing them as soon as they are found. This helps conjecture the actual set of solutions.
