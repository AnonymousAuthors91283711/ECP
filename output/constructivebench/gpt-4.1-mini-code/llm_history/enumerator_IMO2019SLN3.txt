The problem involves exploring sets \( S \subseteq \mathbb{Z} \) closed under taking differences of powers of two and polynomial roots with coefficients in \( S \). We want to enumerate possible candidates for such \( S \) that include all \( 2^a - 2^b \) for positive integers \( a,b \) and are closed under root-taking of polynomials with coefficients in \( S \).

To get concrete insight, I will:
- Enumerate elements of the form \(2^a - 2^b\) for small \(a,b\).
- Then, consider small-degree polynomials with these elements as coefficients.
- Check which integers can be roots.
- Print all values found that belong to such a set \(S\).

This enumeration helps conjecture the structure of \(S\). Since the problem is complex, the code uses small ranges for \(a,b\) and polynomial degrees.

```python
# Enumerate 2^a - 2^b for small a,b > 0
# Then, for small polynomials with such coefficients, find integer roots.

def integer_roots(coeffs):
    # coeffs: list of integers from constant term to highest degree
    # Find integer roots of polynomial sum coeffs[i]*x^i
    # Using Rational Root Theorem candidate divisors of constant term
    from math import gcd, isqrt
    
    def divisors(n):
        n = abs(n)
        res = set()
        for i in range(1, isqrt(n)+1):
            if n % i == 0:
                res.add(i)
                res.add(n//i)
        return res

    if not coeffs:
        return []
    c = coeffs[0]
    if c == 0:
        # 0 is root, also check poly / x
        # but to keep simple limit here
        return [0]
    candidates = divisors(c) | set(-d for d in divisors(c))
    roots = []
    for r in candidates:
        val = 0
        for i, coeff in enumerate(coeffs):
            val += coeff * (r**i)
            # early break if abs(val) too large? skip for now
        if val == 0:
            roots.append(r)
    return roots

            val = 2**a - 2**b

            print(val)
