theorem P2010AIMEII_12 :
  IsLeast {p : ℕ | ∃ (a₁ b₁ a₂ b₂ : ℕ),
    a₁ + a₁ + b₁ = p ∧
    a₂ + a₂ + b₂ = p ∧
    a₁ > b₁ ∧ a₂ > b₂ ∧
    b₁ * b₂ = 8 * 7 ∧
    b₁ * Nat.sqrt (4 * a₁^2 - b₁^2) = b₂ * Nat.sqrt (4 * a₂^2 - b₂^2) ∧
    a₁ ≠ a₂ ∧ b₁ ≠ b₂} P2010AIMEII_12_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating solutions with b1*b2=56, b1!=b2:
No solutions found with given bounds.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<56>>> 

Explanation: Since b₁ * b₂ = 56, the minimal p = 2a + b that satisfies all conditions is at least 56. The problem constraints and symmetry suggest the minimal value is exactly 56.
