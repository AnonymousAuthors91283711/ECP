The problem concerns finding the greatest lower bound (infimum) of the set of real numbers \(z\) such that there exists an \(x\) with \(\cos x = 0\) and \(\cos(x+z) = \frac{1}{2}\). To explore this, we can enumerate pairs \((x,z)\) for some values of \(x\) with \(\cos x = 0\), then check candidate \(z\)'s satisfying \(\cos(x+z)=1/2\). 

Since \(\cos x = 0\) at \(x = \frac{\pi}{2} + k\pi\) for integers \(k\), we try various \(k\) values and find all \(z\) such that \(\cos(x+z)=1/2\). Using the known values where cosine is \(1/2\), we get possible \(z\), and we print them immediately. We will enumerate \(k\) around zero for a small range to find candidates and then output the infimum.

```python
import math

# Enumerate k values, x = pi/2 + k*pi where cos x = 0
# For each x, find all z with cos(x+z)=1/2, i.e. x+z = ±π/3 + 2π n for integers n
# So z = ±π/3 + 2π n - x = ±π/3 + 2π n - (π/2 + kπ)

pi = math.pi
candidate_z = []

print("Enumerating candidates z for various k and n:")

for k in range(-3,4):  # small range for k
    x = pi/2 + k*pi
    # cos(x+z) = 1/2 means x+z = ±π/3 + 2π n for all n in some small range
    for n in range(-3,4):
        for val in [pi/3, -pi/3]:
            z = val + 2*pi*n - x
            print(f"k={k}, n={n}, z={z:.6f}")
            candidate_z.append(z)

# Find infimum from collected candidates
inf_z = min(candidate_z)
print(f"Infimum of z candidates is approximately {inf_z:.6f}")
```
