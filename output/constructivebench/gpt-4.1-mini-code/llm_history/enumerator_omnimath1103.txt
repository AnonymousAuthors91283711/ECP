The problem asks to evaluate the sum over all permutations \(\sigma\) of the fourth power of the number of fixed points of \(\sigma\). That is,

\[
\sum_{\sigma \in S_{2013}} (\text{fix}(\sigma))^4,
\]

where \(\text{fix}(\sigma)\) is the number of fixed points of \(\sigma\).

This is a classical problem related to moments of the distribution of fixed points in permutations. The number of permutations with exactly \(k\) fixed points is \(\binom{2013}{k} D_{2013-k}\), where \(D_m\) is the number of derangements (permutations with no fixed points) of \(m\) elements.

Hence the sum can be written as
\[
\sum_{k=0}^{2013} k^4 \binom{2013}{k} D_{2013-k}.
\]

Computing this directly is expensive, but we can try smaller values of \(n\) to conjecture the general formula or values.

Below is a Python program that enumerates the sum for smaller \(n\), printing each candidate value \(\sum_{\sigma}(\text{fix}(\sigma))^4\) for \(n=1,2,3,4,5\) to help conjecture a closed form.

```python
from math import comb

# Compute derangements using the formula:
# D_0=1, D_1=0
# D_n = (n-1)*(D_{n-1} + D_{n-2})
def derangements(n):
    D = [1, 0]
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        D.append((i-1)*(D[i-1] + D[i-2]))
    return D[n]

# Enumerate sum_{sigma in S_n} (fixed_points(sigma))^4
# Sum = sum_{k=0}^n k^4 * C(n,k) * D_{n-k}
print("n,sum of fixed points^4")
for n in range(1, 11):  # small n to keep output small
    total = 0
    for k in range(n+1):
        total += (k**4) * comb(n, k) * derangements(n - k)
    print(f"{n},{total}")
```

This prints sums for permutations of size \(n = 1\) to \(10\), which can be used to conjecture the pattern for \(n=2013\).
