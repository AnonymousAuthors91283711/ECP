[write_program]
The problem references a set \( P2002AMCA_6\_answer \) defined as a subset of natural numbers, and asks to show it's infinite. Without the original problem statement, I'll write a program to enumerate some sets of natural numbers with a conjectured pattern, printing examples as soon as they appear, to assist in conjecturing its definition and infinitude.

I'll assume the set involves natural numbers satisfying certain "interesting" arithmetic properties that can be tested quickly, for example numbers that can be expressed as sums of two squares, or numbers in arithmetic progressions. The program enumerates small values and prints those meeting the property.

```python
# Enumerate natural numbers n and print those that satisfy a sample arithmetic property;
# here we choose numbers expressible as sum of two squares (this is for illustration).
# Adjust the property as needed to match the actual set definition to help conjecture the answer set.

def is_sum_of_two_squares(n):
    # Check if n = a^2 + b^2 for some a,b in N with a,b <= sqrt(n)
    from math import isqrt
    limit = isqrt(n)
    for a in range(limit + 1):
        b_squared = n - a*a
        if b_squared < 0:
            break
        b = int(b_squared**0.5)
        if b*b == b_squared:
            return True
    return False

def main():
    max_n = 100  # limit for enumeration for demonstration, can increase
    print("Enumerating numbers up to", max_n, "that are sums of two squares:")
    for n in range(max_n + 1):
        if is_sum_of_two_squares(n):
            print(n)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
