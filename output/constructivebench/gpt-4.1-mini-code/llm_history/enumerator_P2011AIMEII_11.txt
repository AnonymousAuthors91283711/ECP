The problem involves the sequence of determinants \( D(n) \) of tridiagonal \( n \times n \) matrices with diagonal entries 10 and off-diagonal entries 3. We want to explore the infinite series \(\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{8D(n+1)+1}\).

The program below:
- Enumerates \(D(n)\) for \(n=1..20\) using a recurrence for the determinant of the tridiagonal matrix.
- Prints the partial sums of \(\frac{1}{8D(n+1) + 1}\) as rational numbers to guess its convergence.
- Prints denominators and numerators of these partial sums to guide conjecture about the sum as a rational number.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def D(n):
    # Recurrence for determinant of tridiagonal matrix:
    # D(1) = 10, D(2) = 10*10 - 3*3 = 91,
    # D(n) = 10*D(n-1) - 9*D(n-2)
    if n == 1:
        return 10
    elif n == 2:
        return 91
    Dnm2, Dnm1 = 10, 91
    for _ in range(3, n + 1):
        Dn = 10 * Dnm1 - 9 * Dnm2
        Dnm2, Dnm1 = Dnm1, Dn
    return Dn

print("Enumerating partial sums of sum_{n=0}^N 1/(8*D(n+1)+1):")
partial_sum = Fraction(0,1)
for n in range(20):
    denom = 8 * D(n + 1) + 1
    term = Fraction(1, denom)
    partial_sum += term
    print(f"n={n}: term=1/{denom} = {term}, partial_sum = {partial_sum} â‰ˆ {float(partial_sum)}")

print("\nObserving numerators and denominators for pattern:")
for n in range(20):
    denom = 8 * D(n + 1) + 1
    term = Fraction(1, denom)
    # Just to be consistent with earlier added partial sums
    # Rebuild partial sums
partial_sum = Fraction(0,1)
for n in range(20):
    denom = 8 * D(n + 1) + 1
    partial_sum += Fraction(1, denom)
    print(f"Sum up to n={n}: numerator = {partial_sum.numerator}, denominator = {partial_sum.denominator}")
