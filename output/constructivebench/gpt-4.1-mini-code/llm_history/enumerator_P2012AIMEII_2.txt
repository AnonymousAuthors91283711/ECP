Let's enumerate real values \( r \) satisfying \( a_{15} = b_{11} \) where \(a_n = 27 r^{n-1}\) and \(b_n = 99 r^{n-1}\), i.e. \(27 r^{14} = 99 r^{10}\). Then calculate \(a_9 = 27 r^8\) for those \(r\). We sample rational exponents by solving explicitly and printing the exact fraction solutions of \(r\), then print the corresponding \(a_9\).

```python
# Enumerate exact solutions r for 27 r^14 = 99 r^10,
# that is, 27 r^4 = 99 => r^4 = 99/27 = 11/3,
# then r = ± (11/3)^{1/4}.
from fractions import Fraction
from math import isclose

def nth_root_exact(value, n):
    # Try to represent the nth root exactly as a fraction
    # (only for small integer roots)
    # Here, just return float for fraction's root since perfect root is unlikely
    return value ** (1 / n)

def main():
    val = Fraction(11,3)  # 99/27 simplified
    # Possible r: + and - fourth root of 11/3
    roots = []
    # r^4 = 11/3 => r = ±(11/3)^{1/4}
    r_pos = nth_root_exact(float(val),4)
    r_neg = -r_pos
    roots.append(r_pos)
    roots.append(r_neg)
    print(f"Possible r values from equation 27*r^14=99*r^10:")
    for r in roots:
        # Compute a_9 = 27 * r^{8}
        a9 = 27 * (r ** 8)
        # Ideally print exact fraction form, but fractional powers not exact.
        # We print float with 6-digit precision
        print(f"r = {r:.6f}, a_9 = 27*r^8 = {a9:.6f}")

if __name__=="__main__":
    main()
