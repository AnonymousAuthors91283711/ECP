The problem involves characterizing all values \( k \in \mathbb{R} \) such that the function 
\[ f(k, x) = \sin^6 x + \cos^6 x + k(\sin^4 x + \cos^4 x) \]
has a root in \( x \).

Our task is to find the set of all such \( k \).

We can proceed by expressing \( f \) in terms of \( t = \sin^2 x \in [0,1] \):
\[
\sin^6 x + \cos^6 x = t^{3} + (1 - t)^3 \\
\sin^4 x + \cos^4 x = t^2 + (1 - t)^2
\]

Define 
\[
g_k(t) := t^3 + (1 - t)^3 + k \left( t^2 + (1 - t)^2 \right), \quad t \in [0,1].
\]

We want to find the set of real \( k \) such that for some \( t \in [0,1] \), 
\[
g_k(t) = 0.
\]

Given this, the approach is to fix some rational values \( t \in [0,1] \), solve for \( k \) via 
\[
k = -\frac{t^3 + (1 - t)^3}{t^2 + (1 - t)^2},
\]
provided the denominator is nonzero.

By sampling many \( t \) values, we can enumerate possible \( k \) values. The set of such \( k \) is the range of this expression over \( t \in [0,1] \); it's a continuous range because the numerator and denominator are continuous in \( t \).

So the code will sample \( t \), print candidate \( k \) values found, and also determine and output the minimum and maximum \( k \) that can occur.

```python
# Enumerate values k such that f(k,x)=0 for some x,
# where f(k,x) = sin^6 x + cos^6 x + k (sin^4 x + cos^4 x).
# Using transformation t=sin^2 x, with t in [0,1]:
# f(k,x) = t^3 + (1 - t)^3 + k (t^2 + (1 - t)^2)
# solve for k = -(t^3 + (1 - t)^3)/(t^2 + (1 - t)^2).

def main():
    ts = [i/100 for i in range(0,101)]
    ks = []
    print("Enumerating candidate k values for t in [0,1]:")
    for t in ts:
        denom = t**2 + (1 - t)**2
        if denom == 0:
            continue
        num = t**3 + (1 - t)**3
        k = -num / denom
        print(f"t={t:.2f}, k={k:.6f}")
        ks.append(k)
    k_min = min(ks)
    k_max = max(ks)
    print(f"\nMinimum k: {k_min:.6f}")
    print(f"Maximum k: {k_max:.6f}")

    main()
