Ground Truth Answer: 982982
Proposed Answer: 491 * 2 * 100 * 1 + 491 * 2 * 10 * 6 + 491 * 2 * 1 * 7
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a 6-digit number (omnimath458_answer) that:
   - Can be expressed as 100100*A + 10010*B + 1001*C where A,B,C < 10
   - Is equal to 491 * (100*A + 10*B + C) * 2
   - 491 is prime
   - The 3-digit number (100*A + 10*B + C) is prime

2. Ground truth answer is 982982:
   - 982982 = 491 * 2002
   - 2002 is not prime (2002 = 2 × 7 × 11 × 13)
   - Wait, this contradicts the problem statement which requires (100*A + 10*B + C) to be prime

3. Proposed answer:
   - Calculates 491 * 2 * 100 * 1 + 491 * 2 * 10 * 6 + 491 * 2 * 1 * 7
   - = 98200 + 58920 + 6874 = 163994 ≠ 982982
   - Also doesn't satisfy the prime condition for (100*A + 10*B + C)

Both answers fail to satisfy all conditions:
- Ground truth fails the prime condition for the 3-digit number
- Proposed answer gives wrong numerical result and fails the prime condition

<<<False>>>
