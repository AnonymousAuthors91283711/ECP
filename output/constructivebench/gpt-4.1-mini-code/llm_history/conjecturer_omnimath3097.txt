abbrev omnimath3097_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3097 (a : ℝ) : 
    (3 * a - 7) / (a - 2) = 2 ↔ a = omnimath3097_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Checking a near 2 (to avoid division by zero):
a = 1, (3a - 7)/(a - 2) = 4.0
a = 1.5, (3a - 7)/(a - 2) = 5.0
a = 1.9, (3a - 7)/(a - 2) = 12.999999999999996
a = 1.99, (3a - 7)/(a - 2) = 102.99999999999993
a = 2.01, (3a - 7)/(a - 2) = -97.00000000000213
a = 2.1, (3a - 7)/(a - 2) = -6.999999999999987
a = 3, (3a - 7)/(a - 2) = 2.0
a = 4, (3a - 7)/(a - 2) = 2.5
Exact candidate a = 3, evaluates to 2.0
Conjecture: a = 3 solves the equation exactly.. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<3>>>
