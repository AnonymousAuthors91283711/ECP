The problem seems to involve finding natural numbers \( k \) such that \( 3 + 11k \) equals some elusive value "omnimath2942_answer". Since the answer is unknown, letâ€™s enumerate values of \( 3 + 11k \) for small natural numbers \( k \) and output the results to get a sense of possible values, which might help identify patterns or conjecture the true answer.

```python
# Enumerate values of 3 + 11*k for k in a small range.
# This helps understand the sequence and possible values it can take.

def main():
    print("Enumerating values of 3 + 11*k for k = 0 to 20:")
    for k in range(21):
        value = 3 + 11 * k
        print(f"k={k}, value={value}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
