The problem concerns 4-element sets of positive integers, maximizing the number of pairs whose sum divides the total sum of the set. We'll enumerate all 4-element subsets of small positive integers, compute the number of qualifying pairs, and print interesting sets and their count of such pairs. This helps conjecture the maximizing sets.

```python
from itertools import combinations

def divisors_count(A):
    s = sum(A)
    pairs = [(x,y) for i,x in enumerate(A) for y in A[i+1:] if x < y]
    count = sum(1 for x,y in pairs if s % (x+y) == 0)
    return count

max_n = 0
max_sets = []

# Try 4-element subsets from 1 to 20
nums = list(range(1,21))
for A in combinations(nums, 4):
    if min(A) <= 0:
        continue
    n = divisors_count(A)
    print(f"Set {A} has {n} such pairs")
    if n > max_n:
        max_n = n
        max_sets = [A]
    elif n == max_n:
        max_sets.append(A)

print(f"\nMaximum number of pairs dividing sum: {max_n}")
print("Sets achieving maximum:")
for s in max_sets:
    print(s)
```
