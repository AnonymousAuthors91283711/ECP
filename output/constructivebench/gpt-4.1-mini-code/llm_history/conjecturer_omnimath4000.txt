abbrev omnimath4000_answer : Set (ℝ → ℝ) := sorry
theorem omnimath4000 (f : ℝ → ℝ) : 
  (∀ x y, (x + y^2) * f (y * f x) = x * y * f (y^2 + f x)) ↔ f ∈ omnimath4000_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing constant functions f(x)=c for c in -2..2
Found function f(x) = 0, constant
Testing linear functions f(x)=a*x + b for a,b in -2..2
Found function f(x) = 0*x + 0
Found function f(x) = 1*x + 0
Testing f(x) = 0 function explicitly
Found f(x)=0
Testing f(x)=x
Found f(x)=x
Testing f(x)=-x. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ → ℝ)
<<<{f | ∀ x, f x = 0} ∪ {f | ∀ x, f x = x}>>>
