The problem involves counting certain permutations \( p \) on \( \{0, \ldots, n-1\} \) such that for every \( k \), \((k+1) \times (p(k)+1)\) is a perfect square. The question asks for the smallest \( n \) for which the number of such permutations is positive and divisible by 2010.

To assist in conjecturing the answer, I will write a Python program that for small values of \( n \):
- Enumerates permutations \( p \) of \( \{0, \ldots, n-1\} \).
- Checks if for all \( k \), \((k+1)(p(k)+1)\) is a perfect square.
- Counts such permutations and tests divisibility by 2010.
Because 2010 is quite large, I'll enumerate for \( n=1,2,\ldots,8 \), print counts and whether divisible by 2010, and identify the minimal \( n \) with positive count divisible by 2010.

```python
import math
from itertools import permutations

def is_square(x):
    r = int(math.isqrt(x))
    return r*r == x

def check_perm(p):
    n = len(p)
    for k in range(n):
        if not is_square((k+1)*(p[k]+1)):
            return False
    return True

def main():
    print("n count divisible_by_2010")
    found_answers = []
    for n in range(1, 9):
        count = 0
        elems = list(range(n))
        for perm in permutations(elems):
            if check_perm(perm):
                count += 1
                print(f"n={n} permutation={perm}")
        divisible = (count % 2010 == 0) and (count > 0)
        print(f"{n} {count} {divisible}")
        if divisible:
            found_answers.append((n,count))
    if found_answers:
        min_n = min(found_answers, key=lambda x: x[0])
        print(f"Minimal n with count divisible by 2010: {min_n[0]} count={min_n[1]}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
