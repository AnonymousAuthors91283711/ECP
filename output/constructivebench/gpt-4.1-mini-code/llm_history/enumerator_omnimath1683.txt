The problem is to count 3-element subsets of the 3x3 grid (Fin 3 × Fin 3), where no two points share the same row and are adjacent (difference in column 1), and no two points share the same column and are adjacent (difference in row 1).

We need to enumerate all 3-subsets of the 9 points, satisfying the adjacency conditions.

We will:
- Generate all 3-subsets of points from the 3×3 grid.
- For each subset, verify the conditions.
- Print each valid subset.

Given the combinatorial explosion is small (C(9,3)=84), this brute-force approach is feasible.

```python
from itertools import combinations

# Points in 3x3 grid: (row, col) with row, col in {0,1,2}
points = [(r,c) for r in range(3) for c in range(3)]

def adjacent(p, q):
    # Check adjacency in same row
    if p[0] == q[0] and abs(p[1]-q[1]) == 1:
        return True
    # Check adjacency in same column
    if p[1] == q[1] and abs(p[0]-q[0]) == 1:
        return True
    return False

count = 0
print("Enumerating 3-subsets with given adjacency restrictions:")
for subset in combinations(points, 3):
    # Check no two distinct points are adjacent as defined
    # Check pairwise
    valid = True
    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(i+1,3):
            if adjacent(subset[i], subset[j]):
                valid = False
                break
        if not valid:
            break
    if valid:
        count += 1
        print(f"Valid subset #{count}: {subset}")

print(f"Total valid subsets: {count}")
```
