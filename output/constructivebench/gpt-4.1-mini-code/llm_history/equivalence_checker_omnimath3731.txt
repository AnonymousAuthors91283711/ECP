Ground Truth Answer: fun y => (y + Real.sqrt (y^2 - 4)) / 2
Proposed Answer: fun y : ℤ => (y + Real.sqrt (y ^ 2 - 4)) / 2
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer matches exactly with the ground truth answer. Both define the same function that takes an integer y and returns (y + Real.sqrt (y^2 - 4)) / 2. The type annotation `: ℤ` in the proposed answer is just an explicit type specification that doesn't change the mathematical meaning of the function.
