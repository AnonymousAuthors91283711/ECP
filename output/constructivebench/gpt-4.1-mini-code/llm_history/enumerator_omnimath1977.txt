The problem asks to find the value of \( 4^{3x+2} \) given \( 2^x = 3 \) (rewritten from \( \text{Real.rpow } 2 x = 3 \)) for real \( x \). This can be solved algebraically, but to assist in conjecturing the answer, I'll enumerate values of \( x \) near the solution \( x = \log_2(3) \), compute \( 4^{3x+2} \), and print exact powers of 2 if possible. This lets us notice the pattern.

```python
import math

# Given 2^x = 3, so x = log2(3)
x_exact = math.log(3, 2)
print(f"x (exact) = log2(3) = {x_exact}")

# We want to find 4^(3x + 2)
# Note 4 = 2^2, so 4^(3x+2) = (2^2)^(3x+2) = 2^{2*(3x+2)} = 2^{6x +4}

# We know 2^x = 3, so 2^{6x} = (2^x)^6 = 3^6 = 729
# Thus 4^{3x+2} = 2^{6x + 4} = 2^{4} * 2^{6x} = 16 * 729 = 11664 exactly

# To enumerate and print some values for x near log2(3)
for i in range(10):
    x = math.log(3, 2) + (i - 5) * 0.01
    val = 4**(3*x + 2)
    print(f"x = {x:.5f}, 4^(3x+2) = {val:.5f}")

print("Exact value of 4^(3x+2) given 2^x=3 is 11664 = 16 * 729 = 16 * 3^6")
```
