The problem concerns counting the number of divisors \( d \) of \( 20^4 \cdot 11^T \) that are perfect cubes. To assist, I'll enumerate such divisors for small \( T \), including \( T=5 \) as given, and print the count.

Key points:
- Factor \(20^4 = (2^2 \cdot 5)^4 = 2^8 \cdot 5^4\).
- Any divisor is \(2^a 5^b 11^c\) with exponents within the divisor limits.
- For divisor \(d = m^3\) to be a perfect cube, each exponent of prime factors in \(d\) must be divisible by 3.
- So we count triples \((a,b,c)\) with \(0 \le a \le 8\), \(0 \le b \le 4\), \(0 \le c \le T\), each divisible by 3.

The program enumerates these for \(T=1\) to \(6\) and prints results, including \(T=5\).

```python
# Enumerate count of perfect cube divisors of 20^4 * 11^T for T=1..6

def count_cube_divisors(T):
    # 20^4 = 2^8 * 5^4
    max_a, max_b, max_c = 8, 4, T
    count = 0
    # a,b,c exponents divisible by 3 within limits
    for a in range(0, max_a+1, 3):
        for b in range(0, max_b+1, 3):
            for c in range(0, max_c+1, 3):
                count += 1
    return count

for T in range(1, 7):
    ans = count_cube_divisors(T)
    print(f"T={T}, cube divisors count = {ans}")

# Explicit output for T=5 (problem condition)
T = 5
ans = count_cube_divisors(T)
print(f"Answer for T=5: {ans}")
```
