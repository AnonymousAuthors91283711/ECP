The problem involves enumerating the count of integers \( k \in [1,2014] \) for which \( f(k) \equiv 1 \pmod{10} \), where \( f(k) = \binom{k+4}{4} - \binom{k+3}{3} \) (with the second term zeroed out for \( k<2 \)). The binomial coefficients suggest combinatorial expressions, but here brute force enumeration is feasible and exact modulo 10 checking suffices.

The program below:
- Implements the function \( f \) with the piecewise definition,
- Iterates over the range 1 to 2014,
- Prints each \( k \) for which \( f(k) \% 10 = 1 \) immediately,
- Counts how many such \( k \) exist,
- Finally prints the total count as the answer.

This will help conjecture the exact number and pattern before formal proof.

```python
from math import comb

def f(n):
    # Compute f(n) = C(n+4,4) - C(n+3,3) if n >= 2 else C(n+4,4)
    c1 = comb(n+4, 4)
    c2 = comb(n+3, 3) if n >= 2 else 0
    return c1 - c2

def main():
    count = 0
    for k in range(1, 2015):
        val = f(k)
        if val % 10 == 1:
            print(k)
            count += 1
    print("Count:", count)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
