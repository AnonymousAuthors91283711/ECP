open Polynomial

abbrev omnimath1239_answer : ℤ := sorry
theorem omnimath1239 (a b c : ℤ) :
    gcd (X^2 + C a * X + C b) (X^2 + C b * X + C c) = X + C 1 ∧
    lcm (X^2 + C a * X + C b) (X^2 + C b * X + C c) = X^3 - C 4 * X^2 + X + C 6
    ↔ a + b + c = omnimath1239_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating triples (a,b,c) with conditions on polynomial gcd and lcm:. Expected Answer Type: ℤ
