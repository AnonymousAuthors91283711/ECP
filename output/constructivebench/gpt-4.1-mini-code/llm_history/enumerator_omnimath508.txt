The problem asks to find the smallest positive integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 + x + 41 \) is not prime. This is related to Euler's prime-generating polynomial \( n^2 + n + 41 \), which produces primes for \( n = 0 \) to 39. We want to find the first \( x > 0 \) for which the value is composite.

The following Python code will check values \( x = 1, 2, \ldots \) and print each composite number found (along with \( x \)), stopping after finding some candidates up to a reasonable range.

```python
import math

def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    # test divisors up to sqrt(n)
    r = int(math.isqrt(n))
    for i in range(5, r + 1, 6):
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
    return True

def main():
    print("Checking for smallest x > 0 with x^2 + x + 41 composite:")
    for x in range(1, 100):
        val = x * x + x + 41
        if not is_prime(val):
            print(f"x = {x}, value = {val} is NOT prime.")
            # stop after printing the first found composite
            break
        else:
            print(f"x = {x}, value = {val} is prime.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
