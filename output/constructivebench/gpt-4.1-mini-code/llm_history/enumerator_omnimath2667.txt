The problem involves solving the equation (2 + x + 10) / 3 = x for x in real numbers. Our program will enumerate values of x and check this condition numerically to conjecture the solution.

```python
# Enumerate candidate solutions for (2 + x + 10) / 3 = x
# Rearranged: (12 + x)/3 = x  =>  12 + x = 3x  => 12 = 2x  => x = 6
# We'll numerically verify near x=6 and print exact root found by algebra as well.

def check_eq(x):
    return (2 + x + 10) / 3 == x

def main():
    print("Enumerating candidate x values in [0, 10] with step 0.5:")
    for i in range(21):
        x = i * 0.5
        lhs = (2 + x + 10) / 3
        if abs(lhs - x) < 1e-9:
            print(f"x = {x} satisfies (2 + x + 10)/3 = x exactly.")
        else:
            print(f"x = {x}: lhs = {lhs}, lhs - x = {lhs - x}")

    print("\nAlgebraically, solving (2 + x + 10)/3 = x:")
    # 12 + x = 3x -> 12 = 2x -> x=6
    x_exact = 6
    lhs_exact = (2 + x_exact + 10) / 3
    print(f"x = {x_exact} is the exact solution with lhs = {lhs_exact}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
