The problem involves finding 2002 distinct positive integers \(k_i\) such that for every integer \(n \geq 2001\), there exists some \(i\) with \(k_i \cdot 2^n + 1\) prime. This is a hard number theory problem involving primes in special sequences.

To assist with conjecturing, we can try small values of the number of integers (say from 1 to 10), enumerate sets of distinct positive integers \(k_i\) (small integers to keep computations feasible), and test primality of \(k_i \cdot 2^n + 1\) for some \(n \geq n_0\). Since computing primality for very large \(n\) is difficult, and 2^n grows fast, we can fix a small \(n_0\) (e.g., 1 or 2) and test primality at these points as a proxy for the behavior.

We try to find sets of \(k_i\) such that for all \(n\geq n_0\) from some range (e.g. \(n_0, n_0+1, \ldots, n_0+5\)), there is at least one \(i\) with \(k_i \cdot 2^n + 1\) prime.

**Plan:**
- Fix a small \(n_0\) (e.g. 1 or 2 or 3)
- For \(m = 1 \text{ to } 6\) (number of \(k_i\)'s)
- Enumerate tuples of length \(m\) with distinct positive integers \(k_i\) from 1 to 10
- For each tuple, check the condition for \(n = n_0, n_0+1, ..., n_0+5\)
- Print candidates that satisfy the condition

This will not prove the full statement but can help conjecture the number of \(k_i\)'s needed and the nature of the \(k_i\).

```python
import itertools
from sympy import isprime

def check_condition(ks, n_start=1, n_end=6):
    # For each n in [n_start, n_end], check if exists k in ks so that k*2^n + 1 is prime
    for n in range(n_start, n_end + 1):
        if not any(isprime(k * (2 ** n) + 1) for k in ks):
            return False
    return True

def main():
    print("Testing sets of distinct positive integers ks with size m, checking primality of k*2^n+1 for n in [3..8]")
    n_start = 3
    n_end = 8
    max_k = 10
    max_m = 6
    for m in range(1, max_m + 1):
        # Enumerate sorted tuples to avoid duplicates
        for ks in itertools.combinations(range(1, max_k + 1), m):
            if check_condition(ks, n_start, n_end):
                print(f"m={m}, ks={ks} satisfy condition for n in [{n_start}..{n_end}]")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
