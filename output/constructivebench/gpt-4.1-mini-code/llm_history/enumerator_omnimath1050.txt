The problem involves finding the remainder polynomial when dividing \( P \) by \( (X-1)(X-2)(X-3) = X^3 - 6X^2 + 11X - 6 \), given values of \( P \) at 1, 2, and 3. Since the divisor is cubic, the remainder is at most quadratic. We want to find the unique polynomial \( R(x) = a x^2 + b x + c \) satisfying:
\[
R(1) = P(1) = -4, \quad R(2) = P(2) = -1, \quad R(3) = P(3) = 4.
\]

Enumerate all quadratic polynomials with these constraints by solving the linear system, then print the remainder polynomial \( R \).

```python
# Solve for remainder polynomial R(x) = a x^2 + b x + c,
# with R(1) = -4, R(2) = -1, R(3) = 4.

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

x = symbols('x')
a, b, c = symbols('a b c')

# Setup equations
eq1 = Eq(a*1**2 + b*1 + c, -4)
eq2 = Eq(a*2**2 + b*2 + c, -1)
eq3 = Eq(a*3**2 + b*3 + c, 4)

# Solve the linear system
sol = solve([eq1, eq2, eq3], (a, b, c))

# Print the resulting polynomial
a_val, b_val, c_val = sol[a], sol[b], sol[c]
print(f'Remainder polynomial: R(x) = {a_val}*x^2 + {b_val}*x + {c_val}')
```
