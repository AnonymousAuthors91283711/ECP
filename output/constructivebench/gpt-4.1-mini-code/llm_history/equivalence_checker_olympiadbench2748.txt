Ground Truth Answer: 2028
Proposed Answer: 52^2 - 13 * 52
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n > 2023 such that the quadratic equation x² - 13x - n = 0 has integer solutions.

2. The ground truth answer is 2028.

3. The proposed answer is 52² - 13*52 = 2704 - 676 = 2028.

4. Both answers evaluate to the same number (2028).

5. The proposed answer actually shows the calculation that results in the ground truth answer, demonstrating that when x=52, the equation yields n=2028.

Since both answers represent the same value and the proposed answer correctly shows the calculation that leads to the ground truth answer, they are equivalent.
