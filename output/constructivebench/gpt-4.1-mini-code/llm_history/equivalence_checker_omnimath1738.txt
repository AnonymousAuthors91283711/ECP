Ground Truth Answer: fun f => ∃ a b, ∀ x, (5 ∣ x → f x = a * x / 5) ∧ (¬5 ∣ x → f x = b * x)
Proposed Answer: λ f => ∃ a : ℤ, ∀ n : ℤ, f n = a * n
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

The ground truth answer specifies that:
1. There are two different linear behaviors depending on whether the input is divisible by 5
2. When divisible by 5, f(x) = (a*x)/5
3. When not divisible by 5, f(x) = b*x

The proposed answer suggests a single linear behavior f(n) = a*n for all integers n, which is much simpler and doesn't account for the different cases based on divisibility by 5.

The ground truth answer allows for two different slopes (a/5 and b), while the proposed answer only allows one slope (a). These are not equivalent because:
1. The proposed answer is a strict subset of the ground truth answer (when a/5 = b)
2. The ground truth allows for more general solutions where a/5 ≠ b
