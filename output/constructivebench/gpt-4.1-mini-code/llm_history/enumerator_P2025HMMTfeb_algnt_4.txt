This problem involves summing the floor of 2025 divided by (j + 0.5) for integers j between -1000 and 1000. We need to consider the values carefully to avoid division by zero and handle the floor function properly. We will enumerate terms for j in that range, excluding any term that causes division by zero, print partial sums incrementally, and output the final sum.

```python
# Enumerate sum of floor(2025/(j+0.5)) for j in [-1000..1000], skipping j = -0.5 (which is not an integer, so safe)
# Print each term and running total

def floor_division(numer, denom):
    return int(numer // denom)  # floor division in Python

def main():
    numer = 2025
    lower, upper = -1000, 1000
    total = 0
    for j in range(lower, upper+1):
        denom = j + 0.5
        # denom is never zero here since j is integer, so denom cannot be 0.5 * integer
        val = int(numer // denom)
        total += val
        print(f"j={j}, floor(2025/{j}+0.5)={val}, partial sum={total}")

    print(f"Final sum: {total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
