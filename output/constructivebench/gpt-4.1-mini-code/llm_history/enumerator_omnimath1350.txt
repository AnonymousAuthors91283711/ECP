The problem involves the polynomial \( z^4 + 2z^3 + 2 = 0 \) and its four distinct roots \( \alpha(0), \alpha(1), \alpha(2), \alpha(3) \). We want to enumerate possible values of the set containing three sums of products of roots taken in pairs, as specified.

We can:
- Find approximate roots numerically.
- Compute sums \(\alpha_0\alpha_1 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\), etc.
- Print these complex sums immediately.
- Identify any patterns or exact values guessed from numeric results.

We'll use numpy to find roots numerically, then print the three desired sums for the roots ordered as found.

```python
# Enumerate sum of products of roots of z^4 + 2z^3 + 2=0
# Roots: α0,..α3 distinct complex roots
# Compute: α0*α1 + α2*α3, α0*α2 + α1*α3, α0*α3 + α1*α2

import numpy as np

def main():
    # Coefficients of polynomial z^4 + 2 z^3 + 0 z^2 + 0 z + 2
    coeffs = [1, 2, 0, 0, 2]
    roots = np.roots(coeffs)  # Complex roots
    
    # Ensure roots are sorted for consistency (by real part, then imag)
    roots = sorted(roots, key=lambda z: (z.real, z.imag))
    
    α = roots
    # Calculate the three sums of products
    sums = [
        α[0]*α[1] + α[2]*α[3],
        α[0]*α[2] + α[1]*α[3],
        α[0]*α[3] + α[1]*α[2]
    ]
    
    # Print each sum immediately with real and imag parts rounded
    for i, val in enumerate(sums):
        r, im = val.real, val.imag
        print(f"Sum {i+1}: {r:.6f} + {im:.6f}i")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
