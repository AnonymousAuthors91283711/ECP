The problem counts functions \(f : \{0, \ldots, 11\} \to \{0,1\}\) such that exactly 4 values are 1, and no two consecutive indices both map to 1. We enumerate all subsets of size 4 without consecutive elements from 12 points.

```python
from itertools import combinations

# We consider all 4-element subsets of {0,...,11} with no consecutive elements
n = 12
k = 4

def no_consec(subset):
    # Sorted subset, check no consecutive elements
    return all(b - a > 1 for a, b in zip(subset, subset[1:]))

count = 0
print(f"Enumerating subsets of size {k} from {n} elements with no two consecutive:")
for comb in combinations(range(n), k):
    if no_consec(comb):
        count += 1
        print(comb)

print("Total count:", count)
```
