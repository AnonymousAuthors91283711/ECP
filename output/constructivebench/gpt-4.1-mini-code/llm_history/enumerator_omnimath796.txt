[write_program]
The problem asks for the number of real solutions to the equation involving nested absolute values:
| | | |x - 2| - 2| - 2| = | | | |x - 3| - 3| - 3|

We can write a Python program to enumerate real values x for which the equality holds, focusing on integers or rational points around the "kink" points where absolute values change behavior (these are sums of ± the key constants 2 and 3).

Since the equation involves nested absolute values, it is piecewise linear with breakpoints at shifts of ±2 and ±3 repeatedly applied.

We generate candidate breakpoints, then iteratively test intervals between these points (since the function is linear there), solve equations on each interval, and count roots.

The program prints each solution found (exact rational values when possible) immediately, then reports the total count.

```python
# Enumerate solutions to:
# | | | |x - 2| - 2| - 2| = | | | |x - 3| - 3| - 3|
# We treat the function f(x) = abs(abs(abs(abs(x - a) - a) - a) - a) for a=2 or 3
# The "breakpoints" (points with changes) are at shifts by ±a at each nesting, so their combinations are finite.
# We check intervals between sorted breakpoints, where each side is linear, solve for equality in each.

def abs_nested(x, a, depth=4):
    # apply nested abs depth times with inner constant a
    val = x
    for _ in range(depth):
        val = abs(val - a)
    # then subtract a depth times (note that the problem applies abs, then subtract a)
    # Actually as given, the expression is abs(abs(abs(abs(x - a) - a) - a) - a), not subtracting after abs.
    # The problem is | | | |x - a| - a| - a| for depth 4 repeated abs and subtract a inside abs chain.
    # From original:
    # abs(abs(abs(abs x - a) - a) - a)
    # So inside abs: abs(abs(abs x - a) - a) - a
    # It means the last subtraction by a is inside the last abs.
    # So formula is abs(abs(abs(abs x - a) - a) - a), i.e., four nested abs with intermediate minus a inside abs.
    # We implement exactly as the formula:
    val = abs(val - a)
    val = abs(val - a)
    val = abs(val - a)
    val = abs(val - a)
    return val

# Since the function is piecewise linear with breakpoints at shifts of a at each nesting,
# The breakpoints of the expression abs(abs(abs(abs(x - 2) - 2) - 2) - 2) are at:
# Each stage modifies the set of breakpoints by adding ±a shifts.
# Initial breakpoints at stage 0: {2} or {3}
# After one abs and subtract a, the breakpoints expand.
# Approximating, the breakpoints are at sums of ±2 multiplied by the nesting.
# We can generate candidate breakpoints for a=2 and a=3 by summing combinations of ± multiples.
