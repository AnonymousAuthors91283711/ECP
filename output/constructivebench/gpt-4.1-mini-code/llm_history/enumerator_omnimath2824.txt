The problem involves two lines: line1 with equation \( y = 2x + 6 \) and line2 with equation \( y = -4x + 6 \). Their x-intercepts are \( x_1 = -3 \) and \( x_2 = \frac{3}{2} \) respectively. The task is to find the absolute difference \( |x_1 - x_2| \).

To assist in conjecture, the program will calculate differences between x-intercepts for similar pairs of lines with different coefficients and intercepts, enumerating a few such cases. This helps see patterns about how the difference depends on the parameters.

```python
# Enumerate absolute differences between x-intercepts of two lines:
# line1: y = a1*x + b1, line2: y = a2*x + b2
# Only nonzero slopes, and b != 0 to ensure x-intercept is finite and not zero division
# For sample a1, a2 in {-4, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 4}
# and b1, b2 in {3, 6, 9} (multiples of 3 for simplicity)

def x_intercept(a, b):
    # Solve a*x + b = 0 => x = -b/a
    if a == 0:
        return None
    return -b / a

a_values = [-4, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, 4]
b_values = [3, 6, 9]

print("Enumerating |x1 - x2| for line1: a1*x + b1=0 and line2: a2*x + b2=0 (x-intercepts):")
count = 0
max_print = 20  # limit output to avoid too long

for a1 in a_values:
    for a2 in a_values:
        if a2 == a1:
            continue  # skip identical slopes to avoid coincident or parallel lines with same intercept
        for b1 in b_values:
            for b2 in b_values:
                x1 = x_intercept(a1, b1)
                x2 = x_intercept(a2, b2)
                if x1 is None or x2 is None:
                    continue
                diff = abs(x1 - x2)
                print(f"a1={a1}, b1={b1}, a2={a2}, b2={b2} => |x1 - x2| = {diff}")
                count += 1
                if count >= max_print:
                    break
            if count >= max_print:
                break
        if count >= max_print:
            break
    if count >= max_print:
        break

# Now output the specific difference for the problem lines:
a1, b1 = 2, 6
a2, b2 = -4, 6
x1 = x_intercept(a1, b1)
x2 = x_intercept(a2, b2)
diff = abs(x1 - x2)
print(f"\nSpecific problem difference |x1 - x2| = |{-b1/a1} - {-b2/a2}| = {diff}")
```
