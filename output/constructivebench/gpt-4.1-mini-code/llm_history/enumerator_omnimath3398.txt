The problem asks to find the exact value of the expression \( \frac{1}{2 + \frac{2}{3}} \) as a rational number and verify that it equals the answer. We'll enumerate the values to find the exact rational number and print the result.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def enumerate_rationals():
    # Evaluate the expression exactly using fractions
    expr_value = Fraction(1, 2 + Fraction(2, 3))
    print(f"Expression value as fraction: {expr_value}")
    # Also print as float for reference
    print(f"Expression value as float: {float(expr_value)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    enumerate_rationals()
```
