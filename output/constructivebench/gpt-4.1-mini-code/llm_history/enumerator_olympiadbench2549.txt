Let's analyze the problem description in the code:

We have a function \( f(x) = x^2 - 2x \). We want to find all real \( x \) such that applying \( f \) three times gives 3, i.e.,

\[
f(f(f(x))) = 3.
\]

We want to enumerate all such \( x \) values. Since the problem is over the reals and involves compositions of quadratic functions, explicit symbolic solving is complicated, so we'll enumerate solutions by checking roots recursively.

Approach:
- Define \( f(x) = x^2 - 2x \).
- We seek \( x \) so that \( f(f(f(x))) = 3 \).
- Note that \( f(y) = 3 \implies y^2 - 2y -3 =0 \implies y = 1 \pm 2 = -1 \text{ or } 3 \).
- So \( f(f(x)) \in \{-1, 3\} \).
- For each target value at one step, solve quadratic equations to find preimages.
- Enumerate all preimages step by step (three iterations).
- To print exact solutions, express roots symbolically where possible, otherwise print approximate decimals.

We'll implement this for real solutions only. We'll output all solutions found (with partial immediate prints). Finally print the total count.

```python
# Enumerate all real x such that f(f(f(x)))=3 for f(x)=x^2-2x
import math

def f(x):
    return x*x - 2*x

def preimages(y):
    # Solve x^2 - 2x = y
    # x^2 -2x - y = 0
    d = 4 + 4*y  # discriminant: (-2)^2 - 4*1*(-y) = 4 + 4y
    if d < 0:
        return []
    sqrt_d = math.sqrt(d)
    return [(2 - sqrt_d)/2, (2 + sqrt_d)/2] if d>1e-14 else [(1.0,)]  # double root case

def eq_close(a,b,eps=1e-12):
    return abs(a-b)<eps

# We propagate sets of candidates backward from 3 up to original x

# Step 3: Solve f(z)=3 => z^2 - 2z - 3=0 => z=3 or -1
Z3 = [3.0, -1.0]
print("Step 3 targets f^3(x)=3, possible f^2(x) values:", Z3)

# Step 2: find all y with f(y) in Z3
Z2 = []
for val in Z3:
    pre = preimages(val)
    for p in pre:
        if isinstance(p, tuple):
            # double root
            Z2.append(p[0])
            print(f"f(f(x)) = {val}, double root solution: {p[0]:.6f}")
        else:
            Z2.append(p)
            print(f"f(f(x)) = {val}, solutions: {p:.6f}")
print(f"Step 2 possible f^2(x) values count: {len(Z2)}")

# Step 1: find all x with f(x) in Z2
X_candidates = []
for val in Z2:
    pre = preimages(val)
    for p in pre:
        if isinstance(p, tuple):
            X_candidates.append(p[0])
            print(f"f(x)={val}, double root x={p[0]:.6f}")
        else:
            X_candidates.append(p)
            print(f"f(x)={val}, solutions x={p:.6f}")

print(f"Step 1 total candidate x count: {len(X_candidates)}")

# Validate and print solutions with better formatting avoiding duplicates
unique = set()
print("\nAll solutions x such that f(f(f(x))) = 3:")
for x in X_candidates:
    # verify f(f(f(x))) approx 3:
    val = f(f(f(x)))
    if abs(val - 3) < 1e-9:
        # print with 12 decimals for uniqueness
        key = round(x,12)
        if key not in unique:
            unique.add(key)
            print(f"x = {x:.12f}, f(f(f(x))) = {val:.12f}")

print(f"\nTotal distinct solutions found: {len(unique)}")
```
This code carefully enumerates all candidate real \( x \) values solving \( f(f(f(x)))=3 \), printing intermediate targets and roots. It prints each solution as soon as verified, avoiding duplicates.

```bash
