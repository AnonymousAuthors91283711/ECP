This problem considers functions from a 6-element set to the set \( S = \{0, \tfrac{1}{2}, 1\} \). For each function \( f \), it compares the floor of the product of \( f(0), f(1), f(2) \) with the product \( f(3) \times f(4) \times f(5) \times f(3) \) (note that \( f(3) \) appears twice on the right side). We enumerate all such functions (there are \(3^6 = 729\)) and count how many satisfy the equality.

We print each satisfying function's tuple, and then print the probability ratio at the end.

```python
from fractions import Fraction
from math import floor

S = [Fraction(0), Fraction(1,2), Fraction(1)]
total = 3**6
count = 0

# Precompute all 6-tuples with elements in S
def product(vals):
    p = Fraction(1)
    for v in vals:
        p *= v
    return p

for a0 in S:
    for a1 in S:
        for a2 in S:
            left_val = floor(product([a0,a1,a2]))
            for a3 in S:
                for a4 in S:
                    for a5 in S:
                        right_val = a3 * a4 * a5 * a3  # f(3) twice
                        # Check if floor(left) == right_val exactly (rational)
                        if left_val == right_val:
                            count += 1
                            print(f"f = ({a0}, {a1}, {a2}, {a3}, {a4}, {a5}) satisfies floor(product(front three)) = product(back four)")
print(f"Favorable = {count}, Total = {total}, Ratio = {Fraction(count, total)}")
```
