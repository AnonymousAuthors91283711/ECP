The problem is to find the smallest number \( k \) such that there's a list \( l \) of positive integers with exactly one element repeated 10 times, no element repeated more than 10 times, and \( l \) contains \( k \) distinct elements.

The conditions:

- Exactly one number appears 10 times.
- No number appears more than 10 times.
- All elements are positive.
- \( k \) is the number of distinct elements in the list.

We want the minimal \( k \) such that such an \( l \) exists.

To explore this, I'll enumerate possible multisets satisfying conditions up to some size threshold, focusing on the distinctness count \( k \), and print candidates and their parameters.

```python
# Enumerate lists of positive integers with exactly one element repeated 10 times,
# all counts ≤ 10, and output possible distinct element counts k.

from collections import Counter
from itertools import combinations_with_replacement, product

def multiset_candidates(max_distinct=6):
    # We'll try k from 1 up to max_distinct and find lists l satisfying:
    # - Exactly one element appears 10 times
    # - No element appears more than 10 times
    # - All appear at least once
    # For fixed k, find all possible multisets counts with one count=10 and others ≤10

    # Since we want minimal k, start from k=1 upwards
    for k in range(1, max_distinct + 1):
        # For k distinct elements, counts is a tuple of length k
        # Exactly one count is 10, others in [1..10], no other 10s allowed
        # So one element count=10, others counts in [1..9]
        # Generate all such tuples
        others_ranges = [range(1,10) for _ in range(k-1)] if k>1 else []
        # Positions to put count=10
        for pos_10 in range(k):
            if k==1:
                # Only one element, count=10
                counts = (10,)
                yield counts
                continue
            # Other elements counts combinations
            for others_counts in product(*others_ranges):
                # Insert 10 at pos_10
                counts = others_counts[:pos_10] + (10,) + others_counts[pos_10:]
                # Check condition: exactly one 10, no other 10s - guaranteed by construction
                yield counts

def main():
    print("Finding minimal k with a list l where exactly one element repeated 10 times, others ≤10 and positive counts")
    found = False
    for k in range(1, 7):
        # Enumerate candidates:
        for counts in multiset_candidates(k):
            # Construct a representative list l for counts
            # Use distinct elements 1,...,k
            l = []
            for i, c in enumerate(counts, 1):
                l.extend([i]*c)
            # Check the uniqueness of 10 count
            count_counter = Counter(l)
            tens = sum(1 for v in count_counter.values() if v ==10)
            if tens != 1:
                continue
            # Check no count > 10
            if any(v>10 for v in count_counter.values()):
                continue
            # l.toFinset.card == k -- distinct count
            if len(count_counter) != k:
                continue
            print(f"k={k} -> counts={counts} -> list length={len(l)}")
            found = True
        if found:
            print(f"Minimal k candidate found at k={k}")
            break

if __name__=="__main__":
