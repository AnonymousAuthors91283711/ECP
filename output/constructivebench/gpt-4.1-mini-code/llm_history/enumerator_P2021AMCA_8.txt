[write_program]
The problem is about the sequence defined by:
D(0) = 0, D(1) = 0, D(2) = 1, and for n â‰¥ 0,
D(n+3) = D(n+2) + D(n).

We seek to explore (D 2021, D 2022, D 2023).

I'll write a Python program to compute values of D(n) for some n, confirming the recurrence, and printing the triple (D(n), D(n+1), D(n+2)) for small n, then jump to larger n values like 2021 to verify patterns or relationships.

```python
# Compute sequence D defined by:
# D(0)=0, D(1)=0, D(2)=1
# D(n+3) = D(n+2) + D(n)
# We'll print triples (D(n), D(n+1), D(n+2)) for sample n and then compute D(2021), D(2022), D(2023).

def D_seq(up_to):
    D = [0,0,1]
    for i in range(3, up_to+1):
        D.append(D[i-1] + D[i-3])
    return D

def main():
    # Print first few triples to understand pattern
    D = D_seq(20)
    print("n | D(n), D(n+1), D(n+2)")
    for n in range(10):
        print(n, D[n], D[n+1], D[n+2])
    print("---")
    # Compute large values
    max_n = 2023
    D_large = D_seq(max_n)
    # Print the triple asked for in the problem
    print(f"D(2021) = {D_large[2021]}")
    print(f"D(2022) = {D_large[2022]}")
    print(f"D(2023) = {D_large[2023]}")
    # Print the triple
    print(f"Answer triple: ({D_large[2021]}, {D_large[2022]}, {D_large[2023]})")

if __name__=="__main__":
    main()
```
This enumerates values efficiently, printing partial results and the triple for 2021-2023.
