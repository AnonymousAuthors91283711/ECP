The problem involves prime numbers \( p < 1000 \) such that there exists a complex number \( z \) satisfying the system:
\[
z^3 = (z^2 + 1)i, \quad i z^2 = (z + 1)^2,
\]
where \( i = \sqrt{-1} \).

We want to enumerate primes \( p < 1000 \) for which there exists a complex \( z \) with these conditions holding when interpreted modulo \( p \) or in some sense involving \( p \).

Since this is a high school competition setting and the conditions look algebraic in \( z \), the problem likely requires checking primes \( p \) with the existence of solutions \( z \in \mathbb{C} \) to the systemâ€”or more likely related to the structure mod \( p \).

Because the problem is abstract, we will locally:

- Enumerate primes \( p < 1000 \);
- For each prime, attempt to find \( z \in \mathbb{C} \) with the property. However, since \( z \in \mathbb{C} \), infinite values exist; but the problem likely concerns \( z \) in some finite field or more restrictive condition.
  
But to gain insights, we could test whether the given equations have complex solutions at all (they should), and then examine the minimal polynomial relationships to determine \( p \).

Another approach: from the equations, try finding \( z \) explicitly and gather hints on possible primes \( p \).

Since this is complicated, we focus on enumerating primes \( p < 1000 \) and checking numerically whether the system has complex solutions with properties that seem dependent on \( p \).

Below is a Python program enumerating the primes less than 1000, then for each prime tries approximate solutions for \( z \), verifying the two equations. Because exact symbolic solving is complex, we use numeric approximations to identify primes for which approximate solutions exist. Then, print the primes and eventually output the maximal prime found.

```python
# Enumerate primes below 1000 and attempt to find z in complex numbers satisfying
# the system:
# z^3 = (z^2 + 1)*i
# i*z^2 = (z + 1)^2
#
# Because the problem is abstract and assumes complex numbers, 
# we look for numerical solutions explicitly.
# However, since z exists in \mathbb{C} independent of p,
# the problem likely involves primes p meeting conditions derived from the equations,
# so here we just search for primes p < 1000 where possible integer or rational
# conditions might arise. We demonstrate an approach enumerating primes.
