. Expected Answer Type: ℚ → ℝ
Explanation:
The error arises because "Real.abs" is not defined in Lean's mathlib. Instead, the absolute value on real numbers is given by the notation |x| or by the function `abs` imported from the appropriate namespace (often `Real.abs` is not a constant in Lean, but `abs` or `real.abs` may be available). You can also use `abs` directly since it is in the core namespace.

Thus, to fix the error, simply replace `Real.abs x` with `abs x`. Since the domain is ℚ and the codomain ℝ, Lean will coerce ℚ to ℝ automatically for `abs` and for `log`.

This yields the closed-form solution that satisfies the functional equation:

f(x) = (log |x|)/2

This matches with the given orbits where sums of f at different points equal the log of absolute values, and pair sums split the log values evenly, indicating the factor 1/2.

Corrected Lean expression:

<<<fun x : ℚ => (log (abs x)) / 2>>>
