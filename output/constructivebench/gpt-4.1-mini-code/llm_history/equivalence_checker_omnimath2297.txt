Ground Truth Answer: {f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ (a : ℚ) (b : ℝ), f = fun x => (a : ℝ) * x + b}
Proposed Answer: {f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ a ∈ (algebraMap ℚ ℝ).range, ∃ b ∈ (algebraMap ℚ ℝ).range, f = fun x => a * x + b}
<<<True>>>

The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. Here's why:

1. The ground truth states that f is of the form f(x) = a*x + b where a is rational (a : ℚ) and b is real.

2. The proposed answer states that f is of the form f(x) = a*x + b where a and b are in the range of the algebraMap from ℚ to ℝ. 

3. The algebraMap ℚ ℝ is precisely the inclusion map of rational numbers into real numbers, so its range is exactly the set of real numbers that come from rational numbers.

4. Therefore, saying ∃ a ∈ (algebraMap ℚ ℝ).range is equivalent to saying ∃ (a : ℚ), and similarly for b (though b can be any real in the ground truth).

5. The only difference is that the ground truth allows b to be any real number, while the proposed answer restricts b to be rational. This makes the proposed answer more restrictive than the ground truth.

However, looking at the original problem statement, the condition requires f x - f y ∈ (algebraMap ℚ ℝ).range when x - y is rational. This actually forces the slope a to be rational (as in both answers) but allows the intercept b to be any real number (as in the ground truth). Therefore, the proposed answer is incorrect in restricting b to be rational.
