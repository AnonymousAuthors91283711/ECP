The problem involves characterizing all functions \( f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \) such that for all positive integers \( n \), the partial sums of \( f \) are perfect squares, and \( f(n) \) divides \( n^3 \).

To assist, I will enumerate candidate functions \( f \) for small \( n \), checking the divisibility condition and if the partial sums form perfect squares. We can explore functions defined for \( n \leq 10 \), considering \( f(n) \) divides \( n^3 \).

We'll print possible \( f(n) \) values step by step, the cumulative sums, and identify those that yield perfect squares. This will help conjecture the form of \( f \).

```python
import math

def is_square(x):
    return int(math.isqrt(x))**2 == x

# Enumerate functions f: [1..N] -> N where f(n) divides n^3,
# and partial sums are perfect squares for each prefix.
# We'll try all divisors of n^3 and check sums.

N = 7  # Keep small for brevity

# Precompute divisors of n^3 for n in [1..N]
def divisors(n):
    divs = set()
    for i in range(1, int(abs(n)**(1/3)) + 10):
        # i^3 close to n^3? Instead simply get divisors of n^3 by prime factoring n and cubing exponents.
        pass
    # Instead brute force divisors by checking all from 1 to n^3
    limit = n**3
    divs = [d for d in range(1, limit + 1) if limit % d == 0]
    return divs

# We will explore all functions f for n=1..N,
# tracking partial sums that are squares.

from itertools import product

# Gather divisors for each n
div_lists = [divisors(n) for n in range(1, N + 1)]

count = 0

def print_candidate(f):
    partial_sums = []
    acc = 0
    for val in f:
        acc += val
        partial_sums.append(acc)
    squares_ok = all(is_square(s) for s in partial_sums)
    if squares_ok:
        print(f"f = {f}, partial sums = {partial_sums}")

# Enumerate all candidate f values for n=1..N
# To limit output, stop after 20 candidates

limit_print = 20

for f_candidate in product(*div_lists):
    count +=1
    if count > 100000:  # avoid huge computation, break early
        break
    # Check partial sums are squares
    sums = []
    s = 0
    ok = True
    for val in f_candidate:
        s += val
        if not is_square(s):
            ok = False
            break
    if ok:
        print_candidate(f_candidate)
        limit_print -= 1
        if limit_print == 0:
            break
```
