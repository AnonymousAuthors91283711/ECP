[write_program]
The problem seems to involve evaluating the expression \(8 \times 6 - \frac{4}{2}\) in real numbers. We will write a program that computes this value exactly and prints it. Since the expression is straightforward, the program will just evaluate and print it.

```python
# Evaluate the expression 8 * 6 - 4 / 2 and print the exact value
def main():
    numerator = 4
    denominator = 2
    value = 8 * 6 - numerator / denominator
    print(f"Evaluated value: {value}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
