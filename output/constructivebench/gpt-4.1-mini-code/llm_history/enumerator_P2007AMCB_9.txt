[write_program]
The problem states a functional equation for a function \( f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) defined by:
\[
f(3x - 1) = x^2 + x + 1.
\]
We want to find the value \( f(5) \).

To find \( f(5) \), we need to find \( x \) such that \( 3x - 1 = 5 \), then compute \( f(5) = x^2 + x + 1 \).

I'll write a Python program that:
- Enumerates rational \( x \) values that satisfy \( 3x - 1 = 5 \) (which implies \( x = 2 \)).
- Prints the exact value of \( f(5) \).
- As a demonstration, the program will show that for general inputs where \( y = 3x - 1 \), \( f(y) = x^2 + x + 1 \).

This explicitly shows the steps and the computed exact value for \( f(5) \).

```python
# Program to find f(5) given f(3x - 1) = x^2 + x + 1

def find_f_of_y(y):
    # Solve 3x - 1 = y for x
    x = (y + 1) / 3
    # Compute f(y)
    return x**2 + x + 1

def main():
    # We want f(5)
    y = 5
    x = (y + 1) / 3
    print(f"Solving 3x - 1 = {y} gives x = {x}")
    f_y = find_f_of_y(y)
    print(f"f({y}) = x^2 + x + 1 = {x}^2 + {x} + 1 = {f_y}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
