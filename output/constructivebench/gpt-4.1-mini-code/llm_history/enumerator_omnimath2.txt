[write_program]
The problem concerns tournaments (directed complete graphs with no loops) on a finite set \( G \) of size \( n \ge 1 \), and a coloring of their edges so that no 3-cycle of vertices \( u,v,w \) with edges \( u \to v \) and \( v \to w \) has the same color on these two edges. The goal is to find the minimal possible number \( k \) of distinct colors used on the edges that appear in such a coloring.

To assist in conjecturing the minimal \( k \) for small values of \( n \), I will enumerate all possible small tournaments (with fixed \( n \)) and valid colorings, and track the minimal number of colors that satisfy the given condition.

However, since enumerating all tournaments becomes very large even for moderate \( n \), I'll test only very small \( n \in \{1, 2, 3, 4\} \), printing the parameters and minimal colorings found, enumerated up to some upper bound on the number of colors.

This program enumerates tournaments with 1 to 4 vertices, computes minimal edge colorings obeying the condition, and prints minimal colors found for some tournaments, conjecturing the minimal \( k \) for those \( n \).
