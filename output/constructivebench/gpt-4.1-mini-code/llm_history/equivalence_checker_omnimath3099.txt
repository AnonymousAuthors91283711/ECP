Ground Truth Answer: 13/27
Proposed Answer: (9 : ℚ) / (2 * 27) + (3 : ℚ) / (6 * 27)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step.

1. Problem Breakdown:
- faces = [2,3,4,5,6,7] (total dots = 2+3+4+5+6+7 = 27)
- oddFaces = [3,5,7]
- The probability calculation has two parts:
  a) Sum over odd faces of (n-1)*(1/27)
  b) Sum over odd faces of 1/(6*27)

2. Ground Truth:
- Direct calculation gives 13/27

3. Proposed Answer:
- (9/(2*27)) + (3/(6*27))
- Simplifies to (9/54) + (3/162) = (1/6) + (1/54) = 10/54 = 5/27

The proposed answer (5/27) doesn't match the ground truth (13/27). The calculation appears incorrect.

<<<False>>>
