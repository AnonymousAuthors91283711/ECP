Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: (555^(555^554)^554) % 1000
<<<None>>>
Since the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's not provided), we cannot definitively compare it with the proposed answer. The proposed answer attempts to express the solution in terms of exponentiation, but without knowing the actual ground truth or having more context about the function W's behavior, we cannot verify its correctness. The recursive definition of W in the problem statement suggests a more complex computation than simple exponentiation, making the proposed answer potentially incomplete or incorrect.
