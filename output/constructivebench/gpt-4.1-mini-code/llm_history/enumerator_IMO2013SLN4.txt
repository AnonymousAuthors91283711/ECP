The problem involves sequences \(a : \mathbb{N} \to \{1, \ldots, 9\}\) and the question whether beyond some index \(N\) the reversed digit number formed by the first \(k\) terms is a perfect square for each \(k > N\). We want to explore sequences that produce reversed digit numbers and test for perfect squares.

To gain insights, the program will:
- Try small sequences \(a : \{0,\dots,K-1\} \to \{1,\dots,9\}\) for small \(K\).
- Compute the reversed digit number formed by the first \(k\) terms as digits.
- Check if these numbers are perfect squares.
- Print sequences with the largest number of initial squares and the square numbers found.

This helps conjecture if such sequences exist.

```python
# Enumerate small sequences a: {0,...,K-1} -> {1,...,9}
# For each prefix length k, check if reversed digits form a perfect square.
# Print sequences with many initial prefixes producing square numbers.

from math import isqrt
from itertools import product

def is_square(n):
    r = isqrt(n)
    return r*r == n

def reversed_number(digits):
    return int("".join(map(str, reversed(digits))))

max_length = 7  # sequence length to test (keep small for feasibility)

print(f"Enumerating sequences a: [1..9]^{max_length}")
for seq in product(range(1,10), repeat=max_length):
    squares_found = 0
    for k in range(1, max_length+1):
        num = reversed_number(seq[:k])
        if is_square(num):
            print(f"Seq={seq[:k]} reversed={num} is square")
            squares_found += 1
        else:
            break
    if squares_found == max_length:
        print(f"Full length={max_length} sequence with all reversed prefixes squares: {seq}")
```
This prints partial results immediately and shows candidate sequences. It may help check if infinitely many such squares can appear consecutively in reversed digit sequences.
