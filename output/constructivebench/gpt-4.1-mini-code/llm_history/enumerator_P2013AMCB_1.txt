The problem seems to find a unique real number low such that the midpoint of low and high = low + 16 equals 3. The condition (high + low)/2 = 3 implies (low + (low+16))/2 = 3, which gives low + 8 =3, so low = -5.

However, per instructions, let's write a program enumerating possible low values around -5 and check the condition until the exact low satisfying the condition is found.

```python
print("Enumerating possible values of low and checking condition (low + low + 16)/2 = 3:")

# We check integer low values from -10 to 10 to find candidate
for low in range(-10, 11):
    high = low + 16
    midpoint = (low + high) / 2
    if midpoint == 3:
        print(f"Found candidate low = {low}, high = {high}, midpoint = {midpoint}")

print("From the candidates, low = -5 satisfies the condition uniquely.")
```
