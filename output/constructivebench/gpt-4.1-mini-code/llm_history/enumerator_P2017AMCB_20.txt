The problem involves evaluating the measure (volume) of the set of points (p.1, p.2) in the unit square (0,1)×(0,1) for which the floor of the base-2 logarithm of the first coordinate equals that of the second coordinate.

Because for x in (0,1), log₂(x) is negative, and floor(log₂(x)) takes integer values ... Let's enumerate the intervals where floor(log₂(x)) is constant, i.e., for each integer k < 0, numbers x such that 2^{k+1} ≤ x < 2^k. We can iterate over some negative integers k.

For each k, the set where floor(log₂(x)) = k corresponds to the interval [2^{k+1}, 2^k). The set of points (x,y) where floor(log₂(x))=floor(log₂(y))=k is the square [2^{k+1}, 2^k)×[2^{k+1}, 2^k).

Since these sets are disjoint for different k, the total volume is the sum over k of the measure of these squares, i.e., (length)^2 = (2^k - 2^{k+1})² = (2^k - 2^{k+1})² = (2^k(1 - 2))² = (2^k * (-1))² = (2^k)² = 2^{2k}.

However, 2^{k+1} ≤ x < 2^k, for k in negative integers.

Note: Because the interval is (0,1), k varies over negative integers k = -1, -2, -3, ...

Then total volume = sum_{k=-∞}^{-1} (2^k - 2^{k+1})² = sum_{k=-∞}^{-1} (2^k)^2 = sum_{k=-∞}^{-1} 2^{2k}

Sum_{k=-∞}^{-1} 2^{2k} = sum_{k=-∞}^{-1} 4^{k} = a geometric series with ratio 1/4.

Sum_{k=-∞}^{-1} 4^{k} = sum_{m=1}^∞ 4^{-m} = 1/3

We can verify this by programming.

Let's write a Python program enumerating k from -1 to -N (e.g., -20), print intervals and partial sums, and output the total measure.

```python
# Enumerate the set measure for points (x,y) in (0,1)^2 where floor(log2 x) = floor(log2 y)
# For each integer k < 0, floor(log2 x) = k corresponds to x ∈ [2^{k+1}, 2^k)
# The volume of such pairs is (length of interval)^2 = (2^k - 2^{k+1})^2 = 2^{2k}
# We sum over k from -1 down to negative infinity.

def main():
    total = 0.0
    print("k\tInterval\tInterval length\tSquare length\tPartial sum")
    for k in range(-1, -21, -1):  # k from -1 to -20
        left = 2**(k+1)
        right = 2**k
        length = right - left  # = 2^k - 2^{k+1} = 2^k (1 - 2) = -2^k (but length is positive)
        length = abs(length)
        square = length**2  # = 2^{2k}
        total += square
        print(f"{k}\t[{left:.6g},{right:.6g})\t{length:.6g}\t\t{square:.6g}\t{total:.6g}")

    print(f"Sum for k from -∞ to -1 converges to approximately {total:.6g}")
    # The exact sum is sum_{k=-∞}^{-1} 4^k = sum_{m=1}^∞ 4^{-m} = 1/3 ≈ 0.333333

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
