The problem involves natural numbers \( d, gd, x \) with constraints:

- \( d = 6 \)
- \( d + gd = 30 \)
- \( x \leq d \)
- \( gd = 6 \times x \)
- \( d + (gd - x) = \text{some answer} \)

The goal is to find the value of \( P2004AMCA_4_answer = d + (gd - x) \).

We will enumerate possible \( x \) values (from 0 to \( d=6 \)), compute \( gd = 6x \), check if \( d + gd = 30 \) holds, and if it does, print \( d + (gd - x) \). Since \( d \) is fixed, and \( gd = 6x \), the equation \( 6 + 6x = 30 \implies 6x = 24 \implies x=4 \) must hold exactly.

We will confirm this by enumeration.

```python
# Enumerate possible x, compute gd=6*x, check constraints, and output the value d+(gd - x)

d = 6
for x in range(d + 1):  # x in 0..6
    gd = 6 * x
    if d + gd == 30:  # check constraint
        answer = d + (gd - x)
        print(f"x={x}, gd={gd}, answer={answer}")
```
