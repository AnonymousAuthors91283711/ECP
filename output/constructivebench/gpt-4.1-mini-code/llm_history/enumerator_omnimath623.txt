We want to find all real numbers x such that:
\[ x^2 + \lfloor \frac{x}{2} \rfloor + \lfloor \frac{x}{3} \rfloor = 10. \]

Because the floor functions change values at multiples of 2 and 3, and floors are integers, a good strategy is to try integers and some values near the breakpoints to see which satisfy the equation exactly.

We'll:
- Enumerate integers x in some range (say -10 to 10, since \(x^2 \leq 10\) suggests limited size).
- Also check a few rational values near the boundaries.
- Print any x satisfying the equation exactly.
- Finally, print all such solutions found.

```python
import math

# Function to test if a candidate x satisfies the equation exactly
def test_x(x):
    # Compute left side
    lhs = x**2 + math.floor(x / 2) + math.floor(x / 3)
    # Check if lhs == 10 with an integer lhs
    return lhs == 10

print("Testing integer values x from -10 to 10:")
solutions = []

for x in range(-10, 11):
    if test_x(x):
        print(f"x = {x} is a solution.")
        solutions.append(x)

# To catch solutions not integers, try half-integers and thirds near breakpoints:
print("Testing half-integers and third-integers near breakpoints...")
candidates = []
# multiples of 0.5 near boundaries -10 to 10
for i in range(-20, 21):
    x = i / 2
    if test_x(x):
        print(f"x = {x} is a solution.")
        solutions.append(x)

# multiples of 1/3 near boundaries -10 to 10
for i in range(-30, 31):
    x = i / 3
    if test_x(x) and x not in solutions:
        print(f"x = {x} is a solution.")
        solutions.append(x)

solutions = sorted(set(solutions))

print("\nAll solutions found:")
for sol in solutions:
    print(sol)
```
