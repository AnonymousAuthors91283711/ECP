The problem involves a car trip scenario with parameters:
- t: time in hours
- v: velocity (mph)
- g: miles per gallon
- p: pay rate per mile
- c: cost per gallon

We want to evaluate the average profit per hour = (pay - expenses) / t.

To help conjecture and prove the answer, we'll iterate over small sample values for these parameters and print the results immediately.

```python
# Enumerate possible profit per hour for different sample parameters
def profit_per_hour(t, v, g, p, c):
    miles = t * v
    gallons = miles / g
    pay = miles * p
    expenses = gallons * c
    return (pay - expenses) / t

sample_ts = [1, 2, 3]
sample_vs = [30, 60, 90]
sample_gs = [20, 30, 40]
sample_ps = [0.5, 1.0]
sample_cs = [1, 2, 3]

print("t,v,g,p,c -> profit/hour")
for t in sample_ts:
    for v in sample_vs:
        for g in sample_gs:
            for p in sample_ps:
                for c in sample_cs:
                    ph = profit_per_hour(t, v, g, p, c)
                    # Print exact rational form whenever possible
                    # Here, just print float
                    print(f"{t},{v},{g},{p},{c} -> {ph:.4f}")
```
