The problem involves a sequence \(a_n\) which is arithmetic with difference \(d\) (possibly negative), and also satisfies a geometric-like condition on terms 2 and 6 with ratio \(r\). The question asks, for \(k > 0\), when there exists \(s \in \mathbb{Q}\) such that \(a_4 = a_1 s\) and \(a_k = a_4 s\). We are to identify all such \(k\).

We will test values of \(k\) in a reasonable range (e.g., 1 to 20) and enumerate which satisfy this condition, using symbolic but exact rational arithmetic where possible.

This involves simultaneous arithmetic and geometric conditions on indices. We'll generate sequences fitting the arithmetic and geometric hypotheses, then check the existence of rational \(s\).

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# We enumerate k > 0, test existence of s in Q such that
# given arithmetic sequence a_n = a_1 + (n-1)*d (d integer)
# and geometric-like condition: exists r in Q with a_2 = a_1 * r and a_6 = a_2 * r

# Since a_n arithmetic => a_n = a_1 + (n-1)*d
# a_2 = a_1 + d, a_6 = a_1 + 5d
# geometric condition: a_2 = a_1*r and a_6 = a_2*r => a_6 = a_1 * r^2

# So:
# a_1 + d = a_1 * r => r = (a_1 + d)/a_1
# a_1 + 5d = a_1 * r^2 = a_1 * ((a_1 + d)/a_1)^2 = (a_1 + d)^2 / a_1

# Multiply both sides by a_1:
# a_1(a_1 + 5d) = (a_1 + d)^2 => a_1^2 + 5 a_1 d = a_1^2 + 2 a_1 d + d^2
# 5 a_1 d = 2 a_1 d + d^2
# 3 a_1 d = d^2
# If d != 0, a_1 = d / 3

# Use this to find explicit forms:
# a_1 = d/3, a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d = d/3 + (n-1)d = d(n - 2/3)
# Now check if for a given k > 0, exists s in Q with
# a_4 = a_1 * s and a_k = a_4 * s

# Plugging in:
# a_4 = d(4 - 2/3) = d(10/3) = (10/3)*d
# a_1 = d/3
# So s satisfies a_4 = a_1 * s => (10/3)d = (d/3)*s => s = 10

# Also a_k = a_4 * s => a_k = a_4 * s = (10/3)d * 10 = (100/3) d
# But a_k = d(k - 2/3) = d(k - 2/3)
# Therefore d(k - 2/3) = (100/3) d, and if d != 0,
# k - 2/3 = 100/3 => k = 100/3 + 2/3 = 102/3 = 34 exactly

# So for exact s in Q, k must be 34.

# Program will compute for small k, and print matches.

max_k = 40

print("Enumerating k from 1 to", max_k)
print("Assuming a_1 = d/3, d != 0 (from the geometric condition)")

for k in range(1, max_k + 1):
    # a_1 = d/3, arbitrary numerator is d (can pick d=3 for simplicity to keep integer)
    # a_1 = 1
    a1 = Fraction(1)
    d = Fraction(3)
    # explicit values:
    a4 = a1 + 3 * d  # since (4-1)*d = 3d
    # actually a_n = a_1 + (n-1)*d
    # a_4 = a1 + 3*d = 1 + 9 = 10
    a4 = a1 + (4 -1)* d  # 1 + 3*3 = 10
    # given s = a_4 / a_1 = 10/1 = 10
    s = a4 / a1
    a_k = a1 + (k -1)* d
    # check if exists s such that a_k = a_4 * s = a_4 * s
    # Given s fixed = 10, a_4 * s = 10 * 10 = 100
    # Check if a_k == a_4 * s, here s must be double s to satisfy second equality
    # Problem states: ∃ s ∈ ℚ: a_4 = a_1 * s and a_k = a_4 * s
    # so the s in second equation is maybe different?
    # But by problem, same s, so check if a_k == a_4 * s
    # Let's test this:
    lhs = a_k
    rhs = a4 * s
    if lhs == rhs:
        print(f"k = {k}: a_4 = a_1 * {s}, a_k = a_4 * {s} holds exactly.")

print("\nAccording to above reasoning, k=34 satisfies the condition exactly.")
