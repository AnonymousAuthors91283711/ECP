Ground Truth Answer: fun ⟨x, y⟩ => 2 * x + (y - x^2)
Proposed Answer: fun p => 2 * p.1 - p.2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding a relationship between a and b given certain conditions about quadratic equations and midpoints.

2. The ground truth answer is `fun ⟨x, y⟩ => 2 * x + (y - x^2)`, which can be simplified to `2x + y - x²`.

3. The proposed answer is `fun p => 2 * p.1 - p.2`, which is `2x - y` (where p.1 = x, p.2 = y).

Comparing these:
- Ground truth: `2x + y - x²`
- Proposed: `2x - y`

These are clearly different expressions. The proposed answer is missing the `-x²` term and has the wrong sign for `y`.
