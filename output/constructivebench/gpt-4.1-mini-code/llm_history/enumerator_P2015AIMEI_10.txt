Problem context: find a cubic polynomial \( f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \), with degree 3, subject to:
- \( f(1) = 12 \)
- \( f(2) = -12 \)
- \( f(3) = -12 \)
- \( f(5) = 12 \)
- \( f(6) = 12 \)
- \( f(7) = -12 \)

and compute \( |f(0)| \).

As there are 6 conditions but only 4 unknown coefficients, the system is overdetermined and should have a unique solution (if the polynomial satisfies those conditions exactly).

Approach: set up a system of linear equations for the variables \([a, b, c, d]\), solve for exact or approximate values, and then compute and print \(|f(0)| = |d|\).

We'll programmatically enumerate the constraints and solve the system using sympy for exact rational arithmetic.

We print the found polynomial coefficients and the absolute value at 0 immediately once found, complying with streaming results.

```python
# Enumerate the polynomial coefficients satisfying the given conditions using sympy for exact solution.
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Rational, pprint

def main():
    a, b, c, d = symbols('a b c d', real=True)
    points = [
        (1, 12), (2, -12), (3, -12),
        (5, 12), (6, 12), (7, -12)
    ]

    # Because the system is overdetermined, try all subsets of 4 equations to solve for coefficients.
    from itertools import combinations

    # Store solutions as tuples to avoid duplicates
    solutions = set()

    for eq_indices in combinations(range(len(points)), 4):
        eqs = []
        for i in eq_indices:
            x, y = points[i]
            eqs.append(Eq(a*x**3 + b*x**2 + c*x + d, y))
        sol_candidates = solve(eqs, (a,b,c,d), dict=True)
        for sol in sol_candidates:
            # Verify solution satisfies all 6 equations
            valid = True
            for x, y in points:
                val = sol[a]*x**3 + sol[b]*x**2 + sol[c]*x + sol[d]
                if val != y:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if valid:
                # Round coefficients to rationals for printing
                coeffs = (sol[a].evalf(), sol[b].evalf(), sol[c].evalf(), sol[d].evalf())
                if coeffs not in solutions:
                    solutions.add(coeffs)
                    # Print solution immediately:
                    print("Found polynomial coefficients:")
                    print(f"a = {sol[a]}, b = {sol[b]}, c = {sol[c]}, d = {sol[d]}")
                    abs_f0 = abs(sol[d])
                    print(f"|f(0)| = |d| = {abs_f0}")
                    # Since problem states uniqueness, we can stop after first valid solution
                    return

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
