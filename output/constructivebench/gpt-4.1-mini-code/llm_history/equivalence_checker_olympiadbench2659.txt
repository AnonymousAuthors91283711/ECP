theorem olympiadbench2659 : 
  (10^(9^2 - 9))^(1/9)^(1/2)^(1/2) = olympiadbench2659_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 100
Proposed Answer: 10^(8/9)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step.

1. The expression is: (10^(9^2 - 9))^(1/9)^(1/2)^(1/2)
2. First, calculate the exponent: 9^2 - 9 = 81 - 9 = 72
3. Now we have: (10^72)^(1/9)^(1/2)^(1/2)
4. Apply the exponents from right to left:
   - (1/2)^(1/2) = 1/√2
   - (1/9)^(1/√2) ≈ (1/9)^0.707 ≈ 0.166
5. Now we have: (10^72)^0.166 ≈ 10^(72×0.166) ≈ 10^12

Wait, this doesn't match either answer. Let me re-examine the order of operations.

The correct order should be:
1. Start with 10^(9^2-9) = 10^72
2. Apply (1/9) exponent: (10^72)^(1/9) = 10^(72/9) = 10^8
3. Apply (1/2) exponent: (10^8)^(1/2) = 10^4
4. Apply another (1/2) exponent: (10^4)^(1/2) = 10^2 = 100

The ground truth answer is correct (100). The proposed answer (10^(8/9)) is incorrect as it only accounts for the first exponent operation and ignores the subsequent square roots.
