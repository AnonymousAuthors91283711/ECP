The problem involves counting subsets of size 2 from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, then finding the proportion of those subsets that contain at least one element less than or equal to 4.

Let's enumerate all 2-element subsets of {1,...,6}, count how many have an element ≤ 4, and find the ratio.

```python
from itertools import combinations
from fractions import Fraction

tickets = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Ω = list(combinations(tickets, 2))  # all 2-subsets
total = len(Ω)

count_A = 0
for s in Ω:
    if any(x <= 4 for x in s):  # condition for A
        count_A += 1
        print(f"Subset {s} contains element ≤ 4")

ratio = Fraction(count_A, total)
print(f"Total number of subsets: {total}")
print(f"Number of subsets in A: {count_A}")
print(f"Ratio (card A / card Ω) = {ratio}")
```
This code will immediately print each qualifying subset and finally the exact fraction ratio, aiding in conjecturing the answer.
