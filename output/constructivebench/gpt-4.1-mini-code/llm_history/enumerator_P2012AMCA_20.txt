The problem involves finding the coefficient of \(X^{2012}\) in the expansion of \((1 + X + X^2 + \ldots + X^7)^8\). This coefficient counts the number of ways to write 2012 as a sum of 8 integers each between 0 and 7 inclusive. We want to check if this coefficient is a power of 2, and if so, find the exponent \(k\) such that this coefficient = \(2^k\).

To assist with conjecturing, I'll write a Python program to:
1. Enumerate the coefficient of \(X^n\) for \(n\) around 2012 by using the polynomial expansion.
2. Print the exact coefficient for \(X^{2012}\).
3. Print powers of 2 near this coefficient to help determine the exponent.
4. Also print the coefficient and its factorization for some sample jobs (around n=2012 for 8 terms with max power 7).

The program will efficiently compute coefficients by dynamic programming (counting integer compositions).

```python
# Count number of ways to write n as sum of k integers each in [0,m]
def coeff(n, k=8, m=7):
    # dp[i][j] = ways to sum to j using i terms in [0,m]
    dp = [0]*(n+1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for _ in range(k):
        new_dp = [0]*(n+1)
        for s in range(n+1):
            if dp[s]:
                # Add all next terms from 0 to m if within bounds
                max_add = min(m, n - s)
                for add in range(max_add+1):
                    new_dp[s+add] += dp[s]
        dp = new_dp
    return dp[n]

    return x>0 and (x & (x-1)) == 0

def power_of_two_exponent(x):
    # assumes x is power of two
    e = 0
    while x > 1:
        x >>= 1
        e += 1
    return e

n = 2012
k = 8
m = 7

c = coeff(n, k, m)
print(f"Coefficient of X^{n} in (1+X+...+X^{m})^{k} is {c}")

# Check if c is power of two
if is_power_of_two(c):
    e = power_of_two_exponent(c)
    print(f"This coefficient is 2^{e}")
else:
    print("Coefficient is not a power of two.")

# Let's show coefficients for n near 2012 to detect any pattern
print("\nNearby coefficients:")
for delta in range(-5,6):
    nn = n + delta
    if nn < 0:
        continue
    val = coeff(nn, k, m)
    print(f"coeff for X^{nn}: {val}")

# Show factorizations of a few values around 2012 (using simple trial division)
import math
def factors(x):
    fs = []
    for d in range(2, int(math.isqrt(x))+1):

            fs.append(d)
            x //= d
    if x > 1:
        fs.append(x)
    return fs

    nn = n + delta
    if nn < 0:
