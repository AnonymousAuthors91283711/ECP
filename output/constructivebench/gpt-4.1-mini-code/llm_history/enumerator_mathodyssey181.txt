The given equation is \((x+4) \cdot 6 = 8x + 30\). We can rewrite it as \(6x + 24 = 8x + 30\).

To enumerate and conjecture the integer solution, we will try small integer values for \(x\) and check which satisfy the equation exactly.

```python
# Enumerate integer x in range -20 to 20
for x in range(-20, 21):
    left = (x + 4) * 6
    right = 8 * x + 30
    if left == right:
        print(f"x = {x} satisfies (x+4)*6 = 8*x + 30")

# After enumeration, print the unique solution if found
solutions = [x for x in range(-20, 21) if (x+4)*6 == 8*x + 30]
if solutions:
    print(f"The solution is x = {solutions[0]}")
else:
    print("No integer solution found in range.")
```
