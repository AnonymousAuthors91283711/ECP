The problem involves a function \(f(k)\) defined as a product \(\prod_i (k + a_i)\) for strictly positive \(a_i\), and a parameter \(p\) prime. We want to find the minimal \(m\) such that for all \(k\), there exists \(k'\) with the \(p\)-adic valuations of \(f(k)\) and \(f(k')\) satisfying
\[
v_p(f(k)) < v_p(f(k')) \leq v_p(f(k)) + m.
\]

This requires computing \(v_p(f(k))\), which is the sum of \(v_p(k + a_i)\) over \(i\), and for each \(k\), checking if such \(k'\) exists with \(v_p(f(k'))\) in this allowed range.

To conjecture \(\text{omnimath80\_answer}(n, p)\), we can:
- Fix small \(n\) and \(p\),
- Sample different \(a_i\) (since \(a_i > 0\)),
- For a range of \(k\), compute \(v_p(f(k))\),
- For each \(k\), check minimal \(m\) that works,
- Get the maximum minimal \(m\) over all \(k\),
- Then get minimal \(m\) such that this holds for *all* \(a\) with positive entries.

Because true universal quantification over all \(a\) is infinite, we'll sample some \(a\) to get candidate values.

We'll print immediate candidate \(m\) values for sample \((n, p, a)\).

To keep output short, test \(n \in \{1,2,3\}\), \(p \in \{2,3\}\), \(a_i\) small in \([1,5]\), and \(k\) in some small range, compute \(v_p\), find \(m\) ensuring the valuation increments occur within \(m\).

# Enumerate possible omnimath80_answer(n,p) values for small n,p with sample a_i
# For fixed (n,p,a), compute minimal m such that ∀k∃k' with 
# v_p(f(k')) > v_p(f(k)) and v_p(f(k')) ≤ v_p(f(k)) + m,
# where f(k)=∏(k+a_i) and v_p is p-adic valuation.
