abbrev omnimath395_answer : Set ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath395 (m : ℝ) :
    ∃ (x₁ x₂ : ℝ), roots (C 2 * X^2 - C m * X - C 8) = {x₁, x₂} ∧ x₁ ≠ x₂ ∧ |x₁ - x₂| = m - 1 ↔ m ∈ omnimath395_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: m values and roots with |x1 - x2| = m - 1:
m = 6, roots = (-1.0, 4.0), |x1 - x2| = 5.0

Minimum m with property: 6.0. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
<<<{m | m = 6}>>>
