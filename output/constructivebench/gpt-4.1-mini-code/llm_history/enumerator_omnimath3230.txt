The problem concerns counting the maximum number \( L \) of ways to separate a finite set \( S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2 \) of size \( n \) into two disjoint subsets \( A, B \) using a linear inequality (a strict linear separator). Equivalently, we want to find the maximum number of linearly separable bipartitions of \( S \).

This is a classic problem related to counting the number of ways to dichotomize or label points by linear classifiers in 2D. For example, given \( n \) points in general position in 2D, the number of linear separations is well-known to be at most \( n(n-1)+2 \), but can be less based on configuration.

To experimentally enumerate and conjecture \( \text{omnimath3230\_answer}(n) \), I will:

- For small \( n \),
- Generate configurations of \( n \) points (e.g., random points or simple arrangements),
- Enumerate all possible labelings (bipartitions) of \( S \) (except trivial all-empty sets),
- Count the subsets \( (A,B) \) which are linearly strictly separable, i.e., exist \( (a,b,c) \) (nonzero \( (a,b) \)) so that
  \( a x + b y + c < 0 \) for all points in \( A \) and
  \( a x + b y + c > 0 \) for all points in \( B \),
- Print found counts,
- Compare counts for different configurations,
- Deduce the maximal possible \( L \) for given \( n \).

To keep the enumeration simple and efficient within token limits, I will use a simple test set (e.g., points on a circle or polygon vertices), enumerate labelings, use a linear program or computational geometry to check feasibility of linear separation, and print the maximal count found.

```python
# Counts max number L of linearly separable bipartitions of a set S in R^2 of size n.
# We'll try n=1..5, points on unit circle for general position, enumerate labelings,
# check linear separability, print max count for each n.

    # a*x + b*y + c <0 for all (x,y) in A
    # a*x + b*y + c >0 for all (x,y) in B
    # Equivalent to linear feasibility:
    # For all p in A: a*p[0] + b*p[1] + c < 0
    # For all q in B: a*q[0] + b*q[1] + c > 0
    # We relax strict inequalities by small margin epsilon=1e-8:
    # a*p[0] + b*p[1] + c <= -epsilon for p in A

    # Solve by linear programming feasibility.

    # For q in B: a*q[0] + b*q[1] + c >= EPS
    # Also constraint: a^2 + b^2 >= some positive small value to avoid zero vector.
    # But LP can't enforce quadratic. Instead, try to fix norm or try normalization or try multiple guesses.
    # Strategy: fix a^2 + b^2 =1 by parametrize angle or try guesses for (a,b).
    # Instead, try to solve LP for c given fixed (a,b) directions sampled on unit circle.

    # If exist (a,b) with norm=1 s.t. linear constraints on c feasible, separation holds.
