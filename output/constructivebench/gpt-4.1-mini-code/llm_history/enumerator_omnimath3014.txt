The problem involves a rational number equality with 333/1000 as a proposed answer. Since it is about rational numbers, let's enumerate some rational approximations near 333/1000 with small denominators and verify their closeness or some property (e.g., simplest fractions near 0.333). Since the problem and context is minimal, I'll demonstrate enumerating rational numbers with denominators up to 20 near 0.333 and print these candidates.

```python
# Enumerate rational numbers p/q with q <= 20 near 333/1000 = 0.333
target_num = 333
target_den = 1000
target_val = target_num / target_den

max_den = 20

print(f"Enumerating rationals p/q with q <= {max_den} near {target_num}/{target_den} = {target_val:.5f}")

closest_diff = 1.0
closest_frac = None

for q in range(1, max_den+1):
    # For each denominator q, find p approx target_val*q
    p_approx = round(target_val * q)
    for p in [p_approx-1, p_approx, p_approx+1]:
        if p < 0 or p > q:  # restrict numerator to [0, q] for proper fractions for simplicity
            continue
        val = p / q
        diff = abs(val - target_val)
        print(f"Candidate fraction: {p}/{q} = {val:.5f}, diff = {diff:.5f}")
        if diff < closest_diff:
            closest_diff = diff
            closest_frac = (p, q)

print(f"Closest fraction found with denominator <= {max_den}: {closest_frac[0]}/{closest_frac[1]}, diff = {closest_diff:.5f}")
```
