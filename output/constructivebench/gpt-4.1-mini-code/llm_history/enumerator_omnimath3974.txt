[write_program]
This problem asks to characterize all real functions \( f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) satisfying
\[ f(x^2 - y^2) = x f(x) - y f(y) \quad \forall x,y \in \mathbb{R}. \]

I will write a Python program to enumerate possible functions with simple forms (such as polynomials of degree â‰¤ 2) and check the given equation on a few values. This may help conjecture the form of \( f \).

```python
# Enumerate candidate functions f of the form f(x) = a*x^2 + b*x + c
# Check the functional equation on some sample points

def check_eq(a, b, c):
    # Check the equation for several (x, y)
    # f(x^2 - y^2) ?= x * f(x) - y * f(y)
    # with f(x) = a*x^2 + b*x + c
    
    points = [
        (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1), (-1,1), (2,1), (1,-1), (2,-2)
    ]
    for x, y in points:
        lhs = a*(x**2 - y**2)**2 + b*(x**2 - y**2) + c
        rhs = x*(a*x**2 + b*x + c) - y*(a*y**2 + b*y + c)
        if abs(lhs - rhs) > 1e-9:
            return False
    return True

print("Testing functions f(x)=a*x^2 + b*x + c that satisfy the equation:")
for a in [-2,-1,0,1,2]:
    for b in [-2,-1,0,1,2]:
        for c in [-2,-1,0,1,2]:
            if check_eq(a,b,c):
                print(f"f(x) = {a}*x^2 + {b}*x + {c}")

print("\nTrying some simple non-polynomial guesses:")

# Try f(x) = k*x linear (c=0, a=0)
for k in [-2,-1,0,1,2]:
    def f(x): return k*x
    fails = False
    for x,y in [(1,2),(3,-1),(-2,-2)]:
        lhs = f(x**2 - y**2)
        rhs = x*f(x) - y*f(y)
        if abs(lhs - rhs) > 1e-9:
            fails = True
            break
    if not fails:
        print(f"f(x) = {k}*x (linear)")

# Try f(x) = k*x^3
for k in [-1,0,1]:
    def f(x): return k*x**3
    fails = False
    for x,y in [(1,2),(3,-1),(-2,-2)]:
        lhs = f(x**2 - y**2)
        rhs = x*f(x) - y*f(y)
        if abs(lhs - rhs) > 1e-6:
            fails = True
            break
    if not fails:
        print(f"f(x) = {k}*x^3")

# Try zero function
def f(x): return 0
print("f(x) = 0 (zero function) trivially satisfies")

# Final note: linear forms survive; output encourages conjecture f(x)=c*x.
```
This program tries polynomials of degree up to 2 and some other forms. It prints all functions passing the test on a few sample points immediately, helping to conjecture the real characterization.
