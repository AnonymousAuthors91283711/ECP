[write_program]
The problem describes polynomials \( f \) over \(\mathbb{R}\) such that for every real \(x\),
\[
f(x) \cdot f(2x^2) = f(2x^3 + x).
\]
To explore solutions, I'll write a program to enumerate polynomials up to a small degree (e.g. degree 3), with integer coefficients from \(-2\) to \(2\), and check the identity at several sample points. Since the identity must hold for all real \(x\), testing multiple points will help conjecture candidates.

The program will print each candidate polynomial immediately when verified to satisfy the relation at all test points.

```python
# We explore polynomials f(x) = a3*x^3 + a2*x^2 + a1*x + a0,
# with integer coefficients in -2..2.
# For each, we check if f(x)*f(2*x^2) == f(2*x^3 + x) holds
# for sample x values. If so, print polynomial.

from sympy import symbols, Poly

x = symbols('x')

# Sample points to check the functional equation
test_points = [-2, -1, 0, 0.5, 1, 2]

def poly_str(coeffs):
    terms = []
    deg = len(coeffs)-1
    for i, c in enumerate(coeffs):
        power = deg - i
        if c == 0:
            continue
        term = ''
        if c < 0:
            term += '-'
        elif terms:
            term += '+'
        if abs(c) != 1 or power == 0:
            term += str(abs(c))
        if power > 0:
            term += 'x'
            if power > 1:
                term += f'^{power}'
        terms.append(term)
    return ''.join(terms) if terms else '0'

# Check all polynomials degree up to 3 with coeffs in -2..2
for a3 in range(-2,3):
    for a2 in range(-2,3):
        for a1 in range(-2,3):
            for a0 in range(-2,3):
                coeffs = [a3,a2,a1,a0]
                # Skip zero polynomial
                if all(c == 0 for c in coeffs):
                    continue
                p = Poly(a3*x**3 + a2*x**2 + a1*x + a0, x)
                # Check the condition at all test points
                valid = True
                for val in test_points:
                    lhs = p.eval(val)*p.eval(2*val**2)
                    rhs = p.eval(2*val**3 + val)
                    if abs(lhs - rhs) > 1e-10:
                        valid = False
                        break
                if valid:
                    print(f"Satisfies condition: f(x) = {poly_str(coeffs)}")
```
