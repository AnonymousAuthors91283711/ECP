The problem is to find all positive integer triples (x, y, z) satisfying the system:
- \(x^2 + y - z = 100\)
- \(x + y^2 - z = 124\)

We want to enumerate all such triples with \(x, y, z > 0\). We'll rearrange to find z:
- From the first: \(z = x^2 + y - 100\)
- From the second: \(z = x + y^2 - 124\)

Equate these two:
\[x^2 + y - 100 = x + y^2 - 124\]
\[\Rightarrow x^2 - x + y - y^2 = -24\]
\[\Rightarrow x^2 - x - y^2 + y = -24\]

We can enumerate small positive integers \(x, y\) in a reasonable range, compute z from either formula and check if positive integer z matches both. Print each matching triple immediately.

```python
# enumerate solutions (x,y,z) with x,y,z > 0 satisfying:
# x^2 + y - z = 100
# x + y^2 - z = 124

def main():
    # Given equations imply z = x^2 + y - 100 = x + y^2 - 124
    # Explore x,y in range to find positive z
    # x,y > 0 integers, try reasonable max from constraints
    max_val = 30  # arbitrary small bound to keep search feasible

    for x in range(1, max_val + 1):
        for y in range(1, max_val + 1):
            z1 = x*x + y - 100
            z2 = x + y*y - 124
            if z1 == z2 and z1 > 0:
                print(f"(x, y, z) = ({x}, {y}, {z1})")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
