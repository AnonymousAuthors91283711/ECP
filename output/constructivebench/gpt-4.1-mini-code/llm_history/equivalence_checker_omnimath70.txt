Ground Truth Answer: fun n => if Odd n then n^2 - n + 1 else n^2
Proposed Answer: fun n => n * n - (n - 1)
Let's analyze the two answers:

1. Ground Truth Answer:
   - When n is odd: n² - n + 1
   - When n is even: n²

2. Proposed Answer: n * n - (n - 1) = n² - n + 1

Comparing them:
- For odd n: Both give n² - n + 1 (they match)
- For even n:
  - Ground truth gives n²
  - Proposed gives n² - n + 1 (which is different from n² when n > 0)

The proposed answer only matches the ground truth for odd n, but gives incorrect results for even n. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
