Ground Truth Answer: 10
Proposed Answer: 946
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the minimal value s where two arithmetic sequences (a and b) satisfy:
   - They never intersect (a_i ≠ b_j for any i,j)
   - a₂₀ + b₁₄ = 1000
   - b₂₀ + a₁₄ = s

2. The ground truth answer is 10, which suggests the sequences are very close but never intersect.

3. The proposed answer is 946, which is significantly larger than 10.

4. For arithmetic sequences to never intersect yet have aₙ + bₘ = 1000, the minimal difference would indeed be small (like 10), not in the hundreds.

5. The proposed answer of 946 seems too large to be the minimal possible s satisfying these conditions.
