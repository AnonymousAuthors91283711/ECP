The problem asks us to investigate the set of positive integers \( d \) such that there exist \( m < n \) with \( n - m = d \), for which the number of multiples of 2021 in the interval \( [m, n) \) strictly exceeds the number of multiples of 2000 in the same interval. The goal is to find the maximum such \( d \).

To get insight, we can try small values of \( d \) and check intervals \( [m, m+d) \) for \( m = 0, 1, \dots \) to see if the count of 2021-multiples exceeds that of 2000-multiples.

The approach:
- For each \( d \) in a reasonable range (up to a certain threshold to control output),
- Enumerate \( m \) up to a few multiples of the larger divisor to sample different positions,
- Count how many numbers divisible by 2021 and 2000 lie in \( [m, m+d) \),
- If count(2021) > count(2000), print \( d \) and \( m \) as a witness.

We print all candidate \( d \) found to estimate the supremum and identify the maximum.

```python
# enumerator.py
# Enumerates d for which intervals [m, m+d) exist with more multiples of 2021 than 2000

def count_multiples(div, start, end):
    # Count multiples of div in [start, end)
    return end//div - (start+div-1)//div

def main():
    max_d = 50000  # limit to keep output brief and runtime reasonable
    sample_ms = 50  # sample multiples of largest divisor for starting points
    d_candidates = []

    for d in range(1, max_d+1):
        found = False
        # Sample m around multiples of LCM or largest divisor to cover cases
        for m in range(0, sample_ms * 2000, 2000):
            count_2021 = count_multiples(2021, m, m+d)
            count_2000 = count_multiples(2000, m, m+d)
            if count_2021 > count_2000:
                print(f"d={d}, start={m}, count_2021={count_2021}, count_2000={count_2000}")
                d_candidates.append(d)
                found = True
                break
    if d_candidates:
        max_candidate = max(d_candidates)
        print(f"Maximum d found with condition: {max_candidate}")
    else:
        print("No d found with more multiples of 2021 than 2000 in any sampled interval.")
