The problem concerns counting bijections \( f: \{0,\ldots,5\} \to \{0,\ldots,5\} \) with a certain "local adjacency" constraint based on a 2D grid interpretation (2 rows Ã— 3 columns) of the set \(\{0,\ldots,5\}\). For each \(k\), the image \(f(k)\) has at most two neighbors in the set \(f(i)\) for \(i < k\).

We'll write a Python program to enumerate all permutations of size 6, check the neighbors condition, and print out each valid permutation and finally the total count.

```python
from itertools import permutations

# Grid dimensions
rows, cols = 2, 3
N = rows * cols

# Precompute neighbors for each position 0..5 in the grid
def neighbors(pos):
    r, c = divmod(pos, cols)
    nbrs = []
    for (nr, nc) in [(r, c-1), (r, c+1), (r-1, c), (r+1, c)]:
        if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:
            nbrs.append(nr*cols + nc)
    return set(nbrs)

neighbors_map = {i: neighbors(i) for i in range(N)}

count = 0

# Enumerate all permutations f: {0..5} -> {0..5}
for perm in permutations(range(N)):
    valid = True
    eaten = set()
    for k in range(N):
        fk = perm[k]
        # neighbors of fk that are already "eaten"
        intersection = neighbors_map[fk].intersection(eaten)
        if len(intersection) > 2:
            valid = False
            break
        eaten.add(fk)
    if valid:
        count += 1
        print(f"Valid permutation #{count}: {perm}")

print(f"Total valid permutations: {count}")
```
