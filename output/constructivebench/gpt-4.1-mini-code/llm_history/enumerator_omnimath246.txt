The problem seems to be about analyzing the expression \((m+n)! / (m-n)!\) for natural numbers \(m \ge n\). The task is to find or conjecture the form of the function \( \text{omnimath246_answer}(m, n) \) representing this expression.

To assist, the program will:
- Enumerate values for \(m, n\) with \(m \ge n\),
- Compute the exact integer value \(\frac{(m+n)!}{(m-n)!}\),
- Print the parameters and the value,
- Try small values of \(m,n\) to conjecture a closed form.

```python
import math

print("Enumerating values for (m, n) with m >= n and m,n in [0..10]:")
for m in range(11):
    for n in range(m+1):  # n â‰¤ m
        numerator = math.factorial(m + n)
        denominator = math.factorial(m - n)
        value = numerator // denominator  # exact integer division
        print(f"m={m}, n={n}, ((m+n)!)/(m-n)! = {value}")
```
This gives insight into the pattern and helps guess the closed form or prove the correctness of the theorem.
