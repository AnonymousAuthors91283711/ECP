The problem involves examining the set \(\{ x, x+2, \frac{1}{2}x, x-2, 2x \}\) for \(x < -2\) and identifying the least element among those values. To assist in conjecturing which value is minimal, the Python program below enumerates the values for sample \(x\) values less than \(-2\), prints them, and also prints the minimum found. This immediate printed output can help observe patterns, leading to the exact answer.

```python
# Enumerate and print the values of the set {x, x+2, (1/2)*x, x-2, 2*x} for x < -2
# We pick sample x values less than -2 and print all candidates and their minimum.

def candidates(x):
    return [x, x + 2, 0.5 * x, x - 2, 2 * x]

def main():
    sample_xs = [-3, -4, -5, -10, -20]  # sample values less than -2
    for x in sample_xs:
        vals = candidates(x)
        print(f"x = {x}")
        for i, v in enumerate(vals):
            # print exact fractions or integers when possible
            # since all are multiples or sums with integers, fractions can be decimal
            print(f"  Candidate {i+1}: {v}")
        min_val = min(vals)
        print(f"  Minimum value: {min_val}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
