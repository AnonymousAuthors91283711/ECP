abbrev omnimath3428_answer : ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3428 (s t : ℝ) : 0.1 * s = t ↔ s = omnimath3428_answer t := by sorry. Enumerated answers: t = -2, s = -20 (since 0.1 * s = t)
t = -1, s = -10 (since 0.1 * s = t)
t = 0, s = 0 (since 0.1 * s = t)
t = 0.5, s = 5.0 (since 0.1 * s = t)
t = 1, s = 10 (since 0.1 * s = t)
t = 2, s = 20 (since 0.1 * s = t)
t = 3, s = 30 (since 0.1 * s = t). Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
<<<fun t : ℝ => 10 * t>>>
