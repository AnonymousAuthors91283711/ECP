The problem involves counting the number of integer pairs \((c,d)\) with both \(c \neq 0\) and \(d \neq 0\), for which there exists an integer \(x\) such that:
\[
c \cdot x = d \quad \text{and} \quad d \cdot x = c.
\]
We want to find the cardinality of the set:
\[
S = \{(c,d) \in \mathbb{Z}^2 \mid c \neq 0, d \neq 0, \exists x \in \mathbb{Z}: c x = d \wedge d x = c \}.
\]

Key steps to understand the problem:
1. From \(c x = d\), we get \(x = d / c\).
2. From \(d x = c\), substitute \(x = d/c\) into \(d x = c\) gives:
   \[
   d \cdot \frac{d}{c} = c \implies \frac{d^2}{c} = c \implies d^2 = c^2.
   \]
3. Since \(c,d \neq 0\), \(d^2 = c^2\) implies \(d = \pm c\).
4. Also, \(x = d / c = \pm 1\), which are indeed integers.
5. Thus, the pairs are all \((c,d)\) with \(c,d \neq 0\) and \(d = \pm c\).

This infinite set's cardinality is infinite, but since the problem states \(\{(c,d) \in \mathbb{Z}^2 \mid \ldots \}.\text{ncard}\) presumably denotes the size of some finite subset or a count for bounded values.

To enumerate and conjecture the formula:
- We will consider pairs with \(c,d \in [-N,N] \setminus \{0\}\) for some small \(N\).
- Count how many satisfy \(d = \pm c\), \(c \neq 0\).
- Output the counts and conjecture the formula for arbitrary \(N\).

```python
# Enumerate pairs (c,d) with c,d in [-N,N] \ {0}
# Count pairs where d = c or d = -c.
# Print counts for increasing N to conjecture the cardinality.

def main():
    for N in range(1, 6):  # small N for brevity
        count = 0
        # c != 0, d != 0 in [-N, N]
        for c in range(-N, N+1):
            if c == 0:
                continue
            # d = c
            d1 = c
            if d1 != 0 and -N <= d1 <= N:
                count += 1
                print(f"N={N}: Found pair (c,d)=({c},{d1}) with d=c")
            # d = -c, avoid double counting if c = -c (i.e. c=0, skip)
            d2 = -c
            if d2 != 0 and -N <= d2 <= N and d2 != d1:
                count += 1
                print(f"N={N}: Found pair (c,d)=({c},{d2}) with d=-c")
        print(f"N={N}: Total count = {count}")
        # Note: For each nonzero c, we get two pairs (c,c) and (c,-c),
        # but when c=-c => c=0 excluded, so count = 2 * (2N) 
        # since c != 0, c varies over 2N integers from -N to N excluding 0

    main()
