. Enumerated answers: Enumerating k in [-500,500] with unique positive solution:
Total count of such k: 0. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The condition is log(k * x) = 2 * log(x + 2) with unique solution x > 0. Solving:
log(k) + log(x) = 2 log(x + 2)
=> log(k) = 2 log(x + 2) - log(x) = log((x + 2)^2 / x)
=> k = ((x+2)^2) / x for unique x > 0.
Rewrite k as a function of x > 0:
k(x) = (x+2)^2 / x = x + 4 + 4/x.
Consider k(x) for x > 0:
k(x) = x + 4 + 4/x,
k'(x) = 1 - 4/x^2,
Set k'(x)=0 => x=2,
Minimum of k(x) at x=2: k(2)= 2 +4 +2 =8,
When x→0^+, k→ +∞,
When x→+∞, k→ +∞.
So for k < 8, no solution,
k=8: unique solution at x=2,
k >8: two solutions.

However, the problem domain is k ∈ [-500,500]. Since k(x) > 8 for all x > 0 except minimum at 8, we want k=8 as the only integer in that range permitting unique solution.

Check that k=8 is the unique integer k with unique positive solution, and 8 ∈ [-500,500].

Therefore,

<<<8>>>
