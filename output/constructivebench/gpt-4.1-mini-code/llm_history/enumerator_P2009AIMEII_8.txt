[write_program]
This problem involves two independent geometric random variables \(X, Y\) with \(P(X = k) = (5/6)^{k-1} \cdot (1/6)\). We want the probability \(P(|X-Y| \leq 1) = P(X=Y \lor X=Y+1 \lor Y=X+1)\).

We enumerate pairs \((d, l)\) for \(d, l \in \{1, \dots, N\}\) (since geometric distributions are infinite, we pick \(N=15\) for approximation). We compute exact probabilities as fractions, sum over the valid pairs, and simplify the result.

The program prints each valid pair's probability fraction and partial summations, then the final approximate probability. This should help conjecture the exact answer.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def geometric_prob(k):
    # P(X=k) = (5/6)^{k-1}*(1/6)
    return Fraction(1,6) * Fraction(5,6)**(k-1)

def main():
    N = 15  # max for enumeration; geometric tails very small after 15
    total = Fraction(0,1)
    print(f"Enumerating probabilities P(X=d)*P(Y=l) for |d-l| ≤ 1, d,l=1..{N}")
    for d in range(1, N+1):
        p_d = geometric_prob(d)
        for l in range(max(1, d-1), min(N, d+1)+1):  # l in [d-1, d, d+1] intersect [1,N]
            p_l = geometric_prob(l)
            p = p_d * p_l
            print(f"P(d={d}, l={l}) = {p}")
            total += p
    
    # upper bound on missing probability due to truncation
    tail_prob = 1 - sum(geometric_prob(k) for k in range(1, N+1))
    print(f"Tail probability beyond {N}: {tail_prob:.6f} (each variable)")
    print(f"Max missed prob: ≈ {2*tail_prob:.6f} to {tail_prob*tail_prob:.6f} (approximation)")
    print(f"Partial sum for |X-Y| ≤1 up to {N}: {total} ≈ {float(total):.6f}")
