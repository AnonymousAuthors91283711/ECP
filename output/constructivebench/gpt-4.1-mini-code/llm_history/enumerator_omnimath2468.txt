The problem involves a linear transformation T and the measure of the intersection of S with the preimage of S under T, normalized by measure of S. We want to find the rational value p, expressed in lowest terms, and find 100a + b where a/b = p.

We can approximate p numerically by sampling points in S and checking which map into S, or use polygon intersections for exact measure as S is the unit square and T is linear. Since S is [0,1]^2, T⁻¹(S) is a parallelogram defined by inequalities from T(x,y) in S. The intersection is S ∩ T⁻¹(S), which is a polygon.

We can:
- Compute the intersection polygon.
- Calculate its area.
- Then p = area(intersection) / area(S) = area(intersection) since area(S)=1.

We'll find vertices of T⁻¹(S), intersect with S, then find polygon area, simplify fraction, print candidates.

We select small integer samples to identify a, b, print them.

# Define the transformation T(x,y) = (3x+2y, x+4y)
# Inverse T^-1(u,v) = A^{-1}(u,v) where A=[[3,2],[1,4]]
# Compute inverse matrix:
# det = 3*4 -2*1=12 -2=10
# A_inv = (1/det) * [[4,-2],[-1,3]]

# S = unit square [0,1]^2
# T_inv(S) = set of (x,y) such that T(x,y) in S
# i.e. (u,v) in S implies (x,y) = T_inv(u,v)
# So T_inv(S) is image of S under T_inv

# The polygon T_inv(S) is the image of square vertices under T_inv:
