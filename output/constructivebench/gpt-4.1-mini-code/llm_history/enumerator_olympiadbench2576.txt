The problem asks to find the number of integers \( n \) between 1 and 30 such that the set of common positive divisors of \( n \) and 80 has exactly 2 elements. We enumerate these \( n \), print them as we find, and then print the count.

```python
def divisors(x):
    divs = []
    for i in range(1, int(x**0.5)+1):
        if x % i == 0:
            divs.append(i)
            if i != x // i:
                divs.append(x // i)
    return set(divs)

def common_divisors(a, b):
    return divisors(a).intersection(divisors(b))

count = 0
print("n with exactly 2 common positive divisors with 80:")
for n in range(1, 31):
    common = common_divisors(n, 80)
    if len(common) == 2:
        print(n, "common divisors:", sorted(common))
        count += 1
print("Answer:", count)
```
