Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<14400>>> 

Explanation: The count is the number of primes less than 6 (which are 2,3,5) dividing n, counting multiplicity, squared and summed over n from 0 to 2020. The sequence matches sum over n of (v_2(n)+v_3(n)+v_5(n))^2, where v_p(n) is the multiplicity of prime p dividing n. The closed form evaluated yields 14400.
