abbrev omnimath131_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath131 : 
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | 1 < n ∧ ∃ k : ℕ, (∑ i in Finset.range n, (i + 1)^2) / n = k^2} omnimath131_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating n > 1 with ((n+1)*(2n+1)) / 6 = k^2
n = 337, k = 195, value = 38025 = 195^2

Smallest n: 337 with k = 195. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<337>>>
