The problem involves a polynomial \( f \in \mathbb{Z}[x] \) and a function \( p(m) \) related to prime factors of \( |m| \), with special cases for \( m=0 \) and \( m=\pm 1 \). We want to find polynomials \( f \) such that \( \exists B \in \mathbb{N}, \forall n \in \mathbb{N}, p(f(n^2)) - 2n \le B \). Our goal is to enumerate some polynomials \( f \) with integer coefficients for small degrees and small coefficients, evaluate \( p(f(n^2)) - 2n \), and try to identify those with bounded values.

Since \( p(m) \) roughly returns the greatest prime dividing \( |m| \), or special values \( 1 \) or \( \infty \) if \( m=\pm1 \) or \( 0 \). For \( p(m)-2n \le B \), large prime factors in \( f(n^2) \) growing faster than \( 2n \) would lead to no finite \( B \).

We will enumerate polynomials with degrees 0,1,2 and coefficients from \(-2\) to 2, evaluate \( p(f(n^2)) - 2n \) for \( n=1..10 \) and print those polynomials where the expression stays bounded (say max less than 10). This might help understand the shape of \( f \in \text{omnimath272\_answer} \).

We use sympy to factor numbers and get the maximal prime factor.

```python
# Enumerate integer polynomials f of small degree and coefficients
# For n=1..10, compute m = f(n^2)
# Compute p(m): if m=0 then "inf" else max prime factor (or 1 if Â±1)
# Print polynomials with max(p(m)-2n) <= 10

import sympy

def p(m):
    if m == 0:
        return float('inf')
    if abs(m) == 1:
        return 1
    factors = sympy.factorint(abs(m))
    return max(factors.keys()) if factors else 1

def poly_val(coeffs, x):
    # coeffs: list of coeffs a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + ...
    return sum(c * (x**i) for i, c in enumerate(coeffs))

def poly_str(coeffs):
    terms = []
    for i, c in enumerate(coeffs):
        if c == 0:
            continue
        s = f"{c}" if i==0 else (f"{c}*x^{i}" if i>1 else f"{c}*x")
        terms.append(s)
    return " + ".join(terms) if terms else "0"

max_coeff = 2
max_deg = 2
max_n = 10
threshold = 10

for deg in range(max_deg+1):
    # coeffs from -2..2
    def gen_coeffs(d):
        if d < 0:
            yield []
        else:
            for cs in gen_coeffs(d-1):
                for c in range(-max_coeff, max_coeff+1):
                    yield cs + [c]
    for coeffs in gen_coeffs(deg):
        if all(c == 0 for c in coeffs):
            continue
        vals = []
        overflow = False
        for n in range(1, max_n+1):
            x = n*n
            val = poly_val(coeffs, x)
            pm = p(val)
            if pm == float('inf'):
                overflow = True
                break
            diff = pm - 2*n
            vals.append(diff)
            if diff > threshold:
                overflow = True
                break
        if not overflow:
            print(f"f = {poly_str(coeffs)}; max p(f(n^2))-2n = {max(vals)}")
```
