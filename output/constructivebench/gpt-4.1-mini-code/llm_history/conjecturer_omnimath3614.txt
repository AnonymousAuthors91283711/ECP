abbrev omnimath3614_answer : Set (ℕ × ℕ × ℕ) := sorry
theorem omnimath3614 (x y z : ℕ) : 
  x^5 + x^4 + 1 = 3^y * 7^z ↔ (x, y, z) ∈ omnimath3614_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: (x=1, y=1, z=0) → 1^5 + 1^4 + 1 = 3^1 * 7^0
(x=2, y=0, z=2) → 2^5 + 2^4 + 1 = 3^0 * 7^2. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ × ℕ)
