The problem involves choosing subsets of vertical and horizontal cuts on a 7x7 grid to create a coloring of an 8x8 grid of squares, then counting configurations where black and white areas are equal (32 each). The cuts are indicated by subsets of Fin 7 (7 elements), i.e., subsets of {0,...,6}, where a vertical cut v i or horizontal cut h j divides the squares. Each square is colored black or white based on parity rules involving the cuts.

The goal is to count such (v, h) pairs with equal black and white squares.

We'll enumerate pairs of subsets v, h of {0,...,6}. Each subset can be represented as a 7-bit integer. We'll generate subsets, then for each pair compute the coloring on the 8x8 grid and count black squares. We'll print the count whenever black_area == white_area = 32.

Due to 2^(7+7)=16384 pairs, this is feasible to do quickly.

We'll proceed with small sets, print parameters used, enumerate, and print the final count of valid pairs.

```python
# Enumerate pairs of subsets v, h of {0,...,6}
# For each pair, compute black_area and check if black_area == white_area == 32

def subsets(n):
    # Generate all subsets of {0,..., n-1} as lists of ints
    for mask in range(1 << n):
        yield [i for i in range(n) if (mask >> i) & 1]

def main():
    n = 7
    valid_count = 0
    print(f"Enumerating subsets v, h of size {n}")
    for v in subsets(n):
        v_set = set(v)
        for h in subsets(n):
            h_set = set(h)
            black_area = 0
            # For each cell in 8x8 grid (rows and cols 0..7)
            for x in range(8):
                for y in range(8):
                    # Determine if cut along row x or column y
                    cut = (x in v_set) or (y in h_set)
                    color_parity = (x + y + (0 if cut else 1)) % 2
                    if color_parity == 0:
                        black_area += 1
            white_area = 64 - black_area
            if black_area == white_area:
                print(f"v={sorted(v_set)} h={sorted(h_set)} black_area={black_area} white_area={white_area}")
                valid_count += 1
    print(f"Total valid configurations: {valid_count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
