The problem involves positive real quadruples \((x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)\) satisfying the constraint 
\[x_1 x_2 + x_2 x_3 + x_3 x_4 + x_4 x_1 = x_1 x_3 + x_2 x_4\]
and asks to find the minimum possible value of 
\[f = \frac{x_1}{x_2} + \frac{x_2}{x_3} + \frac{x_3}{x_4} + \frac{x_4}{x_1}.\]

We will try small positive rational-like tuples by enumerating positive integers for \(x_i\), check the constraint approximately (due to floating point), then compute \(f\). This should help conjecture or guess the minimum.

```python
import math

# We enumerate x1,x2,x3,x4 from 1 to 5 (small positive integers) to satisfy positivity.
# Check constraint: x1*x2 + x2*x3 + x3*x4 + x4*x1 == x1*x3 + x2*x4 approximately (tolerance 1e-6).
# If yes, print f and the quadruple.
# Finally, print the minimum f found.

def main():
    tol = 1e-6
    min_f = math.inf
    print("Enumerating tuples (x1,x2,x3,x4) with x_i in [1..5]:")
    for x1 in range(1,6):
        for x2 in range(1,6):
            for x3 in range(1,6):
                for x4 in range(1,6):
                    lhs = x1*x2 + x2*x3 + x3*x4 + x4*x1
                    rhs = x1*x3 + x2*x4
                    if abs(lhs - rhs) < tol:
                        f = x1/x2 + x2/x3 + x3/x4 + x4/x1
                        print(f"f={f:.6f} for (x1,x2,x3,x4)=({x1},{x2},{x3},{x4})")
                        if f < min_f:
                            min_f = f
    print(f"Minimum f found: {min_f:.6f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
