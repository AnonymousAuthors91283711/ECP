The problem defines a sequence \(a_n\) with \(a_0 = 1\) and the recurrence \(a_{n+1} = a_n^2 + 1\). It asks for \(\gcd(a_{999}, a_{2004})\).

To conjecture the gcd, note the sequence grows very fast, but in modular arithmetic, we can track residues modulo potential gcd candidates. The gcd divides both terms, so a candidate gcd divides \(a_{999}\) and \(a_{2004}\). Because the sequence is defined recursively, computing exact values is impossible for large indices due to size, but we can try small divisors or patterns in residues modulo various small divisors. A key observation is that \(a_0=1\) and \(a_1=2\), and that \(\gcd(a_m,a_n) = \gcd(a_{\gcd(m,n)}, \ldots)\) might reduce the problem.

We can try to find gcd numerically by observing the sequence modulo small values and see if something stabilizes. Also try to find \(\gcd(a_m, a_n)\) for small m,n with the same difference pattern (like 999 and 2004) mimicked at small scale to look for patterns.

We'll write a Python program that:
- Defines a function for generating \(a_n\) mod various integers.
- Checks the gcd of actual \(a_m\) and \(a_n\) for smaller m,n by computing exact values (for small n).
- For larger n, just compute residues modulo hypothetical gcd candidates to test divisibility.
- Enumerate possible gcd candidates by seeing which divisors divide both \(a_{999}\) and \(a_{2004}\) modulo that divisor.
 
We will print all divisors found and eventually print the max divisor found, which is the gcd.

```python
# We'll generate a_n modulo candidates to check gcd.
# Since a_n grows fast, we can't store exact a_n for large n.
# We'll try small moduli that divide both a_999 and a_2004.
# By properties of a sequence defined as f(x) = x^2 + 1,
# the gcd of two terms relates to terms indexed by gcd of indices.
# This suggests gcd(a_m,a_n) = a_gcd(m,n) might hold or gcd divides a_gcd(m,n).
# We'll test this on smaller indices.
