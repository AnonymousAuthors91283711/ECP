The problem asks to count the number of integers \( n \in [3, 12] \) for which there exists a commutative, idempotent, associative binary operation \( f : \{0, \dots, n-1\}^2 \to \{0, \dots, n-1\} \). Such an operation is a *commutative idempotent semigroup* operation on the finite set of size \( n \). Equivalently, these correspond to *semilattices* on an \( n \)-element set.

Enumerating all possible binary operations would be huge, so we look for a simpler characterization or try small \( n \) to see which \( n \) admit such operations.

A known fact: A semilattice on \( n \) elements is characterized by an idempotent, commutative, associative operation, which is the meet or join in a partial order. Hence the problem reduces to existence of nontrivial semilattices on \( n \)-element sets.

The trivial semilattice is given by the operation \( f(a,b) = a \) or \( f(a,b) = b \), but \( f(a,a) = a \) always holds trivially.

All sets admit trivial semilattices (take min or max on a total order), so such \( f \) exist for all \( n \). Hence the cardinality of the filtered set (the set of \( n \) that admit such \( f \)) from 3 to 12 is likely 10 (all numbers 3 through 12).

However, the proof asks to count the elements of the set of \( n \in [3..12] \) satisfying those properties.

To assist in conjecturing, the program will enumerate \( n = 3..12 \), attempt to construct a simple candidate operation (e.g. min, max), verify the conditions, and print which \( n \) admit such a function.

We implement the enumeration for \( n \) in range 3..12. For each \( n \), define the min operation (modelling Fin n as integers 0..n-1), then check the three properties. Because min on a finite total order always satisfies these properties, all \( n \) yield true.

We'll print each \( n \) with a candidate operation (min) and state verification success.

```python
# Enumerate n in 3..12, and for each construct the "min" operation on [0..n-1].
# Check if this operation satisfies commutativity, idempotency, associativity.
# The min operation on an integer total order satisfies these.
# Print results streaming, then print the count of such n found.

                return False

    return True

        if is_commutative(f, n) and is_idempotent(f, n) and is_associative(f, n):
            print(f"n={n}: min operation satisfies conditions")
