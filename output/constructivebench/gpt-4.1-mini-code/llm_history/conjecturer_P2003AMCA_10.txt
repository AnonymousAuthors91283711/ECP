The error arises because you defined P2003AMCA_10_answer as a value of type ℚ, but you assigned it a function of type ℚ → ℚ → ℚ → ℚ. Since the theorem uses fixed weights 3, 2, 1, you should evaluate the expression at these values and produce a single rational number.

From the problem, the unclaimed probability is:

unclaimed = 1 - (first_take + second_take + third_take)

where

first_take = a / (a+b+c)
second_take = (b / (a+b+c)) * (1 - first_take)
third_take = (c / (a+b+c)) * (1 - first_take - second_take)

Substitute a=3, b=2, c=1, compute the numeral as a rational number.

An explicit formula for unclaimed fraction is:

1 - [a/(a+b+c) + b/(a+b+c)*(1 - a/(a+b+c)) + c/(a+b+c)*(1 - a/(a+b+c) - b/(a+b+c)*(1 - a/(a+b+c)))]

which simplifies but it is better to compute the numeric value directly.

Compute total = 3+2+1=6

first_take = 3/6 = 1/2

remaining_after_first = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2

second_take = (2/6) * (1/2) = (1/3)*(1/2) = 1/6

remaining_after_second = 1/2 - 1/6 = 1/3

third_take = (1/6)* (1/3) = 1/18

Sum of takes = 1/2 + 1/6 + 1/18 =

convert to common denominator 18:

(9/18 + 3/18 + 1/18) = 13/18

unclaimed = 1 - 13/18 = 5/18

So the answer is 5/18.

Hence, the correct expression for P2003AMCA_10_answer is 5/18.
