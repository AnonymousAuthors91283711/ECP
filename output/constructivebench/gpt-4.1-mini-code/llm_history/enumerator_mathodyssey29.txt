The problem asks to count integer pairs (a, b) with nonzero integers a and b such that:

\[(a^3 + b) \times (a + b^3) = (a+b)^4.\]

We want to find the number of such pairs.

Strategy:
- Enumerate integer pairs (a,b) for a,b ≠ 0 and small |a|, |b| to find candidates.
- Check the equation exactly for each pair.
- Print valid pairs immediately.
- Report the total count at the end.

Due to symmetry and size constraints, consider a, b in range [-10,10] \ {0}.

```python
# Enumerate integer pairs (a,b), a,b != 0, with |a|,|b|<=10
# Check if (a³ + b)(a + b³) = (a + b)^4 exactly
# Print valid pairs immediately and count total solutions

def main():
    solutions = []
    rng = range(-10, 11)
    for a in rng:
        if a == 0:
            continue
        for b in rng:
            if b == 0:
                continue
            lhs = (a**3 + b)*(a + b**3)
            rhs = (a + b)**4
            if lhs == rhs:
                print(f"Solution: a={a}, b={b}")
                solutions.append((a,b))
    print(f"Total number of solutions found: {len(solutions)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
