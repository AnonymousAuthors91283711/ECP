Ground Truth Answer: 7 / (2 * sqrt 30)
Proposed Answer: (3/10)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem presents a system of three equations involving a, b, c with square root terms.
2. The ground truth answer is a = 7/(2√30) ≈ 0.6389
3. The proposed answer is a = 3/10 = 0.3

The proposed answer is significantly different from the ground truth answer (0.3 vs ≈0.6389). 

To verify, we can check if a = 3/10 satisfies the first equation when paired with reasonable b values:
- If a = 0.3, then b would need to satisfy the first equation h1.
- However, numerical checks show no real b satisfies h1 with a = 0.3 while also satisfying the other equations.

The answers are clearly different both in form and numerical value.
