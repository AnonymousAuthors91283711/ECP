Ground Truth Answer: 23
Proposed Answer: 72/529
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer step by step.

1. The problem involves calculating the ratio p1/p2 where:
   - p1 = (24 * 22! * 3!) / 26!
   - p2 = (23 * 23! * 2!) / 26!

2. To find p1/p2, we can simplify the expression:
   p1/p2 = [(24 * 22! * 3!)/26!] / [(23 * 23! * 2!)/26!]
         = (24 * 22! * 3!) / (23 * 23! * 2!)

3. Simplifying factorials:
   - 23! = 23 * 22!
   - 3! = 6
   - 2! = 2
   So the expression becomes:
   (24 * 22! * 6) / (23 * 23 * 22! * 2) = (24 * 6) / (23 * 23 * 2) = 144 / 1058 = 72/529

4. The ground truth answer is 23, while the proposed answer is 72/529 ≈ 0.1361, which is not equal to 23.
