The problem is to find the natural number n so that 8 + 6 = n + 8. We want to enumerate possible values of n which satisfy 14 = n + 8, so n = 14 - 8 = 6. This is straightforward, but for demonstration, the program will enumerate values of n from 0 to a small limit, check the equation, and print the possible n values.

```python
# Enumerate natural numbers n to find those where 8 + 6 = n + 8
# For n in [0..10], print if 14 == n + 8
def main():
    target = 8 + 6  # 14
    max_n = 10
    candidates = []
    for n in range(max_n + 1):
        if n + 8 == target:
            print(f"n = {n} satisfies 8 + 6 = n + 8")
            candidates.append(n)
    if candidates:
        print(f"Answer (unique) is n = {candidates[0]}")
    else:
        print("No solution found in range.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
