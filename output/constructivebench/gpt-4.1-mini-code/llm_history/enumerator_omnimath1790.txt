The problem asks to find the greatest prime divisor \( p \) of \( 101101101101 \) such that \( p \) is a 4-digit number (between 1000 and 9999). To assist, the program will factorize \( 101101101101 \) (or at least find its prime divisors) in the given range and print all prime divisors found in that range as we find them, then print the greatest prime divisor found in that range.

Since the number is quite large, we use divisibility by concatenation properties or trial division by primes in the range 1000 to 9999.

We will:
- Generate primes between 1000 and 9999 efficiently using a sieve or a prime-check method.
- Check divisibility of \( n = 101101101101 \) by each prime.
- Print each qualifying prime divisor immediately.
- At the end, print the greatest prime divisor found in the range.

```python
# Enumerate prime divisors p of 101101101101 with 1000 <= p <= 9999, p prime and divides n.
# Print all such primes as found, then print the greatest.

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2: return False
    if n % 2 == 0 and n != 2: return False
    r = int(n**0.5)
    for i in range(3, r+1, 2):
        if n % i == 0: return False
    return True

def main():
    n = 101101101101
    low, high = 1000, 9999
    max_prime = None
    for p in range(low, high+1):
        if p % 2 == 0:  # skip even except 2 (none in range)
            continue
        if is_prime(p):
            if n % p == 0:
                print(f"Prime divisor found: {p}")
                if max_prime is None or p > max_prime:
                    max_prime = p
    if max_prime is not None:
        print(f"Greatest prime divisor in [1000..9999]: {max_prime}")
    else:
        print("No prime divisor found in [1000..9999]")

    main()
