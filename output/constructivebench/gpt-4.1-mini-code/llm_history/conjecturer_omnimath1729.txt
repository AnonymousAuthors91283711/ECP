No period candidate found in range p=1..20. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Given the rapid growth and recursive form of a(n), the sequence modulo 2014 does not enter a fixed periodic pattern for small periods (up to 20). The problem implies the minimal such period is large or possibly no finite period exists under the definition of the problem. Since the problem is asking for the least period p, and small p fail, the best closed form is the trivial solution p=2014 (or a multiple) to guarantee periodicity modulo 2014. Thus, conjecture:
