The problem asks to find a 5-element subset s of {1..7} for which there exists another distinct 5-element subset t of {1..7} such that they have the same product, but the parity of their sums differs. The task includes computing the product of s (and t) and identifying omnimath667_answer as that product.

We will enumerate all 5-subsets of {1..7}, compute products and sums, and then look for pairs with equal products but differing sum parity. Whenever we find such a pair, we print the product and the subsets involved. After enumerating, we output the product value itself as the answer candidate.

```python
from itertools import combinations

def even(x): return x % 2 == 0

universe = list(range(1,8))
size = 5

subsets = list(combinations(universe, size))

# Map product -> list of (subset, sum parity)
prod_map = {}

for s in subsets:
    p = 1
    for x in s:
        p *= x
    sm_parity = sum(s) % 2
    if p not in prod_map:
        prod_map[p] = []
    prod_map[p].append( (s, sm_parity) 

    )

# Search for pairs with same product but differing parity
found_products = set()
for p, lst in prod_map.items():
    n = len(lst)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            pi, par_i = lst[i]
            pj, par_j = lst[j]
            if par_i != par_j:
                print(f"Product={p}, subset1={pi}, subset2={pj}, sum_parities=({par_i},{par_j})")
                found_products.add(p)

if found_products:
    # Print minimal product as answer candidate
    ans = min(found_products)
    print(f"omnimath667_answer = {ans}")
else:
    print("No such subsets found.")
```
