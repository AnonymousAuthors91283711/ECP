This problem compares the costs of Susan and Pam buying 20 items with different discounts. We want to find the difference in their costs after applying the discounts.

The cost for each person is:
- Susan: 4 * (20 - 25% of 20) = 4 * (20 - 5) = 4 * 15 = 60
- Pam: 5 * (20 - 30% of 20) = 5 * (20 - 6) = 5 * 14 = 70

The difference Pam - Susan is 70 - 60 = 10.

Let's write a Python program to compute these costs for small sample values and print the difference to verify the pattern.

```python
# Enumerate cost differences with parameters: price per item, quantity, discount%
def compute_cost_difference(price_susan, discount_susan, price_pam, discount_pam, quantity):
    susan_cost = price_susan * (quantity - (quantity * discount_susan / 100))
    pam_cost = price_pam * (quantity - (quantity * discount_pam / 100))
    diff = pam_cost - susan_cost
    print(f"quantity={quantity}, susan_cost={susan_cost}, pam_cost={pam_cost}, diff={diff}")

def main():
    # Sample values given by the problem
    quantity = 20
    price_susan = 4
    discount_susan = 25
    price_pam = 5
    discount_pam = 30

    print("Testing with given problem parameters:")
    compute_cost_difference(price_susan, discount_susan, price_pam, discount_pam, quantity)

    # Try a few other quantities to see pattern
    for q in range(10, 26, 5):
        compute_cost_difference(price_susan, discount_susan, price_pam, discount_pam, q)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
