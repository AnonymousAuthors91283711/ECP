[write_program]
This problem involves summing binomial coefficients modulo 3 and averaging them over \(a, b \in \{0, \dots, 80\}\) with \(b \leq a\). I will write a Python program to:

- Enumerate \(a, b\) in \([0,80]\),
- Compute \(\binom{a}{b} \bmod 3\) efficiently via Lucas' theorem,
- Sum the values where \(b \leq a\),
- Calculate and print the running cumulative sums and averages.

This can help spot patterns and conjecture \(\text{omnimath745_answer}\).

Since the sum is large, the program prints intermediate sums at key steps and the final average.

```python
# Enumerate sums of C(a,b) mod 3 for 0 <= b <= a < 81 and compute average.

def nCr_mod3(n, r):
    # Compute nCr mod 3 using Lucas theorem
    # Convert n,r in base 3
    if r > n:
        return 0
    res = 1
    while n > 0 or r > 0:
        n_i = n % 3
        r_i = r % 3
        if r_i > n_i:
            return 0
        # C(n_i, r_i) mod 3: combin. for small n_i,r_i
        # possible values:
        # C(0,0)=1; C(1,0)=1; C(1,1)=1; C(2,0)=1; C(2,1)=2; C(2,2)=1
        if r_i == 0 or r_i == n_i:
            c = 1
        elif n_i == 2 and r_i == 1:
            c = 2
        else:
            c = 0  # others are zero mod 3
            # Specifically handle C(1,1), C(1,0)
            if n_i == 1 and r_i == 1:
                c = 1
            elif n_i == 1 and r_i == 0:
                c = 1
        if c == 0:
            return 0
        res = (res * c) % 3
        n //= 3
        r //= 3
    return res

def main():
    total = 0
    count = 0
    for a in range(81):
        for b in range(a+1):
            val = nCr_mod3(a,b)
            total += val
            count += 1
            # Print progress every 500 elements
            if count % 500 == 0:
                print(f"Sum after {count} pairs: {total}")
    average = total / count
    print(f"Total sum: {total}, Count: {count}, Average: {average}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
