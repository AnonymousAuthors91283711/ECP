abbrev omnimath513_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath513 :
  tsum (fun (n : {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ (2 * n) ∣ φ n}) => (1 / (n : ℚ))) = omnimath513_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating n with 0 < n and 2n | φ(n), n ≤ 100000
Partial sum up to n=100000 is approximately 0.0000000000. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
<<<0>>>
