This problem involves the Fibonacci sequence defined by F(1) = F(2) = 1, and for n â‰¥ 3, F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2). We want to find the sum of the first 10 Fibonacci numbers under this definition:

Sum = F(1) + F(2) + ... + F(10)

The Python program below computes and prints each Fibonacci number from n=1 to 10 and maintains a running sum, printing the partial sums as well. Finally, it prints the total sum, which corresponds to the P2024AMCB_18_answer.

```python
# Enumerate F(1) to F(10) for Fibonacci sequence where F(1)=F(2)=1
def fib(n):
    if n == 1 or n == 2:
        return 1
    a, b = 1, 1
    for _ in range(3, n + 1):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return b

total = 0
print("n | F(n) | partial sum")
for n in range(1, 11):
    fn = fib(n)
    total += fn
    print(f"{n} | {fn} | {total}")

print("\nSum of F(1) to F(10) =", total)
```
