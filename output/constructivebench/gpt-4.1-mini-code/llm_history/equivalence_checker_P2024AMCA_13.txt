Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: (-1 / 2, Real.exp (1 / 2) + Real.exp (1 / 2) - 2)
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer (-1/2, exp(1/2) + exp(1/2) - 2) is mostly correct but has some issues:
1. The x-coordinate (-1/2) is correct for the symmetry point 'a'
2. The y-coordinate calculation is incorrect - it should be f(-1) = exp(0) + exp(1) - 2 = 1 + e - 2 ≈ e - 1, not exp(1/2) + exp(1/2) - 2
3. The answer format should be a pair (x, f(x)) where x = 2a - (-1) = 0, not directly (a, f(a))

The proposed answer gets the symmetry point correct but miscalculates the function value and presents it in the wrong format.
