The problem is to solve for all real \( x \) such that

\[
2 + \sqrt{x - 2} = x - 2.
\]

We'll enumerate values of \( x \) starting from 2 (since \( x - 2 \geq 0 \)) to find such solutions exactly.

```python
import math

# Enumerate candidate x values where sqrt(x-2) is defined (x >= 2).
# We'll check integer values and some rationals around those.
# Equation: 2 + sqrt(x-2) = x - 2
# rearranged: sqrt(x-2) = x - 4
# Both sides must be >= 0, so x - 4 >= 0 => x >= 4.

print("Enumerating candidates for x where 2 + sqrt(x-2) = x - 2:")

# We'll check for x from 2 to 10 in steps of 0.1 to find approximate roots,
# then calculate exact for integer candidates for possible exact solution.

candidates = []
step = 0.1
x = 2.0
while x <= 10.0:
    left = 2 + math.sqrt(x - 2)
    right = x - 2
    if abs(left - right) < 1e-9:
        print(f"x = {x:.1f} approximately satisfies the equation.")
        candidates.append(x)
    x += step

# Also check exact integer candidates from 4 to 10:
for x_int in range(4, 11):
    left = 2 + math.sqrt(x_int - 2)
    right = x_int - 2
    if abs(left - right) < 1e-15:
        print(f"x = {x_int} exactly satisfies the equation.")

# Derivation suggests to try x=4:
# sqrt(4-2) = sqrt(2) ~ 1.414, RHS=4-2=2, LHS=2 + 1.414=3.414 ≠ 2
# Try x=5:
# sqrt(3) ~1.732, RHS=3, LHS=3.732 ≠ 3
# Try x=6:
# sqrt(4)=2, RHS=4, LHS=4 ≈ 4 ✓
print("Confirmed solution: x = 6")

# The equation reduces to sqrt(x-2)=x-4, so x-4 >=0 => x >=4
# Then square both sides:
# x-2 = (x-4)^2 = x^2 - 8x +16
# x^2 -9x +18=0
# Solve quadratic:
D = 81 - 72
sqrtD = math.sqrt(D)
root1 = (9 - sqrtD) / 2
root2 = (9 + sqrtD) / 2
print(f"Quadratic roots: x = {root1}, x = {root2}")

# Check if roots satisfy sqrt domain and original equation:
for r in (root1, root2):
    if r >= 2:
        lhs = 2 + math.sqrt(r - 2)
        rhs = r - 2
        if abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-12:
            print(f"x = {r} exactly satisfies the equation.")

```
