abbrev omnimath226_answer : ℚ → ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath226 (f : ℚ → ℚ) (hpos : ∀ x : ℚ, 0 < x → 0 < f x) :
  (∀ x y : ℚ, 0 < x → 0 < y → f x + f y + 2 * x * y * f (x * y) = f (x * y) / f (x + y)) ↔ f = omnimath226_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing candidate functions for f:
f(t) = 1 / t^2 passes for all tested points. Expected Answer Type: ℚ → ℚ
<<<fun x : ℚ => 1 / (x * x)>>>
