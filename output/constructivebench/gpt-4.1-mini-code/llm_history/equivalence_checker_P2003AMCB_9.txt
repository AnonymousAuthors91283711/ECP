Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: 30
Since the problem involves finding the difference \( f(12) - f(2) \) for a linear function \( f(x) = m x + b \) given that \( f(6) - f(2) = 12 \), we can proceed as follows:

1. Compute \( f(6) - f(2) = (6m + b) - (2m + b) = 4m = 12 \), which implies \( m = 3 \).
2. Then, \( f(12) - f(2) = (12m + b) - (2m + b) = 10m = 30 \).

The proposed answer is \( 30 \), which matches the result derived from the given conditions.
