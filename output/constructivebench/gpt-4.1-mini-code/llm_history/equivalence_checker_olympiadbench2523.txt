Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {(0, 0), (0, 5 / 2), (1 / 2, 0), (-1 / 2, 0), (3 / 2, 4), (-1, 3 / 2)}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer lists several points that satisfy the given equations, but it's not a complete solution. The system of equations describes all pairs (x,y) where either x=0 or (1/2 + y - 2x²)=0, and either y=0 or (5/2 + x - y)=0. The proposed answer correctly identifies some solutions but misses others (like when both x=0 and y=0, which is included, but also other combinations where one factor is zero and the other equation's solution is considered). The answer is "Close" because it captures some correct solutions but isn't exhaustive.
