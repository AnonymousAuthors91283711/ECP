[write_program]
The problem statement is not fully given, but from the context (2020 AMCB Problem 6) it likely involves a property or condition on natural numbers \( n \geq 9 \). Since the exact definitions are missing, I will write a template Python enumerator that for \( n \) from 9 to 20 (sample small values), tries to find or verify some property or outputs some candidate values for each \( n \).

This enumerator can be adapted once the property is specified: it will print \( n \) and some conjectured outputs or values related to \( n \), helping in conjecturing a pattern or formula.

```python
# Enumerating n values from 9 to 20 for the problem P2020AMCB_6
# For each n, print n and a placeholder property or computed value.
# Replace 'property_or_value' computation with actual logic when known.

def property_or_value(n):
    # Placeholder: for example, print n and sum of digits as sample property.
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

def main():
    print("Enumerating values of n in [9..20] and some properties to conjecture patterns:")
    for n in range(9, 21):
        val = property_or_value(n)
        print(f"n = {n}, property = {val}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
