abbrev omnimath2831_answer : ℤ := sorry
theorem omnimath2831 (b : ℤ) (h : 3 ≠ b) : 
  (3 + b) / (3 - b) = -4 ↔ b = omnimath2831_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating integer values of b for (3+b)/(3-b) = -4, b != 3:
b = 5 satisfies (3+b)/(3-b) = -4
Minimum and maximum values found:
Answer candidate: b = 5
Extremal answer: b = 5. Expected Answer Type: ℤ
<<<5>>>
