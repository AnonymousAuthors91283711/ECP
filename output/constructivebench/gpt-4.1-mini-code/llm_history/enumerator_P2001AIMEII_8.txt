The problem involves a function \( f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) with the property \( f(3x) = 3f(x) \) for \( x > 0 \), and \( f \) is defined explicitly on the interval \([1,3]\) by \( f(x) = 1 - |x-2| \). The question is about the smallest positive \( x \) such that \( f(x) = f(2001) \).

To explore this:

- We'll first compute \( f(2001) \) by using the functional equation recursively to map 2001 into \([1,3]\).
- Then, to find all \( x > 0 \) for which \( f(x) = f(2001) \), we note \( f(3x) = 3 f(x) \), so \( f(x) \) behaves like a function with a scaling property.
- We can attempt to express candidate \( x \) as \( 3^k y \) with \( y \in [1,3] \), since \( f(x) \) can be recreated from \( f(y) \) by scaling.
- Then for each \( y \in [1,3] \), \( f(y) = 1 - |y - 2| \), and \( f(3^k y) = 3^k f(y) \).
- Since \( f(2001) \) is known, find \( y, k \) such that \( f(2001) = f(3^k y) = 3^k f(y) \).
- Because \( f(y) \leqslant 1 \), and \( f(2001) \) computed, iterate small \( k \in \mathbb{Z} \) and \( y \in [1,3] \) to find \( x=3^k y \) with \( f(x)=f(2001) \).
- Finally, identify the smallest positive such \( x \).

This Python code enumerates candidates for \( k \) in a small range and \( y \) sampled in \([1,3]\) with a fine grid, prints values as it finds matches (within a small epsilon), and outputs the minimal candidate found.

```python
# Enumerate values x = 3^k * y, y in [1,3], k in a range,
# find those x with f(x) = f(2001).
# Here f(3x) = 3 f(x), f on [1,3]: f(y) = 1 - |y - 2|
# So f(x) = 3^k * f(y)
# Goal: find x > 0 with f(x) = f(2001), minimal such x.

        diff = 1 - target_fy
