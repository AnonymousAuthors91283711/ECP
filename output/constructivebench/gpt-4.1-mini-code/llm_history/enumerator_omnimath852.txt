The problem is about finding positive integers a, b, c, d such that the set {a*b, b*c, c*d, d*a} equals {64, 88, 120, 165}. We want all quadruples (a, b, c, d) matching this property and then the common value of a + b + c + d (which must be the same for all such quadruples).

We will enumerate positive integers a, b, c, d up to a reasonable limit and test these conditions. When we find a match, we print it immediately. We also keep track of sums and verify if all sums are equal.

Since the products are fixed, it's efficient to consider the four products and try to factor them into edges of a quadrilateral, where edges are a,b,c,d and products of adjacent edges are in the set. The biggest product is 165, so max edge might be around sqrt(165) ~ 12-13.

Let's try all quadruples where each edge is from 1 to 20 (to be safe and limit computations), and check the condition that the multiset of {a*b, b*c, c*d, d*a} equals {64, 88, 120, 165}.

We print all quadruples that satisfy this immediately. Then output the minimal sum found (and verify if all sums are equal).

```python
# Enumerate positive integers a,b,c,d up to 20, checking if {a*b,b*c,c*d,d*a}=={64,88,120,165}

products = {64, 88, 120, 165}
max_edge = 20

found_sums = set()

for a in range(1, max_edge+1):
    for b in range(1, max_edge+1):
        ab = a*b
        if ab not in products:
            continue
        for c in range(1, max_edge+1):
            bc = b*c
            if bc not in products:
                continue
            for d in range(1, max_edge+1):
                cd = c*d
                da = d*a
                prods = {ab, bc, cd, da}
                if prods == products:
                    s = a+b+c+d
                    found_sums.add(s)
                    print(f"Found quadruple a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}, sum={s}, products={sorted([ab,bc,cd,da])}")

if found_sums:
    min_sum = min(found_sums)
    max_sum = max(found_sums)
    print(f"Distinct sums found: {sorted(found_sums)}")
    print(f"Minimal sum = {min_sum}, maximal sum = {max_sum}")
else:
    print("No quadruple found")
```
