The problem involves summing a bitwise-xor-like operation (not standard ^, but `^^^`) over a large range \( k = 0 \) to \( 2^{2014} - 1 \). Since \(2^{2014}\) is huge, directly computing is impossible. Also, the expression \(k \, ^^^ \, (k / 2)\) suggests a relationship between \(k\) and its half in terms of bits.

To get insight, let's try smaller values of \(n\) instead of \(2014\), say \(n=3\), and compute 
\[
S(n) = \sum_{k=0}^{2^n - 1} (k \, ^^^ \, \lfloor k/2 \rfloor).
\]

We'll implement `^^^` as bitwise XOR in Python, and enumerate for small \(n\) to find a pattern of \(S(n)\).

```python
# Enumerate sums S(n) = sum_{k=0}^{2^n -1} k ^ (k//2)
# for small n to conjecture formula or values.

def enumerator():
    print("Enumerating S(n) = sum_{k=0}^{2^n - 1} k ^ (k//2) for n=1 to 10")
    for n in range(1, 11):
        limit = 2 ** n
        total = 0
        for k in range(limit):
            val = k ^ (k // 2)
            total += val
        print(f"n={n}, S(n)={total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    enumerator()
```
