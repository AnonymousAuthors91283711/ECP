Ground Truth Answer: 4 * π^2 - 1
Proposed Answer: Real.pi ^ 2 + 8 * Real.pi + 15
Let's analyze the problem and the answers carefully.

1. We have g(x) = 2x - 4, which is bijective (as given)
2. The condition given is g(f(g⁻¹(x))) = 2x² + 16x + 26
3. To find f(π), we need to:
   - Find g⁻¹ (the inverse of g)
   - Express f in terms of g and the right-hand side
   - Evaluate at π

First, find g⁻¹(x):
g(y) = x ⇒ 2y - 4 = x ⇒ y = (x + 4)/2

Now, the condition becomes:
g(f(g⁻¹(x))) = 2x² + 16x + 26
⇒ 2f(g⁻¹(x)) - 4 = 2x² + 16x + 26
⇒ f(g⁻¹(x)) = x² + 8x + 15

Now to find f(π), we need to find y such that g⁻¹(y) = π
⇒ (y + 4)/2 = π ⇒ y = 2π - 4

Thus:
f(π) = (2π - 4)² + 8(2π - 4) + 15
= 4π² - 16π + 16 + 16π - 32 + 15
= 4π² - 1

The ground truth answer is 4π² - 1, while the proposed answer is π² + 8π + 15. These are clearly different expressions.
