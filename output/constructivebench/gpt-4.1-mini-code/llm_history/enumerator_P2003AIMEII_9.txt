The problem asks to find the sum of \(P(z_i)\) where \(z_i\) are roots of \(Q(x) = x^4 - x^3 - x^2 - 1\), and \(P(x) = x^6 - x^5 - x^3 - x^2 - x\). Since the roots are real or complex numbers, we will numerically approximate roots of \(Q\), then compute \(P\) at each root, and sum these values.

We will enumerate the roots, print each root and its \(P\)-value, then print the sum. This helps conjecture the exact answer.

```python
import numpy as np

# Define polynomials
def Q(x):
    return x**4 - x**3 - x**2 - 1

def P(x):
    return x**6 - x**5 - x**3 - x**2 - x

# Find roots of Q using numpy (coefficients in descending order)
coeff_Q = [1, -1, -1, 0, -1]
roots = np.roots(coeff_Q)

print("Roots of Q(x):")
for i, r in enumerate(roots):
    print(f"z[{i}] ≈ {r} (Q(z[{i}]) ≈ {Q(r)})")

# Evaluate P at each root and print
values = []
print("\nEvaluating P at each root:")
for i, r in enumerate(roots):
    val = P(r)
    values.append(val)
    print(f"P(z[{i}]) ≈ {val}")

# Sum of P(z_i)
total = sum(values)
print("\nSum of P(z_i) for i=0..3:")
print(total)
```
