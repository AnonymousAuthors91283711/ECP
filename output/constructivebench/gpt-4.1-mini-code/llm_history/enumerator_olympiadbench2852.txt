This problem asks for the minimal natural number \( k \) with \( k \geq 3 \) such that the set
\[
\{ x : \mathrm{Fin}\ k \to \mathbb{R} \mid \forall i, \prod_j x_j = (x_i)^2 \}
\]
has at least 2009 elements.

To help conjecture the answer, I will enumerate possible values of \( k \) starting at 3, compute or count the cardinality of the set for each \( k \), and print \( k \) and the cardinality each time. Since the problem involves the set of tuples from \( \mathbb{R}^k \) satisfying constraints, to enumerate exactly is impossible, but we can analyze the equations.

Note that
\[
\forall i, \prod_j x_j = (x_i)^2.
\]
If the product is zero, then \( x_i = 0 \) for all \( i \), which yields the zero tuple. Also, if it's nonzero, for each \( i \), \( \prod_j x_j = (x_i)^2 \) implies all \( x_i^2 \) are equal, so all \( |x_i| \) equal the same \( r \) and the product equals \( r^k \), but also \( \prod_j x_j = r^k = (x_i)^2 = r^2 \), so \( r^k = r^2 \Rightarrow r^{k-2} = 1 \). Thus \( r = 1 \) or \( r=0 \) (can't be zero here since product nonzero). So all \( |x_i| = 1 \). With signs, we get a discrete set.

I will enumerate all sign vectors of length \( k \) with product equals \( x_i^2 = 1 \), i.e. \( \pm 1 \) entries such that product equals 1 (or equal to square of any coordinate). From the constraint, possibly there are exactly 2 solutions (all 1s or all -1s) for some \( k \) or more generally, explore.

To keep the output short, I will check \( k = 3,4,5,6,7 \). For each, I will compute the number of solutions \( x \in \{0, \pm 1\}^k \) satisfying the condition and also the zero solution.

We'll print the \( k \) and cardinality found for these discrete approximations, which may help identify a pattern.

```python
# We approximate the problem by considering solutions x in {-1,0,1}^k satisfying:
# For all i, product(x) = (x_i)^2
# product(x) = 0 -> x_i = 0 for all i -> only zero vector
# If product(x) != 0, then product(x) = (x_i)^2 = 1, and all |x_i| =1 and product of all x_i =1
# So solutions consist of the zero vector plus all sign vectors of length k with product=1.

def count_solutions(k):
    # zero vector
    total = 1
    # count sign vectors with product 1
    # number of sign vectors of length k: 2^k
    # product is product of signs: product = (-1)^{number_of_negatives}
    # product=1 iff number_of_negatives is even.
    sign_vectors = 2 ** (k -1)  # half of 2^k have even number of negatives
    total += sign_vectors
    return total

target = 2009
print(f"Checking values of k starting at 3 to find cardinality >= {target}")
for k in range(3, 20):
    c = count_solutions(k)
    print(f"k={k}, |S_k|={c}")
    if c >= target:
        print(f"Minimum k with card >= {target} is {k}")
        break
```
