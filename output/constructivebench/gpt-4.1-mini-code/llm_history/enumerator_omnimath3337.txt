To understand the behavior of the expression \( x = \sqrt[3]{2 + \sqrt{5}} + \sqrt[3]{2 - \sqrt{5}} \), we can evaluate it numerically and check for patterns or algebraic simplifications. The program below computes the value for the given expression and also tests simple nearby values (like integers) to conjecture that it could be a simple algebraic number.

```python
# Enumerate values of x = (2 + sqrt(5))^(1/3) + (2 - sqrt(5))^(1/3)
# and investigate possible simple exact forms.

import math

def cube_root(y):
    # Handle cube root preserving sign
    if y >= 0:
        return y ** (1/3)
    else:
        return -(-y) ** (1/3)

sqrt5 = math.sqrt(5)
a = 2 + sqrt5
b = 2 - sqrt5

x = cube_root(a) + cube_root(b)
print(f"x ≈ {x}")

# Since the expression resembles a = u + v where u^3 + v^3 = 4 and uv = 1,
# test small integers for cube root sums:

for candidate in [1, 2, 3]:
    diff = abs(x - candidate)
    print(f"Difference from {candidate}: {diff}")

# Additional checks: cube x and see if it aligns with expected relations
x_cubed = x ** 3
print(f"x^3 ≈ {x_cubed}")

# From the relation: 
# Let u = cube_root(a), v = cube_root(b)
# u^3 + v^3 = a + b = 4
# and uv = cube_root(ab) = cube_root((2 + sqrt(5))(2 - sqrt(5))) = cube_root(4 - 5) = cube_root(-1) = -1
# Then (u+v)^3 = u^3 + v^3 + 3uv(u+v) = 4 + 3*(-1)*x = 4 - 3x
print(f"Check: x^3 + 3x ≈ 4 -> {x_cubed + 3*x}")

# This suggests x solves x^3 + 3x - 4 = 0

# Print roots of this cubic equation for verification (exact or approximate)
# Rational root theorem candidates: ±1, ±2, ±4
for r in [1, 2, 4, -1, -2, -4]:
    val = r ** 3 + 3*r - 4
    print(f"Polynomial({r}) = {val}")
```
