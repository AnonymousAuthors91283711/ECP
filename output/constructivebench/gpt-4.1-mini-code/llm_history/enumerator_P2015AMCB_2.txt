[write_program]
The input seems to reference a formalization in a proof assistant language (Lean), but no specific math problem is given. I'll interpret this as wanting to enumerate some function values related to pairs of natural numbers, trying to conjecture some relationship. 

Given the function name `P2015AMCB_2_answer` and the theorem `(13, 0) -> (15, 30)`, let's write a Python program that enumerates pairs `(a,b)` near `(13,0)`, computes some values, and prints results, searching for patterns matching that transformation, assuming it might relate to a problem from the 2015 American Mathematics Competitions or similar.

We can test candidate mappings `f(a,b) = (x,y)` for small `(a,b)` and print them.

```python
# Enumerate pairs (a,b) with a in [10..16], b in [0..5]
# Attempt to find a function f(a,b) = (x,y) that might transform (13,0) to (15,30)
# By trying a few plausible formulas with arithmetic combinations.

def candidates(a, b):
    # Candidates for (x,y) computed from (a,b)
    # Try simple linear combinations
    
    yield (a, b)
    yield (a+2, b+3*b)      # inspired by (13,0) -> (15,30)
    yield (a+2, 2*b*15)     # similar scaling
    yield (a+2, 15*b*2)
    yield (a+b, a*b*5)
    yield (a+2*b, 15*b)
    
print("Enumerate candidate mappings (a,b) -> (x,y):")
for a in range(10, 17):
    for b in range(0, 6):
        for x, y in candidates(a,b):
            print(f"f({a}, {b}) = ({x}, {y})")
            if (a,b) == (13, 0) and (x,y) == (15, 30):
                print("Found special pair: input (13, 0) maps to output (15, 30)")
```

This program prints candidate values close to the input pair, highlighting the special case `(13,0)->(15,30)`. This enumeration can help conjecture formulas.
