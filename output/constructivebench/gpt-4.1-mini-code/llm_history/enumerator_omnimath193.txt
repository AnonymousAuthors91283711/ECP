The problem concerns pairs of natural numbers \((m,n)\) that satisfy:
- \(\gcd(m,n) = 1\),
- \(m\) odd,
- \(n\) odd,
- and their sum is a power of two.

We want to enumerate such pairs for small values to understand their structure.

Key observations:
- Both \(m\) and \(n\) are odd, so their sum \(m+n\) is even.
- The sum \(m+n\) must be a power of two.
- The gcd condition is essential.

We'll enumerate pairs \((m,n)\) with \(1 \leq m \leq n \leq N\) for some small \(N\), checking these conditions. For each found pair, print the pair and the power \(k\) with \(m+n=2^k\).

```python
# Enumerate pairs (m,n), m,n odd, coprime, sum power of two
from math import gcd, log2

def is_power_of_two(x):
    return x & (x - 1) == 0 and x != 0

N = 31  # Small bound for enumeration, adjust if needed

for s in (2**k for k in range(2, 11)):  # sum = 4,8,...,1024
    # m and n odd, coprime, m+n=s
    # m in [1,s-1], odd
    # n = s - m, must be odd
    for m in range(1, s//2+1, 2):
        n = s - m
        if n < m:
            # avoid duplicates since pairs are unordered
            continue
        if n % 2 == 1 and gcd(m, n) == 1:
            print(f"m={m}, n={n}, sum=2^{int(log2(s))}={s}, gcd=1")

# This enumerates pairs fulfilling all conditions for sums up to 1024,
# printing each immediately upon finding.
```
