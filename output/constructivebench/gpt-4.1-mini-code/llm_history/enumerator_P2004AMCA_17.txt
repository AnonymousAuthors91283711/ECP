The problem defines a function \( f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \) with:
- \( f(1) = 1 \)
- \( f(2n) = n \cdot f(n) \) for all \( n \).

We want to understand \( f(2^{100}) \).

Let's enumerate \( f(2^k) \) for small \( k \) and try to detect a pattern or formulate a candidate closed form \( P2004AMCA_17\_answer(k) \). The recursion relates \( f(2n) \) to \( f(n) \), so writing down terms for powers of two helps.

```python
# Enumerate f(2^k) using the recursion, print all values found immediately.
def f_power_of_2(k):
    if k == 0:
        return 1  # f(1)=1
    else:
        n = 2**(k-1)
        return n * f_power_of_2(k-1)

# Enumerate and print f(2^k) for k=0..15 to find a pattern:
for k in range(16):
    val = f_power_of_2(k)
    print(f"f(2^{k}) = {val}")
```
