The problem deals with counting pairs of divisors of \(2010^2\), splitting divisors into squares and non-squares, and finding a probability expressed as a reduced fraction \(\frac{m}{n}\) with \(m+n=97\). We want to enumerate divisors of \(2010^2\), separate square and non-square divisors, compute counts, compute the fraction \( \frac{\text{favorable_pairs}}{\text{total_pairs}} \), reduce it, and check for \(m+n=97\).

We will:
- Factor 2010, get its prime powers in \(2010^2\).
- Generate divisor exponents.
- Identify square divisors (all exponent must be even).
- Count total divisors, total pairs, square & non-square divisor counts.
- Compute the fraction and reduce it.
- Print candidates with sum of numerator and denominator up to 100 to conjecture the answer.

        while x % i == 0:
            factors[i] = factors.get(i,0)+1
            x //= i
