Ground Truth Answer: (π - 2)/4
Proposed Answer: (4 - π) / 4
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the area of a specific region within the unit square [0,1]×[0,1] where:
   - a + b > 1
   - And one of three conditions holds regarding a² + b² relationships

2. The ground truth answer is (π - 2)/4, which comes from:
   - The area satisfying a + b > 1 and a² + b² < 1 is a quarter circle minus a triangle (π/4 - 1/2)
   - The other two conditions (a² + 1 < b² and b² + 1 < a²) don't contribute any area within [0,1]×[0,1]
   - So total area is π/4 - 1/2 = (π - 2)/4

3. The proposed answer is (4 - π)/4, which equals 1 - π/4
   - This would be the area of the square not covered by the quarter circle
   - But this doesn't match the problem's conditions

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
- It gives the complement of what was asked for
- It doesn't account for the a + b > 1 condition
- The numerical value would be different (about 0.2146 vs the correct 0.2854)

<<<False>>>
