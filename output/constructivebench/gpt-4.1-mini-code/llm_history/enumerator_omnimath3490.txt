The problem references some natural number \( n \) (fixed to 7 here) and asks about the parity (evenness) of certain expressions involving \( n \) and a mysterious function omnimath3490_answer. The theorem states that omnimath3490_answer(7) is even while several other expressions involving \( n = 7 \) are odd.

To assist in reasoning about this, we can write a Python program that:

- Fixes \( n=7 \)
- Tests various values for omnimath3490_answer(n) for small natural numbers, checking the parity conditions:
  - omnimath3490_answer(n) is even
  - 9 * n is odd
  - n + 8 is odd
  - n^2 is odd
  - n * (n - 2) is odd
- Prints candidates for omnimath3490_answer(7) that satisfy the first condition (even)

Because 9*7=63 (odd), 7+8=15 (odd), 7^2=49 (odd), and 7*(7-2)=7*5=35 (odd), the conditions given are consistent.

Our program can test omnimath3490_answer(7) over a range (say from 0 to 50), check if it's even, and print candidates.

```python
# Enumerate even values for omnimath3490_answer(7)
# Confirm 9*7, 7+8, 7^2, 7*(7-2) are odd as the problem states.

def is_even(x):
    return x % 2 == 0

n = 7
vals_to_test = range(0, 51)

print(f"Testing omnimath3490_answer({n}) in {vals_to_test.start}..{vals_to_test.stop-1}")

# Precompute parity of other expressions
nine_n_even = is_even(9 * n)
n_plus_8_even = is_even(n + 8)
n_sq_even = is_even(n ** 2)
n_nminus2_even = is_even(n * (n - 2))

print(f"9*{n} even? {nine_n_even}")
print(f"{n}+8 even? {n_plus_8_even}")
print(f"{n}^2 even? {n_sq_even}")
print(f"{n}*({n}-2) even? {n_nminus2_even}")

print("Candidates for omnimath3490_answer(7) that are even:")
for candidate in vals_to_test:
    if is_even(candidate):
        print(candidate)
# Since the problem asks "Even(omnimath3490_answer n)" only, this enumeration suffices.
```
