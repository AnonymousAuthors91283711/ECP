. Enumerated answers: Enumerating cos^3(theta) for theta = 2pi/7, 4pi/7, 8pi/7:
cos(0.89760) = 0.6234898019, cos^3 = 0.2423751344
cos(1.79520) = -0.2225209340, cos^3 = -0.0110182500
cos(3.59039) = -0.9009688679, cos^3 = -0.7313568844
Sum: -0.5000000000

Cos and cos^3 for k=1 to 6 times 2pi/7:
k=1, angle=0.89760, cos=0.6234898019, cos^3=0.2423751344
k=2, angle=1.79520, cos=-0.2225209340, cos^3=-0.0110182500
k=3, angle=2.69279, cos=-0.9009688679, cos^3=-0.7313568844
k=4, angle=3.59039, cos=-0.9009688679, cos^3=-0.7313568844
k=5, angle=4.48799, cos=-0.2225209340, cos^3=-0.0110182500
k=6, angle=5.38559, cos=0.6234898019, cos^3=0.2423751344

Sum of all cos^3(k*2pi/7), k=1..6:
-1.0000000000. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<-(1/2)>>>
Explanation: The sum of cos^3(2π/7) + cos^3(4π/7) + cos^3(8π/7) numerically approximates to -0.5, which is exactly -(1/2). This is a known trigonometric identity related to the seventh roots of unity.
