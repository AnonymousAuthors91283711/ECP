The problem asks for the smallest number \( k \) such that for every function \( x: \text{Fin } 2022 \to \mathbb{R} \), there exist \( k \) essentially increasing functions \( f_i \) with the property that for each \( n \), the sum over \( i \) of \( f_i(x_n) = x_n \).

We want to enumerate candidate values of \( k \) and verify for small sets of points whether such a representation is possible.

The key challenge is to enumerate \( k \) and finite sequences \( x_n \), then attempt to express each \( x_n \) as sums of values of essentially increasing functions evaluated at \( x_n \).

Rather than full generality (which is large), we will:
- Select small sample values for the domain size (e.g., n â‰¤ 5).
- Enumerate candidate k from 1 to a small upper bound (e.g., 5).
- Try basic monotone functions since essentially increasing functions are monotone and never zero at any sample points.
- Attempt to see if the identity function on the sample points can be decomposed as sums of such functions.

We print \( k \) tried and any successful decompositions found.

This does not prove or disprove the minimum \( k \) in general but may help conjecture.

# Essentially Increasing = monotone non-decreasing functions excluding zero values at points
# For enumeration, we pick sample domain: finite set of real points, say x = [1,2,3,4,5]
# We want to see if functions f_i: x -> R can be chosen monotone (non-decreasing on samples),
# sum over i of f_i(x_n) = x_n for all n.

# Enumerate candidate k from 1 to max_k
# For each k, enumerate all possible monotone sequences f_i over the sample x for each i,
# sum f_i(n) over i, and check if equal to x_n.

# To keep complexity low, we discretize function values to small integer ranges (e.g. 0 to 5)
# Ensure no zero values on points (f_i(x_n) != 0), else skip

# Print found decompositions when sums match identity
