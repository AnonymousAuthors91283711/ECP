This problem concerns representing a natural number \( p \) as \( p = x^2 + 3y^2 \) for integers \( x, y \). We want to enumerate such representations for sample \( p \) values, printing each representation found. We'll test small \( p \) values and output all \( (x,y) \) pairs satisfying \( p = x^2 + 3y^2 \).

```python
# Enumerate representations of p = x^2 + 3*y^2 for p in [1..50]
# Print all found solutions immediately
# x,y are integers, so we check in range -m..m for suitable m

MAX_P = 50

for p in range(1, MAX_P+1):
    found = False
    limit = int(p**0.5) + 1  # upper bound for |x| and |y|
    print(f"p = {p}:")
    for y in range(-limit, limit+1):
        y_contrib = 3 * y * y
        if y_contrib > p:
            continue
        for x in range(-limit, limit+1):
            if x*x + y_contrib == p:
                print(f"  x={x}, y={y}")
                found = True
    if not found:
        print("  no representation")
```
