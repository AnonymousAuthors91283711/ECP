The problem relates to a polynomial 
p = product_{k=1}^{32} (1 - X^k)^{e_k} 
with integer exponents e_k ≥ 0, and coefficients of powers of X. The conditions are:
- The coefficient of X^1 is -2
- The coefficients of X^i are 0 for i = 2,...,32
We want to enumerate possible exponent tuples (e_1,...,e_32) that satisfy these conditions and identify the value of f' = e_32, or find candidates for it.

We'll try small values e_k ∈ {0,1} for k=1..5 to keep complexity manageable, since full search is huge. Enumerate possible exponents, compute polynomial using sympy, and check coefficients up to degree 32.

Print all candidate vectors and f' found. This will aid conjecturing the true value.

```python
import sympy as sp
X = sp.symbols('X')

# max exponent to consider on each factor
max_exp = 1  # only consider 0 or 1 exponent to limit complexity
# factors from 1 to 6 for demonstration (32 is too large)
N = 6

# store candidate solutions as tuples of exponents
from itertools import product

def coeffs_of_poly(p, max_deg):
    # returns coeff dict of p upto max_deg (or 0 if not present)
    c = {}
    for i in range(max_deg+1):
        c[i] = p.coeff(X, i)
    return c

print("Enumerating exponents e_1..e_6 in {0,1} ...")

for exps in product(range(max_exp+1), repeat=N):
    # build polynomial p = prod (1 - X^k)^{e_k}
    p = 1
    for k,e_k in enumerate(exps, 1):
        p *= (1 - X**k)**e_k
    # get coeff for 1 and 2..32
    c = coeffs_of_poly(p, 32)
    if c[1] == -2 and all(c[i] == 0 for i in range(2,33)):
        print(f"Candidate exponents (for k=1..6): {exps}, f' (e_32) assumed 0")
        # we only considered k=1..6 here, so e_32=f' not included, assume 0 for now

print("Try to include (1 - X^32)^f' with f'=0..2 for each candidate above.")

# We try to guess how adding (1 - X^32)^f' affects coeff 1 and coeffs 2..32.
# For simplicity, try f'=0,1,2 with exps being zero except last factor.

for fprime in range(3):
    p = (1 - X**32)**fprime
    c = coeffs_of_poly(p, 32)
    if c[1] == -2 and all(c[i] == 0 for i in range(2,33)):
        print(f"Candidate with only (1 - X^32)^{fprime}")
print("Enumeration done.")
