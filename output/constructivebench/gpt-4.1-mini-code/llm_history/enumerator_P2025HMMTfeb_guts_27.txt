[write_program]
We are given a recursively defined function f on natural numbers, with f(0) = 0 and for m > 0:  
f(m) = f(m//2) + (m//2 + 1)^2, where // is integer division.

The problem is to evaluate the sum over m=1 to 31 of f(m) / (m(m+1)).

To assist in conjecturing the exact answer for  
\(\sum_{m=1}^{31} \frac{f(m)}{m(m+1)}\),  
we will implement f and enumerate terms to print their values immediately.

We try small values for m=1..31 and print partial sums, hoping to detect a pattern.

The program uses exact fractions from fractions.Fraction to maintain precision.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# f defined recursively with memoization
memo = {0:0}
def f(m):
    if m in memo:
        return memo[m]
    half = m // 2
    val = f(half) + (half + 1)**2
    memo[m] = val
    return val

total = Fraction(0,1)
print("m, f(m), term = f(m)/[m(m+1)], partial sum")
for m in range(1, 32):
    fm = f(m)
    denom = m*(m+1)
    term = Fraction(fm, denom)
    total += term
    print(f"{m}, {fm}, {term}, {total}")

print("\nSum from m=1 to 31 is", total)
```
