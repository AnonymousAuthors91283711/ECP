The problem asks to count bijections from {0,...,5} to itself satisfying a certain property related to partial indices k in {0,...,4}. Specifically, for each k in 0 to 4, there exists i < k such that f(i) > k.

I will interpret the problem as enumerating permutations f of length 6, where for each k=0..4, âˆƒ i<k such that f(i) > k.

We enumerate all permutations of {0,...,5} and count those satisfying the condition. We print each such permutation as we find it.

Finally, we print the total count as the answer.

```python
from itertools import permutations

def check_condition(p):
    # p is a tuple representing f with domain {0,...,5}
    # For each k in 0..4, check if exists i<k with p[i] > k
    for k in range(5):
        if not any(p[i] > k for i in range(k)):
            return False
    return True

count = 0
for perm in permutations(range(6)):
    if check_condition(perm):
        print(f"Valid permutation: {perm}")
        count += 1

print("Total count of valid permutations:", count)
```
