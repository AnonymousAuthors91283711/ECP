The problem involves integers totalStudents, seniorsAvg, overallAvg with constraints, and a combinational identity relating these averages and counts. We want to enumerate possible values of juniors' average (P2007AMCB_12_answer) given the constraints.

Approach:
- totalStudents is divisible by 10.
- juniorsCount = totalStudents/10.
- seniorsCount = 9*totalStudents/10.
- seniorsAvg * seniorsCount ≤ overallAvg * totalStudents (from inequality).
- overallAvg * totalStudents = seniorsAvg * seniorsCount + P2007AMCB_12_answer * juniorsCount
- P2007AMCB_12_answer = (overallAvg * totalStudents - seniorsAvg * seniorsCount) / juniorsCount

We enumerate small totalStudents divisible by 10, and reasonable overallAvg, seniorsAvg, for plausible values. juniorsAvg must be integer and ≥ 0.

We will print the parameters and all valid juniorsAvg values found, with constraints satisfied.

```python
# Enumerate possible juniorsAvg for sample parameters, given integer constraints and conditions.
def enumerate_juniorsavg(max_total=50):
    print("totalStudents seniorsAvg overallAvg juniorsAvg")
    for total in range(10, max_total + 1, 10):  # total divisible by 10
        juniorsCount = total // 10
        seniorsCount = 9 * juniorsCount
        for seniorsAvg in range(0, 21):
            for overallAvg in range(0, 21):
                # Check inequality: 9*total/10*seniorsAvg ≤ overallAvg*total
                # rewrite: seniorsCount * seniorsAvg ≤ overallAvg * total
                if seniorsCount * seniorsAvg <= overallAvg * total:
                    numerator = overallAvg * total - seniorsAvg * seniorsCount
                    if numerator % juniorsCount == 0:
                        juniorsAvg = numerator // juniorsCount
                        if juniorsAvg >= 0:
                            print(total, seniorsAvg, overallAvg, juniorsAvg)

enumerate_juniorsavg()
```
