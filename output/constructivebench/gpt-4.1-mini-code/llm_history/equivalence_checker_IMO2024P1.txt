Ground Truth Answer: {α : ℝ | ∃ k : ℤ, α = 2 * k}
Proposed Answer: {α : ℝ | ∃ m n : ℕ, n ≠ 0 ∧ α = m / n ∧ m ∈ ({0} ∪ {2*k | k : ℕ}) ∧ n ∣ m}
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

The ground truth answer states that α must be an even integer (α = 2k for some integer k).

The proposed answer is more complex:
1. It allows α to be rational (m/n)
2. Requires m to be either 0 or an even natural number (2k)
3. Requires n to divide m

Key observations:
- When n=1, the proposed answer reduces to α = m/1 where m is even, which matches the ground truth
- However, the proposed answer also includes cases like α = 0 (when m=0) and fractions like α = 4/2 (which simplifies to 2, an even integer)
- The ground truth only includes all even integers, while the proposed answer includes some rational numbers that simplify to even integers

The proposed answer is actually more restrictive than the ground truth because:
1. It excludes odd integers (which are not in the ground truth either)
2. It includes some rationals that simplify to even integers, but not all even integers (e.g., α = 2.5 would be excluded)
3. The condition n ∣ m is quite restrictive

The two answers are not equivalent because:
1. The ground truth includes all even integers (positive, negative, zero)
2. The proposed answer includes only non-negative cases where α is a fraction that simplifies to an even integer or zero
3. The proposed answer misses negative even integers
