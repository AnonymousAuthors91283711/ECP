The problem asks to find positive integers \(m, n\) such that
\[
\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} (2^n - 2^i) = m!
\]
This is a product over \(i\) of terms \(2^n - 2^i\), and the question is which factorials \(m!\) equal this product for some \(m,n>0\).

We will enumerate small \(n\), compute the product exactly, and for each product, check if it equals some factorial \(m!\). We print all matches and at the end the pairs \((m,n)\).

By testing \(n\) in a small range (like 1 to 6), and \(m\) up to a reasonable limit, we might identify all such pairs.

```python
from math import factorial

def product_term(n):
    # Compute product_{i=0}^{n-1} (2^n - 2^i)
    product = 1
    for i in range(n):
        product *= (2**n - 2**i)
    return product

# We try n from 1 to 6 for manageable sizes
max_n = 6

# We guess max m up to 30 factorial (for speed, can be adjusted)
max_m = 30

# Precompute factorials for quick comparison
fact_cache = [factorial(i) for i in range(max_m+1)]

# Store discovered pairs to avoid duplicates
found_pairs = set()

for n in range(1, max_n+1):
    val = product_term(n)
    print(f"n = {n}, product = {val}")
    for m in range(1, max_m+1):
        if val == fact_cache[m]:
            # print exact match
            print(f"Match found: m = {m}, n = {n}, {val} = {m}!")
            found_pairs.add((m,n))

print("\nAll pairs (m,n) with m! = product_{i=0}^{n-1} (2^n - 2^i):")
for m,n in sorted(found_pairs):
    print(f"m={m}, n={n}")
```
This enumerates candidates and outputs them immediately upon discovery. Adjust `max_n` and `max_m` if the computation is too heavy or no results.
