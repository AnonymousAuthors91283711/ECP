The given code appears to define a set of natural numbers omnimath3878_answer and a theorem relating membership in that set to the existence of some integer n representing a certain value depending on M and k. Without the exact formula for a M k, we aim to experimentally enumerate values of M and k, check if the mysterious a M k yields an integer n, and collect those M with such k.

We do not have the explicit a M k function, so let's assume a M k is some expression involving M, k producing a rational or real number; for example experiments could involve simple functions such as a(M,k) = (M*k + 1) / (k + 1) or others that encode integrality conditions based on M and k.

Our plan:
- Fix a range of M, say 1 to 20.
- For each M, try k from 1 to 20.
- For each M,k compute a tentative a(M,k) (we must guess a function). To stay meaningful, let's try a formula where integrality depends on M,k.
- If a(M,k) is integer, print M,k,n.
- Collect such M in a set omnimath3878_answer.
- Print this set at the end.

This simulates the kind of enumeration that can help conjecture which M are in omnimath3878_answer.

```python
# Enumerate M, k and check when a(M,k) is integer, collecting such M
def a(M, k):
    # Example function: a(M,k) = (M*k + 1)/(k + 1)
    # Replace with the actual function if known for better results
    return (M * k + 1) / (k + 1)

def is_integer(x):
    return abs(x - round(x)) < 1e-12

def main():
    omnimath3878_answer = set()
    max_M = 20
    max_k = 20
    print("Enumerating values for M in [1..{}], k in [1..{}]".format(max_M, max_k))
    for M in range(1, max_M + 1):
        found = False
        for k in range(1, max_k + 1):
            val = a(M, k)
            if is_integer(val):
                print(f"M={M}, k={k}, a(M,k)={int(round(val))}")
                found = True
        if found:
            omnimath3878_answer.add(M)
    print("\nomnimath3878_answer = {", ", ".join(str(m) for m in sorted(omnimath3878_answer)), "}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
