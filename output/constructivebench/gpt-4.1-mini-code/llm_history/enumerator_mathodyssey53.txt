The problem involves finding pairs \((a,b)\) such that the quadratic inequality \(2bx^2 + ax + 1 - b \geq 0\) holds for all \(x \in [-1,1]\), and then determining the greatest possible value of \(a + b\) under these constraints. To assist in conjecturing the answer, we enumerate pairs \((a,b)\) over a small grid and check the inequality at several points in \([-1,1]\), printing all valid sums \(a + b\) found. We prioritize exact values by using rational fractions and only print sums for which the polynomial fits the constraints at sampled points.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Check polynomial 2*b*x^2 + a*x + 1 - b >= 0 for x in [-1,1]
def check_poly(a, b):
    # Check at critical points x = -1, 0, 1 and vertex if in [-1,1]
    pts = [-1, 0, 1]
    if b != 0:
        vertex = Fraction(-a, 4*b)
        if -1 <= vertex <= 1:
            pts.append(vertex)
    for x in pts:
        val = 2 * b * x * x + a * x + 1 - b
        if val < 0:
            return False
    return True

# Enumerate a,b over small rationals with denominator up to 4 in [-3,3]
denoms = [1,2,3,4]
vals = []
print("Enumerating valid (a,b) with a,b in [-3,3], denominator ≤ 4 and polynomial ≥ 0 on [-1,1]:")
for ad in denoms:
    for bd in denoms:
        for an in range(-3*ad, 3*ad+1):
            a = Fraction(an, ad)
            for bn in range(-3*bd, 3*bd+1):
                b = Fraction(bn, bd)
                if check_poly(a,b):
                    s = a + b
                    print(f"a={a}, b={b}, sum={s}")

# After exploring, print an explicit candidate for greatest a+b found:
# (In actual conjecturing, we would pick max s found.)
# Here, just indicate how one might do that for further proof exploration.
