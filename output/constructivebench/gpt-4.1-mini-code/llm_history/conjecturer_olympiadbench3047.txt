theorem olympiadbench3047 (x : ℝ) (hx : x > 0) (h : logb (sqrt 2) x = 20) :
    logb 2 (sqrt x) = olympiadbench3047_answer x := by sorry. Enumerated answers: x = (sqrt(2))^20 = 1024.0000000000014 (should equal 2^10 = 1024)
sqrt(x) = 32.00000000000002
log2(sqrt(x)) = 5.000000000000001
Analytic computation:
log2(x) = 20 * 1/2 = 10.0
log2(sqrt(x)) = 1/2 * log2(x) = 5.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
<<<fun x => 10>>>
