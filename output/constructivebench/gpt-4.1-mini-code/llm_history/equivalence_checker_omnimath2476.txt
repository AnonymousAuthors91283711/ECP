Ground Truth Answer: 773
Proposed Answer: 1309
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find natural numbers a and b that are coprime, where:
   - 100*a + b equals some answer (omnimath2476_answer)
   - a = isosceles/gcd(isosceles, total)
   - b = total/gcd(isosceles, total)
   - isosceles = 2020*2019
   - total = 2020*2019*2018/6

2. Calculating the values:
   - isosceles = 2020*2019 = 4,078,380
   - total = 2020*2019*2018/6 = 1,370,013,880
   - gcd(4,078,380, 1,370,013,880) = 20

3. Therefore:
   - a = 4,078,380/20 = 203,919
   - b = 1,370,013,880/20 = 68,500,694

4. The final answer should be:
   100*a + b = 100*203,919 + 68,500,694 = 20,391,900 + 68,500,694 = 88,892,594

However, neither the ground truth (773) nor the proposed answer (1309) matches this calculation. Both seem incorrect based on the problem statement.
