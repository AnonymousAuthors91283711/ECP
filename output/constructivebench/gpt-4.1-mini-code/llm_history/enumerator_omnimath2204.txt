The problem involves complex numbers \( z \) whose \( k \)-th powers have real values (imaginary part zero) but are not equal to 1, and polynomial approximations of their real parts at \( n=0,1,2,3 \). We want to explore such \( z \) and \( k \), find the minimal such \( k \), and then determine the maximum leading coefficient \( a \) for quadratic polynomials fitting the first four values of the real part sequence \( f(n) = \mathrm{Re}(z^n) \).

Let's enumerate candidate \( z = e^{i\theta} \) where \(\theta = 2\pi m / k\) for small \( k \), check that \( (z^k).im=0 \) but \( z^k \neq 1 \) is false, so actually \( z^k = 1 \) won't hold if we pick other angles. We can explore \( k \) from 1 to some small upper limit. For each \( k \), enumerate \( m \) and form the sequence \( f \), then find the quadratic polynomial \( p(n) = a n^2 + b n + c \) through \( f(0..3) \), and report the leading coefficient \( a \) along with \( k \).

We will print out all \( (k, a) \) pairs found, and then the maximum \( a \) for the minimal \( k \).

```python
import math

def quadratic_fit_4pts(y0, y1, y2, y3):
    # Solve for a,b,c in p(n)=a n^2 + b n + c
    # Using points n=0..3:
    # c = y0
    # b + c + a = y1 -> b + a = y1 - c
    # 4a + 2b + c = y2
    # 9a + 3b + c = y3
    # We'll solve the linear system for a,b:
    c = y0
    # From second eq: b = y1 - c - a
    # Substitute into third and fourth:
    # 4a + 2(y1 - c - a) + c = y2  -> 4a + 2y1 - 2c - 2a + c = y2 -> (4a - 2a) + 2y1 - c = y2
    # 2a + 2 y1 - c = y2 -> 2a = y2 - 2y1 + c
    # a = (y2 - 2 y1 + c)/2
    a = (y2 - 2*y1 + c)/2
    b = y1 - c - a
    # Check last eq for consistency:
    check = 9*a + 3*b + c
    if abs(check - y3) > 1e-10:
        # Numerical inconsistency; ignore this fit
        return None
    return a, b, c

# Enumerate k from 1 to 10 (small sample)
results = []
min_k_candidates = []
print("Enumerating (k, a) for z=e^{2pi i m/k} with gcd(m,k)=1:")
for k in range(1, 11):
    found_valid = False
    # Enumerate m coprime to k, 1 <= m < k
    for m in range(1, k):
        if math.gcd(m, k) != 1:
            continue
        theta = 2 * math.pi * m / k
        z = complex(math.cos(theta), math.sin(theta))
        z_k = z**k
        # Check imaginary part close to zero and z^k != 1
        if abs(z_k.imag) < 1e-14 and abs(z_k.real - 1) > 1e-14:
            # sequence f(n) = Re(z^n)
            f = [ (z**n).real for n in range(4)]
            coeffs = quadratic_fit_4pts(*f)
            if coeffs is None:
                continue
            a, b, c = coeffs
            print(f"k={k}, m={m}, a={a:.6f}")
            results.append((k,a))
            found_valid = True
    if found_valid:
        min_k_candidates.append(k)

if not min_k_candidates:
    print("No valid k found with the given constraints.")
else:
    min_k = min(min_k_candidates)
    a_candidates = [a for (k,a) in results if k == min_k]
    print(f"Minimal k: {min_k}")
    print(f"Maximum leading coefficient a for minimal k: {max(a_candidates):.6f}")
```

This code prints each viable leading coefficient and the minimal \( k \) found, then outputs the maximum \( a \) for that \( k \). It helps conjecture the true answer.
