The problem seems to involve a sum with falling factorials and modular arithmetic, likely from the 2019 AIME I problem 4. The goal is to evaluate the sum:

1 + âˆ‘_{k=0}^{3} 11 * (11 - k) * (11)_k

where (11)_k = 11 * 10 * ... * (11 - k + 1) is the falling factorial, and then find its remainder modulo 1000.

We'll write a Python program to enumerate the sum terms for k = 0 to 3, print each partial term and cumulative sum modulo 1000, and finally print the result modulo 1000.

```python
def falling_factorial(n, k):
    result = 1
    for i in range(k):
        result *= n - i
    return result

def main():
    total = 1  # initial 1 from the sum
    print(f"Term k=0: initial total = {total}")
    for k in range(4):
        ff = falling_factorial(11, k)
        term = 11 * (11 - k) * ff
        total += term
        print(f"Term k={k}: 11*(11-{k})*falling_factorial(11,{k}) = {term}")
        print(f"Cumulative total after k={k}: {total}")
    result_mod = total % 1000
    print(f"Sum modulo 1000: {result_mod}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
