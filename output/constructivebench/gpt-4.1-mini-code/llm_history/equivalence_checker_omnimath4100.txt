Ground Truth Answer: fun a p x => a * (padicValNat p x)
Proposed Answer: fun a p n => a * Nat.factorization n p
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

1. The ground truth uses `padicValNat p x` which gives the exponent of prime p in the factorization of x.
2. The proposed answer uses `Nat.factorization n p` which also gives the exponent of prime p in the factorization of n.

Both functions essentially do the same thing - count the exponent of a prime p in a number's factorization. The only differences are:
- Variable naming (x vs n)
- The specific function used to get the prime exponent (`padicValNat` vs `factorization`)

In Lean's mathlib, `Nat.factorization n p` is indeed equivalent to `padicValNat p n` (they're just different ways to access the same information). The multiplication by a constant is identical in both cases.
