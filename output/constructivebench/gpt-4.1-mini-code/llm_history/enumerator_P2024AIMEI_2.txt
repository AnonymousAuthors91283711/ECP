The problem involves finding real numbers \(x, y > 1\) such that

\[
\log_x(y^x) = 10, \quad \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10,
\]

and then computing \(x \cdot y\). We want to explore solutions by enumerating small values and checking these equations approximately.

Rewrite logs as:

\[
\log_x(y^x) = \frac{\ln(y^x)}{\ln x} = \frac{x \ln y}{\ln x} = 10,
\]
\[
\log_y(x^{4y}) = \frac{\ln(x^{4y})}{\ln y} = \frac{4y \ln x}{\ln y} = 10.
\]

These give two equations:

\[
\frac{x \ln y}{\ln x} = 10,
\]
\[
\frac{4y \ln x}{\ln y} = 10.
\]

We seek \(x,y > 1\) satisfying these. We'll enumerate candidate \(x,y\) values and check. Then print \(x y\).

```python
import math

# Enumerate x,y in range (1.01, 3) with step 0.01 (to keep output small)
# and check for approx equality of equations.
# Print x,y, and product if close to conditions.

epsilon = 1e-5
step = 0.01
x_start = 1.01
x_end = 3.0

print("Enumerating (x,y) with 1 < x,y < 3 satisfying log conditions roughly")

for i in range(int((x_end - x_start) / step) + 1):
    x = x_start + i * step
    lx = math.log(x)
    if lx == 0:
        continue
    for j in range(i, int((x_end - x_start) / step) + 1):  # start from i for symmetry
        y = x_start + j * step
        ly = math.log(y)
        if ly == 0:
            continue
        cond1 = abs((x * ly) / lx - 10)
        cond2 = abs((4 * y * lx) / ly -10)
        if cond1 < epsilon and cond2 < epsilon:
            product = x * y
            # Print exact values up to 5 decimals
            print(f"x={x:.5f}, y={y:.5f}, product={product:.5f}, cond1={cond1:.2e}, cond2={cond2:.2e}")
```
