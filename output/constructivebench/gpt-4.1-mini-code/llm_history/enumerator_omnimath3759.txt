The problem involves matrices \( A \) of size \( n \times n \) with entries \( A_{ij} = (i+1)+(j+1) \), i.e., \( A_{ij} = i + j + 2 \), where \( i,j \) range from 0 to \( n-1 \).

We want to enumerate the rank of \( A \) viewed over the rationals for small values of \( n \). Given the special structure, we expect a pattern or closed formula for the rank.

The matrix entries form \( A = u \mathbf{1}^T + \mathbf{1} v^T \) for vectors \( u, v \) related to \( i+1 \) and \( j+1 \), so this matrix might have rank 2 (or less) for all \( n \).

Let's write a Python program that:
- For \( n = 1 \) to 10,
- construct the matrix \( A \) with \( A_{ij} = (i+1) + (j+1) \),
- calculate its rank over rationals (using exact arithmetic with fractions),
- print \( n \) and the rank immediately.

This will help conjecture the general formula for the rank (likely 1 if \( n=1 \), and 2 otherwise).

```python
from fractions import Fraction
from math import isclose

def matrix_rank(M):
    # Compute rank of matrix M over rationals using Gaussian elimination with fractions
    M = [row[:] for row in M]  # copy matrix
    n_rows = len(M)
    n_cols = len(M[0]) if M else 0
    rank = 0
    row_used = [False]*n_rows

    for col in range(n_cols):
        pivot_row = None
        for r in range(n_rows):
            if not row_used[r] and M[r][col] != 0:
                pivot_row = r
                break
        if pivot_row is None:
            continue
        # Swap to correct place
        M[rank], M[pivot_row] = M[pivot_row], M[rank]
        row_used[rank] = True
        # Normalize pivot row
        pivot = M[rank][col]
        M[rank] = [x / pivot for x in M[rank]]
        # Eliminate below and above
        for r in range(n_rows):
            if r != rank and M[r][col] != 0:
                factor = M[r][col]
                M[r] = [M[r][c] - factor*M[rank][c] for c in range(n_cols)]
        rank += 1
        if rank == n_rows:
            break
    return rank

print("Enumerating ranks of matrices A with A_ij = (i+1)+(j+1) for n=1..10")
for n in range(1, 11):
    A = [[Fraction(i+1)+Fraction(j+1) for j in range(n)] for i in range(n)]
    r = matrix_rank(A)
    print(f"n={n}, rank={r}")
```

This enumerates ranks for the first 10 sizes, printing each immediately to help see the pattern.
