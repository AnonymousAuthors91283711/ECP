abbrev omnimath3323_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath3323 : 
  ∏ k in Finset.range 351, (k^3 - (350 - k)) = omnimath3323_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: k=0, factor=-350
k=1, factor=-348
k=2, factor=-340
k=3, factor=-320
k=4, factor=-282
k=5, factor=-220
k=6, factor=-128
k=7, factor=0
Zero factor found at k=7, product is zero.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Explanation: Since the term for k=7 is zero, the entire product is zero.
