[write_program]
The problem is given the condition \(2n + 5 = 16\), find the value of \(2n - 3\). We can solve for \(n\) and compute \(2n - 3\). We'll write a Python program to verify values of \(n\) around this condition and print the resulting \(2n - 3\) when the condition holds exactly.

```python
# Enumerate possible n satisfying 2n + 5 = 16 and print the value of 2n - 3 accordingly.

def main():
    # Print the given equation for clarity
    print("Enumerating values of n such that 2n + 5 = 16")
    for n in range(20):  # small range around expected solution
        lhs = 2 * n + 5
        if lhs == 16:
            value = 2 * n - 3
            print(f"n = {n}, 2n + 5 = {lhs} [condition met], 2n - 3 = {value}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
