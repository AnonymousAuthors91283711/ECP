The problem involves choosing 5 distinct numbers from the set {3, 5, 6, 7, 9}, arranging them in a circle (permutation), and finding integers a and d such that the sums of pairs of adjacent numbers fit a particular arithmetic progression centered at a with steps d. We want to enumerate all such (f, a, d) that satisfy the equation and print them as we find them.

We'll try all 5-permutations of {3, 5, 6, 7, 9}, then attempt to solve the system for a and d exactly based on the sums, verifying they fit the pattern.

```python
from itertools import permutations

S = {3, 5, 6, 7, 9}
vals = list(S)

# We want to find permutations f: [0..4] -> S, distinct,
# and integers a, d such that:
# f(g0)+f(g1) = a - 2d
# f(g1)+f(g2) = a - d
# f(g2)+f(g3) = a
# f(g3)+f(g4) = a + d
# f(g4)+f(g0) = a + 2d
# for some permutation g of [0..4] (bijection).

# Because the problem is symmetric in g (a permutation of indices),
# we try each permutation g of [0..4], and for each permutation f of S.

def check_pattern(f, g):
    # sums s_k = f(g(k)) + f(g(k+1 mod 5)) must form arithmetic sequence centered at a:
    # s0 = a-2d, s1=a-d, s2=a, s3=a+d, s4=a+2d
    s = [f[g[i]] + f[g[(i+1)%5]] for i in range(5)]
    # set up equations from s:
    # s2 = a
    # s1 = a - d => d = a - s1 = s2 - s1
    # s3 = a + d => check s3 - a == d
    d = s[2] - s[1]
    if s[3] - s[2] != d:
        return None
    # check s0 = a - 2d and s4 = a + 2d
    if s[0] != s[2] - 2*d or s[4] != s[2] + 2*d:
        return None
    # returns a,d
    return s[2], d

The program tries all permutations f of the given set S = {3,5,6,7,9} and all permutations g of indices 0..4 to check the arithmetic progression conditions on sums. However, it produces no output (empty result). 

After reviewing the logic, the approach is mostly correct, but the key insight is that permutation g is just a reordering of indices to align sums into an arithmetic progression. By attempting all permutations f and g, all cases should be covered. Since no output is found, it suggests a bug in check_pattern or elsewhere.

I will re-examine check_pattern:

- s: sums of f(g[i]) + f(g[i+1 mod 5]) for i in range(5)
- The sequence s should form arithmetic progression with 5 terms, common difference d, centered at s[2].
- The program assumes s1 = a - d, s2 = a, s3 = a + d.
- Then d = s[2] - s[1]
- Checks s[3]-s[2] == d
- Checks s[0] = a - 2d and s[4] = a + 2d.

This is correct.

But the problem is it does not verify if a and d come from feasible integers a,d. Also, the sums s[i] come from sum of integers, so they are integers; but a and d must be integers.

In the code, it tries to check integer-ness of a,d. That part is OK.

I suspect the main issue is subtle: the mapping f: Fin 5 → ℕ needs f(i) ∈ {3,5,6,7,9}, distinct, emphasized. Then g is a bijection Fin5→Fin5 (permutation). The conditions on sums are over f◦g(i).

It may happen that the set of sums s is not fitting the proposed arithmetic progression pattern in any permutation g for any f. But the problem statement in the original competition implies there exists such a configuration.

Hence, maybe checking all permutations g is OK, but we have overlooked reverse checking: Because the problem is symmetric with respect to g, we should also consider that the sum sequence can be in any order, not just indexed 0..4, or we need to check for rotation of the sums too.

Note: The arithmetic sequence 5 terms with common difference d and center a:

The provided input is a problem statement from mathlib (Lean) formalization, describing the existence of a function with particular conditions but with no accompanying Python program. The "Program" field is 'None,' and thus there is no enumeration or attempt at solving or enumerating answers using Python.

Without a program, there's nothing to accept or reject. The output shows "Error: Program is empty," which means the user has provided only the Lean statement but no enumerator. The task is to provide a Python enumerator program that enumerates all possible functions f from {0..4} to the set {3,5,6,7,9}, satisfying the distinctness of values, existence of a bijection g of indices verifying the 5 given sum conditions for some natural numbers a,d, and that a equals the found a.

This is a combinatorial problem of:

- f is a permutation of {3,5,6,7,9} since the 5 values are distinct and each chosen from the set.

- g is a bijection on index set {0..4}.

- The sums of f(g(i)) and f(g(i+1 mod 5)) form an arithmetic progression with common difference d centered at a, for i=0..4.

Therefore, the problem demands to find permutations f and g, and integers a,d, satisfying the 5 sum equations.

Our task is to write an enumerator in Python that attempts all permutations f of the multiset {3,5,6,7,9} and bijections g of {0..4}, tries to find integer a,d fitting the sums, then printing out the candidate answers a.

We should print each found answer a immediately upon discovery, then after all, print the minimum a or all minimal a if requested. The problem states the answer is a natural number, so a>0.

Due to combinatorial explosion, we must prune carefully.

Plan:

- Enumerate all permutations f of [3,5,6,7,9] (120 total).

- For each f, enumerate all permutations g (120 total).

- For each f,g, compute the sequence S_i = f(g(i)) + f(g(i+1)) for i=0...4 (indices mod 5).

- Check if S_i form an arithmetic progression centered at a, with difference d:

  S_0 = a - 2d

  S_1 = a -
