abbrev omnimath1911_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath1911 :
  let S := Icc 1 6
  let A := card (Finset.univ : Finset (Sym2 (S ×ˢ S)))
  let B := card (Finset.univ : Finset (Sym2 S × Sym2 S))
  A - B = omnimath1911_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: A = |Sym2(SxS)| = C(36+1, 2) = 666
B = |Sym2(S)|^2 = 21^2 = 441
A - B = 225. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<225>>>
