The problem counts the number of functions from a 4-element finite set (Fin 4) to Bool, i.e., the number of functions from a set of size 4 to {true, false}. The answer is 2^4 = 16. To confirm and enumerate the functions, let's print all possible functions as 4-length tuples of Bool (False or True), and count them.

```python
# Enumerate all functions from a 4-element set to Bool (False, True)
# Print each function as a tuple and count total

def main():
    from itertools import product
    
    domain_size = 4
    codomain = [False, True]
    count = 0
    
    for f in product(codomain, repeat=domain_size):
        print(f)  # Print each function
        count += 1
    
    print("Total count:", count)  # Total number of functions

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
