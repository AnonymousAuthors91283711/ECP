The problem is about finding the minimum absolute difference of the heads of two nonempty, nonincreasing lists of natural numbers whose sums add up to 2013, such that this difference is minimal among all such partitions and the sum of the heads is maximal among partitions with this minimal difference.

We enumerate pairs of sorted nonincreasing lists `(as, bs)` summing to 2013 and calculate the absolute difference of their heads. We try to find minimal differences and track candidates with maximal sum of heads among those minimal differences.

Given the complexity, we simplify by considering only cases where each list has one element (since more elements might complicate enumeration a lot), then gradually increasing length with small sums.

To keep the output concise, let's enumerate all pairs `(a, b)` with `a + b = 2013` where `a, b` are natural numbers, and `a >= b`, then print the absolute difference `|a - b|` and sum of heads `a + b = 2013`. Since each list is a single element, the heads are those elements, and sums are trivially `a` and `b`.

We will print all pairs and differences, then at the end print the minimal difference and max sum of heads for those minima.

```python
# Enumerate pairs (a, b) with a + b = 2013 where a >= b >= 1
# For each, print abs(a - b) = a - b, sum heads = 2013
# Find minimal difference and max sum of heads among these

S = 2013
min_diff = None
candidates = []

for b in range(1, S//2 + 1):
    a = S - b
    if a < b:
        break
    diff = a - b
    # Print each candidate: difference and heads sum (always 2013)
    print(f"diff={diff}, heads_sum={a+b}, heads=({a}, {b})")
    if (min_diff is None) or (diff < min_diff):
        min_diff = diff
        candidates = [(a,b)]
    elif diff == min_diff:
        candidates.append((a,b))

print(f"\nMinimal difference: {min_diff}")
print("Candidates with minimal difference:")
for a, b in candidates:
    print(f"heads=({a}, {b}), heads_sum={a+b}")
```

This code shows enumerations of heads for 1-element lists. Extending to multiple elements is possible but combinatorially large, so this gives an initial handle to conjecture the minimal difference.
