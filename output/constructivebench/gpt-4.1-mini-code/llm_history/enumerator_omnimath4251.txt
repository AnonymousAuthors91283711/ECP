This problem studies the condition on real number \(x\) where \(\lfloor x^2 - 2x \rfloor + 2 \lfloor x \rfloor = \lfloor x \rfloor^2\). We want to enumerate possible \(x\) that satisfy this and conjecture the set of all such \(x\).

Key idea: Let \(n = \lfloor x \rfloor\). Then the equation is
\[
\lfloor x^2 - 2x \rfloor + 2n = n^2 \implies \lfloor x^2 - 2x \rfloor = n^2 - 2n = n(n-2).
\]

We enumerate for several integer \(n\), ranges of \(x\) within \([n, n+1)\), check which \(x\) satisfy this floor equality, and print them. This helps understand the intervals or points for each integer \(n\).

```python
import math

def check(n, x):
    # check if floor(x^2 - 2x) == n*(n-2)
    val = x**2 - 2*x
    lhs = math.floor(val)
    rhs = n*(n-2)
    return lhs == rhs

print("Enumerating solutions of floor(x^2 - 2x) + 2*floor(x) = floor(x)^2")
print("For integer floor n, x in [n, n+1), solutions:")

for n in range(-3, 4):  # sample n from -3 to 3
    print(f"n = {n}:")
    # within [n, n+1), test x at increments for precision
    solutions = []
    step = 0.01
    x = n
    while x < n + 1:
        if check(n, x):
            # To avoid too many close values, only print if distinct from last
            if not solutions or abs(x - solutions[-1]) > 0.005:
                print(f"  x = {x:.2f}, floor(x^2 - 2x) = {math.floor(x**2 - 2*x)}")
                solutions.append(x)
        x += step
```
This prints candidates points and intervals where the condition holds for some small sample integer \(n\), guiding the shape of the solution set.
