<<<1848 + 5 * (1716 - 1440)>>>

Explanation: The pattern suggests a constant difference in the product increments; using linearity:
(a₁ + kd₁)(a₂ + kd₂) forms quadratic sequence with given terms at k=0,1,2,7.
The difference between terms fits a linear progression; the 7th term corresponds to
1848 + 5 * (1716 - 1440) = 1848 + 5*276 = 1848 + 1380 = 3228.
