sorry

Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: 9
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer.

The problem states:
1. 3 * omnimath2735_answer = 9 + 9 + 9 (which is 27)
2. For all natural numbers n, if 3 * n = 27, then n must equal omnimath2735_answer

The first condition simplifies to 3 * omnimath2735_answer = 27, which means omnimath2735_answer = 9.
The second condition states that this solution is unique (no other natural number satisfies this equation).

The proposed answer is 9, which:
1. Satisfies the first condition (3 * 9 = 27)
2. Is indeed the unique solution among natural numbers (since 3n = 27 has only one natural solution)

<<<True>>>
