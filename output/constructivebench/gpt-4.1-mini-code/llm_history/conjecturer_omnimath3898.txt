abbrev omnimath3898_answer : Set (ℚ → ℤ) := sorry
theorem omnimath3898 (f : ℚ → ℤ) :
  (∀ (x : ℚ) (a : ℤ) (b : ℤ), 0 < b → f ((f x + a) / b) = f ((x + a) / b)) ↔ f ∈ omnimath3898_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing constant functions f(x)=c for c in -2..2
f(x) = -2 works
f(x) = -1 works
f(x) = 0 works
f(x) = 1 works
f(x) = 2 works
Testing floor function f(x) = floor(x)
f(x) = floor(x) works
Testing identity on integers f(x) = int_part(x)
Testing rounding f(x) = round(x). Expected Answer Type: Set (ℚ → ℤ)
<<<{f | ∃ c : ℤ, f = Function.const ℚ c} ∪ {floor}>>>
