The problem involves a sequence defined by a linear recurrence with parameter \( m > 1 \):
\[
a_1 = 1, \quad a_2 = 1, \quad a_3 = 4, \quad a_n = m \cdot (a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}) - a_{n-3} \text{ for } n \ge 4,
\]
and the condition that all terms \( a_n \) are perfect squares of integers.

We want to find all integer \( m > 1 \) such that every \( a_n \) is a perfect square.

The Python program below enumerates values of \( m \) starting from 2 up to a small limit (e.g., 20), computes terms \( a_n \) up to some \( N \) (like 10 or 15), checks if they are perfect squares, and prints those \( m \) for which all computed terms are perfect squares. This can assist in conjecturing the exact set of such \( m \).

```python
# Enumerate values of m > 1 and check if sequence terms are perfect squares

import math

def is_perfect_square(x):
    if x < 0:
        return False
    r = int(math.isqrt(x))
    return r * r == x

def generate_sequence(m, n_terms):
    a = [0]*(n_terms+1)  # 1-based indexing
    a[1], a[2], a[3] = 1,1,4
    for n in range(4, n_terms+1):
        a[n] = m*(a[n-1] + a[n-2]) - a[n-3]
    return a[1:]

def check_sequence(m, n_terms=10):
    a = generate_sequence(m, n_terms)
    for idx, val in enumerate(a, start=1):
        if not is_perfect_square(val):
            # print(f"m={m} fails at term {idx} with value {val} not a perfect square")
            return False
    return True

def main():
    max_m = 20
    n_terms = 10
    print("Checking m values from 2 to", max_m)
    candidates = []
    for m in range(2, max_m+1):
        if check_sequence(m, n_terms):
            print(f"m = {m} yields all perfect square terms up to n={n_terms}")
            candidates.append(m)
    if candidates:
        print("Candidates:", candidates)
        print("Minimum such m:", min(candidates))
    else:
        print("No m found with all terms perfect squares up to n =", n_terms)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
