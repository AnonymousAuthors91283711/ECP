The problem relates to finding \(p \in [0,1]\) such that
\[
\binom{4}{2}p^2(1-p)^2 = \binom{4}{3}p^3(1-p).
\]
We want to enumerate possible values of \(p\), ideally exact or with good approximations for the root(s) of this equation.

```python
from math import comb, isclose

# Equation: C(4,2) * p^2 * (1-p)^2 == C(4,3) * p^3 * (1-p)
# Let f(p) = LHS - RHS = 0

C42 = comb(4, 2)
C43 = comb(4, 3)

def f(p):
    return C42*p**2*(1-p)**2 - C43*p**3*(1-p)

# Enumerate p in [0, 1], step by 0.01 for quick scanning; print candidates where sign changes (roots approx)
step = 0.01
prev_p = 0.0
prev_val = f(prev_p)
print("Checking roots of equation: C(4,2)*p^2*(1-p)^2 = C(4,3)*p^3*(1-p)")

for i in range(1, 101):
    p = i*step
    val = f(p)
    if prev_val == 0:
        print(f"p = {prev_p:.2f} is a root exactly")
    elif val == 0:
        print(f"p = {p:.2f} is a root exactly")
    elif prev_val * val < 0:
        # sign change detected, approximate root between prev_p and p
        # refine with bisection for 10 steps
        a, b = prev_p, p
        for _ in range(10):
            mid = (a + b)/2
            fmid = f(mid)
            if isclose(fmid, 0, abs_tol=1e-10):
                break
            if prev_val * fmid < 0:
                b = mid
            else:
                a = mid
        root = (a + b)/2
        print(f"Approximate root near p = {root:.5f}")
    prev_p, prev_val = p, val

# Also check endpoints
if isclose(f(0), 0, abs_tol=1e-14):
    print("p = 0 is a root exactly")
if isclose(f(1), 0, abs_tol=1e-14):
    print("p = 1 is a root exactly")
```
