The problem asks for pairs of prime numbers \((x, y)\) satisfying the equation:
\[x^y - y^x = x y^2 - 19.\]

We'll enumerate small prime pairs and print those satisfying the exact equation.

```python
from sympy import primerange, isprime

# Generate small primes up to a certain limit to check possible pairs
primes = list(primerange(2, 50))

print("Checking pairs (x,y) of primes with x,y in primes:")
for x in primes:
    for y in primes:
        lhs = x**y - y**x
        rhs = x * y**2 - 19
        if lhs == rhs:
            print(f"Solution found: x={x}, y={y}, x^y - y^x = {lhs}, x*y^2 - 19 = {rhs}")

# Print all results found
```
