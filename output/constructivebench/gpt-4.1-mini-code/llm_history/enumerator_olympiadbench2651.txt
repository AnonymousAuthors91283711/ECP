[write_program]
The problem gives a system of linear equations with parameters and asks for the value of 20x + 14y. We have:

1) x + 9y = 17
2) 40x + 41y = 42

We want to find 20x + 14y. I'll write a Python program to solve this system numerically and symbolically for T=40 and print the value of 20x + 14y.

```python
# Solve the linear system and compute 20x + 14y for given T=40

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Rational

def main():
    T = 40
    print(f"T = {T}")

    # Define symbolic variables x, y
    x, y = symbols('x y', real=True)

    # Equations based on the problem
    eq1 = Eq(x + 9 * y, 17)
    eq2 = Eq(T * x + (T + 1) * y, T + 2)

    # Solve the system
    sol = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))

    # Print exact solutions
    x_sol = sol[x]
    y_sol = sol[y]
    print(f"x = {x_sol}")
    print(f"y = {y_sol}")

    # Compute 20x + 14y
    expr = 20 * x + 14 * y
    val = expr.subs({x: x_sol, y: y_sol})

    # Print the exact value
    print(f"20*x + 14*y = {val.evalf()} (approx) or exactly {val}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
