The problem is to count the number of functions \(a: \{0,1,2,3,4,5\} \to \mathbb{Z}\) such that \(a(i) \leq i\) for each \(i\), and \(\sum_{i=0}^5 a(i) = 6\). Here, \(a(i) \leq i\) means at most \(i\), but since \(a(i)\) is integer, and no explicit lower bound, it's potentially unbounded below. We want to enumerate all integer-valued functions under these constraints.

To make enumeration feasible, note that \(a(i) \leq i\). For lower bound, since \(\sum a(i) = 6\), and given max \(a(i)\), minimal sum is \(\sum a(i)_{\min} \geq -100\) (say arbitrarily), to limit search we will only consider \(a(i)\) in range \([-20,i]\) as lower bounds to keep finite search.

We will enumerate all 6-tuples where \(a[i] \in [-20, i]\) and sum to 6, printing each solution count incrementally (printing the function found). Then we print the total count.

```python
# Enumerate integer functions a: {0..5} -> Z with a[i] <= i and sum a[i] = 6
# We restrict a[i] >= -20 to have finite enumeration.

def main():
    from itertools import product

    indices = list(range(6))
    max_vals = [i for i in indices]
    min_vals = [-20]*6  # arbitrary lower bound to limit search space

    count = 0
    ranges = [range(min_vals[i], max_vals[i]+1) for i in indices]

    for a in product(*ranges):
        if sum(a) == 6 and all(a[i] <= max_vals[i] for i in indices):
            print(f'a = {a}')
            count += 1

    print(f'Total count (omnimath1868_answer) = {count}')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
