[write_program]
The problem asks to find the unique pair of positive integers \((g,h)\) such that \(19g + 17h = 201\). The program will enumerate positive integer pairs \((g,h)\) satisfying this equation and print all candidates, then print the unique solution explicitly.

```python
# Enumerate positive integer pairs (g,h) with 19*g + 17*h = 201
# g,h > 0

def main():
    print("Searching for (g,h) with 19*g + 17*h = 201, g>0, h>0")
    solutions = []
    # g must be at least 1 and at most 201//19
    for g in range(1, 201//19 + 1):
        remainder = 201 - 19*g
        # Check if remainder divisible by 17
        if remainder > 0 and remainder % 17 == 0:
            h = remainder // 17
            if h > 0:
                solutions.append((g,h))
                print(f"Solution candidate: g={g}, h={h}")

    # Print number of solutions found
    print(f"Total solution candidates: {len(solutions)}")
    if len(solutions) == 1:
        g,h = solutions[0]
        print(f"Unique solution: g={g}, h={h}")
    else:
        print("No unique solution found among candidates.")

    main()
