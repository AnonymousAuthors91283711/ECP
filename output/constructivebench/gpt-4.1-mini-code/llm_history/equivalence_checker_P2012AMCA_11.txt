Ground Truth Answer: 5/72
Proposed Answer: (Nat.factorial 6) / (Nat.factorial 3 * Nat.factorial 2 * Nat.factorial 1) * (1/2)^3 * (2/3)^2 * (1/6)
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer step by step.

1. The problem is calculating a multinomial probability with:
   - n = 6 trials
   - k = [3,2,1] counts for outcomes A, M, C
   - p = [1/2, 2/3, 1/6] probabilities for A, M, C

2. The multinomial formula is:
   (n!)/(k₁!k₂!k₃!) * p₁^k₁ * p₂^k₂ * p₃^k₃

3. The proposed answer correctly implements this formula:
   - 6!/(3!2!1!) is the multinomial coefficient
   - (1/2)^3 * (2/3)^2 * (1/6)^1 matches the probability terms

4. Calculating the proposed answer:
   - 720/(6*2*1) * (1/8) * (4/9) * (1/6) = 60 * (1/8) * (4/9) * (1/6) = 60 * (4/432) = 60/108 = 5/9

5. However, the ground truth answer is 5/72, which is different from our calculation.

6. Looking back at the problem statement, we see:
   - p_M is defined as 2*(1-p_A)/3 = 2*(1/2)/3 = 1/3
   - p_C is (1-p_A)/3 = (1/2)/3 = 1/6
   - But the proposed answer uses 2/3 for p_M instead of 1/3

The proposed answer incorrectly used p_M = 2/3 instead of the correct 1/3 from the problem definition. This makes the final answer incorrect.
