The problem involves real numbers x and y under given constraints and asks to find the greatest value of some function z = olympiadbench2247_answer(x, y). Since the exact function olympiadbench2247_answer is not given, we can't compute z directly. Instead, to assist, we can enumerate candidate values of z for sample points (x, y) within the given ranges and print these values. This might help conjecture or guess the true function.

Because we don't have the formula, let's assume we want to explore points (x,y) in grids:
- x in [2, 5]
- y in [10, 20]

We'll use small discrete steps to not exceed output limit.

We'll print candidate z's as computed with a placeholder function (say, olympiadbench2247_answer(x,y) = some function we choose, or identity for now), so we can easily modify it later.

Because the problem only mentions printing, we will focus on enumerating (x,y) and any computed value z, printing them immediately.

```python
# Enumerator for olympiadbench2247 potential answers
def olympiadbench2247_answer(x, y):
    # Placeholder: assume a guess function; for example,
    # z = (x - 2) + (y - 10)/10
    # This is a simple function increasing in x and y
    return (x - 2) + (y - 10)/10

def main():
    xs = [2, 3, 4, 5]
    ys = [10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]
    max_z = None
    max_point = None
    print("Enumerating candidate z for (x,y):")
    for x in xs:
        for y in ys:
            z = olympiadbench2247_answer(x, y)
            print(f"x={x}, y={y}, z={z}")
            if (max_z is None) or (z > max_z):
                max_z = z
                max_point = (x, y)
    print(f"Maximum found z = {max_z} at (x,y) = {max_point}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This code enumerates values on a small sample grid and prints each candidate z immediately. It identifies the largest z on this grid as a candidate maximum. Modify olympiadbench2247_answer to the actual function if known.
