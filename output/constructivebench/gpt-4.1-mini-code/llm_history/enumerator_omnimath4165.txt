The problem asks us to find all triples of positive integers \((x, y, z)\) such that

\[
z + y^2 + x^3 = x y z \quad \text{and} \quad x = \gcd(y, z).
\]

We want to enumerate such triples with some small upper bound to conjecture about patterns.

```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

# We test all triples (x, y, z) with x,y,z in [1..30] for reasonable speed and output
UPPER = 30

# To reduce the search, note x divides y and z (since x = gcd(y,z)).
# So write y = x*a, z = x*b where gcd(a,b) =1.
# Then the equation becomes:
# x*b + (x*a)^2 + x^3 = x * x*a * x*b
# => x*b + x^2 * a^2 + x^3 = x^3 * a * b
# Divide both sides by x:
# b + x a^2 + x^2 = x^2 a b
# Let's iterate over x,a,b with gcd(a,b)=1.

print("Enumerating triples (x,y,z) with x = gcd(y,z) and positive integers:")

found = []

for x in range(1, UPPER+1):
    for a in range(1, UPPER+1):
        for b in range(1, UPPER+1):
            if math.gcd(a,b) != 1:
                continue
            left = b + x * a * a + x * x
            right = x * x * a * b
            if left == right:
                y = x * a
                z = x * b
                print(f"x={x}, y={y}, z={z}")
                found.append((x,y,z))

# If we want minimum or maximum etc., we could analyze found but we just print
```
