The problem is to find all pairs of positive integers \((x, y)\) such that 
\[x^y = y^{x-y}.\]

We will enumerate candidate pairs \((x,y)\) for small values, checking the equation exactly. Since exponents grow quickly, we can limit the search to reasonable bounds (e.g., \(x,y \leq 20\)), print all solutions found, and identify patterns to conjecture the answer.

```python
# Enumerate positive integer pairs (x,y) with x,y <= 20 satisfying x^y = y^(x-y)
# Print each solution immediately.

MAX = 20

for x in range(1, MAX+1):
    for y in range(1, MAX+1):
        if y < x:  # since x-y must be positive for y^(x-y)
            lhs = x**y
            rhs = y**(x - y)
            if lhs == rhs:
                print(f"Solution found: x={x}, y={y} because {x}^{y} = {lhs} = {y}^{x-y}")
```
This program will enumerate all possible candidates for pairs \((x, y)\) up to 20 and print all solutions satisfying the equation exactly.
