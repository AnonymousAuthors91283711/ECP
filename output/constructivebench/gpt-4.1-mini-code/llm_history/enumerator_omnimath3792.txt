[write_program]
The problem appears to involve finding the least natural number \( n \) such that for any finite set of "monsters" with certain properties, there exist \( n \) paths avoiding those monsters and covering certain conditions.

To assist in conjecturing the answer, I will write a Python program that:
- Iterates over small values of \( n \).
- For a sample set of "monsters", checks if paths can be constructed as required.
- Prints candidate \( n \) values immediately when the conditions appear satisfied for the sample.

Because the full combinatorial check is complicated (especially uniqueness and existence over a continuous range), I will simplify by:
- Using a small grid instead of 2024.
- Generating "monsters" sets with the given uniqueness property in a small interval.
- Attempt to find paths from 1 to 2024 (or simplified endpoints) avoiding monsters.
- Enumerate and print candidate \( n \).

This will help in guessing the minimal \( n \).

```python
# Enumerate candidate n for a simplified version of the monster path problem.
# Using smaller parameters to keep computation reasonable.

        cs = [c for (r_, c) in monsters if r_ == r]
