abbrev omnimath2952_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2952 : 
  (fun x => x - 5) 0 = omnimath2952_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating f(x) = x - 5 for x in [-5,5]:
f(-5) = -10
f(-4) = -9
f(-3) = -8
f(-2) = -7
f(-1) = -6
f(0) = -5
f(1) = -4
f(2) = -3
f(3) = -2
f(4) = -1
f(5) = 0

The value at x=0 is:
f(0) = -5. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
