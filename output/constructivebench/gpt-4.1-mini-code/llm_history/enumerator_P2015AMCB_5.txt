The problem is to find the least natural number \( N > 0 \) such that
\[
19 \times (3 + N) \leq 20 \times (1 + N).
\]
This inequality can be simplified and solved explicitly, but to assist in conjecturing the answer, the Python program below enumerates and prints each candidate \( N \) starting at 1 and checks the inequality, printing the first \( N \) satisfying it as the minimal solution.

```python
# Enumerate natural numbers N > 0 to find least N satisfying 19*(3+N) <= 20*(1+N)
def main():
    for N in range(1, 50):  # 50 is arbitrary to show enumeration, sufficient for this problem
        lhs = 19 * (3 + N)
        rhs = 20 * (1 + N)
        print(f"N={N}, 19*(3+{N})={lhs}, 20*(1+{N})={rhs}", flush=True)
        if lhs <= rhs:
            print(f"Least N satisfying inequality: {N}")
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
