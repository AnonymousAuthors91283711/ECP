The problem seems to be looking for a three-digit number \(\overline{abc}\) in base 10 where each digit \(a, b, c < 9\), and it satisfies the equations:
\[
\overline{abc} = a + 9b + 81c
\]
and
\[
\overline{abc} = b + 9c + 81a.
\]

Since the digits satisfy those, the program below enumerates all triples \((a, b, c)\) with digits less than 9 and tests the equality. It prints each triple and the value \(\overline{abc}\) matching both conditions.

```python
# Enumerate digits a,b,c < 9 and test the equations:
# n = a + 9 b + 81 c = b + 9 c + 81 a
# Print solutions immediately.

def main():
    for a in range(9):
        for b in range(9):
            for c in range(9):
                val1 = a + 9 * b + 81 * c
                val2 = b + 9 * c + 81 * a
                if val1 == val2:
                    print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c} => value={val1}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
