The problem is to find the fraction of three-digit numbers (100 to 999) whose digits sum to 24. We want to enumerate all such numbers and print the count and their fraction over the total 900 numbers. Then print the result as a fraction.

```python
# Enumerate three-digit numbers 100..999 whose digit sum is 24
# Print each qualifying number immediately. Finally print count and fraction.

def digit_sum(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

total = 0
count = 0

for n in range(100, 1000):
    s = digit_sum(n)
    if s == 24:
        print(n)
        count += 1
    total += 1

print("Count =", count)
print("Total =", total)
print(f"Fraction = {count}/{total} = {count/total}")
```
