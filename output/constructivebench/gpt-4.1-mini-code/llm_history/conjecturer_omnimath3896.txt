Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 47, which is at "n ∈ {2, 3, 4, 6, 8, " in "abbrev omnimath3896_answer : Set ℕ := {n : ℕ | n ∈ {2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24}}", there is an error: typeclass instance problem is stuck, it is often due to metavariables

. Enumerated Answers: Checking n >= 2 up to 50 for the condition:
n = 2 satisfies the condition
n = 3 satisfies the condition
n = 4 satisfies the condition
n = 6 satisfies the condition
n = 8 satisfies the condition
n = 12 satisfies the condition
n = 24 satisfies the condition. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The condition given says that for all a, b coprime to n, a ≡ b (mod n) if and only if ab ≡ 1 (mod n). This means the group of units modulo n is such that each element is its own inverse, or equivalently that the group is a Boolean group (an abelian group where every element is order 2). The enumerated values that satisfy this are n = 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 as given.

To avoid the Lean error, use `Set` notation explicitly without `{n : ℕ | n ∈ ...}`, since `∈` for `{...}` is not directly recognized. Instead, use `· ∈ ({2,3,4,6,8,12,24} : Set ℕ)` to make the set explicit.

Thus, the correct Lean type is:

```lean
{n : ℕ | n ≥ 2 ∧ n ∈ ({2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24} : Set ℕ)}
```

This fixes the typeclass inference problem.
