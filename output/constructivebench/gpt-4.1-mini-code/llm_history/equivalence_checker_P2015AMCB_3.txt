theorem P2015AMCB_3 (a b : ℕ) (h : (2 * a + 3 * b = 100 ∨ 3 * a + 2 * b = 100) ∧ (a = 28 ∨ b = 28)) :
  P2015AMCB_3_answer (a, b) = 8 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun ⟨a, b⟩ => if a = 28 then b else a
Proposed Answer: fun p : ℕ × ℕ => if (2 * p.1 + 3 * p.2 = 100 ∧ p.2 = 28) ∨ (3 * p.1 + 2 * p.2 = 100 ∧ p.1 = 28) then 8 else 0
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is mostly correct but has some issues:
1. It correctly handles the cases where (a=28 or b=28) and the equations are satisfied, returning 8
2. However, it returns 0 for all other cases, while the ground truth returns either a or b
3. The ground truth answer is more general and works for any input pair, while the proposed answer is specifically tailored for the problem conditions
4. Both answers would return 8 for the valid cases mentioned in the problem statement, but differ elsewhere

The proposed answer is correct for the specific problem constraints but not equivalent to the more general ground truth solution.
