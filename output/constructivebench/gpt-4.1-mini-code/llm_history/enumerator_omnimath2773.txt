The problem appears to be: Find the number of positive natural numbers n such that 111 % n = 6, meaning 111 mod n = 6.

For 111 mod n = 6, we know 111 = q*n + 6 for some integer q. Rearranged: 111 - 6 = q*n => 105 = q*n. So n divides 105 and n > 6 (since remainder 6 < n).

So the problem boils down to enumerating all divisors n of 105 such that n > 6.

Here's a Python program enumerating divisors of 105 greater than 6 and printing each.

```python
def divisors(x):
    divs = []
    for i in range(1, x + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            divs.append(i)
    return divs

target = 111
offset = 6
diff = target - offset  # 105

print(f"Divisors of {diff} greater than {offset} with 111 % n = 6:")

candidates = []
for n in divisors(diff):
    if n > offset:
        if target % n == offset:
            print(n)
            candidates.append(n)

print(f"Total count: {len(candidates)}")
```
This program prints each candidate divisor n immediately, then the total count.
