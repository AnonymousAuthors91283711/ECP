The problem involves the expression \((x + 1)^2 - x^2\) and asks for a function `omnimath3146_answer` that matches this difference for all real \(x\). We want to enumerate values for various \(x\) to conjecture the formula for the answer function.

```python
# Enumerate possible values of (x+1)^2 - x^2 for integer x and suggest a closed form
def compute_difference(x):
    return (x + 1) ** 2 - x ** 2

print("x\t(x+1)^2 - x^2")
for x in range(-5, 6):  # sample integer values from -5 to 5
    diff = compute_difference(x)
    print(f"{x}\t{diff}")

# From the results, we observe the difference = 2x + 1, which suggests:
# omnimath3146_answer(x) = 2*x + 1
print("\nConjectured formula for omnimath3146_answer(x): 2*x + 1")
```
