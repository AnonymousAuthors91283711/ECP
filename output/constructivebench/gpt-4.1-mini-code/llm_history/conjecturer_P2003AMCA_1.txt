abbrev P2003AMCA_1_answer : ℕ → ℕ := sorry
theorem P2003AMCA_1 (n : ℕ) :
  (∑ k in Finset.range n, 2*(k+1)) - (∑ k in Finset.range n, 2*k + 1) = P2003AMCA_1_answer n := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating differences for n=1 to 10:
n=1, sum_even=2, sum_odd=1, difference=1
n=2, sum_even=6, sum_odd=4, difference=2
n=3, sum_even=12, sum_odd=9, difference=3
n=4, sum_even=20, sum_odd=16, difference=4
n=5, sum_even=30, sum_odd=25, difference=5
n=6, sum_even=42, sum_odd=36, difference=6
n=7, sum_even=56, sum_odd=49, difference=7
n=8, sum_even=72, sum_odd=64, difference=8
n=9, sum_even=90, sum_odd=81, difference=9
n=10, sum_even=110, sum_odd=100, difference=10. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
