The problem describes real numbers \(a, b, c\) with constraints:
- \(a + b + c = 96\)
- \(a = 6c\)
- \(c = b - 40\)

We want to find \(|a - b|\).

Using the constraints, we can compute \(a, b, c\) exactly for sample values, and then calculate \(|a - b|\).

```python
print("Enumerating values satisfying constraints:")
# Given:
# a + b + c = 96
# a = 6 * c
# c = b - 40
# Substitute a and c in terms of b:
# 6 * c + b + c = 96 => 6*(b-40) + b + (b - 40) = 96
# 6b - 240 + b + b - 40 = 96
# 8b - 280 = 96 => 8b = 376 => b = 47
b = 47
c = b - 40  # c = 7
a = 6 * c   # a = 42
abs_diff = abs(a - b)
print(f"a = {a}, b = {b}, c = {c}, |a - b| = {abs_diff}")

# To illustrate parameter variation, try a few values around b=47
print("\nTesting close values of b around 47 (not necessarily satisfying all constraints):")
for b_trial in range(40, 55):
    c_trial = b_trial - 40
    a_trial = 6 * c_trial
    total = a_trial + b_trial + c_trial
    if abs(total - 96) < 1e-6:  # check sum constraint
        diff = abs(a_trial - b_trial)
        print(f"a={a_trial}, b={b_trial}, c={c_trial}, sum={total}, |a - b|={diff}")

print("\nExtremal answer based on exact constraints:")
print(f"|a - b| = {abs_diff}")
```
