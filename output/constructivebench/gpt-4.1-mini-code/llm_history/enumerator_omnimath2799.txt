The problem seems to be finding a natural number \( n \) satisfying the equation \( 3 \times n = 6 \times 2 \). Since it is a straightforward algebraic equation, the goal is to enumerate and verify possible values of \( n \) by checking which \( n \) satisfy the given equality. The program will enumerate candidate values of \( n \) and print the one(s) that satisfy this equation.

```python
# Enumerate natural numbers n to find those satisfying 3 * n = 6 * 2
# We compute 6 * 2 once, which is 12, and check for n such that 3n = 12.
# Since it's a small integer problem, we can check n up to 10 for demonstration.

target = 6 * 2  # 12
print(f"Target value: {target}")

for n in range(11):
    lhs = 3 * n
    if lhs == target:
        print(f"Found n: {n} satisfies 3 * {n} = {lhs}")
```
