The problem involves positive real numbers \(x, y\) satisfying \(\log (x y^3) = 1\) and \(\log (x^2 y) = 1\), and asks for \(\log (x y)\).

Rewrite these in terms of \(a = \log x\), \(b = \log y\), then solve the linear system:
- \(a + 3b = 1\)
- \(2a + b = 1\)

The goal is to find \(a + b = \log(x y)\).

Let's enumerate possible integer-like or simple rational values for \(a, b\), reconstruct \(x, y\), and verify the conditions numerically.

```python
import math

# Enumerate possible values of a,b satisfying the linear system:
# a + 3b =1
# 2a + b =1

# Solve the system algebraically:
# From first: a = 1 -3b
# Substitute into second: 2(1 -3b) + b =1 => 2 -6b + b=1 => -5b = -1 => b=0.2
# Then a=1 -3*0.2=1 -0.6=0.4
# So log(x)=0.4, log(y)=0.2, so log(xy)=a+b=0.6

print("Enumerating values based on solution of system:")
for b_numerator in range(-5,6):
    b = b_numerator / 5  # from -1 to 1 in steps of 0.2
    a = 1 -3*b
    left2 = 2*a + b
    # Check if approx equals 1 (within tolerance)
    if abs(left2 -1) < 1e-9:
        x = math.exp(a)
        y = math.exp(b)
        lhs1 = math.log(x * y**3)
        lhs2 = math.log(x**2 * y)
        # Check conditions
        if abs(lhs1 -1) < 1e-9 and abs(lhs2 -1)<1e-9 and x >0 and y >0:
            print(f"log(x)={a:.6g}, log(y)={b:.6g}, log(xy)={a+b:.6g}")
            print(f"x={x:.6g}, y={y:.6g}, log(x y^3)={lhs1:.6g}, log(x^2 y)={lhs2:.6g}")

print("Exact solution from algebraic manipulation:")
a, b = 0.4, 0.2
print(f"log(x) = {a}, log(y) = {b}, log(x y) = {a+b}")
```
