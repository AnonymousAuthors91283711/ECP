open Real

abbrev omnimath3451_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3451 :
  let m_last := 100 / 1.25
  let s_last := 100 / 0.8
  m_last + s_last = omnimath3451_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: m_last = 80 = 80.0
s_last = 125 = 125.0
Sum m_last + s_last = 205 = 205.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<205>>>
