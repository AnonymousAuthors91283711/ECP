The problem is about counting strictly increasing sequences a of length 200 with elements between 0 and 202 such that there exists a positive integer N making every pair sum to N modulo 203 for some pair (i,j). We will enumerate small examples to identify valid sequences and possible values of N.

```python
from itertools import combinations

# Parameters given in the problem
n = 200
max_val = 202
modulus = 203

print(f"Parameters: n={n}, max_val={max_val}, modulus={modulus}")

# We cannot brute force all sequences (there are too many), but let's explore possible N values.
# For a given N, we find which pairs (a_i, a_j) satisfy a_i + a_j ≡ N (mod 203).
# Since a is strictly increasing with 200 elements between 0 and 202, a covers many residues.
# Key idea: For such a to exist, for each i, there must be j with a_i + a_j ≡ N mod 203.
# We investigate the possible N values and corresponding a sets.

# We'll enumerate some candidate N values, then find which residues must be in a.

for N in range(1, modulus):
    # Build set of residues satisfying existence: for all i, ∃ j with a_i + a_j == N mod 203
    # For each residue r in [0,202], check if N - r mod 203 is in [0,202]
    # Because a is StrictMono, elements range 0..202
    
    # For r in 0..202, check if "partner" = (N - r) % 203 in 0..202
    valid_residues = [r for r in range(max_val+1) if (N - r) % modulus <= max_val]

    # For a sequence a containing these valid_residues and strictly increasing,
    # the above condition holds. The question: Can we select exactly n=200 distinct residues?
    # Print info for N where number of valid residues >= 200
    if len(valid_residues) >= n:
        print(f"N={N}: len(valid_residues)={len(valid_residues)} candidates")

        # Try to form a strictly increasing sequence with these residues of length 200
        # Since residues are distinct, just take smallest 200.
        a = sorted(valid_residues)[:n]
        
        # Check condition ∀ i, ∃ j: (a_i + a_j - N) mod 203 == 0
        def condition_met(seq, N):
            s = set(seq)
            for x in seq:
                partner = (N - x) % modulus
                if partner not in s:
                    return False
            return True
        
        if condition_met(a, N):
            print(f"Valid sequence found for N={N}, sequence (first 10 elements): {a[:10]} ...")

# We expect for some N near modulus//2 to get large sets of valid residues.

# Finally print a summary by counting how many N satisfy this with at least 200 residues:
count_N = 0
for N in range(1, modulus):
    valid_residues = [r for r in range(max_val+1) if (N - r) % modulus <= max_val]
    if len(valid_residues) >= n:
        count_N += 1

print(f"Number of N with >= 200 valid residues: {count_N}")
```
