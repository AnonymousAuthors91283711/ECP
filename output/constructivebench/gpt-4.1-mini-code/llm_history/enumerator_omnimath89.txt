The problem considers subsets \( s \) of the integers from 1 to 50 with fixed size \( k \), and asks for the smallest \( k \) such that every subset \( s \) of size \( k \) contains two distinct elements \( a \) and \( b \) where \( a + b \mid a \cdot b \).

This is related to finding minimal cardinalities forcing existence of such pairs. To gain insight, the program will enumerate subsets of sizes \( k = 2,3,4,\ldots \) (up to a small threshold, say 5) from the set \( \{1,\ldots,10\} \) (to keep enumeration short), print any subsets without such pairs (counterexamples), or confirm that all subsets have such pairs. This can help conjecture the minimal \( k \) with the property for the full range \( 1 \ldots 50 \).

```python
from itertools import combinations

# Check if a pair (a,b) with a!=b satisfies (a+b) divides (a*b)
def divides_pair(a,b):
    return (a+b) != 0 and (a*b) % (a+b) == 0

# Check if subset s has two distinct elements a,b with (a+b)|(a*b)
def has_divisible_pair(s):
    for i,a in enumerate(s):
        for b in s[i+1:]:
            if divides_pair(a,b):
                return True
    return False

# We'll use universe from 1 to 10 to keep computations light
universe = list(range(1,11))

print("Enumerating subsets from {1..10} to check minimal k forcing pairs (a+b)|(a*b)")

for k in range(2,6):  # small sizes for speed
    print(f"\nChecking subsets of size {k}:")
    no_pair_subsets = []
    # Enumerate all subsets of size k
    for subset in combinations(universe,k):
        if not has_divisible_pair(subset):
            print(f"  No divisible pair in subset: {subset}")
            no_pair_subsets.append(subset)
    if not no_pair_subsets:
        print(f"  All subsets of size {k} contain a divisible pair (a+b)|(a*b)")
    else:
        print(f"  Number without such pairs: {len(no_pair_subsets)}")
```
This program tries small sets and prints subsets without the divisibility property, which helps in understanding minimal \( k \).
