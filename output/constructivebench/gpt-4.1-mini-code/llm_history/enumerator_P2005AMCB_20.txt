This problem concerns partitioning the fixed set \(\{-7, -5, -3, -2, 2, 4, 6, 13\}\) into two disjoint subsets \(s_1, s_2\) each of size 4, and minimizing \(n = ( \sum s_1 )^2 + ( \sum s_2 )^2\).

We can enumerate all 4-subsets \(s_1\), form \(s_2 = s \setminus s_1\), compute the sums, then print all values and identify the minimal \(n\).

```python
from itertools import combinations

# fixed set
s = [-7, -5, -3, -2, 2, 4, 6, 13]

min_n = None
print("Enumerating sums of partitions:")
for s1 in combinations(s, 4):
    s1_sum = sum(s1)
    s2 = [x for x in s if x not in s1]
    s2_sum = sum(s2)
    n = s1_sum**2 + s2_sum**2
    print(f"s1={s1}, s2={tuple(s2)}, n={n}")
    if (min_n is None) or (n < min_n):
        min_n = n

print(f"\nMinimum n = {min_n}")
```
This will print each partition's sums and the sum of squares, then output the minimum found.
