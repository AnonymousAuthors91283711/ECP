open Real

abbrev olympiadbench2482_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem olympiadbench2482 (x : ℝ) :
    (3 : ℝ)^(x + 2) + (2 : ℝ)^(x + 2) + (2 : ℝ)^x = (2 : ℝ)^(x + 5) + (3 : ℝ)^x ↔ x = olympiadbench2482_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating candidates for x in [-10, 10] in steps of 0.5:
x = 3 => f(x) ≈ 0

Refining search on intervals where sign changes:
Exact root at x = 3.0
Exact root at x = 3.0

All candidate solutions found:
x ≈ 3.000000, f(x) = 0.00e+00. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
