The problem is about finding the least nonnegative integer \( b \) such that there exists an integer \( a > 0 \) and a finite set \( s \subseteq \{P(k) : k \in [a, a+b]\} \) with each element of \( s \) equal to \( P(k) \) for some \( k \in [a, a+b] \), and \( s \) is "fragrant": for every \( x \in s \), \( x \) is not coprime with the product of the other elements.

We want to enumerate values of \( a \) and \( b \) (with small values) to find such sets \( s \) and then deduce the minimal \( b \).

Key points:

- Need to generate \( P(k) = k^2 + k + 1 \) for \( k \in [a, a+b] \).
- For each candidate \( a, b \) and subsets \( s \) of \( \{P(k) \} \), check if \( s \) is fragrant.
- Print all \( (a,b,s) \) found where fragrant holds.
- Enumerate \( b \) starting from small values upwards, then we can find the minimal one.

Strategy:
- Choose small \( b \) (e.g., from 1 to 5), for each \( b \), try \( a \) in a reasonable range (e.g., 1 to 10).
- For \( s \), consider all nonempty subsets of \( \{P(k)\} \).
- For each \( x \in s \), check gcd of \( x \) with product of rest is > 1.
- Enumerate fragrant sets as found; then output minimal \( b \).

Implement gcd with math.gcd, subsets with itertools.

The output must be brief and streaming.

```python
import math
import itertools

def P(n):
    return n*n + n + 1

def is_fragrant(s):
    # For each x in s, check gcd(x, product of others) > 1
    for i, x in enumerate(s):
        prod = 1
        for j, y in enumerate(s):
            if i != j:
                prod *= y
        if math.gcd(x, prod) == 1:
            return False
    return True

def main():
    max_b = 5
    max_a = 10

    minimal_b = None

    for b in range(1, max_b+1):
        found_for_b = False
        for a in range(1, max_a+1):
            vals = [P(k) for k in range(a, a+b+1)]
            # enumerate all nonempty subsets s of vals
            for r in range(1, len(vals)+1):
                for s in itertools.combinations(vals, r):
                    if is_fragrant(s):
                        found_for_b = True
                        print(f"a={a} b={b} s={s}")
        if found_for_b:
            minimal_b = b
            print(f"Minimal b found: {b}")
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
