[write_program]
The problem appears to involve sequences f and g defined on natural numbers up to 16 with specific recurrence relations. We want to enumerate all possible values of n = g 16 under these rules.

We have:
- f(0) = 1,
- f(k+1) = 2 * f(k) for k ≤ 16,
so f(k) = 2^k.

Then g(0) = f(16) = 2^16. For each g(m+1), there exist a,b ≤ m such that g(m+1) = g(a) - g(b). This builds g entirely from previous g-values by differences.

We want all g(16) that can be obtained this way, aiming to find the greatest n = g 16 possible.

The program will:
- Compute f values,
- Generate all possible g sequences length 17 starting with g(0) = f(16),
- For each step m from 0 to 15, compute g(m+1) by choosing pairs (a,b) with a,b ≤ m,
- Print all possible g(16) values found,
- Identify and print the maximum.

To maintain efficiency, we'll memoize visited g tuples and limit the output tokens.

```python
# Enumerate possible values of g(16) given the recurrence g(m+1) = g(a)-g(b) with a,b <= m, starting g(0)=2^16=65536.

def main():
    f16 = 2 ** 16
    from collections import deque
    max_step = 16

    # State: tuple of g values length (m+1)
    # We'll explore states incrementally by length, starting from g = [f16]
    initial = (f16,)
    visited = {initial}
    queue = deque([initial])

    g16_values = set()

    while queue:
        g = queue.popleft()
        m = len(g) - 1
        if m == max_step:
            # reached g length 17, record g16
            val = g[-1]
            print(val)
            g16_values.add(val)
            continue
        # For step m, compute g(m+1)=g(a)-g(b) with a,b <= m
        for a in range(m + 1):
            ga = g[a]
            for b in range(m + 1):
                gb = g[b]
                next_val = ga - gb
                # Append next_val to g to form new state
                ng = g + (next_val,)
                if ng not in visited:
                    visited.add(ng)
                    queue.append(ng)

    if g16_values:
        print("Max g(16):", max(g16_values))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
