The problem appears to be about finding the smallest number \( n \) such that any multiset \( s \) of elements from \(\{0,1,2\}\) with cardinality \( n \) satisfies either:
- There exists an element \( c \) that appears at least 3 times, or
- There exist three distinct elements each appearing at least once.

To explore this, we enumerate multisets \( s \) of size \( n \) from \(\{0,1,2\}\), count the occurrences of each element, and check the conditions. We start from small \( n \) and increment until the condition always holds.

```python
# Enumerate multisets s from {0,1,2} of size n,
# check if either some element appears ≥3 times,
# or all three elements appear at least once.
# Find the minimal n where this always holds.

from collections import Counter
from itertools import combinations_with_replacement

def check_condition(counts):
    # counts is a dict or list of counts of elements 0,1,2
    # Condition: ∃ c count[c] ≥ 3 OR all counts ≥1
    if any(c >= 3 for c in counts):
        return True
    if all(c >= 1 for c in counts):
        return True
    return False

def multiset_counts(n):
    # Generate all multisets (with repetition) of size n from {0,1,2}
    # Using integer partitions with 3 parts summing to n:
    # counts of 0, 1, 2 summing to n
    for c0 in range(n+1):
        for c1 in range(n+1 - c0):
            c2 = n - c0 - c1
            yield (c0, c1, c2)

def main():
    print("n and example failing multisets (c0,c1,c2 counts):")
    for n in range(1, 20):
        # For this n, check if any multiset fails condition
        failed = []
        for counts in multiset_counts(n):
            if not check_condition(counts):
                failed.append(counts)
        if not failed:
            # no failing multisets for this n
            print(f"Condition always holds at n = {n}")
            return
        else:
            # print at most 3 failing examples
            print(f"n={n}, fails on {failed[:3]} ... total {len(failed)} failing multisets")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
