The problem asks to find the smallest positive integer \( N \) such that 14 divides \( 20N \) and 20 divides \( 14N \). To help conjecture and verify the answer, we enumerate values of \( N \) and check these divisibility conditions, printing out all candidate \( N \) values found. Finally, we identify and print the minimum such \( N \).

```python
# Enumerate N up to a small threshold to find N > 0 such that
# 14 | 20N and 20 | 14N, then print candidates and the minimum.

def divides(a, b):
    return b % a == 0

candidates = []
print("N values with 14 | 20*N and 20 | 14*N:")
for N in range(1, 501):
    cond1 = divides(14, 20 * N)
    cond2 = divides(20, 14 * N)
    if cond1 and cond2:
        print(N)
        candidates.append(N)

if candidates:
    print("Minimum N:", min(candidates))
else:
    print("No candidates found up to 500")
```
