The problem seems to involve permutations \( f \) of the set \(\{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}\) and sums that depend on the permutation values and indices. We want to analyze the values of 
\[
s = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \min(f(i), 2i+1)
\]
over all permutations \( f \) of size \( n \), and find the minimum possible such \( s \).

Let's enumerate all permutations for small \( n \) (e.g., \( n = 1,2,3,4 \)) and compute the sums. We print each candidate sum as we find them and track the minimum. This can help conjecture a formula or verify a hypothesis for the minimum sum.

```python
import itertools

def min_sum_for_permutation(n):
    # Generate permutations of [0, 1, ..., n-1]
    arr = list(range(n))
    min_s = None
    print(f"n = {n}")
    for perm in itertools.permutations(arr):
        s = 0
        for i, val in enumerate(perm):
            s += min(val, 2*i + 1)
        print(f"perm={perm}, sum={s}")
        if min_s is None or s < min_s:
            min_s = s
    print(f"Minimum sum for n={n} is {min_s}\n")

# Try small values of n
for n in range(1, 5):
    min_sum_for_permutation(n)
```
This program enumerates all permutations for \(n=1,2,3,4\), prints each sum, and outputs the minimum foundâ€”streamlined and informative within the token limit.
