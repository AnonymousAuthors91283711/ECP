Ground Truth Answer: 5
Proposed Answer: 2
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves building a special sequence recursively and summing its elements modulo 10. The build_row function creates rows where each new row is constructed from the previous one by adding adjacent elements plus 1, with 1s at both ends.

2. The ground truth answer is given as 5, which suggests that the sum of the 2023rd row modulo 10 should be 5.

3. The proposed answer is 2, which differs from the ground truth.

4. Without seeing the actual calculations or proof for the proposed answer, but knowing that the ground truth is verified to be 5, we can conclude the proposed answer is incorrect.
