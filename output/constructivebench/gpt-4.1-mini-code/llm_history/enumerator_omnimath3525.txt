The problem involves finding prime numbers p such that there are at least 7 triples \( t = (t_0,t_1,t_2) \) of primes with \( t_i \in \mathbb{P} \) and a rational root x of the quadratic \( t_0 x^2 + t_1 x + t_2 = 0 \), where the prime p appears in at least one coordinate of t.

To explore this, I'll enumerate triples (t0,t1,t2) with small primes, check if the quadratic has a rational root, and count how many triples per prime appear with that prime in some coordinate.

```python
from sympy import primerange, symbols, Rational, Eq, solve, gcd
from collections import defaultdict

# Enumerate small primes to keep computations manageable
primes = list(primerange(2, 50))

x = symbols('x')
threshold = 7  # minimum ncard to consider

count_per_prime = defaultdict(int)
triples_per_prime = defaultdict(set)

def has_rational_root(a, b, c):
    if a == 0:
        if b == 0:
            return False
        # Linear equation bx + c = 0, root = -c/b rational if b divides c
        root = Rational(-c, b)
        return True
    # Quadratic: a x^2 + b x + c = 0
    # Rational root theorem: root = p/q in lowest terms s.t. p|c and q|a
    # We'll check all such candidates
    from sympy.core.numbers import igcd

    a_abs, c_abs = abs(a), abs(c)
    # List divisors
    def divisors(n):
        divs = set()
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            if n % i == 0:
                divs.add(i)
        return divs

    p_divs = divisors(c_abs)
    q_divs = divisors(a_abs)

    for p_ in p_divs:
        for q_ in q_divs:
            for sign_p in [1, -1]:
                for sign_q in [1, -1]:
                    numerator = sign_p * p_
                    denominator = sign_q * q_
                    # simplify fraction
                    g = gcd(numerator, denominator)
                    r = Rational(numerator//g, denominator//g)
                    # Substitute and check zero
                    val = a*r*r + b*r + c
                    if val == 0:
                        return True
    return False

# We'll check all triples of primes with repetition allowed up to 50
for a in primes:
    for b in primes:
        for c_ in primes:
            if has_rational_root(a,b,c_):
                triple = (a,b,c_)
                # increment counts for primes appearing in triple
                for p in set(triple):
                    triples_per_prime[p].add(triple)

# Now count triples per prime and print primes with at least threshold triples
print(f"Primes with at least {threshold} qualifying triples:")
for p in sorted(primes):
    count = len(triples_per_prime[p])
    if count >= threshold:
        print(f"Prime {p}: {count} triples")
        # Print all triples involving p
        for t in sorted(triples_per_prime[p]):
            print(t)
```
