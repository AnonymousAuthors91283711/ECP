[write_program]
The problem asks for 100! modulo 101, where 101 is prime. By Wilson's theorem, (p-1)! ≡ -1 mod p for a prime p. Here, p=101, so 100! ≡ -1 mod 101. I'll write a Python program to compute 100! mod 101 by direct enumeration and confirm the result, streaming partial products.

```python
# Compute n! mod m and print intermediate factorial mod values.
def factorial_mod(n, m):
    prod = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        prod = (prod * i) % m
        # Print intermediate factorial mod values for verification.
        print(f"{i}! ≡ {prod} (mod {m})")
    return prod

if __name__ == "__main__":
    n, m = 100, 101
    print(f"Computing {n}! mod {m}")
    answer = factorial_mod(n, m)
    print(f"{n}! mod {m} = {answer}")
```
