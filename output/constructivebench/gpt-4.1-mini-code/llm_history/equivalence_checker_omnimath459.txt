Ground Truth Answer: 499500
Proposed Answer: (1000000 / 1000) + 1
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
1. We're counting numbers from 1 to 1,000,000 where n mod 1000 > n mod 1001
2. The condition n mod 1000 > n mod 1001 is quite specific and requires careful analysis

Ground Truth Answer:
- 499500 is given as the correct count

Proposed Answer:
- (1000000 / 1000) + 1 = 1000 + 1 = 1001

Comparison:
1. The proposed answer (1001) is vastly different from the ground truth (499500)
2. The proposed answer seems to just count multiples of 1000 plus one, which doesn't relate to the actual condition
3. The correct solution would involve analyzing the relationship between n mod 1000 and n mod 1001, which is more complex

Conclusion:
The proposed answer is incorrect and not equivalent to the ground truth.

<<<False>>>
