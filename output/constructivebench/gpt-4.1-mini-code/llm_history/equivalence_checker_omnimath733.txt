Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: { n | 0 < n ∧ (n + 1) % 210 = 0 ∧ (digits 10 n).length ≤ 12 ∧ (digits 10 n).sum = 2 * (digits 10 n).length ∧
  ∀ i : Fin (digits 10 n).length, (Even i.val ↔ (digits 10 n)[i] = 0) ∧ (¬ Even i.val ↔ (digits 10 n)[i] = 2) }
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer captures most of the conditions correctly (n > 0, divisibility condition, digit sum condition, and length constraint). However, there are two issues:
1. The condition on even indices is more restrictive in the proposed answer (specifically requiring digits to be 0 or 2) compared to the original problem which just requires a correspondence between digit parity and index parity.
2. The proposed answer uses `i.val` instead of `i.toNat`, which are technically equivalent but not identical in form.

The answer is mostly correct but has these subtle differences, hence "Close".
