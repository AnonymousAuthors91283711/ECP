The problem seems to involve counting how many numbers in the range 1 to 100 end up "red" after painting operations defined by divisibility and parity conditions. For each number n, we check integers k = 1 to 50; if k divides n, we flip color based on k's parity. We want to enumerate all n in [1..100] for which the total flips is odd.

Below is a Python program mimicking this logic. It prints each n that is red after painting, i.e., those for which the number of divisors among 1 to 50 with odd k is an odd count. This enumeration can help conjecture the answer.

```python
def is_red_after_painting(n):
    # For k in 1..50, if k divides n, consider color flip if k is odd
    flips = [k % 2 == 1 for k in range(1, 51) if n % k == 0]
    # Count how many flips are True (odd k), parity determines final color
    return sum(flips) % 2 == 1

print("Red numbers n in [1..100]:")
red_numbers = []
for n in range(1, 101):
    if is_red_after_painting(n):
        print(n)
        red_numbers.append(n)

print(f"Count of red numbers in [1..100]: {len(red_numbers)}")
```
