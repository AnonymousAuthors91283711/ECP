The problem asks to find the greatest real number \( m \) such that for all positive real numbers \( a, b, c \),

\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc \ge m \left(|a-b|^3 + |b-c|^3 + |c-a|^3\right).
\]

We will enumerate candidate values of \( m \) by checking the inequality for several triples \( (a, b, c) \) with small positive values. We print each \( m \) for which the inequality holds across all tested triples. This may help conjecturing the largest such \( m \).

```python
import math
from itertools import product

def lhs(a, b, c):
    return a**3 + b**3 + c**3 - 3*a*b*c

def rhs(m, a, b, c):
    return m * (abs(a - b)**3 + abs(b - c)**3 + abs(c - a)**3)

# Test triples with a,b,c from {1,2,3}
test_values = [1, 2, 3]
triples = [t for t in product(test_values, repeat=3) if all(x > 0 for x in t)]

print("Testing candidate values of m with samples a,b,c in {1,2,3}")

# Candidate m searched as rational numbers with denominator 10 from 0 to 2
for numerator in range(-20, 21):  # Check negatives and positives
    m = numerator / 10
    valid = True
    for a, b, c in triples:
        if lhs(a, b, c) < rhs(m, a, b, c):
            valid = False
            break
    if valid:
        print(f"Candidate m = {m}")

# Among printed candidates, the greatest will be the largest m tested that holds for all.
```
