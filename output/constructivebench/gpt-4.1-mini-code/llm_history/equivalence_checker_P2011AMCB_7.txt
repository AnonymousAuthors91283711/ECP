Ground Truth Answer: fun (x, y) => x / y
Proposed Answer: fun p : ℕ × ℕ => (60 + p.1) / (60 - p.1 : ℚ)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the maximum value of x/y where x and y are two-digit numbers (10-99) whose average is 60.

2. The ground truth answer simply takes the ratio x/y directly.

3. The proposed answer expresses the ratio in terms of the difference from 60: (60 + p.1)/(60 - p.1).

Let's verify if they're equivalent:
- Given that (x + y)/2 = 60, we can express y = 120 - x
- Therefore, x/y = x/(120 - x)
- The proposed answer (60 + p.1)/(60 - p.1) where p.1 = x - 60 (the difference from 60)
- So (60 + (x-60))/(60 - (x-60)) = x/(120 - x) which matches x/y

The expressions are mathematically equivalent, just written differently. The proposed answer is a valid reparameterization.
