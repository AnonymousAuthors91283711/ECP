The problem involves summing over all permutations π of {0,...,9} the count of triples (i,j,k) with i<j<k such that π(j) < π(k) < π(i). We will enumerate permutations of [0..9] and count these triples for each. Since 10! = 3,628,800 is large, we reduce by trying a subset of permutations and print sample counts to conjecture the total. We'll print the sum for sampled permutations and note pattern observations.

```python
from math import comb
from itertools import permutations

def count_triples(p):
    # p is a tuple representing permutation
    count = 0
    n = len(p)
    # i < j < k means indices with i<j<k
    # Condition: p[j] < p[k] < p[i]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            for k in range(j+1, n):
                if p[j] < p[k] < p[i]:
                    count += 1
    return count

def main():
    n = 5  # smaller n due to complexity; original is 10 but 5! =120 permutations manageable here
    total_sum = 0
    perms = list(permutations(range(n)))
    print(f"Enumerating {len(perms)} permutations of [0..{n-1}]")
    for idx, p in enumerate(perms, 1):
        c = count_triples(p)
        print(f"Permutation {idx}: {p} -> count triples = {c}")
        total_sum += c
    print(f"Sum over all permutations: {total_sum}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
