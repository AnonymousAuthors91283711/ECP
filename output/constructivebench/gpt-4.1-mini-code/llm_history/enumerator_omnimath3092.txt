The problem involves finding natural numbers \( t \) and \( s \) satisfying:
\[
3 + t = 5, \quad t + s = 7,
\]
and then computing the value of:
\[
t + t + t + s + s.
\]
I'll write a Python program to enumerate possible values of \( t \) and \( s \) satisfying the constraints (here \( t, s \in \mathbb{N} \)) and print the value of the expression \(3t + 2s\).

```python
# Enumerate natural numbers t, s satisfying the equations:
# 3 + t = 5, t + s = 7, then compute 3*t + 2*s.

def main():
    for t in range(10):  # small enough range for natural numbers
        if 3 + t == 5:
            for s in range(10):
                if t + s == 7:
                    value = 3*t + 2*s
                    print(f"t={t}, s={s}, 3t+2s={value}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
