Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {n : ℕ | ∃ k : ℕ, k > 0 ∧ n = 3^k}
<<<None>>>

Since the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's intentionally left undefined in Lean), we cannot verify the equivalence between the proposed answer and the ground truth. The proposed answer suggests that the solution set consists of powers of 3, but without knowing the actual ground truth, we cannot confirm or deny this. Therefore, the appropriate response is "None" (unsure about their equivalence).
