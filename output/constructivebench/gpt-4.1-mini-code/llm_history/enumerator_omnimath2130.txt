The problem involves integer polynomials \( P \) of degree at most 7, with coefficients in \([-7,7]\), which can be expressed as the sum of a polynomial \( Q \) having root 4, and a polynomial \( R \) with coefficients in \([-1,1]\). We want to enumerate all such polynomials \( P \).

We will:

- Enumerate all \( Q \) with integer coefficients such that \( Q(4) = 0 \) and \(\deg(Q) \le 7\) with coefficients in \([-7,7]\) (or slightly larger bounds to ensure closure after sum).
- Enumerate all \( R \) with coefficients in \([-1,1]\), degree at most 7.
- Sum each \( Q+R \) and keep those with coefficients in \([-7,7]\).

We print each \( P \) found immediately (as a tuple of coefficients), ensure no duplicates, and print total count at the end.

We'll choose a manageable coefficient range for \( Q \) to limit computation and demonstrate the method.

```python
# Enumerate polynomials P over ℤ with deg ≤7, coefficients in [-7,7],
# such that P = Q + R, Q has root 4, Q coeffs in [-7,7], R coeffs in [-1,1].

from itertools import product

def eval_poly(coeffs, x):
    return sum(c * (x**i) for i, c in enumerate(coeffs))

def add_poly(a, b):
    return tuple(ac + bc for ac, bc in zip(a, b))

def coeffs_in_range(coeffs, low, high):
    return all(low <= c <= high for c in coeffs)

# Degree 7 polynomials represented by 8 coeffs: c0 + c1 X + ... + c7 X^7

deg = 7
coeff_range_Q = range(-7,8)
coeff_range_R = range(-1,2)
coeff_range_P = (-7,7)

# To reduce complexity, note that Q(4)=0 means:
# sum c_i * 4^i = 0
# For a given choice of first 7 coeffs of Q, we can solve c7:
# c7 = (-sum_{i=0..6} c_i * 4^i) / 4^7 = integer?
# Because 4^7=16384, c7 should be integer with |c7|<=7

powers = [4**i for i in range(deg+1)]

found = set()

print("Enumerating suitable polynomials P:")

for q_coeffs_0_6 in product(coeff_range_Q, repeat=7):
    s = sum(c * p for c, p in zip(q_coeffs_0_6, powers[:7]))
    if s % powers[7] != 0:
        continue
    c7 = -s // powers[7]
    if c7 not in coeff_range_Q:
        continue
    q_coeffs = q_coeffs_0_6 + (c7,)
    # Now enumerate R with coeffs in [-1,1]:
    for r_coeffs in product(coeff_range_R, repeat=8):
        p_coeffs = add_poly(q_coeffs, r_coeffs)
        if coeffs_in_range(p_coeffs, coeff_range_P[0], coeff_range_P[1]):
            if p_coeffs not in found:
                found.add(p_coeffs)
                print(p_coeffs)

print(f"Total distinct polynomials P found: {len(found)}")
```
