The problem defines four rational numbers \( w, x, y, z \) with relations:
- \( w = \frac{4}{3} x \)
- \( y = \frac{3}{2} z \)
- \( z = \frac{1}{6} x \)

We want to find the value of \( \frac{w}{y} \).

We'll enumerate sampled rational values of \( x \) (denominator 1 to keep values simple), compute \( w, y, z \), then compute \( \frac{w}{y} \).

Because all relations are linear rational, the ratio \( \frac{w}{y} \) should be constant, independent of \( x \).

The program below checks this, printing all intermediate values and confirming the value.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Enumerate sample values for x
for denom in range(1, 4):       # denominators from 1 to 3 for variation
    for num in range(1, 5):     # numerators from 1 to 4
        x = Fraction(num, denom)
        w = Fraction(4,3) * x
        z = Fraction(1,6) * x
        y = Fraction(3,2) * z
        ratio = w / y
        print(f"x = {x}, w = {w}, z = {z}, y = {y}, w/y = {ratio}")

# Based on the theoretical calculation:
# w/y = (4/3 * x) / (3/2 * (1/6 * x)) = (4/3) / ((3/2)*(1/6)) = (4/3) / (3/12) = (4/3) / (1/4) = (4/3)*(4/1) = 16/3

print("\nConjectured exact ratio w/y = 16/3")
```
