The problem involves characterizing pairs of positive integers \((a,b)\) such that the greatest common divisor \(\gcd(a^n + b, b^n + a)\) stabilizes to a constant \(g\) for sufficiently large \(n\).

To gain insight, we will enumerate pairs \((a,b)\) for small values (say \(1 \le a,b \le 10\)) and compute \(\gcd(a^n + b, b^n + a)\) for \(n\) from 1 up to some small limit (like 10), tracking if the gcd stabilizes to a fixed number for all subsequent \(n\). We print any pairs \((a,b)\) for which the gcd stabilizes to a constant after some point \(N\). This experimental enumeration may help conjecture the set \(\text{omnimath4308_answer}\).

```python
from math import gcd

def compute_gcd_sequence(a, b, max_n=20):
    # Compute gcd(a^n + b, b^n + a) for n=1..max_n
    seq = []
    for n in range(1, max_n+1):
        val1 = pow(a, n) + b
        val2 = pow(b, n) + a
        g = gcd(val1, val2)
        seq.append(g)
    return seq

def is_eventually_constant(seq):
    # Check if seq stabilizes to a constant from some index N onward
    for start in range(len(seq)):
        s = seq[start]
        if all(x == s for x in seq[start:]):
            return True, start + 1, s  # N and stable gcd
    return False, None, None

def main():
    max_val = 10
    max_n = 15
    print(f"Enumerating pairs (a,b) with 1 <= a,b <= {max_val}")
    for a in range(1, max_val+1):
        for b in range(1, max_val+1):
            seq = compute_gcd_sequence(a, b, max_n)
            stable, N, g = is_eventually_constant(seq)
            if stable:
                print(f"(a,b)=({a},{b}) stabilizes at N={N} with gcd={g}")
                # Also print first few gcds for insight
                print(f"  gcd sequence: {seq[:max_n]}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This code explores pairs and prints stabilized gcd results, enabling conjecturing the structure of the set \(\text{omnimath4308_answer}\).
