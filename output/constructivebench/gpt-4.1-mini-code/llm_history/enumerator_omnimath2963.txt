This problem concerns the probability that a uniformly selected pair (s, t) from ΩS × ΩT satisfies s > t, with ΩS = {1,2,3,4} and ΩT = {1,2,3,4,5,6}. We want to enumerate how many pairs meet s > t, print each such pair and count, then print the final probability as a Rational number.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Define the sets
ΩS = [1, 2, 3, 4]
ΩT = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

count = 0
total = len(ΩS) * len(ΩT)

print("Pairs (s,t) with s > t:")
for s in ΩS:
    for t in ΩT:
        if s > t:
            count += 1
            print(f"({s}, {t})")

print(f"Count = {count}")
prob = Fraction(count, total)
print(f"Probability = {prob} (exact fraction)")
print(f"Probability ≈ {float(prob):.4f} (approx)")
```
