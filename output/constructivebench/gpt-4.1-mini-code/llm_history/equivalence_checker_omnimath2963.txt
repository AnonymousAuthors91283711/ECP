Ground Truth Answer: 1/4
Proposed Answer: (6 : ℚ) / (4 * 6)
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer simplifies to 6/24, which reduces to 1/4, matching the ground truth answer. Both answers represent the same probability calculation for the event where s > t in the product space ΩS × ΩT. The count of favorable outcomes is indeed 6 (pairs (2,1), (3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2), (4,3)), and the total number of outcomes is 4×6=24.
