[write_program]
The problem describes a 3x3 matrix M with rational entries and several constraints:
- Three fixed entries: M00=8, M01=1, M11=5, M22=4
- Equal sums of first and second rows: sum of row0 = sum of row1
- Equal sums of first and second columns: sum of col0 = sum of col1
- Equal sums of two diagonals:
  M00+M11+M22 = M02+M11+M20

We want to find M02. To assist with conjecturing M02, write a program enumerating possible integers rational values for the other unknown entries M02, M10, M12, M20, M21 that satisfy these constraints. We'll try integer values in a small range and print any possible solution's M02 immediately.

Note: Since three entries are fixed, and constraints tie together sums, the solution for M02 should be unique. Enumerating will find candidates.

```python
# enumerator.py
from fractions import Fraction

# Fixed entries
M00 = Fraction(8)
M01 = Fraction(1)
M11 = Fraction(5)
M22 = Fraction(4)

# We'll vary unknowns: M02, M10, M12, M20, M21
# Define a small search space for enumeration
search_range = range(-5, 6)  # from -5 to 5

print("Enumerating possible matrices with given constraints...\n")

found_solutions = []

                    row0_sum = M00 + M01 + M02
                    row1_sum = M10 + M11 + M12
                    if row0_sum != row1_sum:
