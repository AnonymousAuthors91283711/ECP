Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {x | x = 1 / 2 ∨ x = (sqrt 5 - 1) / 2 ∨ x = -(sqrt 5 + 1) / 2}
<<<None>>>
Since the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's not provided), we cannot verify whether the proposed answer is equivalent to it. The proposed answer provides three roots for the equation, but without knowing the correct solution set, we cannot determine if these are all the roots or if they're correct. The equation is a 9th-degree polynomial, which could have up to 9 roots (real and complex), so the proposed solution might be incomplete. Therefore, we must return "None" as we cannot verify the equivalence.
