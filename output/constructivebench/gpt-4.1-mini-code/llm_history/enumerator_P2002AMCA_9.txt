The problem involves finding the least natural number \( d \) such that there exists a function \( f: \{0,\ldots,29\} \to \{4,7,8\} \) with exactly three values 8 and twelve values 7, and the rest 4 (since \(30 - 3 - 12 = 15\) values), and a partition \( g: \{0,\ldots,29\} \to \{0,\ldots,d-1\} \) such that the sum of \( f(i) \) values in each part is at most 144.

We want to enumerate \( d \) starting from a low bound upward, searching for such partitions.

A direct brute force over all possible \( f \) is huge, but the constraint on the numbers limits the search. Still, enumerating all 30 choose 3 subsets for 8s, and 27 choose 12 subsets for 7s is still big, so we reduce enumeration:

- Enumerate only one fixed \( f \) arrangement (since the problem is symmetric in indices).
- We'll fix positions of 8s as first 3 indices, 7s as next 12, and 4s rest.
- Then for \( d \) in a reasonable range, try to assign the 30 elements to \( d \) parts so that no part exceeds 144 sum.

This is equivalent to partitioning the multiset \{8,8,8,7...7 (12 times), 4...4 (15 times)\} into \( d \) bins with capacity 144.

This is a bin packing / partition problem with capacity 144.

Sum total:

Sum = 3*8 + 12*7 + 15*4
= 24 + 84 + 60 = 168.

Minimum number of bins needed at least total_sum / capacity = 168 / 144 = 1.166... so minimum bins at least 2.

Try to find minimal \( d \) with such a feasible packing.

We can attempt a simple backtracking, but 3*8 + 12*7 + 15*4 = 30 items.

Try \( d \) from 2 to 6, say.

Print \( d \) and any found partition immediately.

We'll perform a simple quick heuristic: Since largest value is 8, capacity 144 means up to 18 eights per bin theoretically (much more), so bin arrangement possible for small d.

Let's write the enumerator to output found \( d \) and partitions for the fixed \( f \).

```python
# Program to enumerate suitable d (number of bins) and possible partitions of the multiset with:
# 3 times 8, 12 times 7, 15 times 4, into bins of max sum 144
# The goal is to find minimal d allowing partition.

from itertools import combinations
import sys

# Define the multiset f
items = [8]*3 + [7]*12 + [4]*15  # length 30
total_sum = sum(items)

# We try d from 2 upwards, print results on success.

def can_pack(items, bins, capacity):
    # bins is a list of current sums of bins, length = d
    # items is list of items to assign
    # We'll try to assign items recursively
    
    if not items:
        return True
    
    item = items[0]
    for i in range(len(bins)):
        if bins[i] + item <= capacity:
            bins[i] += item
            if can_pack(items[1:], bins, capacity):
                return True
            bins[i] -= item
        # If bin is empty and item doesn't fit, no need to try other empty bins
        if bins[i] == 0:
            break
    return False

def main():
    capacity = 144
    # minimal d at least ceil(total_sum / capacity)
    from math import ceil

    min_d = ceil(total_sum / capacity)
    max_d = 10  # cap search at 10 to keep output short
    
    print(f"Total sum: {total_sum}, capacity: {capacity}")
    print("Trying d from", min_d, "to", max_d)
    
    for d in range(min_d, max_d+1):
        bins = [0]*d
        # Sort items descending for better pruning
        items_sorted = sorted(items, reverse=True)
        
        if can_pack(items_sorted, bins, capacity):
            print(f"Found feasible partition for d = {d}")
            # We could print a witness partition but the problem only specifies enumerating candidates
            # We'll print just d here, as a candidate
            print(d)
        else:
            print(f"No feasible partition for d = {d}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
