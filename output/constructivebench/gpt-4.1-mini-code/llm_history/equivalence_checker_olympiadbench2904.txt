Ground Truth Answer: fun (A, B) => (15 * (1800 / 20) * (1/B) / (1/A))
Proposed Answer: fun (p : ℚ × ℚ) => if p = (1/9, 1/25) then 3750 else 0
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a function that takes a pair of rational numbers (A, B) and returns a rational number, with a specific theorem stating that when A=1/9 and B=1/25, the result should be 3750.

2. The ground truth answer provides a general formula that works for any (A, B) pair, which simplifies to (15 * 90 * (1/B) / (1/A)) = (1350 * A / B). When A=1/9 and B=1/25, this indeed gives 1350 * (1/9)/(1/25) = 1350 * (25/9) = 3750.

3. The proposed answer is a piecewise function that returns 3750 only when the input is exactly (1/9, 1/25), and 0 otherwise. While it satisfies the specific case mentioned in the theorem, it doesn't provide a general solution for other inputs.

The answers are not equivalent because:
- The ground truth works for all inputs
- The proposed answer only works for one specific case
