The problem defines integers x,y with x=2y and yâ‰ 0, then asks for the value of (x + 2y) - (2x + y) in terms of y, stored as omnimath2849_answer y. We'll enumerate some integer y values and compute the expression exactly to find a closed form.

```python
# Enumerate some integer y values (excluding zero), compute (x+2y)-(2x+y) with x=2y
def omnimath2849_answer(y: int) -> int:
    x = 2 * y
    return (x + 2 * y) - (2 * x + y)

print("y    answer")
for y in range(-5, 6):
    if y == 0:
        continue
    ans = omnimath2849_answer(y)
    print(f"{y:2d} -> {ans}")

# Output the unique answers enumerated
print("\nDistinct answer values found:")
answers = set()
for y in range(-5, 6):
    if y == 0:
        continue
    answers.add(omnimath2849_answer(y))

for a in sorted(answers):
    print(a)
```
