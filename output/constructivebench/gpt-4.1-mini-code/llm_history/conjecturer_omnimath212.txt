The error arises because the set notation in Lean expects a predicate (a condition on functions) of type `f : ℝ → ℝ → Prop`, but the provided expression mixes functions and propositions incorrectly. In particular, `f = 0` is interpreted as `f = (0 : ℝ → ℝ)` which Lean does not accept directly, since `0` is a number, not a function. Similarly, `fun x => x^2` is a function of type `ℝ → ℝ`, so `f = fun x => x^2` is a proposition, and these are combined incorrectly with `∨` inside set-builder notation in Lean.

To fix this, we need to write the answer as the set containing exactly these three functions:

1. the zero function `fun x => 0`,
2. the function `fun x => x^2`,
3. the function `fun x => -x^2`.

We use `Set` notation with `insert` or `finset`, or simply write the set as ` {zero_fun, sq_fun, neg_sq_fun}` where each is defined as functions.

Hence the fixed expression is:

```lean
{fun x => (0 : ℝ), fun x => x^2, fun x => - x^2}
```

This is a `Set (ℝ → ℝ)` with three distinct functions.
