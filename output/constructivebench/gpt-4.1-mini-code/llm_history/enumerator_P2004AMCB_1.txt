The problem is to find the unique natural number \( x \) such that \( x \times 2^4 = 48 \). Since \( 2^4 = 16 \), we want to find \( x \) with \( 16x = 48 \). Let's write a Python program to enumerate possible natural numbers \( x \) up to a reasonable threshold and check the condition. We will print each \( x \) satisfying the equation and finally print the unique solution.

```python
# Enumerate natural numbers x and check if x * 2^4 == 48
def main():
    target = 48
    power = 2 ** 4  # 16
    max_x = target  # upper bound for search

    solutions = []
    for x in range(max_x + 1):
        val = x * power
        if val == target:
            print(f"Found solution: x = {x}")
            solutions.append(x)
        elif val > target:
            break  # no need to continue

    if solutions:
        print(f"Unique solution: x = {solutions[0]}")
    else:
        print("No solution found")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
