The problem asks for the smallest natural number \( k \) such that there exist two nonempty subsets \( s_1, s_2 \subseteq \{1, 2, ..., 2016\} \) with 
\[
|s_1| + |s_2| = 4032 - k
\]
and the product polynomials
\[
\prod_{i \in s_1} (x - (i+1)) \neq \prod_{i \in s_2} (x - (i+1))
\]
for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \).

Since \(s_1, s_2 \subseteq \{1,\dots, 2016\}\), \(|s_1|, |s_2|\) are between 1 and 2016, so the sum ranges between 2 and 4032.

We want to test various sums \(\sigma = |s_1| + |s_2|\) starting from the maximum \(4032\) downwards, and check whether one can choose subsets \( s_1, s_2 \) so that the two polynomials are different functions (so do not coincide everywhere).

Note that the two products are monic polynomials whose roots are just the elements of \(s_1\) shifted by 1, and similarly for \(s_2\).

They are equal as polynomials iff the multisets \( \{i+1| i \in s_1\} \) and \( \{j+1 | j \in s_2\} \) coincide (order does not matter).

Therefore, the polynomials are unequal iff the sets \(s_1\) and \(s_2\) differ as multisets.

Because each polynomial is determined by its roots, if the multisets of roots coincide, the polynomials match as functions. Otherwise different.

So the condition \(\forall x, \prod_{i \in s_1}(x-(i+1)) \neq \prod_{i \in s_2} (x-(i+1))\) means \(s_1 \neq s_2\).

Hence the problem reduces to finding minimal \(k\) so that there exist nonempty subsets \(s_1, s_2\) of \(\{1,...,2016\}\) such that \( |s_1| + |s_2| = 4032 - k\) and \(s_1 \neq s_2\).

Since \( |s_1|, |s_2| \leq 2016\), the maximal sum is 4032 (if \(s_1 = s_2 = \{1,...,2016\}\)).

To have \(s_1 \neq s_2\) on this sum \(=4032\), impossible (both full set, so equal).

So for sum \(4032\), no two distinct subsets \(s_1, s_2\) have sum 4032.

Try sum = 4031. For sum to be \(4031\), we must have one subset of size 2016 and the other size 2015.

Can we find two distinct subsets \(s_1\) size 2016 and \(s_2\) size 2015 in \(\{1,...,2016\}\) such that \(s_1 \neq s_2\)?

Yes, for example:

- \(s_1 = \{1,2,...,2016\}\) (full set)

- \(s_2 = \{1,2,...,2015\}\)

They differ and sum is 2016 + 2015 = 4031 = 4032 - 1

So these subsets satisfy the polynomial inequality condition.

Hence the minimal \(k\) is at most 1.

Can \(k=0\) hold? No, as above.

So minimal \(k=1\).

I will now enumerate sum of sizes going down from 4032 to 4030, generating pairs of subsets to verify.

Because subsets are numerous, we only enumerate size pairs and print sample subsets illustrating properties.

```python
# enumerator.py
# Enumerate pairs of subset sizes from 2016 down, test if distinct subsets with sum sizes possible

def subsets_of_size(n, size):
    """
    Generate a small sample of subsets for given size from range(n).

    - full first 'size' elements
    - next shifted 'size' elements if possible
    """
    base = set(range(1, size+1))
    yield base
    if size < n:
        shifted = set(range(2, size+2))
        yield shifted

        for s1_size in range(1, n+1):
            s2_size = total - s1_size
            if not (1 <= s2_size <= n):
                continue
            # Generate two sample subsets for each size to test distinctness

                for s2 in s2_samples:
                    if s1 != s2:
                        print(f"Found distinct subsets with sizes {s1_size}, {s2_size}")
                        print(f"s1 sample roots: {sorted(s1)}")
