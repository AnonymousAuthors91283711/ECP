No n <= 30 has count >= 5. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
The count corresponds to the number of positive integers k such that -k² - 2k + n ≥ 0. Rearranged: k² + 2k ≤ n. The maximum k satisfying k(k+2) ≤ n is floor((√(4+4n) - 2)/2). The count is that max k, so for count ≥ 5, minimal n satisfies k=5: 5*7=35 ≤ n. Thus minimal such n is 35.
