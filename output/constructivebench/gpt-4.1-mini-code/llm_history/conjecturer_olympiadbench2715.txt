abbrev olympiadbench2715_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem olympiadbench2715 : 
  ∃ (s : Finset ℝ), (∀ x ∈ s, ⌊x / 2⌋ - ⌊x / 3⌋ = x / 7) ∧ 
  (∀ x ∉ s, ¬(⌊x / 2⌋ - ⌊x / 3⌋ = x / 7)) ∧ 
  s.sum id = olympiadbench2715_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Searching for real x with floor(x/2)-floor(x/3) = x/7
x = -28
x = -14
x = -7
x = 0
x = 7
x = 21
Sum of all such x: -21. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
