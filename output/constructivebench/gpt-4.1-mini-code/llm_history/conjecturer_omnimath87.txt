. Enumerated answers: Testing f(t) = c * t^k for c in [-2.0, -1.5, -1.0, -0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0] and k in [0, 1, 2, 3]
Candidate function: f(t) = 0.0*t^0
Candidate function: f(t) = 0.0*t^1
Candidate function: f(t) = 0.0*t^2
Candidate function: f(t) = 0.0*t^3
Candidate function: f(t) = 0.5*t^1
Candidate function: f(t) = 1.0*t^1
Candidate function: f(t) = 1.5*t^1
Candidate function: f(t) = 2.0*t^1
Checking constant functions
Constant solution: f(t) = 0.0
Checking linear functions with positive slopes
Linear candidate: f(t) = 0.0*t where c >= 0
Linear candidate: f(t) = 0.5*t where c >= 0
Linear candidate: f(t) = 1.0*t where c >= 0
Linear candidate: f(t) = 1.5*t where c >= 0
Linear candidate: f(t) = 2.0*t where c >= 0
Summary: Possible candidates from enumeration:
- f(t) = 0
- f(t) = c*t with c >= 0. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ → ℝ)
<<<{f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ c ≥ 0, ∀ t : ℝ, f t = c * t}>>>
