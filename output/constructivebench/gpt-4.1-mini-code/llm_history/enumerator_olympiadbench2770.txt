The problem involves expressing a fixed complex number z = -142 + 333√5 i as the product of two complex numbers of the form (a + b√5 i) and (c + d√5 i), with positive integers a,b,c,d. We want to find the minimum of (a+b) and (c+d) among all such factorizations.

A natural approach is to:
- Iterate over small positive integers a,b,c,d within sensible bounds,
- Check if (a + b√5 i)*(c + d√5 i) equals z,
- Print the values of (a,b,c,d) and the minimum sum,
- Keep track of the smallest minimum sum found.

Since z is fixed at (-142, 333), and a,b,c,d > 0, and the product is:
(a + b√5 i)*(c + d√5 i) = (ac - 5bd) + (ad + bc)√5 i
which must equal -142 + 333√5 i.

We get two equations:
ac - 5bd = -142
ad + bc = 333

We can attempt to find integer solutions by enumerating a,b,c,d. To limit search, try a,b,c,d up to 20 or so, printing any solution found.

```python
# Enumerate integer quadruples (a,b,c,d) with positive a,b,c,d
# satisfying (a + b*sqrt(5)*i)*(c + d*sqrt(5)*i) == -142 + 333*sqrt(5)*i
# i.e., ac - 5bd = -142 and ad + bc = 333
# For each solution, print a,b,c,d and min(a+b, c+d)
# Finally, print the minimum minimum found.

def main():
    z_real = -142
    z_imag = 333
    max_val = 20  # search bound
    best_min_sum = None
    best_solutions = []

    for a in range(1, max_val+1):
        for b in range(1, max_val+1):
            for c in range(1, max_val+1):
                # From first eq: ac -5bd = -142 -> d = (ac +142)/(5b)
                # d must be positive integer
                numerator = a*c + 142
                denom = 5*b
                if numerator % denom != 0:
                    continue
                d = numerator // denom
                if d <= 0 or d > max_val:
                    continue
                # Check second eq: ad + bc == 333
                if a*d + b*c == z_imag:
                    min_sum = min(a + b, c + d)
                    print(f"Solution: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}, min(a+b,c+d)={min_sum}")
                    if best_min_sum is None or min_sum < best_min_sum:
                        best_min_sum = min_sum
                        best_solutions = [(a,b,c,d)]
                    elif min_sum == best_min_sum:
                        best_solutions.append((a,b,c,d))

    if best_min_sum is not None:
        print(f"Minimum min(a+b, c+d) found: {best_min_sum}")
        print("Solutions achieving minimum:")
        for sol in best_solutions:
            a,b,c,d = sol
            print(f" a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}")
    else:
        print("No solutions found within search bound.")
