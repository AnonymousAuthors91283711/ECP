The problem is about finding the smallest positive integer \( p \) such that there exist two distinct pairs \((a_1,b_1)\) and \((a_2,b_2)\) of nonnegative integers satisfying:
- \( 2a_1 + b_1 = p \) and \( 2a_2 + b_2 = p \),
- \( a_i > b_i \),
- \( b_1 b_2 = 56 \),
- \( b_1 \sqrt{4 a_1^2 - b_1^2} = b_2 \sqrt{4 a_2^2 - b_2^2} \),
- and the pairs are distinct.

I will enumerate factorizations of 56 into positive integers \(b_1,b_2\), then for each pair try to find integer \(a_1,a_2\) satisfying the equalities and inequalities, computing \( p = 2a_i+b_i \), and printing all candidate \(p\). I'll restrict the search space to small \(a_i,b_i \leq 50\) for feasibility and print results as found.

```python
import math

# Enumerate factor pairs (b1,b2) with b1*b2=56, b1,b2>0, b1!=b2
factor_pairs = [(b1,b2) for b1 in range(1,57) if 56 % b1 == 0 for b2 in [56//b1] if b1 != b2]

found = []
# To keep track of minimal p (2a+b)
min_p = None

print("Enumerating solutions with b1*b2=56, b1!=b2:")

    for a1 in range(b1+1, 51):  # a1 > b1
        val1_sq = 4*a1*a1 - b1*b1
        if val1_sq <=0: 
            continue
        sqrt_val1 = math.isqrt(val1_sq)
        if sqrt_val1*sqrt_val1 != val1_sq:
            continue
        # From equality: b1*sqrt_val1 = b2*sqrt_val2 => sqrt_val2 = (b1/b2)*sqrt_val1

        a2_sq = four_a2_sq // 4

            continue

        p1 = 2*a1 + b1
        p2 = 2*a2 + b2
        if p1 != p2:
            continue
        p = p1
        print(f"p={p}, (a1,b1)=({a1},{b1}), (a2,b2)=({a2},{b2})")
        found.append(p)
        if min_p is None or p < min_p:
            min_p = p
