Explanation: The problem asks for the least n≥1 such that an infinite set of positive rational n-vectors has integer sums and integer sums of reciprocals. From enumeration, n=1 works trivially but infinite distinct vectors fail. For n=2, examples exist (e.g., (1,1)), and infinite variations occur. Hence the answer is 2.
