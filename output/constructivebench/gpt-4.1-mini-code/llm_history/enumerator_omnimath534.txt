The problem is to find the smallest 5-digit palindrome divisible by 99.

We can enumerate all 5-digit palindromes (from 10000 to 99999) and check divisibility by 99, then record all such numbers and print them as found. Finally, print the minimal among them.

```python
# Enumerate 5-digit palindromes divisible by 99

def is_divisible_by_99(n):
    return n % 99 == 0

def palindrome_5_digits():
    # A 5-digit palindrome has form: ABCBA
    # A in 1..9, B,C in 0..9
    for a in range(1, 10):
        for b in range(0, 10):
            for c in range(0, 10):
                n = 10000*a + 1000*b + 100*c + 10*b + a
                yield n

def main():
    candidates = []
    for n in palindrome_5_digits():
        if is_divisible_by_99(n):
            print(n)
            candidates.append(n)
    if candidates:
        print("Minimum:", min(candidates))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
