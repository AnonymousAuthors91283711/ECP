This problem asks us to find all pairs of natural numbers \((x, y)\) with \(0 \leq x \leq y\) satisfying the equation:

\[
5x^2 - 4xy + 2x + y^2 = 624.
\]

We will iterate over reasonable ranges of \(x\) and \(y\), given the quadratic form and equation value, and print all solutions found. Then we print how many such solutions exist.

```python
# Enumerate all natural pairs (x,y) with 0 <= x <= y satisfying
# 5x^2 - 4xy + 2x + y^2 = 624.

def main():
    eq_val = 624
    solutions = []
    print(f"Enumerating pairs (x,y) with 0 <= x <= y solving 5x^2 -4xy +2x + y^2 = {eq_val}")
    # We estimate upper bound on x: since y>=x, and x,y>=0,
    # rough bound: 5x^2 + y^2 <= 624, so x,y <= ~25.
    for x in range(26):
        for y in range(x, 26):
            lhs = 5*x*x - 4*x*y + 2*x + y*y
            if lhs == eq_val:
                print(f"Solution found: x={x}, y={y}")
                solutions.append((x,y))
    print(f"Total solutions: {len(solutions)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
