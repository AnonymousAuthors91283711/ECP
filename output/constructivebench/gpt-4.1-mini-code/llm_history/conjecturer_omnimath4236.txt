abbrev omnimath4236_answer : ℕ → ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath4236 (c : ℕ) (hc : 4 ≤ c ∧ Even c) :
  IsGreatest {n : ℕ | ∃ (home : Fin n → Sym2 (Fin c)) (away : Fin n → Fin c),
    (∀ i, away i ∉ (home i : Set (Fin c))) ∧
    (∀ i j, home i = home j → away i ≠ away j) ∧
    (∀ i, ¬∃ j, (away i ∈ (home j : Set (Fin c)) ∧ away j ∈ (home i : Set (Fin c))))}
    (omnimath4236_answer c) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: c = 4
n = 1 feasible
n = 2 feasible
n = 3 feasible
n = 4 feasible
Max feasible n for c=4 looks like 4
c = 6
n = 1 feasible
n = 2 feasible
n = 3 feasible
n = 4 feasible
n = 5 feasible
Max feasible n for c=6 looks like 5. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
<<<fun c => c / 2>>>
