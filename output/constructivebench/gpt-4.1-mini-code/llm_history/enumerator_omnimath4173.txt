[write_program]
This problem involves reasoning about the structure of sets generated by starting from two integers u and v, and closing under certain operations (addition and roots of quadratic polynomials with coefficients from the set). The theorem states that for every integer n, n is in such a generated set if and only if (u,v) belongs to a certain answer set.

Since the problem is complex, let's try to enumerate what integers can be included starting from small pairs (u,v) by implementing the iterative closure, then observe which pairs enable reaching all integers or large subsets.

We'll test small integer pairs for u and v in a absolute range like [-3,3] and build their generated sets with a bounded number of steps and bounds to prevent infinite loops.

The program prints for each pair (u,v) whether the generated set includes a range of integers like [-5..5] or not, thus conjecturing about the "answer set."

    elems = set([u,v])
