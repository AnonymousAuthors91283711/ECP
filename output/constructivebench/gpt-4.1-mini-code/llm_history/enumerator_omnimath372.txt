The problem suggests exploring triples \((v, e, f) \in \mathbb{N}^3\) satisfying the Euler characteristic formula \(v - e + f = 2\). We enumerate small values of \(v, e, f\), print those exactly satisfying the formula, and flag them as candidates for \(\text{omnimath372_answer}\).

```python
# Enumerate natural triples (v,e,f) with small bounds and print those with v - e + f = 2
# This may help conjecturing/validating the predicate omnimath372_answer in the theorem.

max_val = 10  # small to keep output concise

for v in range(max_val + 1):
    for e in range(max_val + 1):
        for f in range(max_val + 1):
            if v - e + f == 2:
                print(f"v={v}, e={e}, f={f} -> satisfies v - e + f = 2")
```
