The problem involves evaluating the expression \((2018 - 18 + 20) / 2\). We can numerically compute this and enumerate similar computations for small variations to conjecture patterns if needed.

```python
# Evaluate (2018 - 18 + 20)/2 precisely and print result
def evaluate_expression(a, b, c):
    numerator = a - b + c
    result = numerator / 2
    print(f"({a} - {b} + {c}) / 2 = {result}")

# We only need to evaluate the given problem, but let's try a few small variations.
def main():
    print("Evaluating given expression and some variants:")
    params_list = [
        (2018, 18, 20),
        (2018, 18, 18),
        (2020, 20, 18),
        (2019, 17, 21),
    ]
    for a, b, c in params_list:
        evaluate_expression(a, b, c)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
