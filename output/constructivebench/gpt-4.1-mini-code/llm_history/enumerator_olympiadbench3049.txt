The problem is to find the least natural number \( s \) such that \( s = 20x + 80y \) for some non-negative integers \( x, y \) with \( x + y > 0 \), and the average \(\frac{s}{x + y} = 34\).

This means: 
\[
\frac{20x + 80y}{x + y} = 34.
\]

Rearranged:
\[
20x + 80y = 34(x + y).
\]

Simplify:
\[
20x + 80y = 34x + 34y \implies 80y - 34y = 34x - 20x \implies 46y = 14x.
\]

Thus:
\[
\frac{y}{x} = \frac{14}{46} = \frac{7}{23}.
\]

Since \( x, y \) are nonnegative integers with \( x + y > 0 \), \( (x,y) = (23k, 7k) \) for \( k \geq 1 \).

Now:
\[
s = 20x + 80y = 20 \cdot 23k + 80 \cdot 7k = (460 + 560)k = 1020k.
\]

So valid \( s \) are multiples of 1020 with \( k \geq 1 \).

The least \( s \) is thus 1020.

The program will verify this by enumerating small values of \( x, y \) and printing candidates for \( s \) where the average is 34.

```python
# Enumerate possible x,y in small ranges to find s with average 34.

def main():
    # We will check x,y from 0 to 50 (arbitrary small bound)
    # and print every s = 20x + 80y with x+y>0 and average s/(x+y) == 34.
    # Then we print all candidates and the minimum among them.
    candidates = []
    for x in range(51):
        for y in range(51):
            n = x + y
            if n == 0:
                continue
            s = 20*x + 80*y
            if s == 34 * n:
                print(f"Found candidate: s={s} with x={x}, y={y}, average=34")
                candidates.append(s)
    if candidates:
        print("Minimum s with average 34:", min(candidates))
    else:
        print("No candidates found.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
