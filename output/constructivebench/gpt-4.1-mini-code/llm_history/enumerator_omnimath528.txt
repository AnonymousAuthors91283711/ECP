The problem deals with sequences of functions from Fin 4 to â„¤ with certain distance conditions. To explore this, we'll consider smaller cases (k=1, k=2) due to combinatorial explosion and print counts of valid sequences. This may help conjecture the growth pattern and the divisibility property involving powers of two.

```python
from itertools import product

# Elements of S: functions from 4-element domain to {-1,0,1}
S_elements = list(product([-1,0,1], repeat=4))

def dist_squared(f, g):
    return sum((a - b)**2 for a,b in zip(f,g))

def valid_successors(current):
    # Return all s in S with dist^2 = 4 from current
    return [s for s in S_elements if dist_squared(current, s) == 4]

def count_sequences(k):
    # sequences of length k+1 starting at zero function (0,0,0,0)
    zero = (0,0,0,0)
    dp = {zero: 1}
    for _ in range(k):
        next_dp = {}
        for f, cnt in dp.items():
            for s in valid_successors(f):
                next_dp[s] = next_dp.get(s,0) + cnt
        dp = next_dp
    total = sum(dp.values())
    print(f"k={k}, total sequences: {total}")
    return total

for k in range(1,4):
    _ = count_sequences(k)
```
