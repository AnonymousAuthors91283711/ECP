The problem is to find the maximum product xy for positive integers x,y such that x+y=31. We enumerate all pairs (x,y) with x,y>0 and x+y=31, calculate their products, print each product, then print the maximum product found.

```python
# Enumerate all positive x,y with x+y=31 and print products
max_product = 0
print("Enumerating pairs (x,y) with x+y=31, x,y > 0 and their products:")
for x in range(1, 31):
    y = 31 - x
    product = x * y
    print(f"x={x}, y={y}, product={product}")
    if product > max_product:
        max_product = product

print(f"Maximum product found: {max_product}")
```
