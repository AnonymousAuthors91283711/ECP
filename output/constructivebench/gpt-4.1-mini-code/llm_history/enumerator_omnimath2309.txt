This problem concerns counting lattice paths from (0,0) to (5,5) with some blocked points defined by coordinates (x,y) ≤ 5. The total number of paths is C(10,5). The blocked paths are those passing through (x,y), counted by C(x+y,x)*C(10-(x+y),5-x). The expression is (total_paths - blocked_paths)/36. 

We will enumerate all (x,y) with x,y from 0 to 5, compute total paths, blocked paths, and the resulting value, printing the results as exact fractions or floats. This may help conjecture the closed form or numerical values for the omnimath2309_answer.

```python
import math
from fractions import Fraction

def nCr(n,k):
    if k < 0 or k > n:
        return 0
    return math.comb(n,k)

def main():
    total_paths = nCr(10,5)
    print(f"Total paths C(10,5) = {total_paths}")
    print("Enumerating (x,y) with 0 ≤ x,y ≤ 5:")
    for x in range(6):
        for y in range(6):
            blocked_paths = nCr(x+y,x)*nCr(10 - x - y, 5 - x)
            numerator = total_paths - blocked_paths
            val_frac = Fraction(numerator, 36)
            print(f"x={x}, y={y}: blocked_paths = {blocked_paths}, (total - blocked)/36 = {val_frac} ≈ {float(val_frac):.6f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
