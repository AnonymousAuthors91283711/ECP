[write_program]
The problem is to find two two-digit prime numbers p and q (both between 10 and 99, inclusive) satisfying the equation:

p² - q² = 2p + 6q + 8.

We want to find the greatest possible sum s = p + q for which this holds.

The program will:
- Enumerate all two-digit primes p and q.
- Check the equation exactly.
- For each solution, print (p, q, p+q).
- Keep track and print the maximum sum found at the end.

We'll first generate primes between 10 and 99 using a simple sieve or a prime check.

```python
# Enumerate all two-digit primes p, q
# Check p^2 - q^2 == 2p + 6q + 8
# Print all solutions and their sums
# Print the maximum sum among solutions at the end

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    if n % 2 == 0 and n != 2:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5)+1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def main():
    primes = [p for p in range(10, 100) if is_prime(p)]
    max_sum = None
    print("p, q, sum")
    for p in primes:
        for q in primes:
            left = p*p - q*q
            right = 2*p + 6*q + 8
            if left == right:
                s = p + q
                print(p, q, s)
                if (max_sum is None) or (s > max_sum):
                    max_sum = s
    if max_sum is not None:
        print("Maximum sum:", max_sum)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
