abbrev omnimath176_answer : Set (ℂ × ℂ × ℂ) := sorry
theorem omnimath176 (x y z : ℂ) : 
  (x + y + z = 3 ∧ x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 3) ↔ (x, y, z) ∈ omnimath176_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(1, 1, 1)}
Proposed Answer: {(x, y, z) | x + y + z = 3 ∧ (x = 1 ∧ y = 1 ∧ z = 1 ∨ (x, y, z) = (-1, 2 - Complex.I, 2 + Complex.I) ∨ (x, y, z) = (-1, 2 + Complex.I, 2 - Complex.I) ∨ (x, y, z) = (2 - Complex.I, -1, 2 + Complex.I) ∨ (x, y, z) = (2 - Complex.I, 2 + Complex.I, -1) ∨ (x, y, z) = (2 + Complex.I, -1, 2 - Complex.I) ∨ (x, y, z) = (2 + Complex.I, 2 - Complex.I, -1))}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all complex triples (x,y,z) where x+y+z=3 and x³+y³+z³=3.

2. The ground truth answer only includes (1,1,1), which clearly satisfies both conditions.

3. The proposed answer includes:
   - (1,1,1)
   - Several complex permutations involving -1 and 2±i

4. Let's test one of the complex solutions:
   Take (-1, 2-i, 2+i):
   Sum: -1 + (2-i) + (2+i) = 3 (satisfies first condition)
   Sum of cubes: (-1)³ + (2-i)³ + (2+i)³
   = -1 + (8-12i-6+i²) + (8+12i-6-i²)
   = -1 + (2-12i) + (2+12i) = 3 (satisfies second condition)

5. The proposed answer correctly identifies all solutions, including the complex ones, while the ground truth answer only includes the real solution.
