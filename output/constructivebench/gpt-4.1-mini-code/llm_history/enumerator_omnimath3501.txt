The problem is essentially to evaluate the expression \(1 - \left(\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{4}\right)\) exactly in rational numbers and verify the exact value. Let's enumerate the partial sums and the resulting difference exactly using Python's `fractions.Fraction`.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Fractions involved
a = Fraction(1, 3)
b = Fraction(1, 6)
c = Fraction(1, 4)

# Compute the sum and the difference exactly
sum_abc = a + b + c
result = Fraction(1) - sum_abc

print("Fractions: 1/3 =", a, ", 1/6 =", b, ", 1/4 =", c)
print("Sum:", sum_abc)
print("1 - (sum) =", result)
```

This will enumerate the exact rational values step-by-step and print the final answer as a reduced fraction.
