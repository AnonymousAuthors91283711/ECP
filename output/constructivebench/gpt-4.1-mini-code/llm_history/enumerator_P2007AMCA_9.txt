The given problem involves finding a real number \( d \) such that \( 4.5 \times 70 = d \) and \( \frac{d}{60} = \) the answer. The problem reduces to calculating \( d = 4.5 \times 70 \) and then computing \( d/60 \).

The Python code below enumerates the process step-by-step and prints the intermediate and final results exactly.

```python
# Calculate d = 4.5 * 70, then d/60
def main():
    a = 4.5
    b = 70
    d = a * b
    print(f"d = {a} * {b} = {d}")
    answer = d / 60
    print(f"Answer = d / 60 = {answer}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
