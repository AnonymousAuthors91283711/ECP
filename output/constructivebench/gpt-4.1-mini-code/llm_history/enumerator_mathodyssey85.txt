The problem involves points \(D\) on a circle of radius 1 centered at \((0,4)\) and vectors \((a,0)+(0,b)+(D)\) with certain constraints on the norms. We want to find the least possible sum \(a'^2 + b'^2\) such that some maximum norm condition is met.

We will:
- Enumerate pairs \((a,b)\) with small integer values.
- For each \((a,b)\), check points \(D\) on the circle centered at \((0,4)\) with radius 1.
- Calculate \(\| (a,0)+(0,b)+D \| = \|(a,b) + (x,y)\|\).
- Check if the maximum is 6 for some \(D\).
- Collect and print candidate minimal \(a^2+b^2\).

We approximate the circle by points along its circumference discretized finely. We also print results streamingly.

```python
import math

# Circle center and radius
cx, cy = 0, 4
r = 1

def circle_points(n=360):
    # Return n points on circle at unit radius centered at (0,4)
    for i in range(n):
        theta = 2*math.pi*i/n
        yield (cx + r*math.cos(theta), cy + r*math.sin(theta))

# For given (a,b), compute max distance ||(a,b)+D||
# D on circle, find max norm ||(a,b)+D||
def max_norm_ab(a,b):
    max_norm = -1
    for (x,y) in circle_points(360):
        dist = math.hypot(a + x, b + y)
        if dist > max_norm:
            max_norm = dist
    return max_norm

candidates = []
print("Enumerating (a,b), max norm of (a,b)+D on circle, filtering max norm near 6:")

# Search (a,b) in integer range -10..10 for coverage
for a in range(-10,11):
    for b in range(-10,11):
        max_dist = max_norm_ab(a,b)
        # Floating tolerance for max = 6 condition
        if 5.99 < max_dist < 6.01:
            s = a*a + b*b
            candidates.append((s,a,b,max_dist))
            print(f"a={a}, b={b}, a^2+b^2={s}, max_dist={max_dist:.4f}")

if candidates:
    min_s = min(c[0] for c in candidates)
    # Print min s
    print(f"Minimum a^2+b^2 achieving max norm ~6 is {min_s}, corresponding (a,b):")
    for (s,a,b,md) in candidates:
        if s == min_s:
            print(f"(a,b)=({a},{b}), max norm={md:.4f}")
else:
    print("No (a,b) found with max norm near 6.")
```
This code enumerates pairs, finds where the maximum norm is around 6, and prints the minimal sum of squares \(a^2+b^2\). This aids conjecturing the minimal value in the problem.
