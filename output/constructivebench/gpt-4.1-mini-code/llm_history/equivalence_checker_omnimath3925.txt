Ground Truth Answer: {(p, n) | (Nat.Prime p ∧ n = p) ∨ (p = 2 ∧ n = 4)}
Proposed Answer: {(2, 2), (2, 4)} ∪ { x : ℕ × ℕ | x.1 = x.2 ∧ Nat.Prime x.1 }
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

Ground truth:
1. All pairs where p is prime and n = p
2. The specific pair (2, 4)

Proposed answer:
1. The specific pairs (2, 2) and (2, 4)
2. All pairs where p = n and p is prime

The differences are:
1. The proposed answer explicitly lists (2, 2) which is already covered by the general case (p = n ∧ prime p)
2. The proposed answer misses all other prime pairs where p = n except (2, 2)

However, mathematically:
- The set {x | x.1 = x.2 ∧ Nat.Prime x.1} covers ALL prime pairs where p = n
- The explicit (2, 2) is redundant but doesn't change the set
- Both include (2, 4)

Therefore the answers are equivalent, with the proposed answer just having some redundant notation.
