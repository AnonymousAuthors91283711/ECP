The problem is to find all functions \( f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) such that for all \( x,y > 0 \),
\[
f\big(x + f(xy)\big) + y = f(x) f(y) + 1,
\]
with the additional condition \( f(x) > 0 \) for \( x > 0 \).

To explore possible solutions, we can try some candidate functions and test if they satisfy the equation. A natural guess is to try functions of the form \( f(x) = a x^b + c \) or simple linear or reciprocal functions on positive reals.

We will test various candidate functions for small positive values of \( x,y \) and check if the given equation holds approximately (to distinguish exact equality cases).

We print each candidate that is "close" to satisfying the condition over some sample values, along with parameters tried. This can help in conjecturing \( f \).

def test_function(f, xs, ys, tol=1e-9):
    # Test if f satisfies the functional equation for all x,y in xs, ys
    # Returns maximum deviation
    max_dev = 0
    for x in xs:
        for y in ys:
            left = f(x + f(x * y)) + y
            right = f(x) * f(y) + 1
            dev = abs(left - right)
            if dev > max_dev:
                max_dev = dev
    return max_dev

    ys = xs.copy()

    # Test some candidate functions
    print("Testing f(x) = 1/x")
    f = lambda x: 1/x
    max_dev = test_function(f, xs, ys)
    print(f"Max deviation: {max_dev}")

    print("Testing f(x) = c/x, c in [0.5,1,2]")
