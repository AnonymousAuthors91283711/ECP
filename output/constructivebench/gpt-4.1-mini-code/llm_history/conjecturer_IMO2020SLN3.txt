The error you got is because in Lean, a lambda function is written as `fun n => ...` or `λ n => ...`. Your code `λ n, n ≤ 3` used a comma instead of `=>`. This is the syntax error.

Also, logically from the enumerated answers and problem statement, the set of `n` such that IMO2020SLN3_answer n holds is those with n ≤ 3, meaning for n ≤ 3 a sequence as in the theorem does not exist and for n ≥ 4 it does. So the answer is `λ n, n ≤ 3` but properly written in Lean syntax.

Hence fix the lambda to use `=>` instead of `,`.

<<<fun n => n ≤ 3>>>
