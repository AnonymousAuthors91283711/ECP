The problem appears to involve a dartboard with a radius of 20 and a target radius of 10. Given 2020 initial darts thrown, it seems we want to analyze the expected number of additional throws needed so that the number of darts landing within the target area meets some condition.

We can interpret the probability of landing inside the smaller target as (10^2) / (20^2) = 100/400 = 1/4. Then the expected number of throws to hit the target can relate to geometric or negative binomial distributions.

To assist in conjecturing the value of expected_throws = initial_darts * (1/p - 1), let's enumerate expected throws for several sample values of radius, target_radius, and initial_darts to see if the formula holds for various parameters.

The program below enumerates different scenarios and prints their computed expected throws, to help understand the pattern and verify the formula. No inputs are required, and the program prints results immediately.

```python
# Enumerate expected throws for various radii, target radii, and initial darts
def expected_throws(radius, target_radius, initial_darts):
    p = (target_radius ** 2) / (radius ** 2)
    # Expected throws as per formula
    return initial_darts * (1 / p - 1)

# Print header
print("radius\ttarget_radius\tinitial_darts\tp\t\texpected_throws")

radii = [10, 15, 20]
target_radii = [5, 7, 10]
initial_darts_list = [10, 100, 2020]

for radius in radii:
    for target_radius in target_radii:
        if target_radius > radius:
            continue
        for initial_darts in initial_darts_list:
            p = (target_radius ** 2) / (radius ** 2)
            e_throws = expected_throws(radius, target_radius, initial_darts)
            # Print exact fraction where possible; leave decimals as well
            print(f"{radius}\t{target_radius}\t\t{initial_darts}\t\t{p:.6f}\t{e_throws:.6f}")
```
