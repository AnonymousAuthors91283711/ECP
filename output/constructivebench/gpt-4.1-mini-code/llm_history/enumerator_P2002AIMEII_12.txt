The problem appears to be about finding primes \( p, q, r, s \) and positive integers \( a, b, c \) such that

\[
(p + q + r + s) \times (a + b + c) = N,
\]

where \( N \) is the answer to the problem. Since \( N \) is unknown, we'll enumerate possible tuples \((p,q,r,s,a,b,c)\) with small primes and positive integers, print the product values, and try to identify patterns or candidates for \( N \). We'll limit search ranges for efficiency and stream results as they appear.

```python
from sympy import primerange, isprime
from itertools import combinations_with_replacement, product

# Enumerate possible sums of 4 primes and 3 positive integers, then their product
# Use small primes up to 30 and positive integers up to 10 for tractability
primes = list(primerange(2, 30))
max_prime_sum = 4 * 29
max_abc_sum = 3 * 10

# We'll store already seen products to avoid repeats
seen_products = set()

print("Enumerating (p,q,r,s,a,b,c) with p,q,r,s primes <=29; a,b,c in 1..10")

for pqs in combinations_with_replacement(primes, 4):
    sum_pqrs = sum(pqs)
    for abc in product(range(1,11), repeat=3):
        sum_abc = sum(abc)
        product_val = sum_pqrs * sum_abc
        if product_val not in seen_products:
            seen_products.add(product_val)
            print(f"Product: {product_val}, (p,q,r,s)={pqs}, (a,b,c)={abc}")

# This enumeration will output many products, allowing analyzing possible values for N.
# Modify ranges as needed for deeper search.
```
