The problem defines a strictly increasing function \( f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) with a functional equation involving \( f(f(x) + \frac{2}{x}) = -1 \) for all \( x > 0 \). The goal is to find the value \( f(1) \).

To assist in conjecturing \( f(1) \), we will enumerate possible values for \( f(x) \) near 1 and check the equation \( f(f(x) + 2/x) = -1 \). Since the function is strictly increasing, \( f \) should be injective and preserve order. We'll try to find \( a = f(1) \) by testing consistent values for \( a \) that satisfy the functional equation for sample \( x > 0 \).

The approach:
- Choose small positive values of \( x \) (e.g., 1, 2).
- For guessed values \( a = f(1) \) (try rationals between -3 and 3).
- For each guess, compute \( f(a + 2/x) \).
- Since \( f(f(x) + 2/x) = -1 \), this means \( f(y) = -1 \) for \( y = f(x) + 2/x \).
- As \( f \) is strictly increasing, \( f(y) = -1 \) implies \( y \) is a fixed input giving output -1.
- We'll look for \( y = k \) so that \( f(k) = -1 \). From the equation, \( k = f(x) + 2/x \).
- We'll try to determine if \( k = 1 \), or if \( f(1) = a \) satisfies similar relations.

As the outputs should be exact (prefer rationals), we'll enumerate over rational \( a = f(1) \), and check consistency for \( x=1 \). We'll print all candidate \( a \) where the equation's pattern could hold for that \( x \).

# Program to assist in conjecturing f(1) = a for f strictly increasing,
# with f(f(x) + 2/x) = -1 for x > 0.
# We'll try rational guesses for a = f(1) in [-3,3] with step 0.5,

    xs = [1, 2]  # sample positive x
    # Since f is strictly increasing and f(f(x) + 2/x) = -1 constant,
    # f(y) = -1 for y = f(x)+2/x all x > 0, meaning f(y)=-1 at multiple points
    # but f is increasing and thus can only take value -1 at one point.
    # So f(x)+2/x is constant for all x >0, call it c.
    # Then f(c) = -1.
    # Then for any x>0: f(x)+2/x = c => f(x) = c - 2/x.
    # Because f is increasing, the map x -> c - 2/x must be increasing on (0,∞).
    # Derivative is (2/x^2) which is positive? No, derivative of -2/x is 2/x^2 > 0.
    # So f(x) = c - 2/x is strictly increasing.
    # Then f(1) = c - 2/1 = c - 2. Since f(c) = -1, plug in f(c) = c - 2/c = -1.
    # So c - 2/c = -1, so c +1 = 2/c, or c^2 + c = 2,
    # c^2 + c - 2 = 0, solutions c=(-1 ± sqrt(1+8))/2 = (-1 ± 3)/2.
    # So c=1 or c=-2.
    # For c=1, f(x)=1 - 2/x.
    # For c=-2, f(x)=-2 - 2/x.
    # Let's compute f(1) in these two cases.
