Ground Truth Answer: fun (m, n) => (2 * 2001 * m - m^2 - m * n) / n
Proposed Answer: fun p : ℤ × ℤ => 2 * p.1 - p.2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a set A of integer pairs (m,n) with certain conditions and asks for a function f that produces certain extremal values (3750 as greatest and 2 as least).

2. The ground truth answer is a specific function that clearly satisfies the divisibility condition (2*n divides the numerator) and would produce the required extremal values when evaluated at appropriate (m,n) pairs in A.

3. The proposed answer is a much simpler linear function that doesn't incorporate the complexity of the problem conditions. It doesn't account for:
   - The specific coefficient 2001 (a in the problem)
   - The quadratic terms in the conditions
   - The divisibility condition (2*n ∣ ...)

The proposed answer is too simplistic and cannot possibly satisfy all the conditions of the problem, particularly producing the required extremal values of 3750 and 2 when evaluated at points in A.
