[write_program]
The problem involves checking a property for matrices \( M \) indexed by \(\mathrm{Fin}(n)\times \mathrm{Fin}(n)\), where each row forms an arithmetic progression (AP) of natural numbers, and we want to know if there exists a permutation \(\sigma\) on the rows such that each column also forms an AP. We will enumerate small values of \( n \geq 3 \) and sample some matrices \( M \) to test the condition experimentally.

The Python program will:
- Consider \( n = 3,4 \) (small sizes).
- For each \( n \), enumerate possible rows as APs with small differences and starts.
- For each \( M \), try to find a permutation of rows \(\sigma\) making columns APs.
- Print each candidate \( n \) and for that \( n \), each \( M \) tested.
- Print all permutations \( \sigma \) found that satisfy the column AP condition.
- In this way, we gather evidence towards the statement's truth or falsehood.

This enumerator serves to conjecture or refute the theorem by searching for counterexamples or verifying for small values.
