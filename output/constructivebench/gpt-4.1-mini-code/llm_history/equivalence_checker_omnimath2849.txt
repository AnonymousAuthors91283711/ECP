abbrev omnimath2849_answer : ℤ → ℤ := sorry
theorem omnimath2849 (x y : ℤ) (h : x = 2 * y) (hy : y ≠ 0) : 
    (x + 2 * y) - (2 * x + y) = omnimath2849_answer y := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun y => -y
Proposed Answer: fun y : ℤ => -y
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us an equation to prove: (x + 2y) - (2x + y) = answer(y), with the constraint x = 2y and y ≠ 0.

2. Simplifying the left side:
   (x + 2y) - (2x + y) = x + 2y - 2x - y = (-x) + y
   Substituting x = 2y: (-2y) + y = -y

3. Therefore, the correct answer should indeed be a function that takes y and returns -y.

4. Both the ground truth answer and the proposed answer are exactly: fun y => -y (with the proposed answer being slightly more explicit about the type ℤ, which doesn't affect the meaning).

The answers are identical in both form and meaning.
