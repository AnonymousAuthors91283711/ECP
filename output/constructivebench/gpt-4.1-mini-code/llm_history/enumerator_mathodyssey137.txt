This problem involves finding the least natural number \( n \) such that for every function \( f: \{0, \dots, n-1\} \to \{0, \dots, 16\} \) (denoted by `Fin n â†’ Fin 17`) with positive domain values, there exist indices \( x > y \) such that \( f(x) = f(y) = p \) for some \( p \), satisfying the inequality \( 118x \leq 119y \).

We will interpret `Fin n` as the set \(\{0, \dots, n-1\}\) (0-based indexing). The conditions require \(x > y\), so \(x,y \in \{0,\ldots,n-1\}\), \(x > y\), and both mapped to the same value in \(\{0,\ldots,16\}\), with \(118x \leq 119y\).

We want to find the smallest \(n\) that guarantees that such \(x,y\) exist for *any* \(f\). We can verify candidates \(n\) by attempting to construct a counterexample \(f\) where no such pair exists; if none exist, \(n\) is the answer.

---

The plan for the Python program:

- For small \(n\), enumerate all functions \(f: \{0,...,n-1\} \to \{0,...,16\}\).
- For each \(f\), check if there exists a pair \((x,y)\) with \(x > y\), \(f(x) = f(y)\), and \(118x \leq 119y\).
- If for some \(f\) no such pair exists, \(n\) is not enough.
- Print all \(n\) and note if a counterexample is found; if none found after all \(f\), print \(n\) as valid.
- To limit the search space, the code tries for small \(n\) and samples functions when enumeration is too large.

---

**Note:** The number of functions grows as \(17^n\), which is large. To manage, we will test all \(f\) for small \(n\leq6\) and sample for larger \(n\).

---

Output: print \(n\), print if a counterexample found or none, and at the end print the smallest \(n\) with no counterexample found.
