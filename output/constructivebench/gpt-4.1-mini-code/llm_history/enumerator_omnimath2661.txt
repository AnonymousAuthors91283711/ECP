The problem involves two functions f and g defined over real numbers, with f(x) = x + 4 and g(x) = f(x) - 6 = x + 4 - 6 = x - 2. We want to compute g(0), which should be -2.

To confirm this and enumerate potential answers, the program will consider these definitions and print g(0).

```python
# Enumerate possible values of g(0) given f(x) = x + 4 and g(x) = f(x) - 6

def f(x):
    return x + 4

def g(x):
    return f(x) - 6

# Enumerate g(0)
val = g(0)
print(f"g(0) = {val}")  # Exact value, no approximations needed
```
