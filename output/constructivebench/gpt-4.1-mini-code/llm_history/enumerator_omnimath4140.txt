[write_program]
The problem defines a sequence \( F \) recursively with rational numbers, and asks to find the sum of the infinite series \( \sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{1}{F(2^n)} \).

I'll write a Python program that computes values of \( F \) for powers of two \( 2^n \) up to some reasonable limit, then sum their reciprocals and print intermediate sums. This will help conjecture the sum.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Define F recursively with memoization for efficiency
memo = {0: Fraction(0), 1: Fraction(3,2)}
def F(n):
    if n not in memo:
        memo[n] = Fraction(5,2)*F(n-1) - F(n-2)
    return memo[n]

print("Computing sum_{n=0}^N 1/F(2^n) with increasing N:")

s = Fraction(0)
for i in range(10):  # 2^9 = 512, reasonable limit
    pow2 = 2**i
    val = F(pow2)
    if val == 0:
        print(f"F({pow2})=0, skipping division")
        continue
    term = Fraction(1, val)
    s += term
    print(f"n={i}, 1/F(2^{i})=1/F({pow2})={term}, partial sum={s}")

print(f"Approximate sum after 10 terms: {float(s)}")
```
