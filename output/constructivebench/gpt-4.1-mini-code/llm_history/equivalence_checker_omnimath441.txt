Ground Truth Answer: fun _ => 1/12
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => 256 / 3125
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum value of the expression ∑(x_j^4 - x_j^5) under the constraints that all x_j ≥ 0 and ∑x_j = 1.

2. The ground truth answer suggests the maximum is always 1/12 ≈ 0.0833, regardless of n.

3. The proposed answer gives 256/3125 ≈ 0.08192 as the maximum.

4. To verify, let's consider the case when n=1 (single variable):
   - The expression becomes x^4 - x^5 with x=1 (since x must sum to 1)
   - Value is 1-1 = 0
   - But both answers give positive values, so n=1 is not the maximizing case

5. For n=2, we can set one variable to p and the other to 1-p:
   - The expression becomes p^4 - p^5 + (1-p)^4 - (1-p)^5
   - The maximum occurs at p=0.4, giving value ≈0.0864
   - This is higher than both proposed answers

6. The true maximum actually occurs when we have:
   - One variable at 2/3 and others at 0
   - Value is (2/3)^4 - (2/3)^5 = 16/81 - 32/243 ≈ 0.0878
   - This is higher than both answers

7. The ground truth answer of 1/12 ≈0.0833 is actually incorrect - the true maximum is higher.

8. The proposed answer of 256/3125 is also incorrect, but closer to the true maximum than the ground truth.

Conclusion: Both answers are incorrect, but they're different incorrect answers.
