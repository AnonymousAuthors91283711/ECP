abbrev omnimath3696_answer : ℕ → ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath3696 (S : Type*) [Fintype S] :
  IsGreatest {k : ℕ | ∃ f : Set S → ℝ, (∀ X Y : Set S, f (X ∩ Y) = min (f X) (f Y)) ∧ Fintype.card (range f) = k} 
    (omnimath3696_answer (Fintype.card S)) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerations for n=1:
n=1 candidate k with sizes function is invalid
Enumerations for n=2:
n=2 candidate k with sizes function is invalid
Enumerations for n=3:
n=3 candidate k with sizes function is invalid
Enumerations for n=4:
n=4 candidate k with sizes function is invalid
Observing maximum k for n is n+1 via subset size levels.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
<<<fun n : ℕ => n + 1>>>
