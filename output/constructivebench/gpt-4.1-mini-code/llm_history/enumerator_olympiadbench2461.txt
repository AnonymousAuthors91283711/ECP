The problem involves solving the equation:

log_2(2^(x-1) + 3^(x+1)) = 2x - log_2(3^x)

We want to find real values of x that satisfy this.

To explore potential values, I'll write a Python program that checks values of x in a range and prints those that satisfy the equality (up to a small numerical tolerance). We convert logs to natural logs and rewrite expressions for accuracy.

Since the problem is transcendental, exact closed-form solutions might not be straightforward. We'll print values of x approximately satisfying it.

```python
import math

# Define a function to test the equality for a given x
def test_x(x, tol=1e-12):
    # Left side: log_2(2^(x-1) + 3^(x+1)) = ln(...) / ln(2)
    left_num = 2**(x - 1) + 3**(x + 1)
    left = math.log(left_num) / math.log(2)

    # Right side: 2x - log_2(3^x) = 2x - (x * log_2(3))
    right = 2*x - x * (math.log(3) / math.log(2))

    # Check if close
    if abs(left - right) < tol:
        print(f"x = {x:.12f}, Left = {left:.12f}, Right = {right:.12f}")

def main():
    # Scan over some range with small steps
    # We'll first try integer values from -5 to 5
    print("Testing integer values in [-5,5]:")
    for x in range(-5, 6):
        test_x(x)

    # Then try half-integers for more detail
    print("\nTesting half-integers in [-5,5]:")
    for i in range(-10, 11):
        x = i / 2
        test_x(x)

    # Then attempt several more finely spaced steps near interesting points
    print("\nTesting fine steps near x=1:")
    for i in range(80, 121):  # from 0.8 to 1.2
        x = i / 100
        test_x(x)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
