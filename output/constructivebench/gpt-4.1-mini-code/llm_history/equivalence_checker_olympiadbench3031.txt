Ground Truth Answer: 210
Proposed Answer: (20*(20+1)) / 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding an exponent K such that the product of all divisors of 2²⁰ equals 2^K.

2. For a number n = p^k (where p is prime), the product of its divisors is p^{k*(k+1)/2}.

3. Here n = 2²⁰, so the product of divisors is 2^{20*(20+1)/2} = 2^{210}.

4. Therefore, K should be 210.

5. The proposed answer is (20*(20+1))/2 = 210, which matches exactly with the ground truth answer.
