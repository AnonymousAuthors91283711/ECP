The problem involves finding the minimum number of nonzero homogeneous linear forms (planes through the origin) needed to cover all nonzero points with coordinates in [0, n]^3. We'll enumerate some small values of n and count minimal such sets of planes by brute force over small integer coefficients.

```python
from itertools import product, combinations

def is_zero_vector(v):
    return all(x == 0 for x in v)

def eval_plane(a,b,c,x,y,z):
    return a*x + b*y + c*z == 0

def norm_vec(a,b,c):
    # Normalize vector by dividing by gcd and making first nonzero positive
    from math import gcd
    g = gcd(abs(a), gcd(abs(b), abs(c)))
    if g == 0: return (0,0,0)
    a, b, c = a//g, b//g, c//g
    # Ensure first nonzero positive
    if a < 0 or (a == 0 and b < 0) or (a == 0 and b == 0 and c < 0):
        a,b,c = -a,-b,-c
    return (a,b,c)

def all_nonzero_points(n):
    pts = []
    for x in range(n+1):
        for y in range(n+1):
            for z in range(n+1):
                if not (x == y == z == 0):
                    pts.append((x,y,z))
    return pts

def generate_planes(max_coef=2):
    # Generates all planes a*x+b*y+c*z=0 with (a,b,c)!=0 and |a,b,c|<=max_coef
    planes = set()
    for a,b,c in product(range(-max_coef,max_coef+1), repeat=3):
        if (a,b,c) == (0,0,0):
            continue
        planes.add(norm_vec(a,b,c))
    return list(planes)

def covers(plane, pts):
    a,b,c = plane
    return set(p for p in pts if eval_plane(a,b,c,*p))

def main():
    # Sample n values
    for n in [1,2]:
        print(f"n = {n}")
        pts = all_nonzero_points(n)
        planes = generate_planes(max_coef=2)
        coverage = {p: covers(p, pts) for p in planes}
        # Try all subsets of planes starting from 1 up to len(planes)
        found = False
        for k in range(1, len(planes)+1):
            for subset in combinations(planes, k):
                covered_pts = set()
                for p in subset:
                    covered_pts |= coverage[p]
                if len(covered_pts) == len(pts):
                    print(f"Found cover with {k} planes: {subset}")
                    found = True
                    break
            if found:
                print(f"Minimum number of planes for n={n} is {k}")
                break
