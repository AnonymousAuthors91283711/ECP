    (∑ k ∈ Finset.range 23, 1 / (1 + z^k + z^(2*k))) = omnimath1615_answer z := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun z => if z^23 = 1 ∧ z.im ≠ 0 then 46 / 3 else 0
Proposed Answer: fun (z : ℂ) => 23 / 3
Let me analyze this carefully.

1. The problem is about evaluating a sum of rational expressions involving powers of z, where z is a 23rd root of unity (z²³=1) with non-zero imaginary part.

2. The ground truth answer:
   - Returns 46/3 when z is a non-real 23rd root of unity
   - Returns 0 otherwise

3. The proposed answer:
   - Always returns 23/3, regardless of z's properties

Key differences:
- The proposed answer doesn't check the conditions (z²³=1 and z.im≠0)
- The numerical value is exactly half of what it should be when the conditions are met

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
1. It gives the wrong value (23/3 instead of 46/3) when the conditions are met
2. It gives a non-zero value when the conditions aren't met (should be 0)

<<<False>>>
