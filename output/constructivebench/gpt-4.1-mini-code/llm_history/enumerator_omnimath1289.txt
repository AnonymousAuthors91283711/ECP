The problem is to find the area (volume) in the unit square of pairs (p1, p2) such that the quartic polynomial 
x^4 + p1 x^3 - p2 x^2 + p1 x + 1 = 0 
has at least one real root. 
We want to enumerate values of (p1, p2) in [0,1]^2 and check the quartic for real roots, to approximate/conjecture the volume of such (p1, p2).

We will discretize [0,1]^2 finely, check roots via numpy roots, and print the parameters with roots. This may help conjecturing the volume.

```python
import numpy as np

def has_real_root(p1, p2):
    # Polynomial coefficients: x^4 + p1 x^3 - p2 x^2 + p1 x + 1
    coeffs = [1, p1, -p2, p1, 1]
    roots = np.roots(coeffs)
    # Check if any root is real (imag part near zero)
    return any(abs(r.imag) < 1e-12 for r in roots)

def main():
    N = 50  # grid granularity
    count = 0
    total = 0
    for i in range(N+1):
        p1 = i / N
        for j in range(N+1):
            p2 = j / N
            total += 1
            if has_real_root(p1, p2):
                count += 1
                print(f"p1={p1:.2f}, p2={p2:.2f} -> real root")
    print(f"Total points: {total}, Points with real root: {count}")
    print(f"Approximate volume (fraction): {count/total:.4f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
