This problem involves real numbers \(x, y, z > 1\) and conditions linking their logarithms:

\[
x^{\frac{\log z}{\log y}} = 2, \quad y^{\frac{\log x}{\log z}} = 4, \quad z^{\frac{\log y}{\log x}} = 8,
\]

where all logarithms are natural logs. Denote \(a = \log x\), \(b = \log y\), \(c = \log z\). The equations become:

\[
e^{a \cdot (c/b)} = 2, \quad e^{b \cdot (a/c)} = 4, \quad e^{c \cdot (b/a)} = 8.
\]

Taking logs again gives

\[
\frac{ac}{b} = \log 2, \quad \frac{ab}{c} = \log 4, \quad \frac{bc}{a} = \log 8.
\]

From these, one can attempt to solve for \(\frac{b}{a}\) (equal to \(\frac{\log y}{\log x}\)).

I will write a Python program to enumerate small positive values \(a,b,c\) consistent with these relations and estimate \(\frac{b}{a}\), printing candidate triples and corresponding \(\frac{b}{a}\).

```python
import math

# Since a = ln x, b = ln y, c = ln z, all > 0 because x,y,z>1.

# We rewrite:
# (ac)/b = ln2
# (ab)/c = ln4
# (bc)/a = ln8

ln2 = math.log(2)
ln4 = math.log(4)
ln8 = math.log(8)

# Check candidates for ratio r = b/a

# From first eq: c = (ln2 * b)/ a = ln2 * r
# From second: ab/c = ln4 => a * b / c = ln4
# With c = ln2 * r, a*b/(ln2 * r) = ln4 => a*b = ln4 * ln2 * r
# But b = r a, so a * r a = a^2 r = ln4 * ln2 * r => a^2 = ln4 * ln2
# So a = sqrt(ln4 * ln2) (positive root)
a = math.sqrt(ln4 * ln2)

# Using a, calculate b = r * a, c = ln2 * r
# Verify if third eq holds: (b c)/a = ln8
# (r a * c)/ a = r * c = ln8
# But c = ln2 * r
# So r * ln2 * r = ln8 => ln2 * r^2 = ln8 => r^2 = ln8 / ln2 = 3
# So r = sqrt(3)

r = math.sqrt(3)  # b/a

b = r * a
c = ln2 * r

# Print these values and the value r = b/a = log y / log x

print(f"a (log x): {a}")
print(f"b (log y): {b}")
print(f"c (log z): {c}")
print(f"b/a (log y / log x): {r}")

# Validate original equations:

lhs1 = math.exp(a * c / b)
lhs2 = math.exp(b * a / c)
lhs3 = math.exp(c * b / a)

print(f"x^{c/b} = {lhs1} (should be 2)")
print(f"y^{a/c} = {lhs2} (should be 4)")
print(f"z^{b/a} = {lhs3} (should be 8)")
```
