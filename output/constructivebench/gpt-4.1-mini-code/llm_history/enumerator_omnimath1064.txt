The problem defines \( n = 60 \) and \( p = \frac{3^{n-1} + 1}{4 \cdot 3^{n-1}} \). To explore the structure and value of \( p \), we will:

- Compute \( p \) for sample values of \( n \) (e.g., from 1 up to 10, then skipping to 60).
- Represent \( p \) as a simplified fraction exactly.
- Print exact fractions and float approximations for insight.

This approach helps conjecture behavior for large \( n \) and verify \( \text{omnimath1064_answer} \).

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def compute_p(n):
    numerator = 3**(n-1) + 1
    denominator = 4 * 3**(n-1)
    return Fraction(numerator, denominator)

def main():
    ns = list(range(1,11)) + [60]
    for n in ns:
        p = compute_p(n)
        print(f"n={n}: p = {p} = {float(p)}")
    # Finding min and max in sample (not required, but useful)
    ps = [compute_p(n) for n in ns]
    print()
    print(f"Smallest p in samples: {min(ps)}")
    print(f"Largest p in samples: {max(ps)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
