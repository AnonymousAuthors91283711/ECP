The problem concerns values of \( k \) for which for all positive integers \( n \):
\[
\sum_{i=0}^n \binom{n}{i}^k \equiv 0 \pmod{n+1}.
\]

We want to explore small values of \( k \) and small \( n \) to identify candidate \( k \) values satisfying this divisibility condition universally.

The code enumerates \( k \) in a small range (say 1 to 10), and for each \( k \) tests \( n \) from 1 up to a small bound (like 20). For each pair, it calculates the sum mod \( n+1 \). If for some \( n \) the sum is not divisible, we discard the \( k \). Otherwise, if \( k \) passes all \( n \) checks, print \( k \) as a candidate.

We print each candidate \( k \) as soon as found.

```python
from math import comb

def check_k(k, max_n=20):
    for n in range(1, max_n+1):
        s = 0
        mod = n+1
        for i in range(n+1):
            c = comb(n,i)
            # Compute c**k mod mod efficiently
            # Using pow with modulus to avoid large numbers
            s = (s + pow(c, k, mod)) % mod
        if s != 0:
            return False
    return True

def main():
    print("Checking k from 1 to 10 for divisibility over n=1..20...")
    for k in range(1, 11):
        if check_k(k):
            print("Candidate k =", k)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
