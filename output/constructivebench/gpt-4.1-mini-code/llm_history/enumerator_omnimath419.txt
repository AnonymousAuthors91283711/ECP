The problem involves figuring out the expression for (r*s)^2 + (s*t)^2 + (r*t)^2 in terms of the coefficients a, b, c of a cubic polynomial with roots r, s, t.

Recall:
- r + s + t = -a
- rs + rt + st = b
- rst = -c

We want to enumerate values of
(r s)^2 + (s t)^2 + (r t)^2
over small sample triples (r,s,t) consistent with the cubic and print candidate expressions in terms of (a,b,c) by testing numeric instances.

The goal: Given any triple of rational roots r,s,t, the polynomial X³ + a X² + b X + c = (X - r)(X - s)(X - t),
compute and print (r*s)^2 + (s*t)^2 + (r*t)^2, the parameters a,b,c used, and check the pattern.

We try random small rational roots triples (r,s,t) and calculate a,b,c by the relation,
print (a,b,c), the value, and attempt some algebraic observations.

We won't guess the exact formula in code, but generate outputs to observe.

```python
# Enumerate (r,s,t) rational triples with small integers in [-3..3], r,s,t distinct
# Compute coefficients a,b,c from roots: a=-(r+s+t), b=rs+rt+st, c=-(rst)
# Compute (r*s)^2 + (s*t)^2 + (r*t)^2
# Print a,b,c and that value with exact fractions (using fractions.Fraction)
