This problem involves characterizing all continuous real-valued functions \( f \) on \(\mathbb{R}\) such that for any real numbers \( x,y \), if \(x - y\) is rational, then \( f(x) - f(y) \) is rational. This is a classic type of problem exploring functions with "rational differences" on certain domains.

To conjecture the possible form of such functions, let's enumerate examples of continuous functions \( f \) and test the condition on sample points differing by rational values. The main insight is that if \( f \) respects rational differences in domain by mapping to rational differences in range, this likely restricts \( f \) to be affine functions with rational slope.

We will try functions of form \( f(x) = a x + b \) with \(a,b\) rational or irrational, and test the property on multiple pairs \( (x,y) \).

```python
# Enumerate possible continuous functions f : ℝ → ℝ
# satisfying that whenever x - y is rational, f(x) - f(y) is rational.
# We test functions f(x) = a*x + b for various a,b rational or irrational.
# Print those f that satisfy the condition on many rational differences.

def is_rational(z, tol=1e-12):
    # Check if z is close to a rational number with denominator <= 100
    # This is heuristic for the test
    for denom in range(1, 101):
        num = round(z * denom)
        if abs(z - num/denom) < tol:
            return True
    return False

def test_f(a, b):
    # Test f(x)=a*x + b for x,y with rational difference
    # We'll try various x,y with x-y rational
    # f(x)-f(y) = a*(x-y), so must be rational for all rational x-y
    # So 'a' must be rational to satisfy the property exactly
    # Let's confirm by testing.
    rationals = [Fraction(n, d) for n in range(-5,6) for d in range(1,6) if d != 0]
    for r in rationals:
        diff = a*r  # f(x)-f(y) = a*(x-y) with x-y=r
        if not is_rational(diff):
            return False
    return True

def main():
    # Enumerate candidates for a,b from a small set
    rationals = [Fraction(n, d) for n in range(-3,4) for d in range(1,4)]
    irrationals = [math.sqrt(2), math.pi]
    
    print("Testing functions f(x) = a*x + b")
    for a in rationals + irrationals:
        for b in rationals + irrationals:
            if test_f(float(a), float(b)):
                print(f"f(x) = ({a}) * x + ({b}) satisfies the condition")

    # We note the special case a=0, then f(x)=b constant real number (any real b)
    # is trivial since f(x)-f(y)=0 in rationals for all x,y.
    print("Constant functions f(x)=b satisfy the condition for any real b.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This will print linear functions \( ax+b \) where \( a \) is rational (since only then \( a \cdot r \) is rational for all rational \( r \)) and any \( b \), as well as constant functions, which obviously satisfy the property. This helps narrow down the candidate functions in \(\texttt{omnimath2297_answer}\).
