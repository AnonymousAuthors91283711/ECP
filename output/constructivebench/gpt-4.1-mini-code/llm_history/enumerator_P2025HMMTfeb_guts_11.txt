The problem involves finding a missing angle \( x \) in a multiset of angles of an \( n \)-gon where the sum of the angles is \((n-2)*180\) and each angle satisfies \(0 < a < \frac{180(n-2)}{n}\). Given a fixed set of angles and one unknown \( x \), we want to calculate \( x \) and the corresponding polygon size \( n \).

The approach is:
- Enumerate small polygon sizes \(n \geq 3\).
- For each \( n \), check if the given angles plus some \( x \) sum to \((n-2)*180\).
- Check the bounds on \( x \).
- Print each candidate \( (n, x) \) with \( x \) exact if possible or as a float.

The given fixed angles are \(\{30, 50, 60, 70, 90, 100, 120, 160, x \}\).

```python
# Enumerate polygon sizes n, sum of angles = (n-2)*180
# Given angles except x: 30,50,60,70,90,100,120,160
# Find x and n such that sum is (n-2)*180 and each angle < 180*(n-2)/n
# x > 0 also

def main():
    fixed = [30,50,60,70,90,100,120,160]
    sum_fixed = sum(fixed)
    # Try polygon sizes n from 9 to 20 (since 8 fixed angles + x -> at least 9-gon)
    for n in range(9, 21):
        total = (n-2)*180
        x = total - sum_fixed
        if x <= 0:
            continue
        max_angle = 180*(n-2)/n
        # Check x < max_angle and all fixed < max_angle
        if all(a < max_angle for a in fixed) and x < max_angle:
            print(f"n={n}, x={x} degrees")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The original program logically attempts to find the unknown angle x and polygon size n, given the angle set and the polygon angle sum constraints. It enumerates polygon sizes from 9 to 20 (since there are 8 known angles plus x) and checks if x is positive and all angles are less than the polygon's internal angle limit.

The issue is that the program outputs nothing — no valid n and x satisfy the given constraints as per the code. This can happen if the polygon angle bound condition is too restrictive or if the fixed angles include one or more that are too large for any reasonable n.

Upon inspection:
- Fixed angles: 30, 50, 60, 70, 90, 100, 120, 160
- maximum angle allowed = 180*(n-2)/n (inside convex polygon)
- For n=9, max angle = 180*7/9 = 140° roughly
- The fixed 160° is already over 140°, so it fails the condition immediately.

Hence, for n = 9 to 20, fixed angles include 160°, which will never be less than or equal to the max interior angle allowed for these polygons.

The conclusion: the maximal angle in fixed angles (160°) violates the polygon interior angle bound condition for all tested n.

Thus, the program should reject these n values and output nothing.

To fix this, notice the problem states "∀ a ∈ angles, 0 < a < 180*(n-2)/n." The program checks strict inequality, so 160 < max_angle must hold.

Since 160° is quite large, probably n must be larger to increase max_angle.

Try expanding n search to larger values where max_angle > 160, for example at n=15, max_angle = 180*13/15=156 which is less than 160.

Try n=18, max_angle=180*16/18=160 exactly. Problem requires strict less than, so 160 fails.

Try n=19: max_angle=180*17/19 ~ 161, which should work.

So n should be tested from 9 up to about 25 to find possible candidates.

Also, because the problem specifies ranges for angles, and x is positive, x should be checked as well.

**Therefore, the original program is rejected because:**

- It searches an insufficient range of polygon sizes n.
- It doesn't consider n

Explanation:
The provided problem is a geometry problem related to polygon angles, with given fixed angles and one unknown angle \( x \) that completes the angle multiset of a polygon with \( n \) sides. The polygon satisfies the usual condition that the sum of interior angles is \((n-2) \times 180\) degrees and that all angles are strictly between 0 and \(180 (n-2)/n\) (which is the polygon angle bound condition).

Since the original "program" is empty and no enumeration or calculation is done, the output "Error: Program is empty" means the original program obviously fails to solve or enumerate the solutions. This must be rejected.

We should provide a Python enumerator that, for small \( n \geq 3 \), calculates the possible \( x \) that satisfies the sum condition and the angle bound condition.

Steps to do:
- The known angles are: 30, 50, 60, 70, 90, 100, 120, 160, and the unknown \( x \).
- For each \( n \) starting from 3 up to some small limit (for example maximum number of angles is 9 here because the multiset has 9 angles, so n=9), check:
    - Is \( n = 9 \)? Because we have 9 angles total, and \( n \) must be the number of polygon sides, \( n = 9 \).
    - Then sum these known angles plus \( x \) equals \( (n-2)*180 \).
    - So \( x = (n-2)*180 - \) sum of known angles.
    - Check that \( x \) satisfies \(0 < x < 180 (n-2)/n\).
- If so, print \( n \) and \( x \).

Since the problem is about determining \( x \), only \( n=9 \) makes sense because the angle multiset has exactly 9 values.

Hence the code should:

- Print the used values of \( n \).
- Calculate and print the answer \( x \) immediately.
- Verify the angle bounds.

This matches problem requirements and ensures output is below limit.
