This problem considers a real quartic polynomial \( f \) with roots \( 2i \) and \( 2+i \) (complex roots). We know complex roots of real polynomials come in conjugate pairs, so the other roots are likely the conjugates \( -2i \) and \( 2 - i \).

The problem asks to find the sum of the coefficients except the leading one, i.e., \( f_3 + f_2 + f_1 + f_0 \).

We can generate the polynomial from roots:
\[
f(x) = (x - 2i)(x + 2i)(x - (2+i))(x - (2 - i))
\]

We can expand this symbolically or numerically for small integer coefficients and print the value.

```python
# Enumerate the polynomial created by roots 2i, -2i, 2 + i, 2 - i
# Then print the sum coeff f_3 + f_2 + f_1 + f_0

import cmath

def poly_from_roots(roots):
    # start with polynomial 1
    coeffs = [1]  # coefficients for x^0
    for r in roots:
        new_coeffs = [0]*(len(coeffs)+1)
        for i in range(len(coeffs)):
            new_coeffs[i] += -r * coeffs[i]
            new_coeffs[i+1] += coeffs[i]
        coeffs = new_coeffs
    return coeffs

def main():
    # roots given
    roots = [2j, -2j, 2+1j, 2-1j]
    coeffs = poly_from_roots(roots)
    # coeffs: from x^0 to x^4, i.e. coeffs[4] is leading coeff = 1

    # coeffs are complex but polynomial has real coefficients; take real parts
    coeffs_real = [c.real for c in coeffs]

    # Print all coefficients for check
    # Coeff order: a0 + a1 x + a2 x^2 + a3 x^3 + a4 x^4
    print("Polynomial coefficients (constant to x^4):")
    for i, c in enumerate(coeffs_real):
        print(f"coeff f_{i}: {c}")

    # Compute sum f_3 + f_2 + f_1 + f_0
    s = coeffs_real[3] + coeffs_real[2] + coeffs_real[1] + coeffs_real[0]
    print("Sum coeff f_3 + f_2 + f_1 + f_0 =", s)
