The problem involves complex sequences \( z(k) \) with alternating purely real and purely imaginary terms, satisfying \(|z_k z_{k+1}| = 2^k\), and asks about minimizing norms of partial sums. We enumerate \( z(k) \) for small \( n \), choosing \( z(k) \) on axes (real for odd \( k \), imaginary for even \( k \)) with magnitudes consistent with the constraint, and print norms of partial sums and their products.

```python
import math
from itertools import product

# Enumerate possibilities for z(k) with constraints:
# odd k: z(k).imag=0 (pure real)
# even k: z(k).real=0 (pure imaginary)
# |z(k)*z(k+1)|=2^k => |z(k)|*|z(k+1)|=2^k
# We'll choose signs ±1 for components since magnitudes satisfy product conditions.
# For n=3 or 4, enumerate sign choices, compute sums norms.

def norm(z):
    return abs(z.real) + abs(z.imag)  # L1 norm to avoid floats? No, use abs complex.

def main():
    for n in [3,4]: # small n samples
        print(f"n={n}")
        # Determine magnitudes |z(k)|
        mags = [0]*(n+2)
        mags[1] = 2**((n+1)//2)  # arbitrary start for |z(1)|
        # deduce others from product constraints
        # We solve |z(k+1)| = 2^k / |z(k)|
        # choose |z(1)|=1 to simplify
        mags[1]=1.0
        for k in range(1,n+1):
            mags[k+1] = 2**k / mags[k]
        # Signs for each z(k): ±1 in real or imag axis
        signs = [-1,1]
        # For each k, assign sign on axis 
        # sign choices: n+1 values
        for sign_tuple in product(signs, repeat=n+1):
            z = []
            for k in range(1,n+2):
                mag = mags[k]
                s = sign_tuple[k-1]
                if k%2==1:  # odd k: real axis
                    z.append(complex(s*mag,0))
                else:        # even k: imag axis
                    z.append(complex(0,s*mag))
            sum_n = sum(z[1:n+1],complex(0,0))
            sum_nplus1 = sum(z[1:n+2],complex(0,0))
            norm_sum_n = abs(sum_n)
            norm_prod = norm_sum_n*abs(sum_nplus1)
            print(f"Signs {sign_tuple} -> ||sum_n||={norm_sum_n:.5f}, product={norm_prod:.5f}")
