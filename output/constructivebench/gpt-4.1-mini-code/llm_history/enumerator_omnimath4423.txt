The problem relates to decomposing a bijection f on integers with displacement bounded by k into a composition of bijections each moving points by at most 1. We want to verify the conjecture for small values of k.

We will:
- Check small k values (1 to 4).
- Enumerate all bijections f: ℤ → ℤ with |f(z)-z| ≤ k over a small integer range centered at 0.
- Attempt to write f as composition of bijections each with displacement ≤ 1.
- Print the results as they come to conjecture omnimath4423_answer(k).

Since ℤ is infinite, for practical enumeration, we restrict domain to integers in [-m, m] for small m depending on k, and treat bijections on finite sets Z = {−m,..,m}.

    # Heuristic:
    # Decompose permutation as product of permutations each moving elements by at most 1
    # We try compositions of simple shifts (±1 transpositions or identity)
    n = len(domain)
    # Because domain is small, try a BFS of applying all ±1 bounded bijections
    from collections import deque
