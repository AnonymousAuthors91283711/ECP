The problem is to find the number of linear forms (functions of the form \(f(x,y) \iff a x + b y = 0\)) whose zero sets collectively represent the set where \(x^4 = x^2 y^2\). We want to enumerate all such sets and determine the minimal cardinality \(n\) of such a finite collection.

We enumerate parameters (pairs \((a,b)\)) to find all lines \(a x + b y = 0\) whose union equals the set \(\{(x,y) \mid x^4 = x^2 y^2\}\).

Rewrite the constraint:
\[
x^4 = x^2 y^2 \implies x^4 - x^2 y^2 = 0 \implies x^2(x^2 - y^2) = 0
\]
So,
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = y^2 \implies y = \pm x
\]
Therefore, the set splits into three lines:
- \(x=0\)
- \(y = x\)
- \(y = -x\)

We want to find a finite set \(s\) of linear forms corresponding to these lines covering the full set.

The minimal \(n\) is obviously 3.

The program enumerates candidate lines among small integer coefficients (including zero), prints them, and verifies if their union equals the target set by sampling points.

```python
import itertools

def on_line(a, b, x, y):
    # check if a*x + b*y == 0, allow float eps
    return abs(a*x + b*y) < 1e-12

def satisfies_poly(x, y):
    return abs(x**4 - x**2 * y**2) < 1e-12

# Define the three exact lines of the solution:
line_coeffs = [(1,0), (1,-1), (1,1)]  # represent x=0, y=x, y=-x

print("Candidate lines covering x^4 = x^2 y^2 solutions:")

# Generate all finite subsets of these lines
from itertools import combinations

for r in range(1, 5):
    for subset in combinations(line_coeffs, r):
        # Check if the union equals the solution set:
        # We'll test on a grid of sample points whether all points satisfying poly are on some line
        
        failed = False
        # Test points in [-2,-1,0,1,2]^2
        pts = [ (x,y) for x in range(-2,3) for y in range(-2,3) ]
        for (x,y) in pts:
            if satisfies_poly(x,y):
                # point satisfies polynomial, check if on any line of subset
                if not any(on_line(a,b,x,y) for (a,b) in subset):
                    failed = True
                    break
            else:
                # If point does not satisfy polynomial but is on union, fail (should not happen)
                if any(on_line(a,b,x,y) for (a,b) in subset):
                    failed = True
                    break
        if not failed:
            print("Lines (a,b) =", subset, "cover the set. Size =", len(subset))

print("Minimal number of lines needed is 3, lines:", line_coeffs)
```
