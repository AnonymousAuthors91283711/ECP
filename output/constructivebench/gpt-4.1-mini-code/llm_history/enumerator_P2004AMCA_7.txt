[write_program]
The problem involves iterating a process on triples \((x,y,z)\) of natural numbers starting from \((a,b,c) = (15,14,13)\) and tracking the values of \(n\) for which some coordinate in the triple becomes zero at the \(n\)-th iteration. The goal is to find the greatest such \(n\).

I will write a Python program that simulates this iteration step by step for small initial triples near the given one, prints every \(n\) at which a coordinate hits zero, and tries to identify the greatest such \(n\). This simulation can help conjecture the maximum number of iterations before hitting zero coordinates.

```python
# Enumerate iteration steps for given (a,b,c)
# print n when any coordinate hits zero
# also try a few sample initial triples near (15,14,13)

def step(x,y,z):
    if x >= y and x >= z:
        return (x - (y+z+1), y+1, z+1)
    elif y >= x and y >= z:
        return (x+1, y - (x+z+1), z+1)
    else:
        return (x+1, y+1, z - (x+y+1))

def simulate(a,b,c,max_iter=1000):
    x,y,z = a,b,c
    for n in range(max_iter+1):
        if x == 0 or y == 0 or z == 0:
            print(f"Initial ({a},{b},{c}), n={n}, triple=({x},{y},{z}) zero coordinate hit")
            yield n
        x,y,z = step(x,y,z)
        # stop if any coordinate negative because negative is forbidden
        if x < 0 or y < 0 or z < 0:
            # This iteration leads to negative, stop
            break

# Explore the original triple
found = list(simulate(15,14,13))

# Explore small nearby samples for comparison
samples = [(15,14,13),(14,14,13),(15,13,13),(15,14,12),(16,14,13)]
for a,b,c in samples:
    list(simulate(a,b,c))

# Print the maximum n found for the original triple
if found:
    print(f"Max n with zero coordinate starting from (15,14,13) is {max(found)}")
else:
    print("No zero coordinate reached up to iteration limit.")
```
