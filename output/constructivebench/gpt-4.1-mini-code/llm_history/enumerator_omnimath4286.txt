This problem is about solving the Diophantine equation x²(1 + x²) = -1 + 21^y for integers x and natural numbers y. We want to enumerate candidate integer pairs (x, y) satisfying this.

We can rewrite as x² + x⁴ = 21^y - 1. For y=0, RHS=0; for larger y, rapidly grows.

We will try small values of y, from 1 up to some threshold, compute RHS=21^y -1, then try integer x values with x²(1+x²)=RHS. We check if RHS can be written as x² + x⁴.

The equation can be rewritten as x⁴ + x² - RHS=0, consider it as a quadratic in z = x²: z² + z - RHS=0. Check if discriminant 1+4*RHS is a perfect square. Then from z = (-1 ± sqrt(1+4*RHS))/2 pick integer positive z (x²), and x=±sqrt(z).

We enumerate y from 0 to 7 or so, compute RHS=21^y-1, try to find integer z ≥0 solutions of z² + z - RHS=0.

Print all such pairs immediately as we find them.

```python
# Program to find integer solutions (x,y) to x²(1 + x²) = 21^y -1

import math

def is_perfect_square(n):
    if n < 0: return False
    r = int(math.isqrt(n))
    return r*r == n

def try_y(y):
    RHS = pow(21, y) -1
    disc = 1 + 4*RHS  # discriminant of z² + z - RHS = 0
    if is_perfect_square(disc):
        s = int(math.isqrt(disc))
        # z = (-1 ± s)/2
        for sign in [-1,1]:
            numerator = -1 + sign * s
            if numerator % 2 == 0:
                z = numerator // 2
                if z >= 0:
                    # z = x², check if z is perfect square
                    if is_perfect_square(z):
                        x = int(math.isqrt(z))
                        for xx in [x, -x]:
                            print(f"Found solution: x={xx}, y={y}")

print("Enumerating possible solutions (x,y) for x^2(1 + x^2) = 21^y -1")

for y in range(8):  # small y values
    try_y(y)
