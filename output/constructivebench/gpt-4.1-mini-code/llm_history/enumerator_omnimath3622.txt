The problem involves finding positive integers \( m \) such that there exist integer sequences \( a \) and \( g \) where for every \( n \), \( a(n) \equiv g(n) \pmod{m} \) and yet \( (a(2) - a(1)) \not\equiv 0 \pmod{m} \). The sequences \( a \) and \( g \) differ by multiples of \( m \) pointwise, but the difference \( a(2) - a(1) \) is not divisible by \( m \).

We can attempt to enumerate possible \( m \) and construct sequences \( a, g \) to verify when the conditions hold. For ease, pick small \( m \) and try simple functions \( g \) and corresponding \( a \) satisfying the congruence.

This serves to identify \( m \) for which the set is nonempty, guiding conjecture of the answer set.

```python
# Enumerate positive integers m up to a threshold and try to find sequences a,g : ℕ→ℤ
# with a(n) ≡ g(n) mod m for all n, but (a(2)-a(1)) not divisible by m.
# We'll test simple structured sequences: let g be constant zero sequence,
# a(n) = g(n) + k_n * m with k_n integers.
# The condition m | a(n)-g(n) always holds.
# To violate m | (a(2)-a(1)), (a(2)-a(1)) mod m != 0,
# means (k_2 - k_1)*m mod m != 0, impossible,
# so try g not constant.
# Try g(n)=n, a(n)=g(n)*m + r_n, adjust r_n mod m.
# We'll brute force small r_n values to find an example.

MAX_M = 20  # Limit for search

print("Testing m from 1 to", MAX_M)
for m in range(1, MAX_M+1):
    # Try a(n) = g(n) + x_n*m, g(n) any sequence, try g(n)=n mod m for n=1,2
    # We want (a(n)-g(n)) divisible by m, so difference x_n*m fits.
    # But (a(2)-a(1)) mod m !=0 means ((g(2)+x_2*m)-(g(1)+x_1*m)) mod m != 0 
    # => (g(2)-g(1)) mod m != 0
    # So key is g(2)-g(1) mod m ≠ 0

    # So choose g with g(2)-g(1) ≠ 0 mod m:
    # For example, g(1)=0, g(2)=1 satisfies difference 1 mod m
    # Then for a(n), set a(n) = g(n) + k_n*m, so a(n)-g(n) divisible by m always.
    # Here (a(2)-a(1)) mod m = (g(2)-g(1)) mod m = 1 ≠ 0, condition satisfied.

    # These choices work for any m>1 (since 1 mod 1=0).
    if m == 1:
        # difference mod 1 is 0 always
        print(f"m={m}: no sequences found due to mod 1 triviality")
    else:
        print(f"m={m}: example found, g(1)=0, g(2)=1, a(n)=g(n) (x_n=0)")
print("Conjecture: all m > 1 satisfy the condition.")
