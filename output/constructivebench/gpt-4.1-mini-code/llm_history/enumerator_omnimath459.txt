[write_program]
This problem counts numbers \( n \) in the range \([1, 1000000]\) satisfying \( n \bmod 1000 > n \bmod 1001 \). The program enumerates all such \( n \) and prints them, then prints the total count.

```python
# Enumerate all n from 1 to 1,000,000 where n%1000 > n%1001
# Print each such n and at last print the total count.

def main():
    count = 0
    for n in range(1, 10**6 + 1):
        r1000 = n % 1000
        r1001 = n % 1001
        if r1000 > r1001:
            print(n)
            count += 1
    print(f"Total count: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
