The problem seems to ask for all real numbers \( x \) such that \( x^3 < x^2 \). We want to find the set of \( x \) satisfying this inequality.

Rewrite \( x^3 < x^2 \) as \( x^3 - x^2 < 0 \) or equivalently \( x^2(x-1) < 0 \).

Because \( x^2 \ge 0 \) always, and zero only at \( x=0 \), the inequality \( x^2 (x-1) < 0 \) holds if and only if \( x^2 > 0 \) and \( x-1 < 0 \), i.e. \( x \neq 0 \) and \( x < 1 \).

So the solution set is \( (-\infty, 0) \cup (0, 1) \).

To illustrate with enumeration and numeric checking, I will test values around critical points -2, -1, 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and print which satisfy \( x^3 < x^2 \).

```python
# Enumerate sample real values and check x^3 < x^2

test_vals = [-2, -1, -0.5, -0.1, 0, 0.1, 0.5, 0.9, 1, 1.1, 2]
print("Checking x^3 < x^2 for sample x:")

for x in test_vals:
    lhs = x**3
    rhs = x**2
    if lhs < rhs:
        print(f"x = {x}: {x}^3 = {lhs} < {x}^2 = {rhs} -- True")
    else:
        print(f"x = {x}: {x}^3 = {lhs} < {x}^2 = {rhs} -- False")

print("\nConjecture: x^3 < x^2 for x in (-âˆž, 0) U (0, 1)")
```
