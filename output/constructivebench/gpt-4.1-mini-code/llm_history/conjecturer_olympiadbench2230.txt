theorem olympiadbench2230 (k : ℕ) (hk : 0 < k) :
  IsLeast {m : ℕ | ∀ (D : Finset (Fin k → Fin 2)), 
    m ≤ D.card → 
    ∃ (M : Fin k → Fin k → Fin 2), 
    (∀ j, (fun i => M i j) ∈ D) ∧ (∀ i, (fun j => M i j) ∈ D)} 
  (olympiadbench2230_answer k) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: 
Enumerating for k=2 (total vectors=4)
All sets of size 2 have M for k=2
Minimal m for k=2 conjectured as 2

Enumerating for k=3 (total vectors=8)
Fail for m=3, D=((0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 0), (0, 1, 1))
Fail for m=3, D=((0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 1), (1, 0, 1))
Some sets of size 3 do not have M for k=3, minimal m > 3
All sets of size 4 have M for k=3
Minimal m for k=3 conjectured as 4. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
<<<fun k : ℕ => 2^(k - 1)>>>
