Ground Truth Answer: {n | 3 ≤ n}
Proposed Answer: { n : ℕ | n > 1 ∧ n % 2 = 1 }
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for which natural numbers n > 1 there exists a non-zero integer sequence (a_k) such that for all k, the weighted sum of a_{(i+1)*k} equals zero.

2. The ground truth answer is all natural numbers n ≥ 3.

3. The proposed answer is all odd natural numbers greater than 1.

The proposed answer is a subset of the ground truth answer (since all odd numbers ≥3 are included in n ≥3), but it's missing the even numbers ≥4. The condition n > 1 ∧ n % 2 = 1 gives us {3,5,7,...} while the correct answer should be {3,4,5,6,7,...}.

Therefore, the proposed answer is partially correct but incomplete.
