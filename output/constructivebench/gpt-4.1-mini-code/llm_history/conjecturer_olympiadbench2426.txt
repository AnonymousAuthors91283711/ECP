theorem olympiadbench2426 :
  ∃! v, v > 0 ∧ 
  (let train_interval := 3/60;  -- trains depart every 3 minutes (in hours)
   let passing_interval := 10/60;  -- Linh is passed every 10 minutes (in hours)
   let linh_speed := 60;
   -- Relative speed between trains and Linh
   let relative_speed := v - linh_speed;
   -- Distance between consecutive trains
   let train_distance := v * train_interval;
   -- Time between passes should equal distance divided by relative speed
   passing_interval = train_distance / relative_speed) ∧
  v = olympiadbench2426_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Parameters:
train_interval = 1/20 hours
passing_interval = 1/6 hours
linh_speed = 60 km/h
Enumerating candidate train speeds v > linh_speed:
Exact solution for v (km/h): 600/7 (~85.714286)
v = 85: lhs=0.166667, rhs=0.170000
v = 86: lhs=0.166667, rhs=0.165385. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
