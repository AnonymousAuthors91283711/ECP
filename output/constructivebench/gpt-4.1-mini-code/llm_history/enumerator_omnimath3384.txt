[write_program]
The problem appears to ask for the smallest natural number \( m \) such that for all natural numbers \( s_1, s_2, s_3 \), if the average \(\frac{m + s_1 + s_2 + s_3}{4} = 20\), then each \( s_i < 20 \). I'll write a Python program to enumerate candidates for \( m \), check the condition for all relevant triples \( (s_1,s_2,s_3) \), and identify the minimal \( m \).

```python
# Enumerate m and triples (s1,s2,s3) with 0 <= s_i < 40 (reasonably small)
# Check if (m + s1 + s2 + s3)/4 == 20 implies s_i < 20 for all i.
# If there's any s_i >= 20 when average = 20, then reject m.

def main():
    target_avg = 20
    max_si = 39  # upper bound for s_i to check

    for m in range(1, 80):  # Try values of m up to 80
        valid_for_all = True
        for s1 in range(max_si+1):
            for s2 in range(max_si+1):
                for s3 in range(max_si+1):
                    total = m + s1 + s2 + s3
                    if total == 4*target_avg:
                        # condition must hold: s_i < 20 for all i
                        if not (s1 < 20 and s2 < 20 and s3 < 20):
                            print(f"m={m} fails: s1={s1}, s2={s2}, s3={s3} average 20 but s_i >=20 exists")
                            valid_for_all = False
                            break
                if not valid_for_all:
                    break
            if not valid_for_all:
                break
        if valid_for_all:
            print(f"Candidate m = {m} is valid for all (s1,s2,s3)")
            print(f"Minimal m found: {m}")
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
