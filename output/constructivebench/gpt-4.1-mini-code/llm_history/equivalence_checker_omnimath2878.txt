Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: 4 / 8 + 8 / 4
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer directly applies the definition of `otimes` given in the hypothesis `hotimes`, which states that `otimes a b = a / b + b / a`. When we substitute `a = 4` and `b = 8` into this definition, we get exactly the proposed answer `4 / 8 + 8 / 4`. Therefore, the proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer.
