The problem involves integer solutions \((x,y)\) to the equation:

\[
x^2 + xy + y^2 = \left(\frac{x + y}{3} + 1\right)^3
\]

and characterization of these solutions in terms of two infinite sets parametric in \(n \in \mathbb{Z}\).

To explore and understand this, we can enumerate integer tuples \((x,y)\) for small values of \(x,y\), check the equation, and print those that satisfy it exactly. We'll also enumerate the sequences \(\{(-n^3 + 3n + 1, n^3 + 3n^2 - 1)\}\) and compare.

The program will:
- Iterate over small integer ranges for \(x,y\).
- Test the equality exactly, checking if \((x+y)\) divisible by 3 to avoid fractions.
- Print any \((x,y)\) that satisfy the equation.
- Print the parameter \(n\) and the corresponding \((x,y)\) generated by the parametric formula.
- Since the problem refers to a set \(\{omnimath252_answer n\}\), but the function is omitted, we just enumerate what we can and print results.

```python
# enumerator.py
# Enumerate integer pairs (x,y) satisfying x^2 + x*y + y^2 = ((x + y)/3 + 1)^3
# and compare with the given parametric family (-n^3 + 3n +1, n^3 + 3n^2 -1).

def lhs(x,y):
    return x*x + x*y + y*y

def rhs(x,y):
    s = x + y
    if s % 3 != 0:
        return None
    val = (s//3) + 1
    return val*val*val

RANGE = 12  # test small integers to explore

print("Enumerating (x,y) with |x|,|y| <= {} satisfying equality:".format(RANGE))
for x in range(-RANGE, RANGE+1):
    for y in range(-RANGE, RANGE+1):
        r = rhs(x,y)
        if r is not None and lhs(x,y) == r:
            print(f"x={x}, y={y}, lhs={lhs(x,y)}, rhs={r}")

print("\nEnumerate parametric family (-n^3 +3n +1, n^3 +3n^2 -1) for n in [-{}..{}]:".format(RANGE, RANGE))
for n in range(-RANGE, RANGE+1):
    X = -n**3 + 3*n + 1
    Y = n**3 + 3*n**2 - 1
    # Check if equality holds for these pairs:
    l = lhs(X,Y)
    r = rhs(X,Y)
    valid = (r is not None and l == r)
    print(f"n={n}: (x,y)=({X},{Y}), lhs={l}, rhs={r}, valid={valid}")
```
This will output exact solutions found by brute force and verify the parametric candidate solutions. The results help conjecture that all solutions may arise from these two parametric families.
