Explanation: The error is that the polynomial variable in Mathlib is denoted by `Polynomial.X` instead of just `X`. Also, scalar multiplication is done via `c • Polynomial.X ^ 2`. So the correct answer is the set of polynomials equal to `c • X^2` for real `c`. This matches the pattern found by enumeration and the problem's functional equation.
