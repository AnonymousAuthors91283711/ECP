The problem is about the minimal absolute value of a complex number of the form \(a + b\omega + c\omega^2\), where \(\omega\) is a complex cube root of unity different from 1, and \(a, b, c\) are integers with product 60. We want to find the smallest possible absolute value (modulus) of such numbers.

To explore this, we'll:
- Use \(\omega = e^{2\pi i/3}\).
- Enumerate all integer triples \((a,b,c)\) with \(|a|, |b|, |c| \leq 60\) and \(a \times b \times c = 60\) (positive 60, as negative would just reflect results).
- Compute \(|a + b\omega + c\omega^2|\).
- Print all found values and track the minimal one.

This will help conjecture the minimum and verify candidate values. We prioritize exact values by also printing \(|z|^2\) as rational numbers when possible.

```python
import cmath

# Primitive cube root of unity (excluding 1)
omega = cmath.rect(1, 2 * cmath.pi / 3)  # e^{2pi i/3}

def abs_squared(z):
    # Returns exact squared magnitude (float here), exact if z components are integers/fractions
    return z.real*z.real + z.imag*z.imag

def factors(n):
    # Enumerate integer factors of n
    res = []
    for i in range(1, abs(n)+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            res.append(i)
            res.append(-i)
    return sorted(set(res))

    n = 60
    fs = factors(n)
    min_abs = None
    min_tuple = None
    printed = set()
    # Enumerate all triples (a,b,c) with a*b*c=60 from factors
    for a in fs:
        for b in fs:
            if a * b == 0:
                continue
            if n % (a*b) != 0:
                continue
            c = n // (a * b)
            if c not in fs:
                continue
            z = a + b*omega + c*omega**2
            val = abs(z)
            val_sq = abs_squared(z)
            key = (round(val_sq, 10), a, b, c)
            if key in printed:
                continue
            printed.add(key)
            print(f"a={a:2d}, b={b:2d}, c={c:2d} => |a+bω+cω²| = {val:.6f} (|z|²={val_sq:.6f})")
            if (min_abs is None) or (val < min_abs):
                min_abs = val
                min_tuple = (a,b,c,val)
    print(f"\nMinimum |a+bω+cω²| found: {min_abs:.6f} for (a,b,c) = {min_tuple[:3]}")
```
