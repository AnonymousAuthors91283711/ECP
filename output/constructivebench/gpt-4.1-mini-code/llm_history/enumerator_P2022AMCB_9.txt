The problem involves finding natural numbers \(a_0, d\) (with \(d > 0, a_0 > 0\)) such that the sequence \(a_n = a_0 + n d\) is increasing, and satisfies the equation:
\[
a_0 + 7d - 27 = \log_2(a_0 + 7d).
\]
We want to enumerate possible pairs \((a_0, d)\) and check the above equation holds exactly (i.e., the right-hand side is integer and equals the left).

Then, among all such solutions, we want to find the smallest value of \(a_0 + 2d\).

The program will:
- Iterate over small values for \(a_0\) and \(d\),
- Compute \(x = a_0 + 7d\),
- Check if \(\log_2(x)\) is integer and equals \(x - 27\),
- If so, print the corresponding \(a_2 = a_0 + 2d\),
- Keep track of minimal \(a_2\).

We limit the iteration range to keep output under 400 tokens.

```python
import math

min_a2 = None
print("Searching for (a0,d) with 0<a0,d<=50 and equation holds:")
for d in range(1, 51):
    for a0 in range(1, 51):
        x = a0 + 7*d
        rhs = math.log2(x)
        if rhs.is_integer():
            rhs_int = int(rhs)
            lhs = x - 27
            if lhs == rhs_int:
                a2 = a0 + 2*d
                print(f"a0={a0}, d={d}, a0+7d={x}, lhs={lhs}, rhs=log2({x})={rhs_int}, a2={a2}")
                if min_a2 is None or a2 < min_a2:
                    min_a2 = a2
if min_a2 is not None:
    print(f"Minimum a2 = {min_a2}")
else:
    print("No solutions found in given range.")
```
