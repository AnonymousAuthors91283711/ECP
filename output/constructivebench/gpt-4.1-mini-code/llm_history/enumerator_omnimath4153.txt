The problem concerns characterization of twice continuously differentiable functions \( f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R} \) satisfying the functional equation \( f(7x+1) = 49 f(x) \) for all real \( x \).

To assist in conjecturing the solution shape of these functions, we enumerate some candidate functions and test whether they satisfy the functional equation exactly.

Key observations:
- The scaling \( 7x + 1 \) suggests linear changes of variable.
- The equation \(f(7x+1) = 49 f(x)\) scales \(f(x)\) by \(49\).
- Polynomials up to degree 2 are twice differentiable and easy to test.
- Try general quadratic \(f(x) = a x^2 + b x + c\) and see under what conditions the functional equation holds exactly.
- Test also monomials for patterns, such as \(f(x) = x^n\), to detect eigenfunction-like behavior.
- Print any exact polynomial fits discovered, and approximate numerical tests for other functions.

```python
# Enumerate candidate functions f satisfying f(7x+1) = 49 f(x) for f twice differentiable.
# Focus on polynomials up to degree 2 and monomials to conjecture solutions.

def check_poly(a,b,c):
    # Check if f(x)=a x^2 + b x + c satisfies f(7x+1) = 49 f(x) ∀x.
    # Means equality of two polynomials:
    # Left: a(7x+1)^2 + b(7x+1) + c
    # Right: 49(a x^2 + b x + c)
    # Equate coefficients termwise:

    # Left expanded:
    # a(49 x^2 +14 x +1) + b(7 x + 1) + c
    # = 49 a x^2 +14 a x + a + 7 b x + b + c
    # = 49 a x^2 + (14 a +7 b) x + (a + b + c)

    # Right expanded:
    # 49 a x^2 + 49 b x + 49 c

    # Equate coef by degree:
    # x^2: 49 a = 49 a   (always true)
    # x^1: 14 a +7 b = 49 b   => 14 a = 42 b => b = (1/3) a
    # x^0: a + b + c = 49 c   => a + b = 48 c

    # Given b in terms of a, c in terms of a and b:
    # c = (a + b)/48 = (a + (1/3)a)/48 = (4/3 a)/48 = a/36

    # So all triples proportional to:
    # a = a
    # b = a/3
    # c = a/36

    # Return if consistent and print normalized polynomial

    # To avoid zero polynomial, choose a=36 for integers:
    a_int = 36
    b_int = 12  # 36/3=12
    c_int = 1   # 36/36=1

    print(f"Polynomial solution candidate: f(x) = {a_int} x^2 + {b_int} x + {c_int}")

def check_monomials(n_max=4):
    # Check if monomial x^n satisfies f(7x+1) = 49 f(x):
    # (7x+1)^n = 49 x^n for all x?
    # Only possible if (7 x +1)^n = 49 x^n ∀ x,
    # but this is a polynomial equality, so coefficients must match.
    # Test each n=0..n_max.

    for n in range(n_max+1):
        # For n=0: 1=49*1? no
        # But x=0 test for general n:
        # At x=0, Left=1^n=1 Right=49*0=0 => no, fail
        # For n=2: (7x+1)^2=49 x^2 + 14 x +1 vs 49 x^2
        # Not equal unless 14 x +1 ≡0, no
        # So monomial alone fails.
        # Let's try linear combinations to spot eigenfunctions.

        # Print result
        print(f"Check monomial f(x) = x^{n}: no exact solution unless n=0")
