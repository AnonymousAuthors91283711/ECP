The problem states an equality involving real numbers and asks to find the exact value of (8 + 4) / (8 - 4). We can enumerate potential answers by evaluating this expression and verifying candidate values. Since it's a simple arithmetic expression, we directly compute it exactly and print the result.

```python
# Enumerate candidate answers for (8 + 4) / (8 - 4)
numerator = 8 + 4
denominator = 8 - 4

# Avoid division by zero
if denominator != 0:
    result = numerator / denominator
    # Print the exact value and also as fraction if possible
    from fractions import Fraction
    frac_result = Fraction(numerator, denominator)
    print(f"Exact fraction form: {frac_result}")
    print(f"Floating point form: {float(result)}")
else:
    print("Denominator is zero; division undefined.")
```
