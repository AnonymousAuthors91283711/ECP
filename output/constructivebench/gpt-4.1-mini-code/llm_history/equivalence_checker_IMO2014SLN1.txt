open Set Function Nat

abbrev IMO2014SLN1_answer : ℕ → ℕ := sorry
theorem IMO2014SLN1 (n : ℕ) (hn : 2 ≤ n) :
  IsGreatest {m : ℕ | ¬ ∃ (s : Finset ℕ), (∀ k ∈ s, k < n) ∧ m = ∑ k in s, (2^n - 2^k)} (IMO2014SLN1_answer n) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (n - 2) * 2^n + 1
Proposed Answer: fun n => 2^(n + 1) - 2 * n - 2
Let's analyze the problem and the two answers:

1. The problem asks for the greatest natural number m that cannot be expressed as a sum of numbers of the form (2^n - 2^k) where k < n.

2. Ground Truth Answer: (n-2)*2^n + 1
   - For n=2: (0)*4 + 1 = 1
   - For n=3: (1)*8 + 1 = 9
   - For n=4: (2)*16 + 1 = 33

3. Proposed Answer: 2^(n+1) - 2n - 2
   - For n=2: 8 - 4 - 2 = 2
   - For n=3: 16 - 6 - 2 = 8
   - For n=4: 32 - 8 - 2 = 22

The values clearly don't match for any n ≥ 2. The proposed answer gives smaller numbers than the ground truth, and the pattern of differences grows rapidly (1 vs 2, 9 vs 8, 33 vs 22).
