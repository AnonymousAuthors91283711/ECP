Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: 4 * 3 * 2
<<<True>>>

The problem is asking for the number of injective functions from Fin 3 to Fin 4. The proposed answer 4 * 3 * 2 correctly calculates this as:
- 4 choices for the first element (c 0)
- 3 remaining choices for the second element (c 1, must be different from c 0)
- 2 remaining choices for the third element (c 2, must be different from c 0 and c 1)

This is indeed the standard way to count injective functions between finite sets, where the domain has size 3 and codomain has size 4. The ground truth answer would be 24 (4*3*2), so the proposed answer is correct.
