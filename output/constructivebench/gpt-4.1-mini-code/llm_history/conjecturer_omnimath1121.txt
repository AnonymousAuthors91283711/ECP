The error occurs because Lean cannot directly compute real number exponentiation in a computable way, due to dependencies on non-definitional constructs of the real number system. To fix this, we mark the answer as noncomputable, allowing use of noncomputable definitions like (1 + 1/100)^100 in ℝ.

Your candidate expression `(1 + 1/100)^100` is exactly the closed-form expected answer for this compounding growth problem (starting at 1 coin, multiplied by (1 + 1/100) each round for 100 rounds).

Hence the fix is to mark the definition as `noncomputable` and keep the expression as is.

The error occurs because you cannot write "noncomputable def" inside an abbreviation and you should not redefine the same name twice. Since the answer is numeric and involves real numbers, you can write simply as an abbreviation with a real literal expression, coercing the rational number 1/100 to real. Your enumerated answers confirm that (1 + 1/n)^n is the pattern, so for n=100 it is (1 + 1/100)^100.

Here is the fixed Lean expression:

Expected coins after 100 rounds: 2.7048138294. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The error arises because Lean's real number structure often requires marking definitions as `noncomputable` when they depend on instance proofs or objects that do not have computable implementations. Since the expression involves real division and exponentiation, Lean requires the definition to be marked `noncomputable`.

The enumerated pattern `(1 + 1/n)^n` converges to e as n grows large, and for n=100, the expected coins after 100 rounds are exactly `(1 + 1/100)^100`.

The fix is to mark the abbreviation as `noncomputable`, allowing Lean to accept it without requiring computational content.

The Lean error arises because the definition of `omnimath1121_answer` involves real division and exponentiation, which depend on noncomputable instances in Lean's mathlib. To fix the error, we should mark the abbreviation as `noncomputable` to indicate it relies on noncomputable real numbers operations.

No further modifications are necessary; the expression `(1 + 1 / 100 : ℝ) ^ 100` is correct mathematically and matches the enumerated pattern for `(1 + 1/n)^n`, evaluated at n=100.

Thus the fixed code is:
