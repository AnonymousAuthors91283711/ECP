The problem looks for a unique natural number k between 2 and 40 such that:

(k * (k - 1)) / (40 * 39) = 5 / 12.

We will enumerate k in the range [2, 40], check the equality using exact fraction arithmetic (using fractions.Fraction), and print any k that satisfies the equation exactly.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def main():
    target = Fraction(5, 12)
    denominator = 40 * 39
    print("Enumerating k in [2..40] for (k*(k-1))/(40*39) == 5/12")
    for k in range(2, 41):
        val = Fraction(k * (k - 1), denominator)
        if val == target:
            print(f"k={k} yields fraction {val}")
    # Confirm uniqueness
    print("Done enumerating.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
