noncomputable abbrev omnimath1099_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath1099 : 
  let p := (3/4) * (1/4)  -- Probability of catching train in one minute
  let q := 1 - p          -- Probability of not catching train in one minute
  q^5 = (13/16)^5 ∧       -- Probability of not catching train in 5 minutes
  1 - q^5 = omnimath1099_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 1 - (13/16)^5
Proposed Answer: 1 - (13/16)^5
<<<True>>>
