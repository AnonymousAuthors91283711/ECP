The problem asks for the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that \( n \) is divisible by 60, 84, and 140. This is equivalent to finding the least common multiple (LCM) of these three numbers.

The program will:
- compute and print multiples of 60, 84, and 140 up to a threshold
- check if a number is divisible by all three
- print qualifying numbers immediately
- print the minimal found number at the end

```python
# Enumerate numbers divisible by 60, 84, and 140 to find the smallest n
# such that n % 60 == 0, n % 84 == 0, n % 140 == 0 (the LCM)
from math import gcd

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def lcm_three(a, b, c):
    return lcm(lcm(a, b), c)

a, b, c = 60, 84, 140
print(f"Checking divisibility by {a}, {b}, {c}")

# The minimal n is the LCM of the three numbers
limit = 5000  # search threshold
candidates = []
for n in range(1, limit + 1):
    if n % a == 0 and n % b == 0 and n % c == 0:
        print(f"Found n = {n}")
        candidates.append(n)
        break  # smallest found, so break

if candidates:
    print("Minimal n (LCM) =", candidates[0])
else:
    # If not found, compute directly
    minimal = lcm_three(a, b, c)
    print("Minimal n (LCM) computed =", minimal)
```
