The problem appears to be: count the number of functions \( a: \{0,1,2,3,4\} \to \mathbb{N} \) such that each \( a(i) \leq 7 \), and \( 5 \mid \sum_{i=0}^4 2^{a(i)} \).

We want to find how many such 5-tuples exist.

Strategy:
- Enumerate all 5-tuples with each element between 0 and 7.
- For each tuple, compute \( \sum 2^{a(i)} \).
- Check if divisible by 5.
- Count those tuples.

Output all partial solutions by printing each tuple and their sum mod 5 or only print final when necessary.

Since there are \(8^5 = 32768\) tuples, this is manageable.

We will:
- Print each tuple that satisfies divisibility by 5, printing the tuple and the sum.
- Count total solutions and print at the end.

Implementation: enumerate all tuples of length 5 with elements from 0 to 7, check divisibility by 5.

```python
# Counting number of 5-tuples a with 0<=a[i]<=7 such that 5 divides sum of 2^(a[i])

def main():
    from itertools import product

    valid_count = 0
    # Precompute 2^k mod 5 and 2^k actual
    pow2 = [2**k for k in range(8)]
    pow2_mod5 = [x % 5 for x in pow2]

    for a in product(range(8), repeat=5):
        s_mod5 = sum(pow2_mod5[i] for i in a) % 5
        if s_mod5 == 0:
            # Print the tuple and sum of powers
            s = sum(pow2[i] for i in a)
            print(f"{a} sum= {s} divisible by 5")
            valid_count += 1

    print(f"Total count: {valid_count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
