<<<1>>> 
Explanation: The set S consists of perimeters of rectangles with integer sides a,b > 0 and area 24. These yield exactly four distinct perimeter values: 20, 22, 28, and 50. All other positive integers, including 1, do not have such a representation. Since the problem asks for a unique natural number not in S with the stated properties, the smallest natural number 1 is the canonical choice.
