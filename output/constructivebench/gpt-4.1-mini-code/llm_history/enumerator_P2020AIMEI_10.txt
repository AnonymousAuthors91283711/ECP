[write_program]
This problem looks like: Find the smallest positive integer k = m+n such that there exist positive integers m, n with gcd(m+n, 210) = 1, n^n divides m^m, but n does not divide m.

To explore this, I'll write a Python program to:
- Enumerate pairs (m, n) with m, n > 0, m+n = k for increasing k.
- Check gcd(m+n, 210) = 1.
- Check if n^n divides m^m.
- Check n does not divide m.
- Print all such (k, m, n).
- Then print the smallest k found.

To keep the program efficient and output short, I'll check k up to some small limit (e.g., 50) and only print candidates as found.

```python
# Enumerate (m,n) with m,n>0, m+n = k up to max_k
# Check conditions:
# gcd(m+n,210)=1
# n^n divides m^m
# n does NOT divide m

from math import gcd

def divides(a, b):
    # Check if a divides b
    return b % a == 0

def pow_divisible(m, n):
    # Check if n^n divides m^m
    # To optimize, prime factorize n, then check exponent condition in m^m
    # But n, m small, so direct pow check is feasible for small values
    
    # Instead of computing huge powers, factor prime factorization
    # n^n | m^m  means for every prime p dividing n, its exponent in n^n <= exponent in m^m
    # exponent in m^m = m * v_p(m)
    from collections import Counter
    def prime_factors(x):
        res = Counter()
        d = 2
        while d*d <= x:
            while x%d==0:
                res[d]+=1
                x//=d
            d+=1
        if x>1:
            res[x]+=1
        return res
    nf = prime_factors(n)
    mf = prime_factors(m)
    for p in nf:
        if p not in mf:
            return False
        if nf[p]*n > mf[p]*m:
            return False
    return True

max_k = 50
found = []
for k in range(2, max_k+1):
    if gcd(k, 210) != 1:
        continue
    for n in range(1, k):
        m = k - n
        if n == 0 or m == 0:
            continue
        if divides(n, m):
            continue
        if pow_divisible(m, n):
            print(f"k={k}, m={m}, n={n}")
            found.append(k)
            break  # only print first pair per k

if found:
    print("Minimum k found:", min(found))
else:
    print("No k found up to", max_k)
```
