The problem involves checking properties of two sets \( A \) and \( B \) of ordered pairs over \(\text{Fin}(n^2)\), along with a strictly increasing function on stations, to find the smallest \( k \) such that there exist two subsets \( A, B \) of size \( k \) satisfying complex monotonicity conditions and sharing a comparable path from \( x \) to \( y \).

We will enumerate relatively small \( n \) values (like 2 and 3). For each \( n \), we consider subsets \( A, B \) of all possible pairs on \(\text{Fin}(n^2)\), check the conditions, and track the minimal \( k = |A| = |B| \) for which the conditions hold. 

Due to combinatorial explosion, we will limit \( k \) and randomly sample or use heuristics. We prioritize printing exact \( k \) values found and print the minimal \( k \) at the end for each \( n \).

```python
# Enumerate candidates for minimal k in the omnimath3864 problem.
# For n=2 and 3, generate all pairs in range(n^2).
# We will test subsets A,B of pairs of size k for increasing k,
# check if monotonicity and chain conditions can be modeled,
# and print candidate k values immediately on success.
