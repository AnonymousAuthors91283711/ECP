The problem involves perfect numbers defined by the sum of their positive divisors equalling twice the number. We want to find all natural numbers n > 0 such that both (n-1) and the nth triangular number T_n = n(n+1)/2 are perfect. The goal is to conjecture the specific n satisfying this property.

We will:
- Enumerate n from 1 up to a small limit (e.g., 30)
- Check if n-1 is perfect
- Check if T_n is perfect
- Print all such n found
- Print the minimal such n (if any) as a candidate for mathodyssey12_answer

This enumeration may help identify or conjecture the unique solution.

```python
def divisors_sum(n):
    # sum of all positive divisors of n
    total = 0
    i = 1
    while i*i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            total += i
            if i*i != n and i != 1:
                total += n//i
        i += 1
    return total

def is_perfect(num):
    # check if sum of divisors = 2*num
    if num <= 0:
        return False
    return divisors_sum(num) == 2*num

print("Enumerating n where isPerfect(n-1) and isPerfect(n(n+1)/2):")
candidates = []
for n in range(1, 31):
    val1 = n-1
    val2 = n*(n+1)//2
    if is_perfect(val1) and is_perfect(val2):
        print(f"n={n}, n-1={val1} is perfect, T_n={val2} is perfect")
        candidates.append(n)

if candidates:
    print("Minimal such n (mathodyssey12_answer) =", min(candidates))
else:
    print("No such n found up to 30")
```
