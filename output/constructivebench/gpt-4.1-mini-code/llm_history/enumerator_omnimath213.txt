The problem involves irrational numbers \( x > 0 \) and conditions on fractional parts \(\{kx\}\) for \(k=1,\ldots,n\). It states a negation of the existence of such an \( x \) with a bound \( N \) that ensures all fractional parts for all \( n > N \) are at least \( \frac{1}{n+1} \).

We will explore the behavior of fractional parts \(\{kx\}\) for various irrational \( x \), and for increasing \( n \), check if the minimum fractional part among \( k=1,\ldots,n \) is ever at least \(\frac{1}{n+1}\). If so, we print that instance, else we keep searching.

Since the problem requires no hardcoding of the truth and streaming output, the program tries sample irrational \( x \) values (like \(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, \pi - 3\)) and enumerates over \( n \), prints tuples \((x,n,\min_{k}\{kx\}, \frac{1}{n+1})\) when the bound holds, to help conjecture the problem's truth.
