The problem involves positive real numbers \(a, b\) where \(\sqrt{\log a} = m\), \(\sqrt{\log b} = n\) for positive integers \(m, n\), and for some positive integers \(k, l\):
\[
\sqrt{\log a + \log b} = k, \quad \sqrt{(\log a)(\log b)} = l.
\]
We want to explore possible values of \(a b\).

Since \(\log a = m^2\), \(\log b = n^2\), so:
\[
a = e^{m^2}, \quad b = e^{n^2}.
\]
Then:
\[
a b = e^{m^2 + n^2}.
\]
From the conditions:
\[
\sqrt{\log a + \log b} = k \Rightarrow \sqrt{m^2 + n^2} = k,
\]
\[
\sqrt{(\log a)(\log b)} = l \Rightarrow \sqrt{m^2 n^2} = l \Rightarrow mn = l.
\]
Since \(k, l\) are positive integers, and \(m, n\) are positive integers, the conditions are:
- \(\sqrt{m^2 + n^2} = k\) integer,
- \(m n = l\) integer.

We want integers \(m,n,k,l > 0\) with:
\[
k^2 = m^2 + n^2, \quad l = m n.
\]
We then compute:
\[
a b = e^{m^2 + n^2} = e^{k^2}.
\]

The program enumerates integers \(m,n\) up to a limit, checks these conditions, and prints the values.

```python
import math

# Enumerate positive integers m, n <= 20 for feasibility
MAX = 20

print("Enumerating (m,n,k,l) with m,n,k,l positive integers such that:")
print("k^2 = m^2 + n^2 and l = m * n")
print("Then a b = e^{k^2}")

for m in range(1, MAX+1):
    for n in range(1, MAX+1):
        s = m*m + n*n
        k = int(round(math.sqrt(s)))
        if k*k == s:
            l = m*n
            # m,n,k,l satisfy the condition
            ab = math.exp(k*k)
            # Print exact k^2 form and float approximation
            print(f"m={m}, n={n}, k={k}, l={l}, a*b = e^{k*k} â‰ˆ {ab:.4e}")
```
This output helps conjecture the possible values of \(a b\), appearing as powers of \(e\) with exponents being perfect squares, \(k^2\), where \((m,n,k)\) form a Pythagorean triple.
