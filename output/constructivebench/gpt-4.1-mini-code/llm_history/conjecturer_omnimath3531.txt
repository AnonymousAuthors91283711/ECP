noncomputable abbrev omnimath3531_answer : List ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3531 : 
  omnimath3531_answer.Sorted (· ≤ ·) ∧ 
  {3, 5/2, √10} = {x | x ∈ omnimath3531_answer} := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Sorted values and exact representations:
5/2 ≈ 2.500000
3 ≈ 3.000000
√10 ≈ 3.162278

Confirm that these three are the only values in the supposed list:
2.0 in set? False
2.5 in set? True
3.0 in set? True
3.16 in set? False. Expected Answer Type: List ℝ
<<<[5/2, 3, Real.sqrt 10]>>>
