The problem is about values of rational numbers r defined for distinct digits A, B in Fin 7 (0 to 6) less than 1, where r is computed by a formula involving A, B, and an infinite sum as a geometric series. We want to find the greatest r less than 1 and confirm its numerator + denominator sum.

The series ∑ (1/49)^n = 1/(1 - 1/49) = 49/48.

So the r becomes: r = (A/7 + B/49) * (1 + 49/48) = (A/7 + B/49) * (97/48).

We want to find the max r < 1 with A ≠ B, A,B in {0,...,6}.

We can enumerate all (A,B), compute r exactly, filter those < 1, print all candidates, and print the maximum and numerator+denominator sum of that maximum rational.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def main():
    # Parameters: A,B in 0..6, distinct
    # r = (A/7 + B/49) * (97/48)
    candidates = []
    factor = Fraction(97, 48)
    print("Enumerating (A,B), r = (A/7 + B/49)*97/48 < 1 with A != B")
    for A in range(7):
        for B in range(7):
            if A == B:
                continue
            base = Fraction(A,7) + Fraction(B,49)
            r = base * factor
            if r < 1:
                candidates.append((r, A, B))
                print(f"A={A}, B={B}, r={r} (num={r.numerator}, den={r.denominator})")
    # Find maximum r < 1
    max_r, max_A, max_B = max(candidates, key=lambda x: x[0])
    print(f"\nMaximum r < 1 found: r={max_r} with A={max_A}, B={max_B}")
    print(f"Sum numerator+denominator = {max_r.numerator + max_r.denominator}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
