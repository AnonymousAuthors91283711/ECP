Ground Truth Answer: { (x, y, z) | x = y ∧ y = z }
Proposed Answer: { (x, y, z) | x = y ∧ y = z ∧ x > 0 }
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is mostly correct but adds an unnecessary constraint. The ground truth answer already implies x > 0, y > 0, z > 0 through the problem's hypotheses (hx, hy, hz). The condition x > 0 is redundant when we already have x = y = z and the original problem requires x, y, z > 0. The answers are equivalent in practice but the proposed answer includes an explicit constraint that's already implied.
