[write_program]
The problem involves combinations (binomial coefficients) and equalities between several binomial coefficients with different parameters. The equation at the end relates `a`, `b`, and the answer. We want to identify the value of `omnimath2487_answer`.

I will write a program enumerating the binomial coefficients for small values (since 15 and 14 are small), and check the equalities, then compute the expression \( a + b \times (15 - b) \).

```python
from math import comb

# Given values from the problem
a = 78
b = 5

# Precompute binomial coefficients in question
C_3003_1 = comb(3003, 1)  # equals 3003

# We'll verify all given equalities and then compute the expression
print(f"C(3003,1) = {C_3003_1}")

# Enumerate combinations to verify equalities and help conjecture
# Test values near those given (14,6), (14,8), (15,b), (15,15-b), (a,2), (a,a-2)
# Print them both inner and confirm equality with C(3003,1)

pairs = [
    (3003, 1),
    (3003, 3002),
    (a, 2),
    (a, a-2),
    (15, b),
    (15, 15 - b),
    (14, 6),
    (14, 8),
]

for n, k in pairs:
    val = comb(n, k)
    print(f"C({n},{k}) = {val} {'= C(3003,1)' if val == C_3003_1 else ''}")

# Finally compute and print the value a + b*(15 - b)
answer = a + b * (15 - b)
print(f"Answer = a + b * (15 - b) = {answer}")
```
