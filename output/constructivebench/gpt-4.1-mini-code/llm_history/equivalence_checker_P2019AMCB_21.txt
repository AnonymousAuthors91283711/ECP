Ground Truth Answer: 4
Proposed Answer: 2
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

The problem asks for the number of quadratic polynomials p(x) with real coefficients where:
1. The degree is exactly 2
2. The polynomial has two real roots r and s
3. The set of coefficients {a₂, a₁, a₀} equals the set of roots {r, s}

The ground truth answer is 4, while the proposed answer is 2.

Analysis:
1. A general quadratic polynomial can be written as p(x) = a(x-r)(x-s) = ax² - a(r+s)x + ars
2. The condition requires {a, -a(r+s), ars} = {r, s}
3. This leads to several cases where coefficients equal roots in different combinations
4. After solving all valid cases, we indeed find 4 distinct polynomials that satisfy the conditions

The proposed answer of 2 is incorrect as it misses some valid cases. The correct count is 4 as given in the ground truth.
