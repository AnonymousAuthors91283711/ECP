The problem asks to express a complicated nested radical as a linear combination of \(\sqrt{2}\), \(\sqrt{3}\), and \(\sqrt{5}\) with positive integer coefficients \(a, b, c\), then find the product \(a b c\).

We want to find positive integers \(a,b,c\) such that:
\[
\sqrt{104 \sqrt{6} + 468 \sqrt{10} + 144 \sqrt{15} + 2006} = a \sqrt{2} + b \sqrt{3} + c \sqrt{5}.
\]

Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
104 \sqrt{6} + 468 \sqrt{10} + 144 \sqrt{15} + 2006 = (a \sqrt{2} + b \sqrt{3} + c \sqrt{5})^2.
\]

Expanding the right side and matching coefficients on \(\sqrt{6}=\sqrt{2}\sqrt{3}\), \(\sqrt{10}=\sqrt{2}\sqrt{5}\), and \(\sqrt{15}=\sqrt{3}\sqrt{5}\) gives equations in \(a,b,c\).

We'll enumerate small positive integers \(a,b,c\) (say up to 20) and check which satisfy the system exactly. For those that match, print \(a,b,c\) and their product \(a*b*c\).

```python
# Enumerate positive integers a,b,c up to 20 to solve
# (a√2 + b√3 + c√5)^2 = 2006 + 104√6 + 468√10 + 144√15

# After expansion:
# (a√2)^2 = 2a^2
# (b√3)^2 = 3b^2
# (c√5)^2 = 5c^2
# Cross terms:
# 2ab√6, 2ac√10, 2bc√15

# Equate rational parts and coefficients of √6, √10, √15:
# Rational: 2a^2 + 3b^2 + 5c^2 = 2006
# √6: 2ab = 104  => ab = 52
# √10: 2ac = 468 => ac = 234
# √15: 2bc = 144 => bc = 72

max_val = 30
for a in range(1, max_val+1):
    # From ab=52 => b=52/a if integer
    if 52 % a != 0:
        continue
    b = 52 // a
    # From ac=234 => c=234/a if integer
    if 234 % a != 0:
        continue
    c = 234 // a
    # Check bc=72
    if b * c != 72:
        continue
    # Check rational part
    if 2*a*a + 3*b*b + 5*c*c == 2006:
        print(f"a={a} b={b} c={c} product={a*b*c}")
```
This exact matching will output all solutions found and their products, assisting in conjecturing the answer.
