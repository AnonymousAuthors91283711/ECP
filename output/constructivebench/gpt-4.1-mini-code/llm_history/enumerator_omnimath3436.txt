The problem relates to four positive rational numbers \(l_1, l_2, l_3, l_4\) all distinct, with sum \(L\), and chained equalities \(l_1 = 2 l_2\), \(l_2 = 2 l_3\), \(l_3 = 2 l_4\). We want to find and verify the exact value of \(l_1 / L\).

Let's enumerate \(l_4\) as a positive rational \(a/b\) with small integers and compute all \(l_i\) and \(L\), then print \(l_1 / L\), expecting a constant value independent of \(l_4\).

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Enumerate small positive rationals for l4
print("Enumerating l1/L for sample l4 values:")
for numerator in range(1, 6):
    for denominator in range(1, 6):
        if numerator != denominator:
            l4 = Fraction(numerator, denominator)
            l3 = 2 * l4
            l2 = 2 * l3
            l1 = 2 * l2
            distinct = len({l1, l2, l3, l4}) == 4
            if not distinct:
                continue
            L = l1 + l2 + l3 + l4
            ratio = l1 / L
            # Print exact fraction and its float approximation
            print(f"l4 = {l4}, l1={l1}, l2={l2}, l3={l3}, L={L}, l1/L = {ratio} (~{float(ratio):.4f})")
```
This program enumerates possible \(l_4\), computes all \(l_i\), ensures they are distinct, and prints \(l_1 / L\) exactly and approximately, allowing us to conjecture and prove the fixed ratio value.
