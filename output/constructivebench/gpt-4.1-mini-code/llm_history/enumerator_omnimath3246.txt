The problem counts permutations of length 3k+1 from {1,...,3k+1} without repetition, where no prefix sum is divisible by 3. We'll enumerate these for small k and print the ratio of valid permutations over all permutations (which is 1/(3k+1)!).

```python
import math
from itertools import permutations

def is_valid(perm):
    s = 0
    for x in perm:
        s += x
        if s % 3 == 0:
            return False
    return True

def factorial(n):
    return math.factorial(n)

def main():
    for k in range(1, 4):  # small k=1..3 for feasibility
        n = 3*k + 1
        print(f"k={k}, n={n}")
        total = factorial(n)
        count = 0
        # Iterate over all permutations of 1..n
        # Stop if taking too long for k=3
        if n > 7:
            print(f"Skipping full enumeration for n={n} due to complexity")
            continue
        for perm in permutations(range(1, n+1)):
            if is_valid(perm):
                count += 1
                # Print the valid permutation as exact list
                print(f"valid perm: {perm}")
        ratio = count / total
        print(f"count={count}, total={total}, ratio={ratio:.6f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
