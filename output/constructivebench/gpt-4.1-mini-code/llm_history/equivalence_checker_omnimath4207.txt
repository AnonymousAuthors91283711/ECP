Ground Truth Answer: fun n => {s | ∃ k : ℕ, k < n ∧ s = 2^k}
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => ((Finset.range n).image (λ k => Nat.fib (k + 2))).toSet
Let me analyze the problem and the two answers:

1. The problem asks for a set of natural numbers with:
   - Exactly n elements (n=100)
   - All elements between 1 and 25000
   - Unique sums property (any two pairs with equal sums must be identical pairs)

2. Ground Truth Answer:
   - Uses powers of 2: {1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^99}
   - Has exactly 100 elements
   - All elements ≤ 2^99 (but 2^99 is much larger than 25000)
   - Has unique sums property (binary representation guarantees this)

3. Proposed Answer:
   - Uses Fibonacci numbers: {Fib(2), Fib(3), ..., Fib(101)}
   - Has exactly 100 elements
   - Fib(100) = 354224848179261915075 > 25000
   - Has unique sums property (Zeckendorf's theorem guarantees this)

The main issue is that both answers violate the M=25000 constraint, as their largest elements exceed this bound. However, they both satisfy all other properties correctly.
