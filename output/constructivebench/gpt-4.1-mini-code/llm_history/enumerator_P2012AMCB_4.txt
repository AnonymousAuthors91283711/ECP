The problem involves currency conversion and a percentage calculation. We know:

- Diana has 500 dollars.
- Etienne has 400 euros.
- The exchange rate is 1 euro = 1.3 dollars.
- Convert Etienne's euros to dollars.
- Find \( 100 \times \frac{\text{Etienne's dollars} - \text{Diana's dollars}}{\text{Diana's dollars}} \).

We want to enumerate the results of this expression for several nearby exchange rates, to verify the formula and identify the percentage difference.

```python
# Enumerate percentage differences for several euro-to-dollar exchange rates
def main():
    diana_dollars = 500
    etienne_euros = 400
    exchange_rates = [1.2, 1.25, 1.3, 1.35, 1.4]  # sample exchange rates around 1.3

    for rate in exchange_rates:
        etienne_dollars = etienne_euros * rate
        percentage_diff = 100 * (etienne_dollars - diana_dollars) / diana_dollars
        # Print exact fraction if simple, else float
        print(f"Exchange rate: {rate}")
        print(f"Etienne dollars: {etienne_euros} * {rate} = {etienne_dollars}")
        print(f"Percentage difference: 100 * ({etienne_dollars} - {diana_dollars}) / {diana_dollars} = {percentage_diff}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
