abbrev P2007AMCB_10_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem P2007AMCB_10 : 
  ∃ (total : ℕ), 
    0 < total ∧ 
    2 * total % 5 = 0 ∧  -- Initial girls are 40% of total
    (2 * total / 5 - 2) * 10 = 3 * (total - 2 + 2) ∧  -- After changes, girls are 30% of new total
    2 * total / 5 = P2007AMCB_10_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating total values and corresponding girls satisfying conditions:
total: 20, girls: 8
Minimum total: 5
Minimum girls (2*total/5): 2. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<20>>>
