The problem counts the number of 7-tuples \( t: \{0, \ldots, 6\} \to \mathbb{N} \) with positive values satisfying these linear equations:

\[
\begin{cases}
t_0 + t_1 = t_2 + t_3 \\
t_0 + t_2 = t_4 + t_5 \\
t_0 + t_4 = t_6 + t_1 \\
t_0 + t_6 = t_3 + t_5
\end{cases}
\]

Our goal is to enumerate positive integer solutions and count them.

By rearranging, express some variables in terms of others, and iterate over small values to find solutions, printing each one when found.

```python
# Enumerate positive integer solutions to the system of equations:
# t0 + t1 = t2 + t3
# t0 + t2 = t4 + t5
# t0 + t4 = t6 + t1
# t0 + t6 = t3 + t5

# All variables t0..t6 are positive integers.

max_val = 20  # search upper bound to enumerate (adjustable)

for t0 in range(1, max_val+1):
    # We'll choose t1, t2, t3 as free variables within reasonable range.
    for t1 in range(1, max_val+1):
        for t2 in range(1, max_val+1):
            # From first eq: t3 = t0 + t1 - t2
            t3 = t0 + t1 - t2
            if t3 <= 0 or t3 > max_val:
                continue
            
            # From second eq: t4 + t5 = t0 + t2
            # From first eq: t2 + t3 = t0 + t1, so t2 + t3 = t0 + t1
            # Use fourth eq: t0 + t6 = t3 + t5 => t6 = t3 + t5 - t0
            
            # Letâ€™s consider all possible t5 in 1..max_val
            for t5 in range(1, max_val+1):
                t4 = t0 + t2 - t5
                if t4 <= 0 or t4 > max_val:
                    continue
                
                t6 = t3 + t5 - t0
                if t6 <= 0 or t6 > max_val:
                    continue
                
                # Check third eq: t0 + t4 = t6 + t1
                if t0 + t4 == t6 + t1:
                    # Valid solution found
                    print((t0,t1,t2,t3,t4,t5,t6))
```
This enumerates all positive integer solutions with variables up to 20 printing each solution immediately. Adjust `max_val` as needed.
