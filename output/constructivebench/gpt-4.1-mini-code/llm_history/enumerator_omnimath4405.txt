The problem involves finding integer solutions \((m,n)\) to the quadratic equation \(5m^2 - 6mn + 7n^2 = 1985\). This is a Diophantine equation with two variables. To help conjecture about the existence of such integer pairs, I'll enumerate integer values \(m, n\) in a reasonable range and check which satisfy the equation exactly.

Given the quadratic form, values of \(m,n\) larger than approximately \(\sqrt{\frac{1985}{\min(|5|,|7|)}}\approx 20\) are unlikely to match due to rapid growth. We'll enumerate \(m,n \in [-30,30]\) for completeness.

The program will print all \((m,n)\) that exactly satisfy the equation. The presence or absence of such solutions helps formulate the boolean answer.

```python
# Enumerate integer pairs (m,n) with |m|,|n| ≤ 30
# and check if 5*m^2 - 6*m*n + 7*n^2 == 1985.
# Print all such pairs immediately.

def main():
    target = 1985
    limit = 30
    found_any = False
    for m in range(-limit, limit+1):
        for n in range(-limit, limit+1):
            val = 5*m*m - 6*m*n + 7*n*n
            if val == target:
                print(f"Solution: m={m}, n={n}")
                found_any = True
    if not found_any:
        print("No solutions found for |m|,|n| ≤ 30")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
