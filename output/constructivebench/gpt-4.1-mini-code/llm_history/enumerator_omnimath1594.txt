[write_program]
The problem is to find all natural numbers n less than 100 such that n divides \(2^n + 2\). The program enumerates n from 1 to 99, checks the divisibility condition, and prints each such n immediately.

```python
# Enumerate n < 100 such that n divides 2^n + 2
def main():
    print("n values with n | 2^n + 2 (n < 100):")
    for n in range(1, 100):
        if (pow(2, n, n) + 2) % n == 0:
            print(n)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
