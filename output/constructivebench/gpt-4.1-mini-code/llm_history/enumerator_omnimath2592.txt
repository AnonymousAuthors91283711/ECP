The problem involves a sequence of natural numbers \( \{ seq_i \} \) defined by:
- \( seq_1 = \sum_{i=0}^{100} i! \) (sum of factorials from 0 to 100),
- for each \( i \geq 1 \), there exists \( k \) such that \( seq_i + seq_{i+1} = (2k+1)^2 \) (sum of two consecutive terms is an odd square number),
- we want the minimal possible value of \( seq_{1000} \).

We will enumerate possible values for \( seq_1, seq_2, \ldots, seq_{1000} \) by generating pairs of numbers summing to an odd square, starting with the initial sum, then trying feasible pairs for the next, etc. Since the domain is huge, we will restrict search by checking consecutive pairs sums as odd squares larger than a threshold and only for small plausible \( seq_i \).

We print each candidate \( seq_{1000} \) found. The goal is to get insight or conjecture the minimal such \( seq_{1000} \).

```python
from math import factorial, sqrt, ceil

# Precompute sum of factorials 0! to 100!
def sum_factorials(n=100):
    s = 0
    f = 1
    for i in range(n+1):
        if i > 0:
            f *= i
        s += f
    return s

S = sum_factorials()
print(f"seq_1 (sum factorials 0..100): {S}")

# We want to find seq_2 such that S + seq_2 = (odd square)
# So for candidate k: (2k+1)^2 >= S + 0, we try k in a range, compute seq_2
# Then repeat similarly for seq_3 from seq_2 ...

# To keep computation manageable, we enumerate only a small number of steps, say up to seq_10,
# and list possible seq_10 values, to extrapolate behavior.

MAX_STEPS = 10
candidates = {1: [S]}  # step index -> list of possible seq_i values

def odd_squares_ge(x, limit=1000000):
    """Generate odd squares >= x and <= limit"""
    start = int(ceil(sqrt(x)))
    if start % 2 == 0:
        start +=1
    k = (start-1)//2
    while True:
        val = (2*k+1)**2
        if val > limit:
            break
        if val >= x:
            yield val
        k += 1

for i in range(1, MAX_STEPS):
    candidates[i+1] = []
    for v in candidates[i]:
        # seq_i + seq_{i+1} = odd square
        # seq_{i+1} = odd_square - seq_i, >=0 since seq_{i+1} ∈ ℕ
        min_sum = v  # minimal sum to consider for odd square >= v + 0
        # For performance only consider odd squares up to some limit
        for odd_sq in odd_squares_ge(v, v + 10000):
            next_val = odd_sq - v
            if next_val >= 0:
                # Add candidate for seq_{i+1}
                candidates[i+1].append(next_val)
                print(f"seq_{i}={v}, seq_{i+1}={next_val}, sum={odd_sq}")

# After computing up to seq_10, print unique seq_10 values
seq_10_vals = set(candidates[10])
print("Unique seq_10 values found:", sorted(seq_10_vals))
