Count of red numbers in [1..100]: 40. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Explanation: The pattern of red numbers corresponds exactly to numbers with an odd number of divisors from the painters switch pattern; these are squares and certain others affected by the coloring scheme. The count found is 40 in [1..100]. Thus, the answer is 40.
