abbrev omnimath4000_answer : Set (ℝ → ℝ) := sorry
theorem omnimath4000 (f : ℝ → ℝ) : 
  (∀ x y, (x + y^2) * f (y * f x) = x * y * f (y^2 + f x)) ↔ f ∈ omnimath4000_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {f | (∀ x, f x = x) ∨ 
       (∀ x, f x = 0) ∨ 
       ∃ a ∈ Set.Ioi 0 ∪ Set.Iic (-1), ∀ x, f x = if x = -a^2 then a else 0}
Proposed Answer: {f | ∀ x, f x = 0} ∪ {f | ∀ x, f x = x}

The proposed answer captures two of the three cases in the ground truth answer (the zero function and the identity function), but misses the third case involving piecewise functions with a specific parameter `a`. Therefore, the proposed answer is incomplete but mostly correct for the simpler cases.
