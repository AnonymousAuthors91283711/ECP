. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The error occurs because Lean's real number operations involving division and multiplication are not computable by default and thus require marking the definition as `noncomputable`. To fix the error and have a clean closed form value, declare the answer as `noncomputable` or simply use the explicit numerical value since the expression evaluates to a constant real number.

From the enumerated answers, with euroToDollar = 1.3, etienneDollars = 400 * 1.3 = 520, the percentage difference is:

100 * (520 - 500) / 500 = 100 * 20 / 500 = 4.0

So the final answer is 4.0 as a real number.

Therefore, the best way is

`noncomputable def P2012AMCB_4_answer : ℝ := 4.0`

or equivalently just `4.0` marked noncomputable.

Since you want the answer content only (i.e. the expression), and to fix the error, mark it as `noncomputable` implicitly by making it a definition (not abbrev), but since only answer expression is required, provide the constant number as real literal 4.0.

Hence the answer is:

<<<4.0>>>
