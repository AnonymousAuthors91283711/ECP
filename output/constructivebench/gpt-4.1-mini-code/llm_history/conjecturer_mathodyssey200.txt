f(n) = n                  -> tends to infinity? True
f(n) = n^2                -> tends to infinity? True
f(n) = -n                 -> tends to infinity? True
f(n) = 1                  -> tends to infinity? True
f(n) = n mod 10           -> tends to infinity? True
f(n) = n if n<500 else 0  -> tends to infinity? True
f(n) = n + (-1)^n * 10    -> tends to infinity? True
f(n) = 10^n               -> tends to infinity? True. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ → ℝ)
