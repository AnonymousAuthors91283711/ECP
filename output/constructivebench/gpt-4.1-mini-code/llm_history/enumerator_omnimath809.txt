[write_program]
The problem defines a function \( f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R} \) satisfying the functional equation 
\[
f(a) + f(b) = n^2
\]
whenever \( a, b, n \in \mathbb{N} \), \( a,b,n > 0 \), and 
\[
a + b = 2^n.
\]
We want to find \( f(2002) \).

To explore \( f \), we can try small values of \( n \), enumerate pairs \( (a,b) \) with \( a+b=2^n \), and gather relations for \( f(a)+f(b) = n^2 \).

Key observations:
- For fixed \( n \), any \( a,b \) with \( a+b=2^n \) satisfy \( f(a)+f(b) = n^2 \).
- This linkage means \( f \) values at arguments summing to \( 2^n \) are linearly related.
- We want to identify a pattern or formula for \( f(k) \).

We enumerate values for \( n \) from 1 up to 10 (since \( 2^{10} = 1024 \)), compute \( f(a)+f(b)= n^2 \) for all \( (a,b) \) with \( a+b=2^n \), and store the pairs. Then we observe patterns and try to deduce \( f(2002) \).

```python
# Enumerate f(a) + f(b) = n^2 for a+b=2^n, a,b,n>0 up to n=11 (2^11=2048 > 2002)
# We look for possible values of f(2002) by combining equations with a=2002 or b=2002.
# Since f is unknown, we represent f(k) symbolically through relations.

def enumerate_relations():
    max_n = 11  # 2^11=2048 covers 2002
    relations = {}  # key: sum=2^n, value: n^2
    # We track sums and the value n^2
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        s = 2 ** n
        val = n * n
        relations[s] = val
    return relations

def possible_f_values():
    # The key is f(a) + f(b) = n^2 whenever a+b=2^n.
    # For fixed sum s=2^n, pairs (a,b) satisfy f(a)+f(b)=val.
    # So for fixed s, f(a) = val - f(s - a).
    #
    # Idea: Pick a baseline f(1) = x, try to express f(k) in terms of x for small k.
    # Use sums 2,4,8,... to derive relations.
    #
    # We'll enumerate a few values and solve symbolically.
    #
    # We do not solve symbolically here, but print relations checked for a=2002.

    relations = enumerate_relations()
    print("Relations for sums s=2^n and f(a)+f(b)=n^2:")
    for s,val in sorted(relations.items()):
        print(f"Sum {s}: f(a)+f({s}-a) = {val}")

    # Find n where 2002 < s=2^n
    # For each such n, a,b >0, a+b=2^n
    # If a=2002, b = 2^n - 2002
    # Then f(2002) + f(b) = n^2
    # So f(2002) = n^2 - f(b)
    #
    # If we know f(b) for some b, we can approach f(2002).
    # We'll try some small n such that 2^n > 2002: n>=11 (2^11=2048)
    print("\nTesting sums with 2^n > 2002:")
    for n in range(11, 14):  # a few nearby
        s = 2 ** n
        if 2002 >= s:
            continue
        b = s - 2002
        print(f"For sum={s}, pair (2002, {b}): f(2002) + f({b}) = {n*n}")

    # We try guessing f(k) = some function of k.
    # Suppose f(k) = c * log2(k) (not valid since sum is fixed).
    # Or f(k) = A * k + B / k, none fits simply.
    #
    # Just printing sums with small pairs to assist guess:
    print("\nSmall sums and pairs (a,b):")
    for n in range(1, 7):
        s = 2 ** n
        val = n * n
        print(f"\nSum = {s}, f(a)+f(b) = {val}")
        for a in range(1, s//2 + 1):
            b = s - a
            print(f"  f({a}) + f({b}) = {val}")

This code enumerates all sums \( 2^n \), lists pairs \( (a,b) \) with \( a+b=2^n \), and prints out the relation \( f(a) + f(b) = n^2 \). It also identifies pairs involving 2002 for sums above 2002, highlighting potential equations directly involving \( f(2002) \).

Run this program to gather numeric relations that can help conjecture \( f(2002) \) by comparing \( f(k) \) values and identifying consistent patterns.
