theorem omnimath4242 (a : ℕ) :

    let digitsA := digits 10 a
    b = ofDigits 10 ([digitsA.getLastD 0] ++ digitsA.dropLast) ∧

Ground Truth Answer: {2, 3} ∪ {a | ∃ n, a = ofDigits 10 (replicate (n + 1) 2 ++ [1])}
Proposed Answer: {a | ∃ d < 10, a = 10 * (10 * d + 2) + 1}
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes numbers where if you:
   - Take a number a
   - Move its last digit to the front to get b
   - Square b to get c
   - Move the first digit of c to the end to get d
   - Then d should equal a²

2. The ground truth answer includes:
   - The numbers 2 and 3
   - Numbers consisting of (n+1) '2's followed by a '1' (like 221, 2221, etc.)

3. The proposed answer describes numbers of the form:
   - 10*(10*d + 2) + 1 where d < 10
   - This simplifies to numbers like 221 (when d=2), 421 (d=4), etc.

Comparison:
- The proposed answer captures some numbers from the infinite family in the ground truth (like 221), but misses:
  - The base cases 2 and 3
  - The general case with more than three digits (like 2221, 22221, etc.)
  - It also includes some numbers not in the ground truth (like 421)
