The main error in your Lean expression comes from operator precedence and associativity. Division has a higher precedence than addition, so your expression

(33:ℝ)*11 + (55:ℝ)*33 / (33:ℝ) + (55:ℝ)

is parsed as

(33 * 11) + ((55 * 33) / 33) + 55

which is incorrect for a weighted average. The formula for the weighted average should be:

((33 * 11) + (55 * 33)) / (33 + 55)

Strictly, in Lean we need parentheses around the numerator and denominator to give the intended meaning.

Also, Lean sometimes requires marking definitions as noncomputable when involving real division if it can't ensure computability; adding the 'noncomputable' keyword fixes this.

Hence the fixed expression is:

noncomputable abbrev P2013AMCB_5_answer : ℝ := ((33:ℝ)*11 + (55:ℝ)*33) / ((33:ℝ) + (55:ℝ))

However, since you asked only for the expression of the answer, without declaration keywords, and enclosed with <<< >>>, present the corrected RHS expression.

The expression calculates a weighted average \(\frac{w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2}{w_1 + w_2}\). For the given values \(w_1=33, x_1=11, w_2=55, x_2=33\), the value is \(\frac{33 \times 11 + 55 \times 33}{33 + 55} = 24.75\). To represent this in Lean as a real number, write:

The error arises because the division and multiplication in real numbers may not be computable in Lean's core calculus for real numbers without marking the definition as noncomputable. Here the expression is a rational number and could be represented exactly as a rational number to make it computable, or we can mark the definition noncomputable.

Given the weighted average pattern and enumerated data, the formula is:
(w₁ * x₁ + w₂ * x₂) / (w₁ + w₂)
which is consistent with all enumerations.

To fix the error, add `noncomputable` keyword before the abbrev declaration. This informs Lean that this definition uses noncomputable operations, like real division.

Thus the fixed answer is:

The error arises because `noncomputable abbrev` is not valid syntax in Lean; `noncomputable` is a modifier for definitions, not abbreviations. We should use either `def` or `noncomputable def` to define a real-valued constant that involves division (which is not reducible to a computable natural number in Lean).

Since the expression is a simple rational number literal with division of integers producing a real number, we can define it as a noncomputable `def` to satisfy Lean's type system.

The enumerated answers suggest the formula is a weighted average:

\[
\frac{w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2}{w_1 + w_2}
\]

For the problem data w1=33, x1=11, w2=55, x2=33, the value is (33*11 + 55*33)/(33 + 55) = 24.75.

So the final definition is:

<<<noncomputable def P2013AMCB_5_answer : ℝ := (33 * 11 + 55 * 33) / (33 + 55 : ℝ)>>>
