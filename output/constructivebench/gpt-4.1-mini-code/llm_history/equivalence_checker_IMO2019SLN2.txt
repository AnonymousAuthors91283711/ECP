Ground Truth Answer: {(1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2), (2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 1), (3, 1, 2), (3, 2, 1)}
Proposed Answer: {(1, 2, 3)}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is partially correct as it includes one valid solution (1, 2, 3), but it's incomplete since it doesn't include all permutations of this triple. The ground truth answer correctly includes all 6 permutations of (1, 2, 3), which are all valid solutions to the equation. Therefore, the proposed answer is mostly correct but misses some valid cases.
