Ground Truth Answer: [5/2, 3, √10]
Proposed Answer: [5/2, 3, Real.sqrt 10]
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer [5/2, 3, Real.sqrt 10] is equivalent to the ground truth answer [5/2, 3, √10] because:
1. Both lists contain the same elements in the same order
2. Real.sqrt 10 is just another notation for √10 in Lean/Mathematical notation
3. Both satisfy the requirements of being sorted and containing exactly the elements {3, 5/2, √10}
