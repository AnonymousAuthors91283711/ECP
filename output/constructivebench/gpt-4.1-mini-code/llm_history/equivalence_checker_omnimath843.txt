Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: 1
Since the problem is about finding the cardinality of a specific set defined by a system of equations, and both the ground truth answer and the proposed answer are marked as `sorry` (which typically means the answer is not provided or is incomplete in Lean), we cannot definitively determine the equivalence of the answers. 

However, the proposed answer is `1`, which suggests that the set has exactly one solution. Without the ground truth answer or further information about the system of equations, we cannot verify this claim. 

Given the lack of information, the most appropriate response is:

<<<None>>>
