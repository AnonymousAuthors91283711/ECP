The problem involves finding a sequence of positive integers \( n(k) \) for \( k = 1, \ldots, 2022 \) such that the product
\[
\prod_{i=1}^{2022} \left( n(i)^{2020} + n\big((i+1) \mod 2022 + 1\big)^{2019} \right)
\]
is a perfect power of 11, i.e., equals \( 11^m \) for some \( m \in \mathbb{N} \).

Since the full size (2022) is large and complicated, I will experiment with smaller values of \( N \) similar to 2022, trying sequences with some patterns to gain insights. The program tries \( N = 2,3,4,5 \) and generates sequences of positive integers bounded by a small max to evaluate the product defined analogously, then checks if the product is a pure power of 11, printing exact solutions directly.

```python
from itertools import product
from math import gcd

def is_power_of_11(x):
    if x < 1:
        return False
    while x % 11 == 0:
        x //= 11
    return x == 1

def mod_index(i, n):
    # Compute (i+1) mod n with 1-based indexing
    return ((i) % n) + 1

def try_small_N():
    # Try small N analogous to 2022, small sequences n(k) in range 1..3
    for N in [2, 3, 4, 5]:
        print(f"N = {N}")
        max_val = 3
        # Generate all sequences n: {1..N} -> {1..max_val}
        for seq in product(range(1, max_val+1), repeat=N):
            # Compute product
            prod = 1
            for i in range(1, N+1):
                a = seq[i-1] ** 2020
                j = mod_index(i+1, N) - 1
                b = seq[j] ** 2019
                sum_val = a + b
                prod *= sum_val
                if prod == 0:
                    break
            if prod > 0 and is_power_of_11(prod):
                print("Sequence:", seq, "product = 11^m for some m")

try_small_N()
