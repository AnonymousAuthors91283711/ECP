The problem involves roots \(r_i\) of the polynomial \(f(x) = x^4 - 4x^3 + 8x^2 - 7x + 3\) and asks to evaluate the sum \(\sum_i \frac{r_i^2}{\sum_{j \neq i} r_j^2}\).

We will:
- Find roots of \(f\) numerically.
- For each root \(r_i\), compute numerator \(r_i^2\) and denominator \(\sum_{j\neq i} r_j^2\).
- Compute the target sum.
- Enumerate intermediate values to conjecture the answer.

# enumerator.py

import numpy as np

def poly_roots(coeffs):
    # Find roots of polynomial with given coefficients (highest power first)
    return np.roots(coeffs)

def main():
    # Polynomial: x^4 -4x^3 + 8x^2 -7x +3
    coeffs = [1, -4, 8, -7, 3]
    roots = poly_roots(coeffs)
    roots_squared = [r**2 for r in roots]

    # Print roots and their squared values
    print("Polynomial roots and their squares:")
    for i, r in enumerate(roots):
        print(f"r[{i}] = {r}, r[{i}]^2 = {roots_squared[i]}")

    # Compute the sum of squares of roots for denominators
    total_sq_sum = sum(roots_squared)

    # Compute sum_i r_i^2 / sum_{j!=i} r_j^2
    total_sum = 0
    print("\nEnumerating terms r_i^2 / sum_{jâ‰ i} r_j^2:")
    for i, r_sq in enumerate(roots_squared):
        denom = total_sq_sum - r_sq
        term = r_sq / denom
        total_sum += term
        print(f"Term {i}: numerator = {r_sq}, denominator = {denom}, term = {term}")
