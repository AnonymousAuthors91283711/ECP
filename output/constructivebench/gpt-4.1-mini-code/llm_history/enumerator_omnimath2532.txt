The problem asks to evaluate the sum over n in [0..2020] of the square of the count of prime factors of n less than 6. These primes are 2, 3, and 5.

We can compute the prime factors of each n â‰¤ 2020, count how many of these are under 6 (which are primes 2, 3, or 5), square that count, then sum over n.

To optimize, note that prime factors < 6 are only 2, 3, and 5, so counting multiplicities, the prime factors less than 6 for each n can be found by counting how many of 2, 3, and 5 divide n (not exponents, but distinct prime factors) or should we consider multiplicity? The problem states "primeFactors n" which usually includes multiplicities, so we consider multiplicities.

Therefore, for each n, factor it and extract prime factors including multiplicities, count how many are < 6, i.e., 2,3,5 counted as many times as they appear, then square and sum.

To speed up, for each n, count powers of 2,3,5 dividing n.

We implement a fast function for this, and sum.

We'll output partial results immediately, then output the final sum.

```python
# Calculate sum_{n=0}^{2020} (count of prime factors < 6 with multiplicity)^2

def count_small_prime_factors(n):
    count = 0
    for p in (2,3,5):
        while n % p == 0 and n > 1:
            count += 1
            n //= p
    return count

def main():
    total = 0
    for n in range(2021):
        c = count_small_prime_factors(n)
        sq = c*c
        print(f"n={n}, count={c}, count^2={sq}")
        total += sq
    print("Total sum =", total)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
