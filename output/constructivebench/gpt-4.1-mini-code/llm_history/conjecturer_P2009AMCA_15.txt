theorem P2009AMCA_15 : 
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | ∑ k in Finset.range n, (k + 1) * I ^ (k + 1) = 48 + 49 * I} P2009AMCA_15_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Searching for n such that sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (k+1)*i^{k+1} = 48+49i
Match found at n=97: sum = (48+49j)
Least such n is 97. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<97>>>
