The problem wants to find how many distinct values of \(n^{100} \mod 125\) there are, where \(n\) ranges over all integers \(\mathbb{Z}\). Since residues modulo 125 depend only on \(n \mod 125\), we only need to consider \(n \in \{0, 1, \ldots, 124\}\).

We want to enumerate all distinct values of \(n^{100} \mod 125\) as \(n\) varies, print them, and count how many distinct values occur.

```python
# Enumerate distinct values of n^100 mod 125 for n=0..124
MOD = 125
exponent = 100

seen = set()
for n in range(MOD):
    val = pow(n, exponent, MOD)
    if val not in seen:
        print(f"{n}^{exponent} mod {MOD} = {val}")
        seen.add(val)

print("Total distinct values:", len(seen))
```
This program prints each new residue immediately when found, and outputs the total count which is the answer.
