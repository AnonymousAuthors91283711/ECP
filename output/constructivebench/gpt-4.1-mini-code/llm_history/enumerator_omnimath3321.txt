[write_program]
The problem involves finding the smallest natural number \( n > 0 \) such that the sum 
\[
\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \frac{1}{4+k} \geq 1.
\]
This follows from the ant_position recursion, which essentially accumulates terms \( \frac{1}{4+k} \).

The Python program enumerates \( n \) and computes the partial sums of \( \frac{1}{4+k} \), printing each \( n \) when the sum crosses or reaches 1, thus conjecturing the minimum \( n \).

```python
# Enumerate n to find the smallest n > 0 with sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 1/(4+k) >= 1

def main():
    threshold = 1
    total = 0.0
    n = 0
    while total < threshold:
        total += 1 / (4 + n)
        n += 1
        print(f"n={n}, sum=1/(4)+...+1/({4+n-1}) = {total}")
    print(f"Smallest n with sum >= 1 is {n}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
