[write_program]
The problem involves examining colorings of the divisors of a number \(N\) with 4 colors (represented by \(\mathrm{Fin} 4\)), under certain gcd-related constraints. We want to enumerate possible values \(c\) that satisfy the condition and find their maximum.

To assist in conjecturing and proving, I will write a Python program that:
- Selects sample composite numbers \(N\) (excluding prime powers).
- Enumerates the divisors of \(N\).
- Tries to assign colors to each divisor from the set \(\{0,1,2,3\}\).
- Checks the constraint for each pair of distinct divisors.
- Prints all found values of \(c\) (the size of such valid coloring subsets).
- Prints the maximum \(c\).

The program explores all functions \(f\) from divisors to 4 colors, validating the condition, and collects \(c = \text{number of divisors}\) satisfying it.

To keep output short and efficient, I pick small composite \(N\) values with multiple divisors.

```python
# Enumerate possible values of c for problem constraints on divisor colorings.

from math import gcd
from itertools import product

def divisors(n):
    return [d for d in range(1,n+1) if n % d == 0]

def is_prime_power(n):
    # check if n = p^k for some prime p and k â‰¥1
    for p in range(2, n+1):
        if n % p == 0:
            k = 0
            x = n
            while x % p == 0:
                x //= p
                k += 1
            if x == 1:
                return True
    return False

def check_coloring(N, f, divs_idx, divs):
    # Check the condition:
    # For any a!=b distinct divisors, with gcd_ab their gcd divisor:
    # If a,b,gcd_ab distinct, then colors f(a), f(b), f(gcd_ab) are all different
    for i in range(len(divs)):
        for j in range(i+1,len(divs)):
            a = divs[i]
            b = divs[j]
            if a == b:
                continue
            g = gcd(a,b)
            if g == a or g == b:
                continue
            # all distinct: a != b != gcd_ab
            ca = f[divs_idx[a]]
            cb = f[divs_idx[b]]
            cg = f[divs_idx[g]]
            if ca == cb or ca == cg or cb == cg:
                return False
    return True

# For a sample of composite non-prime-power numbers:
sample_N = [6,10,12,18]

    if is_prime_power(N):
        print(f"# Skipping prime power N={N}")
        continue

    divs_idx = {d:i for i,d in enumerate(divs)}
    n = len(divs)
    print(f"Trying N={N} with divisors {divs} (count={n})")
    valid_c = []
    # Instead of enumerating all 4^n colorings (too large), we try partial colorings:
    # Enumerate all functions f:{divs}->4 colors if n<=5 for feasibility:
    if n > 5:
        print(f"Skipping N={N} (too many divisors for exhaustive search)")
        continue
    count = 0
    max_valid = 0
    for f in product(range(4), repeat=n):
        if check_coloring(N,f,divs_idx,divs):
