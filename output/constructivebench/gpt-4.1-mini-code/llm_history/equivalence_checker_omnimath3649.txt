Ground Truth Answer: Set.Icc 0 4
Proposed Answer: {F | 0 ≤ F ∧ F ≤ 4}
<<<True>>>

Explanation: The ground truth answer `Set.Icc 0 4` is the standard notation in Lean/Mathlib for the closed interval from 0 to 4, which is exactly equivalent to the set comprehension `{F | 0 ≤ F ∧ F ≤ 4}`. Both expressions represent the same mathematical concept of all real numbers F satisfying 0 ≤ F ≤ 4.
