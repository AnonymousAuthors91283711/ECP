Ground Truth Answer: (1989, 1989, 1990, 2 * 1989)
Proposed Answer: (1989, 1989, 1990, 3978)
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer because:
1. 2 * 1989 = 3978
2. All other components (1989, 1989, 1990) match exactly
3. The problem specifies n = 1988, so n+1 = 1989 and n+2 = 1990
4. The last component is just two different representations of the same value (2*1989 and 3978)
