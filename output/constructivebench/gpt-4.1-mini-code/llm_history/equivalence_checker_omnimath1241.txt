Ground Truth Answer: 20
Proposed Answer: 6
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. We're given two trigonometric equations:
   - tan x + tan y = 4
   - cot x + cot y = 5

2. We need to find tan(x + y), which has the formula:
   tan(x + y) = (tan x + tan y)/(1 - tan x tan y) = 4/(1 - tan x tan y)

3. From the cotangent equation:
   cot x + cot y = 1/tan x + 1/tan y = (tan x + tan y)/(tan x tan y) = 4/(tan x tan y) = 5
   Therefore, tan x tan y = 4/5

4. Substituting into the tan(x + y) formula:
   tan(x + y) = 4/(1 - 4/5) = 4/(1/5) = 20

The ground truth answer is 20, which matches our derivation. The proposed answer is 6, which doesn't match.
