noncomputable abbrev P2025HMMTfeb_team_9_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem P2025HMMTfeb_team_9 (p : ℕ) :
  Nat.Prime p ∧ (∃ f : ℤ → ℤ, 
    (∀ x, f (x + p) = f x) ∧ 
    (∀ x, (f (x + f x) - x) % p = 0)) ↔ p ∈ P2025HMMTfeb_team_9_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating primes and functions f: Z->Z mod p to find solutions.
Trying prime p=2
No function f found for prime 2
Trying prime p=3
No function f found for prime 3
Trying prime p=5
Prime 5 admits such a function f: (0, 2, 4, 1, 3)
Trying prime p=7
No function f found for prime 7
