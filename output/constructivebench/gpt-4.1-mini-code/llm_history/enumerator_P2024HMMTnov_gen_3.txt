The problem asks to find the least natural number \( s = a + b + c \) where \(a,b,c\) are distinct positive integers satisfying the equation:

\[
a^b \cdot b^c = a^c
\]

We want to enumerate triples \((a,b,c)\) with distinct positive integers to find all \(s = a+b+c\) that satisfy this, then identify the minimum \(s\).

Insight:
- Since \(a^b \cdot b^c = a^c\), rearranging:
\[
a^b \cdot b^c = a^c \implies b^c = a^{c-b}
\]

- For integer \(a,b,c > 0\) distinct, and \(c \neq b\):
\[
b^c = a^{c-b}
\]

- This means \(b^c\) is a perfect power of \(a\), suggesting to try small values for \(a,b,c\).

We enumerate \(1 < a,b,c \leq 10\), distinct with \(a,b,c > 0\), check the condition exactly, print found sums immediately.

```python
# Enumerate triples (a,b,c) with distinct positive integers up to max_n
# Check if a^b * b^c == a^c holds exactly
# Print s = a+b+c whenever condition holds, then identify minimum sum

def main():
    max_n = 10
    found = []
    for a in range(1, max_n+1):
        for b in range(1, max_n+1):
            if b == a:
                continue
            for c in range(1, max_n+1):
                if c == a or c == b:
                    continue
                # check equation: a^b * b^c == a^c
                lhs = pow(a, b) * pow(b, c)
                rhs = pow(a, c)
                if lhs == rhs:
                    s = a + b + c
                    found.append(s)
                    print(f"Found triple (a,b,c)=({a},{b},{c}), sum={s}")

    if found:
        minimum = min(found)
        print(f"Minimum sum s = {minimum}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This enumerates and outputs solutions immediately, then prints the least sum at the end.
