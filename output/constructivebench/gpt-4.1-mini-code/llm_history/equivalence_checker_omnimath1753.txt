Ground Truth Answer: fun u c => ((u + c) / 2, (u - c)^2 / (4 * u))
Proposed Answer: fun (u c : ℝ) => 
  let p := (u + c) / 2 
  (p, (p - c) * (1 - p / u))
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. Both answers correctly compute the optimal price \( p = \frac{u + c}{2} \) and the corresponding maximum revenue \( r \). The proposed answer expresses \( r \) as \( (p - c)(1 - p/u) \), which simplifies to \( \frac{(u - c)^2}{4u} \), matching the ground truth. The expressions are algebraically equivalent.
