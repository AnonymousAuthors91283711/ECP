The problem involves finding the greatest number of divisors that the expression "a + b divides a * b" can have, where a ≤ 1983 and m is the count of b satisfying that divisibility. We want to enumerate values m for sample a ≤ 1983 to conjecture the maximum.

We implement a Python program that:
- Iterates over a small sample of a values (e.g., a from 1 to 30).
- For each a, finds all b such that a + b divides a * b.
- Prints the count of such b (m) for each a.
- Tracks the maximum m found.

This approach helps conjecture the maximal m achievable for the problem.

```python
# Enumerate counts m = |{b | a+b divides a*b}| for a in a sample range
# Then identify the maximal count m among these samples.

def divisors(n):
    # Efficiently return divisors of n
    divs = set()
    i = 1
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            divs.add(i)
            divs.add(n // i)
        i += 1
    return divs

def count_b_for_a(a):
    count = 0
    # From a + b | a * b
    # Equivalent to (a * b) % (a + b) == 0
    # for b >=1 we can check b from 1 to some reasonable limit
    # Analysis suggests checking divisors of a^2 because for divisibility,
    # x = a+b would divide a*b -> x divides a*b

    # From the problem, a+b divides a*b => (a+b) | ab
    # rewrite condition: a + b divides a*b
    # We try b in [1, 2a] as heuristic bound.

    limit = 2 * a
    result_b = []
    for b in range(1, limit + 1):
        if (a * b) % (a + b) == 0:
            count += 1
            result_b.append(b)
    return count, result_b

max_count = 0
max_a = None
print("a,count")

for a in range(1, 31):  # small sample a ≤ 30 for insight
    c, bs = count_b_for_a(a)
    print(f"{a},{c}")
    if c > max_count:
        max_count = c
        max_a = a

print(f"Maximum count m found: {max_count} at a = {max_a}")
```
