The problem relates to a real number \( x \) where \(\frac{x}{100} \times 60 = 12\). From this, we want to find the value \(\frac{15}{100} \times x\). Instead of formal proof, let's enumerate solutions for \( x \) that satisfy the given equation and then compute the required expression.

```python
# Enumerate possible x values satisfying (x / 100) * 60 = 12
# Solve algebraically: x * 60 / 100 = 12 -> x = 12 * 100 / 60 = 20
# Then compute 15% of x, i.e., 0.15 * x.
# We'll print to confirm the exact value 20 for x and the result 3 for the expression.

def main():
    # Since the equation is linear, x=20 exactly
    x = 20
    lhs = (x / 100) * 60
    if abs(lhs - 12) < 1e-12:
        result = (15 / 100) * x
        print(f"x = {x} satisfies (x/100)*60 = {lhs}")
        print(f"(15/100)*x = {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
