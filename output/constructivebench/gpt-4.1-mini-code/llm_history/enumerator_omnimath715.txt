The problem is about finding the sum of squares of the roots of a given polynomial:
\[ p(x) = x^8 - 14x^4 - 8x^3 - x^2 + 1. \]

We want to enumerate the roots numerically (or symbolically if possible), and find their squares, summing them. The output can help conjecturing the exact sum.

```python
# Enumerate roots of the given polynomial and sum their squares.
# Poly: x^8 -14 x^4 -8 x^3 - x^2 +1
# We'll use numpy.roots for numerical roots approximation.
# Streaming outputs as we find roots, then print sum of squares.

import numpy as np

coeffs = [1, 0, 0, 0, -14, -8, -1, 0, 1]  # degree 8 coefficients highest to lowest
roots = np.roots(coeffs)

sum_sq = 0
print("Roots and their squares:")
for r in roots:
    if np.iscomplex(r):
        # We consider only real roots (imaginary part close to zero)
        if abs(r.imag) > 1e-10:
            continue
        root = r.real
    else:
        root = r
    sq = root**2
    print(f"Root: {root:.10f}, Square: {sq:.10f}")
    sum_sq += sq

print(f"Sum of squares of real roots: {sum_sq:.10f}")
```
