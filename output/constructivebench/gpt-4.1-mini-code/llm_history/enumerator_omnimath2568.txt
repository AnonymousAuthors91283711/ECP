The problem asks for an infinite set of natural numbers such that for any two distinct elements, their sum is squarefree (not divisible by any square > 1). To explore, we enumerate sets of natural numbers and check sums for squarefreeness, printing candidates and sums checked. We try small sets here and output candidates that satisfy the squarefree sum property.

```python
import math

def is_squarefree(n):
    if n < 1:
        return False
    for p in range(2, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % (p * p) == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Try small sets and check if all sums of pairs are squarefree.
# Print candidate sets and sums found.
print("Trying small sets to find sets with squarefree sums:")

# Enumerate sets of size 3 from first 12 natural numbers
from itertools import combinations

N = 12
max_set_size = 5

found_sets = []

for size in range(2, max_set_size + 1):
    for subset in combinations(range(1, N + 1), size):
        all_squarefree = True
        sums = set()
        for a, b in combinations(subset, 2):
            s = a + b
            sums.add(s)
            if not is_squarefree(s):
                all_squarefree = False
                break
        if all_squarefree:
            print(f"Candidate set of size {size}: {subset}, sums = {sorted(sums)}")
            found_sets.append(subset)
print(f"Number of candidate sets found: {len(found_sets)}")
```
