The problem involves finding a real-valued function on 8 points where each value is the average of values at "adjacent" points (adjacent defined by a parity condition on indices), repeated 10 times, and checking if a non-constant fixed point exists.

We can enumerate functions on `Fin 8`, iteratively apply the averaging operator 10 times, and check if the function returns to itself without being constant. Since there are infinitely many functions \(f: \{0, \ldots, 7\} \to \mathbb{R}\), we can't brute force all real functions but can try vectors with integer or rational values in a small range and observe behavior.

We'll:
- Define adjacency for each node.
- Define a function to compute one averaging step.
- Iterate 10 times and check if \(average\_adjacent^{10}(f) = f\) and if \(f\) is non-constant.
- Enumerate integer-valued functions with values in a small range (e.g., \{-2,...,2\}) to find any approximate fixed points.

We'll print every candidate fixed point found and finally print if non-constant fixed points exist for these samples.

```python
# Python program to explore the fixed points of the average_adjacent operator on Fin 8

def adjacent(k):
    # Adjacent nodes j to k satisfy j != k and (j + k) is odd
    return [j for j in range(8) if j != k and (j + k) % 2 == 1]

def average_adjacent(f):
    # Compute f' where f'(k) = average of f(i) for i in adjacent(k)
    f_new = []
    for k in range(8):
        neighbors = adjacent(k)
        total = sum(f[i] for i in neighbors)
        f_new.append(total / 3)  # each node has exactly 3 neighbors
    return f_new

def is_close(f1, f2, tol=1e-9):
    return all(abs(a - b) < tol for a, b in zip(f1, f2))

def is_constant(f):
    return all(abs(x - f[0]) < 1e-9 for x in f)

def print_vector(f):
    print("f =", [round(x,5) for x in f])

    # Enumerate integer-valued functions with each value in -2,..,2 (5^8 = 390625 possibilities)

        for _ in range(10):
            f = average_adjacent(f)

        # Check if average_adjacent^10(f_orig) == f_orig (within tolerance)
        if is_close(f, f_orig):
            candidates += 1
            if not is_constant(f):
                found_nonconstant += 1
                print_vector(f_orig)

    print(f"Total fixed points found with values in {-1,0,1}: {candidates}")
    print(f"Non-constant fixed points count: {found_nonconstant}")
