The problem defines a set \( S \subseteq (0,1]^2 \) with conditions on the floors of logarithms base 2 and 5, requiring these floors to be even numbers. We want to compute the area of \( S \), express it as a reduced fraction \( \frac{m}{n} \), and examine \( m + n \).

This Python code enumerates rectangles corresponding to even floor values of \(\log_2(1/x)\) and \(\log_5(1/y)\), sums their areas, reduces the fraction and prints each partial sum with numerator and denominator candidates, all while obeying the problem constraints and output length limit.

```python
from math import floor, log
from fractions import Fraction

# Enumerate contributions for k,l from 0 up to MAX to approximate area
MAX = 8  # reasonable cutoff to limit output length

# Each point (x,y) in S satisfies:
# floor(log2(1/x)) = 2k
# => 2k <= log2(1/x) < 2k+1, since floor=2k exactly
# => 2k <= -log2(x) < 2k+1
# => 2k <= -log2(x) < 2k+1
# => 2^{-2k-1} < x <= 2^{-2k}
# Similarly for y with base 5 and 2l

# Compute intervals for x and y
def interval_bounds(base, k):
    # floor(log_base(1/x))=2k means:
    # 2k <= log_base(1/x) < 2k+1
    # So intervals in x:
    low = base**(-2*k-1)
    high = base**(-2*k)
    return low, high

partial_sum = Fraction(0,1)
print("Enumerating partial sums for area of S:\n")

for k in range(MAX+1):
    x_low, x_high = interval_bounds(2, k)
    for l in range(MAX+1):
        y_low, y_high = interval_bounds(5, l)
        area_rect = (x_high - x_low) * (y_high - y_low)
        # Exact fraction for (x_high - x_low) = 2^{-2k} - 2^{-2k-1} = 2^{-2k-1}
        # Similarly for y: 5^{-2l} - 5^{-2l-1} = 5^{-2l-1}*(5-1)/5=4*5^{-2l-1}/5=4*5^{-2l-2}
        # We want exact rationals. Express as Fractions:
        # x range length:
        x_len = Fraction(1, 2**(2*k)) - Fraction(1, 2**(2*k+1))
        # y range length:
        y_len = Fraction(1, 5**(2*l)) - Fraction(1, 5**(2*l+1))
        # Area as fraction
        area_frac = x_len * y_len
        partial_sum += area_frac
        # Print partial sum numerator, denominator and decimal
        print(f"k={k}, l={l}, area_frac={area_frac.numerator}/{area_frac.denominator}, partial_sum={partial_sum.numerator}/{partial_sum.denominator}")

# After enumeration, print the reduced fraction and sum of numerator and denominator
m = partial_sum.numerator
n = partial_sum.denominator
print(f"\nFinal approximated area fraction: {m}/{n}")
print(f"Sum m+n = {m+n}")
```
