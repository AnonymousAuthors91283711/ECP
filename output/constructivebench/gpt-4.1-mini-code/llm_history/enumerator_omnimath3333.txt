The problem involves the sequence defined by a_0=1, a_1=1, a_2=2, and a_{n+3} = a_{n+2} + a_{n+1} + a_n, and the set of natural numbers n > 0 such that a_{n-1} = n^2. We want to find all n for which the (n-1)-th term of the sequence equals nÂ².

The program will:
- Compute terms of the sequence a up to some reasonable n (say n=30).
- Check if a_{n-1} equals n^2 exactly.
- Print the n values that satisfy this equality immediately when found.

This enumeration will help identify candidate values of n and conjecture if there are finitely many or infinitely many such n.

```python
# Sequence a: a_0=1, a_1=1, a_2=2, and a_{n+3} = a_{n+2}+a_{n+1}+a_n
# Find all n > 0 with a_{n-1} = n^2 for n <= 30

def a_sequence(n):
    # Memoization for efficiency
    memo = {0:1, 1:1, 2:2}
    def helper(k):
        if k in memo:
            return memo[k]
        memo[k] = helper(k-1) + helper(k-2) + helper(k-3)
        return memo[k]
    return helper(n)

print("Enumerating n with a_{n-1} = n^2 for n in 1..30:")
for n in range(1,31):
    val = a_sequence(n-1)
    if val == n*n:
        print(f"n={n}, a_{n-1}={val}, n^2={n*n}")

```
