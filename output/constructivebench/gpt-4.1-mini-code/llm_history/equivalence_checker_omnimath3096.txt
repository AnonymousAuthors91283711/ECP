Ground Truth Answer: fun (a, b, c) => max (max a b) c - min (min a b) c
Proposed Answer: fun p => Nat.max p.1 (Nat.max p.2.1 p.2.2) - Nat.min p.1 (Nat.min p.2.1 p.2.2)
Let's analyze the two answers:

1. Ground Truth Answer: `max (max a b) c - min (min a b) c`
   - This computes the maximum of all three numbers (a, b, c) minus the minimum of all three numbers

2. Proposed Answer: `fun p => Nat.max p.1 (Nat.max p.2.1 p.2.2) - Nat.min p.1 (Nat.min p.2.1 p.2.2)`
   - This unpacks the tuple p into (a, (b, c)) structure
   - Computes `max a (max b c)` which is equivalent to `max (max a b) c`
   - Computes `min a (min b c)` which is equivalent to `min (min a b) c`

The two expressions are mathematically equivalent, just written with different syntax:
- Both compute the range (max - min) of the three numbers
- The tuple unpacking in the proposed answer doesn't affect the computation
- The order of max/min operations doesn't matter (max and min are associative)
