The problem defines a set of real numbers \(x\) such that applying the iteration 
\[ y \mapsto |y| + x \]
starting from 0 and iterating \(n=2017\) times gives 1. We want to find all such \(x\). Since \(n\) is fixed to 2017, we want to find \(x\) such that:
\[
f^{(2017)}(0) = 1,
\]
where \(f(y) = |y| + x\).

The problem involves nested absolute values and iteration, so it might behave differently depending on the sign of the values at each step. Let's write a Python program to enumerate the possible \(x\) values that satisfy the iteration condition for some \(n\) and inspect these values, aiming to conjecture the form of the solution.

We'll try small \(n\) values like 1, 2, ..., 20 for manageable enumeration and print results for those \(x\) that yield \(f^{(n)}(0) = 1\). For each \(n\), print candidate \(x\).

```python
# enumerator.py
# Enumerate possible x such that the n-th iterate of f(y) = |y| + x starting at 0 equals 1,
# for small sample values of n up to 20, to conjecture about the pattern.

def iterate_f(x, n):
    y = 0
    for _ in range(n):
        y = abs(y) + x
    return y

def possible_x_for_n(n, tolerance=1e-9):
    # We want to solve iterate_f(x, n) = 1 for x.
    # Because iteration is monotone and piecewise linear in x,
    # We try to find x by binary search in a reasonable domain.
    # The iteration is increasing in x.
    
    low_x, high_x = -10, 10
    results = []
    steps = 50
    for i in range(steps+1):
        x = low_x + i * (high_x - low_x) / steps
        val = iterate_f(x, n)
        if abs(val - 1) < tolerance*10:
            results.append(x)
    return results

def main():
    print("Enumerating possible x where f^n(0) = 1 for f(y)=|y| + x")
    max_n = 20
    for n in range(1, max_n+1):
        candidates = possible_x_for_n(n)
        # Print unique candidates with rounding for readability
        unique_candidates = sorted(list(set(round(c, 9) for c in candidates)))
        if unique_candidates:
            print(f"n = {n}, candidates x (approx): {unique_candidates}")
