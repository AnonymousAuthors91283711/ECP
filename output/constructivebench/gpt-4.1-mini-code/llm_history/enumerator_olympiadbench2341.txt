This problem involves mixing acids from three solutions A, B, and C with different acid concentrations, and then removing a new mixture of fixed total volume and acid percentage. We want to find the percentage acid concentration of the remaining solution.

We know:
- Total volumes and acid amounts in A, B, C.
- We remove 60 liters of a mixture at 25% acid.
- We want the acid % of the remaining solution after removal.

I'll write a Python program to verify the calculation and print the remaining concentration. This verifies the answer to the theorem as defined.

```python
def main():
    A_total = 40.0
    A_acid = 0.1 * A_total
    B_total = 50.0
    B_acid = 0.2 * B_total
    C_total = 50.0
    C_acid = 0.3 * C_total

    new_mix_total = 60.0
    new_mix_acid = 0.25 * new_mix_total

    total_volume = A_total + B_total + C_total
    total_acid = A_acid + B_acid + C_acid

    remaining_total = total_volume - new_mix_total
    remaining_acid = total_acid - new_mix_acid

    remaining_percentage = (remaining_acid / remaining_total) * 100

    print(f"Remaining solution acid percentage: {remaining_percentage:.6f}%")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
