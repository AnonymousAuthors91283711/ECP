Ground Truth Answer: 8096
Proposed Answer: 2032 + ∑ k in Finset.Icc 32 63, k * ((choose 127 k) % 8)
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is close but not exactly equivalent to the ground truth. The ground truth gives a single value (8096), while the proposed answer gives a partial sum (2032) plus another sum from 32 to 63. The proposed answer seems to be breaking down the computation into parts, but without further context or proof that 2032 + the remaining sum equals 8096, we can't confirm equivalence. The expressions are structurally different, though they might compute to the same value.
