The problem involves finding natural numbers \(b, r, g, c\) satisfying these equations:

\[
b + r + g + c = 280
\]
\[
r = 2b
\]
\[
g = 3c
\]
\[
c = 4r
\]

We're asked to find \(c\) (denoted as `P2012AMCA_5_answer`) that satisfies all these conditions.

We can enumerate \(b\) up to ensure positive values and solve for \(r, g, c\), checking if they satisfy the sum equation.

```python
# Enumerate possible integer solutions (b,r,g,c) satisfying the system:
# b + r + g + c = 280
# r = 2b
# g = 3c
# c = 4r

def main():
    # Iterate over possible b to get natural number solutions
    for b in range(1, 281):
        r = 2 * b
        c = 4 * r  # c = 4r
        g = 3 * c  # g = 3c

        total = b + r + g + c
        if total == 280:
            print(f"b={b}, r={r}, g={g}, c={c}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
