Ground Truth Answer: {(1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 2), (3, 3)}
Proposed Answer: {p : ℕ × ℕ | (p.fst = 2 ∨ p.fst = 3) ∧ (p.snd = 2 ∨ p.snd = 3)}
Let me analyze the two answers:

1. Ground Truth Answer explicitly lists all pairs (a,b) that satisfy the condition: (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3).

2. Proposed Answer describes a set where both components are either 2 or 3. This would include:
   - All pairs from ground truth where both numbers are 2 or 3: (2,2), (2,3), (3,2), (3,3)
   - But excludes (1,2) and (2,1)
   - Also includes additional pairs not in ground truth like (3,1), (1,3), etc.

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
- It misses valid pairs (1,2) and (2,1)
- It includes invalid pairs where one component is 1 and the other is 3
- It includes other invalid pairs like (3,1)
