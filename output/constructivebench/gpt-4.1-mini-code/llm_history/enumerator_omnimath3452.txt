This problem involves the three real numbers: \( \sqrt{2011} \), \( 2011 \), and \( 2011^2 \). We want to enumerate these numbers in increasing order and identify which index in \( \mathrm{Fin}\ 3 \) (i.e., 0,1,2) corresponds to each value.

Since enumerating these values directly will confirm the order \(\sqrt{2011} < 2011 < 2011^2\), the Python program will compute these numbers, print them immediately, and print the mapping from index to value.

```python
# Enumerate the three values sqrt(2011), 2011, 2011^2 with their indices in increasing order
import math

values = [(math.sqrt(2011), 'sqrt(2011)'),
          (2011, '2011'),
          (2011**2, '2011^2')]

# Sort by the numerical value
values.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

print("Enumerating values in increasing order:")

for i, (val, name) in enumerate(values):
    # Print exact when possible, here approximate float shown but label retains meaning
    print(f"Index {i}: {name} = {val}")

print("\nOrder confirms: sqrt(2011) < 2011 < 2011^2")
```
This enumerates all candidates, printing each immediately, and shows their relative order.
