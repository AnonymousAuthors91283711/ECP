The problem asks for the number of multisets of 3 positive integers with sum 2002. This corresponds to counting the number of solutions in positive integers to x + y + z = 2002, with x,y,z ≥ 1, and since multisets are unordered, we count distinct sorted triples (x ≤ y ≤ z).

We will enumerate all triples (x,y,z) with x ≤ y ≤ z, x+y+z=2002, x,y,z ≥1, then print each solution as found, and finally print the total count.

```python
def enumerate_triples(sum_value=2002):
    count = 0
    # x ≤ y ≤ z, x,y,z≥1, x+y+z=2002
    # For x in 1 to 2002//3 (max 667)
    max_x = sum_value // 3
    for x in range(1, max_x+1):
        # y ≥ x, y ≤ (sum - x)//2 to ensure y ≤ z
        max_y = (sum_value - x) // 2
        for y in range(x, max_y+1):
            z = sum_value - x - y
            if z < y:
                continue  # ensures ordering x ≤ y ≤ z
            # found one multiset
            print(f"Multiset: {{{x}, {y}, {z}}}")
            count += 1
    print(f"Total multisets with 3 positive integers summing to {sum_value}: {count}")

    enumerate_triples()
