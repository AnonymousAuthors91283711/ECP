This problem asks for the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that \(\gcd(n^3, n!) \geq 100\). Since \( \gcd(n^3, n!) = n^3 \) if \(n^3 | n!\), we want to find the smallest \(n\) such that \(n^3 | n!\) and \(n^3 \geq 100\).

We will enumerate \(n\) from 1 upwards, compute the prime factorization of \(n\), check if \(n^3 \mid n!\) by verifying the prime-power counts, and print candidates with \(\gcd(n^3, n!) \geq 100\). Finally, we will output the minimum such \(n\).

Since the factorial grows fast, we'll use small \(n\) (up to around 20) to keep computations manageable.
