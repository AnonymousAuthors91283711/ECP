The problem is to find the number of triples \((a,b,c)\) of natural numbers such that \((a b + 1)(b c + 1)(c a + 1) = 84\).

We will enumerate \(a,b,c\) over small natural numbers and print all satisfying triples. Since the product is 84, a relatively small number, we can limit \(a,b,c\) to small integers. The factors \(a b +1\), \(b c +1\), and \(c a +1\) are divisors of 84 of the form \(d\), and \(d-1\) must be divisible by some variable combinations.

We enumerate all triples with \(a,b,c\) from 0 to 10 to cover all possible candidates efficiently, print found solutions, and count them.

```python
# Enumerate (a,b,c) in natural numbers (including 0 to 10) satisfying (a*b+1)*(b*c+1)*(c*a+1)=84.
# Print each solution as found, then output total count as answer.

def main():
    from math import isqrt
    target = 84
    max_val = 10  # upper bound for a,b,c
    count = 0
    for a in range(max_val+1):
        for b in range(max_val+1):
            ab = a*b + 1
            if target % ab != 0:
                continue
            for c in range(max_val+1):
                bc = b*c + 1
                ca = c*a + 1
                prod = ab * bc * ca
                if prod == target:
                    print(f"Found solution: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}")
                    count += 1
    print(f"omnimath451_answer = {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
