[write_program]
We want to evaluate the function \(f(t) = \lfloor \frac{t}{20} \rfloor + \lfloor \frac{t}{30} \rfloor\) at \(t=300\). The program will enumerate values of \(f(t)\) for \(t\) near 300 to confirm the value and print immediately when found.

```python
# Enumerate values of f(t) = floor(t/20) + floor(t/30) around t = 300
from math import floor

def f(t):
    return floor(t / 20) + floor(t / 30)

# Print values for t in range [290..310] to verify pattern and final value
for t in range(290, 311):
    val = f(t)
    print(f"f({t}) = {val}")

# Explicitly print the answer at t=300 as required
answer = f(300)
print(f"P2012AMCA_2_answer = {answer}")
```
