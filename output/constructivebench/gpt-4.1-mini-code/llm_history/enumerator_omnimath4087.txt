The problem asks to find all natural numbers \( n > 1 \) such that \( n^2 \) divides \( 2^n + 1 \). To assist in conjecturing answers, we enumerate values of \( n \) up to a small bound and check the divisibility condition exactly.

```python
# Enumerate n > 1 and print n where n^2 divides 2^n + 1 for n up to 1000.
# Prints all candidates and finally the smallest/largest found if any.

def main():
    candidates = []
    print("Enumerating n with n^2 | 2^n + 1 for n up to 1000:")
    for n in range(2, 1001):
        val = 2**n + 1
        n_sq = n*n
        if val % n_sq == 0:
            print(n)          # print candidate immediately when found
            candidates.append(n)
    if candidates:
        print("Minimum candidate:", min(candidates))
        print("Maximum candidate:", max(candidates))
    else:
        print("No candidates found up to 1000")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
