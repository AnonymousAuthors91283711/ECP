Ground Truth Answer: {1}
Proposed Answer: { n : ℕ | ∃ k : ℕ, (0 < k) ∧ n = k^3 }
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for which natural numbers n > 0 there exists an r × c matrix of divisors of n where:
   - All entries are distinct
   - All row sums are equal
   - All column sums are equal

2. The ground truth answer is {1}, meaning only n=1 satisfies these conditions.

3. The proposed answer suggests that numbers which are perfect cubes (n = k³) satisfy the conditions.

Analysis:
- For n=1 (which is 1³), the trivial 1×1 matrix [1] satisfies all conditions, matching both answers.
- However, for n=8 (which is 2³), we'd need to construct such a matrix. The possible divisors are 1,2,4,8. It's impossible to arrange these in a matrix where all entries are distinct and row/column sums are equal.
- The only case that works is n=1, as any larger n would require multiple distinct divisors arranged in a way that maintains equal sums, which isn't generally possible.

Conclusion: The proposed answer is incorrect as it includes many numbers beyond just 1. Only n=1 satisfies the given conditions.
