The problem is to study the equation 
\[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{x} + \sqrt{x - 2}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{x + 2} + \sqrt{x}} = \frac{1}{4} \]
for \( x \geq 2 \). We want to find all real \( x \geq 2 \) satisfying this equation. The goal is to enumerate possible answers by checking values of \( x \) starting from 2 upwards, and printing any values satisfying the equation (within some numerical tolerance), then conjecturing exact values from numeric output.

```python
import math

# We'll check x values from 2 to 10 with a small step.
# Print x values where the equation nearly holds (within tolerance).
# Then we'll print the minimal such x.

def lhs(x):
    return 1/(math.sqrt(x) + math.sqrt(x - 2)) + 1/(math.sqrt(x + 2) + math.sqrt(x))

tolerance = 1e-9
candidates = []

print("Checking values of x from 2 to 10:")

x = 2
while x <= 10:
    value = lhs(x)
    diff = abs(value - 0.25)
    if diff < tolerance:
        print(f"x = {x:.9f} solves equation: lhs={value}")
        candidates.append(x)
    x += 0.0001

if candidates:
    min_x = min(candidates)
    print(f"Minimum solution near {min_x:.9f}")
else:
    print("No solutions found within tolerance in [2,10].")
```
