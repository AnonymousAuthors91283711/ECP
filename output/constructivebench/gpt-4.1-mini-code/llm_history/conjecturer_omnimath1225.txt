theorem omnimath1225 :
  ∃ (r s : ℕ), Nat.Coprime r s ∧
  (r : ℝ) / s = (2 * (sqrt 2 + sqrt 10)) / (5 * sqrt (3 + sqrt 5)) ∧
  (r, s) = omnimath1225_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating candidates for (r,s) with denominator ≤ 50 representing the target value:

r = 4, s = 5, r/s = 4/5 = 0.8

Among these candidates, one is the minimal pair (r,s).. Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ
