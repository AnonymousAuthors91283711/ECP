The problem involves summing the number of distinct digits of all integers from \(10^{2018}\) to \(10^{2019} - 1\). Since digit enumeration for such massive numbers is infeasible directly, I will explore smaller ranges (like powers of 10 with fewer digits) to conjecture the pattern and eventually the true sum.

The idea: for each number \( n \), find the count of unique digits, sum over the interval, then observe and print results for ranges \( [10^k, 10^{k+1}) \), \( k=1,2,3 \).

```python
# Enumerate sums of distinct digit counts over intervals [10^k, 10^{k+1}) for small k to guess pattern

def distinct_digit_count(n):
    return len(set(str(n)))

def sum_distinct_counts(lo, hi):
    total = 0
    for x in range(lo, hi):
        c = distinct_digit_count(x)
        print(f"{x}: {c}")
        total += c
    print(f"Sum of distinct digits count from {lo} to {hi-1} = {total}")
    return total

def run():
    # Small digit ranges for feasibility
    for k in range(1, 4):
        lo = 10**k
        hi = 10**(k+1)
        print(f"Parameters: k={k}, interval=[{lo}, {hi})")
        sum_distinct_counts(lo, hi)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run()
```
