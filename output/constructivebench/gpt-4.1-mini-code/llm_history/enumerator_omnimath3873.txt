The problem is to find all natural numbers \( n > 0 \) such that \((n^3 + 3)\) is divisible by \((n^2 + 7)\). This means:
\[
(n^3 + 3) \equiv 0 \pmod{n^2 + 7}
\]
or
\[
n^2 + 7 \mid n^3 + 3.
\]

To solve and assist conjecture, we can enumeratively check values of \( n \) starting from 1 up to a reasonable bound and print all \( n \) that satisfy the divisibility condition. Since the denominator grows like \( n^2 \) and numerator like \( n^3 \), we expect only small \( n \) to fit or a pattern.

```python
# Enumerate natural numbers n > 0 and check if (n^3 + 3) is divisible by (n^2 + 7)
# Print all such n immediately when found
# This should help conjecture the true set

def main():
    limit = 1000  # check n up to 1000 to find possible candidates
    print("Checking n from 1 to", limit)
    results = []
    for n in range(1, limit + 1):
        denom = n**2 + 7
        numer = n**3 + 3
        if numer % denom == 0:
            print(f"n={n} divides: ({n}^3+3) divisible by ({n}^2+7)")
            results.append(n)
    if results:
        print("Candidates found:", results)
        print("Minimum candidate:", min(results))
        print("Maximum candidate:", max(results))
    else:
        print("No candidates found")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
