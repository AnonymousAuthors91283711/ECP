The problem describes a function \( F \) defined on natural numbers with \( F(1) = 1, F(2) = 1 \), and for \( n \geq 1 \), \( F(n+2) = F(n+1) + F(n) \). This is the Fibonacci sequence. The theorem states that the only shift \( t > 0 \) for which \( F(n) = F(n+t) \) for all \( n > 0 \) is some fixed \( t \).

To assist in conjecturing the true answer, we will verify for \( t = 1, 2, \ldots, 10 \) whether the sequence repeats with period \( t \). Since the Fibonacci numbers are well-known to be non-periodic, we expect no \( t > 0 \) will satisfy the equality for all \( n \). We will enumerate and print results for each \( t \) checking the condition up to some moderately large \( n \).

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 1, 1
    for _ in range(n-1):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return a

max_t = 10
max_n = 20  # Check first 20 terms for equality

print("Checking periods t for Fibonacci sequence starting with F(1)=1, F(2)=1")

for t in range(1, max_t + 1):
    # Check if F(n) == F(n+t) for all n up to max_n
    equal_all = True
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        if fibonacci(n) != fibonacci(n + t):
            print(f"t={t}: fails at n={n} with F(n)={fibonacci(n)}, F(n+t)={fibonacci(n+t)}")
            equal_all = False
            break
    if equal_all:
        print(f"t={t}: sequence repeats for first {max_n} terms (possible period)")
        
print("Conjecture: No positive t yields full equality F(n) = F(n+t) for all n")
```
