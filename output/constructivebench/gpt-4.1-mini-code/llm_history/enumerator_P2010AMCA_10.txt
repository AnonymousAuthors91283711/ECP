[write_program]
The problem involves real numbers \( p, q \) with a constraint \( q=9 \), and a given equality involving \( p, q \). The goal is to find the value of an expression \( (3p + q) + 2010((3p + q) - (3p - q)) \).

Key observations:
- Since \( q = 9 \), that simplifies the problem.
- The equality relates terms involving \( p \) and \( q \) and can be used to solve for \( p \).
  
The program will:
1. Substitute \( q=9 \).
2. Enumerate plausible rational or integer values for \( p \) (say over a small set to identify the pattern).
3. Check the equality condition.
4. Compute the expression for valid \( p \).
5. Print each candidate along with \( p \).
  
We will use exact rational arithmetic to avoid approximations and print results immediately.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# q is fixed at 9
q = Fraction(9)

# Try a range of p values around plausible integers
# Since we want exact values, try p in -10 to 10 with steps of 1/2
steps = [Fraction(n, 2) for n in range(-20,21)]  # -10 to 10 in steps of 0.5

# The given equality:
# (3p - q) - p = (3p + q) - (3p - q)
# Let's simplify:
# Left: (3p - q) - p = 2p - q
# Right: (3p + q) - (3p - q) = 2q
# So 2p - q = 2q => 2p = 3q => p = 3q/2 = 3*9/2 = 27/2 = 13.5

# Since p is uniquely determined, let's verify:
p_exact = Fraction(27,2)  # 13.5
lhs = (3*p_exact - q) - p_exact
rhs = (3*p_exact + q) - (3*p_exact - q)
assert lhs == rhs, "Equality doesn't hold for p=27/2"

# Compute the expression:
# (3p + q) + 2010*((3p + q) - (3p - q))
expr = (3*p_exact + q) + 2010*((3*p_exact + q) - (3*p_exact - q))

# Print results immediately
print(f"q = {q}")
print(f"p = {p_exact} ({float(p_exact)})")
print(f"Expression = {expr} ({float(expr)})")
```
