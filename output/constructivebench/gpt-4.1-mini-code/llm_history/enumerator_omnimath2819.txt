The problem involves real numbers \(a, b, x\) with the constraint \(a + b = 12\) and the equation 
\[
a(x+2) + b(x+2) = 60.
\]
We want to find \(x\) such that the equation holds.

Since \(a+b=12\), 
\[
a(x+2) + b(x+2) = (a+b)(x+2) = 12(x+2).
\]
Setting this equal to 60 gives:
\[
12(x+2) = 60.
\]
Solving for \(x\) yields:
\[
x+2 = 5 \implies x = 3.
\]

We expect exactly this answer \(x=3\). The program will enumerate values of \(a, b\) (with \(a+b=12\)) and verify corresponding \(x\) values satisfying the original equation, then print all distinct \(x\) values found to help conjecture the solution.

```python
# Enumerate a, b with a + b = 12, and find x satisfying a*(x+2)+b*(x+2)=60
# Since (a+b)(x+2)=60 -> 12(x+2)=60 -> x=3, we verify by enumeration

def float_eq(u, v, tol=1e-9):
    return abs(u - v) < tol

print("Enumerating x values from a,b such that a+b=12 and a*(x+2)+b*(x+2)=60:")

x_values = set()
step = 0.5
for a_times_10 in range(0, 121):  # Enumerate a from 0 to 12 in steps of 0.1 (scaled)
    a = a_times_10 / 10
    b = 12 - a
    # Equation: a*(x+2)+b*(x+2) = 60 => (a+b)(x+2)=60 => 12*(x+2)=60 => x=3
    # But let's solve x from the equation just for enumerating:
    numerator = 60
    denominator = a + b
    if float_eq(denominator, 0):
        continue
    x = numerator / denominator - 2  # x+2 = 60/(a+b)

    if float_eq(a*(x+2) + b*(x+2), 60):
        if not any(float_eq(x, xv) for xv in x_values):
            print(f"a={a:.1f}, b={b:.1f} => x={x:.6g}")
            x_values.add(x)

print("Distinct x values found:")
for xv in sorted(x_values):
    print(f"x = {xv:.6g}")

print(f"Therefore, the solution x = {3}")
```
