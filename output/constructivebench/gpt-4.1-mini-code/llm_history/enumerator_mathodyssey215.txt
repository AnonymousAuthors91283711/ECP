We want to find all real x such that:
√(x² + 2x − 6) = √(x² − 14).

Square both sides (considering domain restrictions) to get:
x² + 2x − 6 = x² − 14,
which simplifies to:
2x − 6 = −14 ⇒ 2x = −8 ⇒ x = −4.

We must verify the domains:
For the square roots to be defined,
x² + 2x − 6 ≥ 0 and x² − 14 ≥ 0.
Check if x = -4 satisfies these:
(-4)² + 2*(-4) − 6 = 16 - 8 - 6 = 2 ≥ 0,
(-4)² − 14 = 16 − 14 = 2 ≥ 0,
and both square roots equal √2.

No other solutions satisfy the equality because the squared sides must be equal and domains valid.

To assist the proof, we write a program to enumerate values near the solution, print when roots match, confirming the analytic solution.

```python
import math

# Enumerate x in sample range and check sqrt equality
# Prioritize exact matches by checking difference exactly zero within floating tolerance
for x in [-10 + i * 0.1 for i in range(201)]:  # from -10 to 10 step 0.1
    lhs_expr = x**2 + 2*x - 6
    rhs_expr = x**2 - 14
    if lhs_expr >= 0 and rhs_expr >= 0:
        lhs = math.sqrt(lhs_expr)
        rhs = math.sqrt(rhs_expr)
        if math.isclose(lhs, rhs, abs_tol=1e-14):
            print(f"x = {x:.1f}, sqrt(x^2+2x-6) = sqrt(x^2-14) = {lhs}")
# Final explicit print of solution from algebra
print("Algebraic solution x= -4 satisfies the equality.")
```
