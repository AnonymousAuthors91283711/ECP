The problem seems to involve finding triples of positive integers (a, b, c) satisfying the equation

1/a + 1/b + 1/c = 1/p,

where p is a prime number, and such that a + b + c < 2 * p * sqrt(p).

We want to enumerate such triples for sample small primes p, print each triple found immediately, and also print the parameters used.

We limit search by a reasonable bound (based on 2*p*√p) to ensure termination and efficiency.

```python
import math

def find_triples(p):
    bound = int(2 * p * math.sqrt(p))
    print(f"Prime p = {p}, searching triples with a+b+c < {bound}")
    for a in range(1, bound):
        # Since 1/a + 1/b + 1/c = 1/p, and all positive, 1/a ≤ 1/p so a ≥ p
        if a < p:
            continue
        for b in range(a, bound):
            # For fixed a,b, solve for c:
            denom = 1/p - (1/a + 1/b)
            if denom <= 0:
                continue
            c = 1/denom
            if abs(c - round(c)) < 1e-9:
                c = int(round(c))
                if c >= b and a + b + c < bound and c > 0:
                    # Verify the equation to avoid floating error
                    lhs = 1/a + 1/b + 1/c
                    rhs = 1/p
                    if abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-12:
                        print((a, b, c))

def main():
    sample_primes = [2, 3, 5]
    for p in sample_primes:
        find_triples(p)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
