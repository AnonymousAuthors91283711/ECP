abbrev olympiadbench2637_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem olympiadbench2637 :
  ∑ d in (Nat.divisors 24).erase 0, (1 : ℚ) / d = olympiadbench2637_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Divisors of 24: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24]
1/1 = 1
1/2 = 1/2
1/3 = 1/3
1/4 = 1/4
1/6 = 1/6
1/8 = 1/8
1/12 = 1/12
1/24 = 1/24
Sum of reciprocals of divisors of 24 = 5/2. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
<<<5 / 2>>>
