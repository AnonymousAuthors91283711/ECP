The problem involves 10 real numbers with average 87, two of which are 51 and 99 at distinct indices. We want to find the average of the remaining eight numbers. By enumerating all possible positions of 51 and 99 (distinct indices), and calculating the average of the 8 remaining numbers, we can determine the possible values and conjecture the fixed answer.

```python
# We have 10 numbers with average 87 -> total sum = 870
# Two numbers are fixed: 51 and 99 at distinct indices
# The average of the other 8 numbers is (870 - 51 - 99)/8 = ?

total_sum = 87 * 10
x = 51
y = 99

print("Enumerating positions of 51 (j) and 99 (k) with j != k and corresponding average of other 8:")

for j in range(10):
    for k in range(10):
        if j != k:
            # Sum of remaining 8 numbers
            rem_sum = total_sum - x - y
            rem_avg = rem_sum / 8
            print(f"j={j}, k={k}, average of remaining 8 = {rem_avg}")

print("\nConclusion: The average of the other 8 numbers is always", (total_sum - x - y)/8)
```
