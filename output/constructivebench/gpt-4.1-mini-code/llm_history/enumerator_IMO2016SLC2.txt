The problem asks for enumerating positive integers n that can be represented as an r×c grid of distinct divisors of n such that each row sums to the same value and each column sums to the same value. This is a challenging combinatorial number theory problem.

To investigate, we will try small values of n (say up to 30) and enumerate all possible grid shapes r×c and divisor assignments f. We will check whether the conditions hold. When solutions are found, we will print n and example parameters.

This enumeration will help conjecture the set IMO2016SLC2_answer. We print partial results immediately, without hardcoding the answer.

# Get divisors of n

    divs = [1]
    for i in range(2, n//2+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divs.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        divs.append(n)
    return divs

# Check if sequence sums to target for all rows and all columns uniquely arranged into r x c
def check_grid(n, r, c, grid):
    # grid is a flat list of length r*c
    # distinctness checked by construction
    # each element divides n checked by construction
    # rows sums equal
    row_sums = [sum(grid[i*c:(i+1)*c]) for i in range(r)]
    if len(set(row_sums)) != 1:
        return False
    # columns sums equal
    col_sums = []
    for j in range(c):
        col_sums.append(sum(grid[i*c+j] for i in range(r)))

    return False
