abbrev omnimath870_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath870 : 
  let total_outcomes := 6^4
  let favorable_outcomes := 4^4 - 3^4 - (5^4 - 4^4)
  favorable_outcomes / total_outcomes = omnimath870_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Total outcomes: 1296
Favorable outcomes: -194
Ratio (favorable / total): -194 / 1296
Ratio (decimal approx): -0.14969135802469136. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
<<<-(4^4 - 3^4 - (5^4 - 4^4)) / 6^4>>>
