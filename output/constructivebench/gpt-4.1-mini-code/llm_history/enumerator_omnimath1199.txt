This problem involves pairs of functions \( d_1, d_2 : \text{Fin } 8 \to \mathbb{N} \) and their sums over conditions based on sums of indices and values. The theorem relates the existence of these functions with a certain counting equality, sums \(a, b\), and their minimum belonging to a set \(\text{omnimath1199\_answer}\).

To conjecture what \(\text{omnimath1199\_answer}\) looks like, we can enumerate small values \(a, b\) and try to find \(d_1, d_2\) that satisfy the conditions for these \(a, b\) pairs.

The condition involves for each \(k\):
\[
|\{(i,j) \mid d_1(i) + d_2(j) = k\}| = |\{(i,j) \mid i + j + 2 = k\}|
\]
where \(i,j \in \{0,\dots,7\}\). Since \(i,j \in \text{Fin } 8\), the range for \(i+j+2\) is from \(2\) to \(16\).

We want to:
- Enumerate small pairs \((a,b)\), \(a \neq b\);
- For each, check if there exist functions \(d_1,d_2\) mapping \(\{0..7\}\to \mathbb{N}\) with sums \(a,b\) and matching the equation;
- Print the valid min(a,b)'s we find.

Because the problem is complex, we simplify the enumeration:
- Fix small sums \(a,b\) up to a threshold (say 10);
- Attempt to find \(d_1, d_2\) such that the condition on counts over \(k\) holds;
- We try simplest form: \(d_1\) or \(d_2\) being uniform or linear.

We will:
- Precompute counts of pairs \(i,j\) with \(i+j+2=k\);
- Enumerate \(a,b\in [1,10], a\neq b\);
- For each, try simple \(d_1,d_2\) such that sum conditions hold and check if the multiset condition on counts holds.

Note: Enumerating all functions is infeasible, so we try \(d_1,d_2\) constant (equal entries), or \(d_1(i)=i\), \(d_2(j)=b/8\) integer parts if divisible, etc.

This exploration will provide candidate min sums to guess \(\text{omnimath1199\_answer}\).
