This problem looks related to calculating time differences in minutes. The equation is:

8 * 60 - current_time = omnimath2890_answer

with current_time = 7*60 + 30 + 16.

To explore, I'll write a Python program that enumerates current_time values close to this and calculates 8*60 - current_time results, printing each one. This will help conjecture the exact answer.

```python
# Enumerate possible current_time values near the given one and print results
def main():
    base_time = 7 * 60 + 30 + 16  # Given current time in minutes
    end_time = 8 * 60              # 8:00 in minutes
    print(f"Given current_time = {base_time} minutes ({base_time//60}h {base_time%60}m)")
    # Check times from base_time-5 min to base_time+5 min, within reasonable bounds
    for ct in range(base_time - 5, base_time + 6):
        if ct < 0 or ct > end_time:
            continue
        diff = end_time - ct
        print(f"current_time={ct} ({ct//60}h {ct%60}m), 8*60 - current_time = {diff}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
