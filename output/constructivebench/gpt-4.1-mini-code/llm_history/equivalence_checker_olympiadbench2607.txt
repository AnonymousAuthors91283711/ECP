Ground Truth Answer: 136
Proposed Answer: 196
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the minimal value of g(14) where g is a function satisfying:
   - g(x) + g(y) > x² for all x,y > 0
   - Among all such functions, g minimizes the sum of first 20 values

2. The ground truth answer is 136, which suggests:
   - The minimal function likely satisfies g(x) = x² + 1 - c where c is some constant
   - For x=14, 14² + 1 = 197, so 136 would be 197 - 61

3. The proposed answer is 196, which is very close to 14² = 196
   - This suggests the proposed answer might be using g(x) = x² exactly
   - But g(x) + g(y) = x² + y² > x² doesn't hold for all y (fails when y=1)
   - Therefore 196 is too large and doesn't satisfy the first condition

The proposed answer fails to satisfy the problem's conditions, while the ground truth answer appears correct based on the functional form needed.
