The problem gives two conditions on real numbers \(x\) and \(y\):

1. \(x - y = 4\)
2. \(x^3 - y^3 = 28\)

We want to find \(x \cdot y\).

Using the identity for difference of cubes:

\[
x^3 - y^3 = (x - y)(x^2 + xy + y^2)
\]

Given \(x - y = 4\), then

\[
28 = 4(x^2 + xy + y^2) \implies x^2 + xy + y^2 = 7
\]

But since \((x - y)^2 = x^2 - 2xy + y^2 = 16\), we can write:

\[
x^2 + y^2 = 16 + 2xy
\]

Plug into the previous equation:

\[
x^2 + xy + y^2 = (x^2 + y^2) + xy = (16 + 2xy) + xy = 16 + 3xy = 7
\]

So:

\[
16 + 3xy = 7 \implies 3xy = -9 \implies xy = -3
\]

Thus, the answer is \(-3\).

The program below enumerates possible integer pairs \((x, y)\) that satisfy \(x - y = 4\), then checks the cube difference and prints \(x \cdot y\).

```python
# Enumerate integer pairs x,y with x-y=4, check x^3 - y^3 = 28, print x*y
# Since the problem involves reals, we use integers around plausible solution

def main():
    print("Enumerating pairs (x,y) with x - y = 4 and x^3 - y^3 = 28:")
    for y in range(-10, 11):
        x = y + 4
        cube_diff = x**3 - y**3
        if cube_diff == 28:
            product = x * y
            print(f"x={x}, y={y}, x*y={product}")

    # From algebra, product should be -3
    print("Product x*y = -3")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
