The problem involves real numbers \(a, b, c\) satisfying the symmetric system:
\[
\begin{cases}
a^2 + b = c^2 \\
b^2 + c = a^2 \\
c^2 + a = b^2
\end{cases}
\]
and we want to find \(a \cdot b \cdot c\).

To explore possible real triples \((a,b,c)\) satisfying the system, I'll enumerate candidate triples for \(a,b,c\) over a small range of integers and check the system to verify exact solutions. For each solution, the product \(a \cdot b \cdot c\) will be printed immediately, with exact values preferred.

This numerically-guided search should help conjecture the possible product values.

```python
# Enumerate triples (a,b,c) with a,b,c integers in a small range
# Check if they satisfy the system exactly:
# a^2 + b = c^2
# b^2 + c = a^2
# c^2 + a = b^2
# Print the product a*b*c for each solution found.

            rhs2 = a**2
            lhs3 = c**2 + a
