The problem seems to be evaluating the expression (-2)^3 - (-3)^2 and conjecturing the exact integer result.

This can be quickly computed:

(-2)^3 = -8
(-3)^2 = 9
So (-2)^3 - (-3)^2 = -8 - 9 = -17

The program below enumerates over small integers for a base a and b, computes a^3 - b^2, and prints the results for a in [-5,5], b in [-5,5], highlighting the target evaluation a=-2 and b=-3.

```python
# Enumerate values of a and b in small ranges,
# compute a^3 - b^2 and print them.
# Particularly, print the value for a=-2,b=-3.

for a in range(-5, 6):
    for b in range(-5, 6):
        val = a**3 - b**2
        print(f"a={a}, b={b} => a^3 - b^2 = {val}")
        # Highlight the particular value of interest
        if a == -2 and b == -3:
            print(f"Target answer: omnimath2741_answer = {val}")
```
