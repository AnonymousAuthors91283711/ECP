theorem P2014AMCA_7 : 
  ∃ (r : ℝ), (√3) * r = 3^(1/3) ∧ (3^(1/3)) * r = 3^(1/6) ∧ (3^(1/6)) * r = P2014AMCA_7_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 1
Proposed Answer: 3^(1/6)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step.

1. The problem gives us a system of three equations with r as the unknown:
   - √3 * r = 3^(1/3)
   - (3^(1/3)) * r = 3^(1/6)
   - (3^(1/6)) * r = P2014AMCA_7_answer

2. Let's solve for r from the first equation:
   r = 3^(1/3) / √3 = 3^(1/3) / 3^(1/2) = 3^(1/3 - 1/2) = 3^(-1/6)

3. Now verify this r with the second equation:
   (3^(1/3)) * (3^(-1/6)) = 3^(1/3 - 1/6) = 3^(1/6) which matches the right side

4. Now compute P2014AMCA_7_answer using the third equation:
   (3^(1/6)) * (3^(-1/6)) = 3^(1/6 - 1/6) = 3^0 = 1

5. The ground truth answer is 1, which matches our calculation.

6. The proposed answer is 3^(1/6), which is not equal to 1 (since 3^(1/6) ≈ 1.2009).

Therefore, the proposed answer is incorrect.
