abbrev omnimath1638_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath1638 : 
  (List.sum (List.filter (fun n => ¬ (2 * n + 3) ∣ (2^(n !) - 1)) (List.drop 50 (List.range 101)))) = omnimath1638_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n=52 fails: (2n+3)=107 does NOT divide 2^(n!)-1
n=82 fails: (2n+3)=167 does NOT divide 2^(n!)-1
n=88 fails: (2n+3)=179 does NOT divide 2^(n!)-1
Sum of all such n: 222. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<52 + 82 + 88>>>
