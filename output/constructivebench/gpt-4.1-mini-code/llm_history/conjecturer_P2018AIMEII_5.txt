The error arises because `(abs x)^2` is ambiguous in Lean mathlib: `abs` for complex numbers is `Complex.abs`, which returns an `ℝ`, but Lean may treat `^2` as a power for a type class needing a `Lattice` instance, not numeric power on reals. The more canonical way to express the squared magnitude of a complex number z is `Complex.normSq z` (= (abs z)^2) which is already defined and has type `ℝ`. So summing `Complex.normSq x + Complex.normSq y + Complex.normSq z` is type correct.

Also, from the enumerated data, the sum of squared magnitudes is approximately 762, which matches the expression `|x|^2 + |y|^2 + |z|^2`, which is the sum of the squared norms.

Hence, the correct Lean expression is:

```lean
fun x y z => Complex.normSq x + Complex.normSq y + Complex.normSq z
```

This compiles and has type `ℂ → ℂ → ℂ → ℝ`.
