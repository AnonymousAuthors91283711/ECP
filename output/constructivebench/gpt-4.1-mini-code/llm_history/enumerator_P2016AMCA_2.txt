The problem reduces to solving for \(x\) in the equation \(10^x \cdot 100^{2x} = 1000^5\). We can enumerate candidate values of \(x\) (including fractions) and verify if the equality holds. Since exact values are preferable, we'll print any \(x\) for which the equality is true or numerically very close. 

```python
# Enumerate candidate x values to solve 10^x * 100^(2x) = 1000^5
# We try rational candidates near the expected solution by properties of exponents.

def lhs(x):
    return 10**x * 100**(2*x)

rhs = 1000**5

# 100 = 10^2, 1000 = 10^3, so rewriting:
# lhs = 10^x * (10^2)^{2x} = 10^x * 10^{4x} = 10^{5x}
# rhs = 10^{3*5} = 10^{15}
# So 10^{5x} = 10^{15} -> 5x = 15 -> x = 3 exactly.

# But we will enumerate around x=3 to confirm
print("Checking candidates for x where 10^x * 100^(2x) = 1000^5")

for numerator in range(10, 40):
    for denominator in range(1, 10):
        x = numerator / denominator
        val_lhs = lhs(x)
        if abs(val_lhs - rhs) < 1e-6:  # floating tolerance
            print(f"x = {numerator}/{denominator} = {x} satisfies the equation (approx).")

print("By rewriting with exponents, exact x = 3 is the solution.")
print("x = 3")
```
