The problem seems to involve evaluating the floor of an expression involving constants, likely from an AMC contest problem. We want to find the unique natural number \( n = \lfloor 20 \times 100 \times \frac{1.45}{100} \rfloor \).

Let's write a program that computes this exactly and prints the result, along with close elevations if needed. Since the expression is quite straightforward, the output will demonstrate the exact floor value.

```python
# Enumerate floor values for expressions of the form floor(20 * 100 * (x/100))
# with x close to 1.45 to verify uniqueness and value.

def compute_floor(x):
    val = 20 * 100 * (x / 100)
    floor_val = int(val)  # floor since val is positive
    print(f"x={x:.2f}, 20*100*(x/100) = {val}, floor = {floor_val}")

def main():
    # Exact value for x=1.45
    x = 1.45
    compute_floor(x)
    # Check neighbors around x=1.45 to verify uniqueness and stability
    for dx in [-0.01, 0.00, 0.01]:
        xn = x + dx
        compute_floor(xn)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This prints the floor value at x=1.45 and near values for verification.
