The problem involves functions \( f: \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{Q} \) satisfying a functional equation and bounding the size of the finite set \(\{k = f(r) + f(-r) \mid r \in \mathbb{Q}\}\). To get insight, I'll enumerate small rational examples with functions that satisfy the conditions, look at the sets, and identify bounds on their cardinalities.

We test simple rational-valued functions on small sets and check the cardinality of these sets. We print functions and cardinalities as we find them.

```python
from fractions import Fraction as F

# Small sample of Q: rationals with denominator in {1,2} and numerators in -2..2
# Define simple candidate functions f : Q->Q and check the property and resulting set size.
# Because the problem is complex, we test:
# 1) f(r) = r  (identity)
# 2) f(r) = -r (negation)
# 3) f(r) = 0  (constant zero)
# 4) f(r) = 1 (constant one)
# 5) f(r) = r/2
# 6) f(r) = -r/2
# 7) f(r) = floor(r) (approximate by int part, but need rational outputs)
# For each, check if they satisfy:
# For all x,y in Q: f(x + f(y)) = f(x) + y OR f(f(x) + y) = x + f(y)

# Due to Q infinite and complexity, test limited samples of x,y
x_vals = [F(n, d) for n in range(-2,3) for d in [1,2]]
y_vals = x_vals

def check_condition(f):
    # check condition for all x,y in x_vals,y_vals
    for x in x_vals:
        for y in y_vals:
            lhs1 = f(x + f(y))
            rhs1 = f(x) + y
            lhs2 = f(f(x) + y)
            rhs2 = x + f(y)
            if not (lhs1 == rhs1 or lhs2 == rhs2):
                return False
    return True

def build_set(f):
    s = set()
    for r in x_vals:
        val = f(r) + f(-r)
        s.add(val)
    return s

def print_candidate(name, f):
    if check_condition(f):
        s = build_set(f)
        print(f"Function {name} satisfies condition. Set size: {len(s)} Elements: {sorted(s)}")

# Define candidates
candidates = {
    "identity": lambda r: r,
    "negation": lambda r: -r,
    "zero": lambda r: F(0,1),
    "one": lambda r: F(1,1),
    "half": lambda r: r/2,
    "neg_half": lambda r: -r/2,
    "const2": lambda r: F(2,1)
}

print("Testing candidate functions on small rationals:")
for name, f in candidates.items():
    print_candidate(name, f)
```
