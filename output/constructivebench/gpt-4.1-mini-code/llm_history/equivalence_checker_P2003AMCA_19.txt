abbrev P2003AMCA_19_answer : ℝ → ℝ → ℝ → ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem P2003AMCA_19 (a b c : ℝ) (ha : a ≠ 0) :
  (let f := fun x => a*(x-5)^2 + b*(x-5) + c
   let g := fun x => -a*(x+5)^2 - b*(x+5) - c
   (f + g) = P2003AMCA_19_answer a b c) ∧ 
  10 * b ≠ 0 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun a b c x => 10 * b * x + (50 * b + 2 * c)
Proposed Answer: fun a b c x => -20 * a * x - 10 * b
Let's analyze the problem and the answers carefully:

1. The problem defines two functions f and g, then asks for their sum (f + g). The ground truth answer provides this sum.

2. Calculating f(x) + g(x):
   f(x) = a*(x-5)² + b*(x-5) + c
   g(x) = -a*(x+5)² - b*(x+5) - c

   f(x) + g(x) = a[(x-5)² - (x+5)²] + b[(x-5) - (x+5)] + [c - c]
               = a[(x²-10x+25)-(x²+10x+25)] + b[-10] + 0
               = a[-20x] - 10b
               = -20a*x - 10b

3. The proposed answer matches exactly with our calculation: fun a b c x => -20 * a * x - 10 * b

4. The ground truth answer is different: 10*b*x + (50*b + 2*c)

The proposed answer is correct while the ground truth answer appears to be incorrect. They are not equivalent.
