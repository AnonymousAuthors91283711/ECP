This problem involves the number \( n \) which is the product of the first 10 primes, and a sum over divisors involving Euler's tot function \( \varphi \). To explore this, we enumerate divisors of \( n \) and compute:

\[
S = \sum_{x|n} \sum_{y|(n/x)} \varphi(x) \cdot y
\]

Our goal is to find \( S/n \).

Since direct symbolic manipulation is complex, we will compute numerically using Python with exact integer arithmetic, exploiting the fact that \( n \) is the product of the first 10 primes. We won't explicitly generate all divisors (since \( n \) has \(2^{10} = 1024\) divisors), we will generate divisors by subset products of the prime list.

We'll:
- Generate all divisors of \( n \),
- For each divisor \( x \), compute \(\varphi(x)\),
- For the divisors \( y \) of \( n/x \), sum \( y \),
- Accumulate all \(\varphi(x) \times \sum y\),
- Finally print \( S \) and \( S/n \).

This will print intermediate divisors and partial sums (streaming), as requested.

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

primes = [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29]

def prod(lst):
    p = 1
    for x in lst:
        p *= x
    return p

# Compute n
n = prod(primes)

# Generate divisors by taking all subsets of primes
def divisors(primes):
    divs = [1]
    for p in primes:
        newdivs = [d*p for d in divs]
        divs += newdivs
    return sorted(set(divs))

# Euler tot function for divisor composed of distinct primes from the set
def phi(d):
    result = d
    for p in primes:
        if d % p == 0:
            result = result // p * (p - 1)
    return result

# Sum of divisors: since divisors are subset products, sum them similarly
def sum_divisors(m):
    # Divisors come from subset of primes in m
    # find which primes divide m
    relevant_primes = [p for p in primes if m % p == 0]
    # sum of divisors is product over primes of (1 + p)
    s = 1
    for p in relevant_primes:
        s *= (1 + p)
    return s

# Generate divisors of n
divs = divisors(primes)

S = 0
print(f"n = {n}")
for x in divs:
    nx = n // x
    phix = phi(x)
    sdiv = sum_divisors(nx)
    val = phix * sdiv
    print(f"x={x}, phi(x)={phix}, sum_divisors(n/x)={sdiv}, contrib={val}")
    S += val

print("Sum S =", S)
print("S / n =", S // n)
```
