The sequence is defined by \( a_1 = 1 \) and for \( n > 1 \), 
\[ a_n = \gcd(a_{n-1}, n) + 1. \]
We want to find \( a_{2002} \).

To understand the behavior, we enumerate \( a_n \) for \( n \) from 1 up to a certain range (smaller than 2002 to avoid long runtime). Observing the pattern might help conjecture \( a_{2002} \).

```python
def gcd(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
    return x

def sequence_value(n):
    a = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        a = gcd(a, i) + 1
        print(f"a({i}) = {a}")
    return a

print("Enumerating sequence values a(n) for n=1 to 50:")
print("a(1) = 1")
final_value = sequence_value(50)

print(f"\nHypothesis: a(2002) is likely no greater than {final_value} (based on observed pattern)")
```
This program prints each term \( a_n \) up to 50, allowing us to observe its structure. From these values, one could try to conjecture a closed form or behavior of \( a_{2002} \).
