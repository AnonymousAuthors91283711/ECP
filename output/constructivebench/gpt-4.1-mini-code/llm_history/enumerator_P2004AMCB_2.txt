The problem is to find the greatest natural number \( x \) such that for some permutation \((a,b,c,d)\) of \(\{0,1,2,3\}\), \( x = c \cdot a^b - d \). We will enumerate all permutations and compute corresponding values \( x \), printing all candidates and finally the maximum.

```python
from itertools import permutations

# The set to permute
S = {0,1,2,3}
max_x = None

for perm in permutations(S):
    a, b, c, d = perm
    # compute c * a^b - d
    val = c * (a ** b) - d
    if val >= 0:
        print(val)
        if max_x is None or val > max_x:
            max_x = val

print("Maximum x found:", max_x)
```
