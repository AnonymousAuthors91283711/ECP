The problem involves evaluating a triple infinite sum with indices a ≥ 1, b ≥ a, c ≥ b of the term 1 / (2^a * 3^b * 5^c). We want to explore values of the sums and look for possible closed forms.

To analyze this numerically, I will write a Python program that:
- Enumerates a, b, c with small upper bounds,
- Prints partial sums immediately,
- Prints the total approximate sum,
- Attempts to guess the closed form based on patterns.

Due to the nature of exponents and bounds (a ≤ b ≤ c), the sums are nested with increasing lower limits on indices.

We can try truncation limits up to 5 for each index to see the numerical trend, then try to derive the formula:

Observe that for each fixed a,
- b runs from a to ∞,
- c runs from b to ∞.

This suggests summations can be separated and reordered.

Here is the Python program to compute partial sums and print partial results:

```python
# Enumerate the sum S = sum_{a=1}^\infty sum_{b=a}^\infty sum_{c=b}^\infty 1/(2^a * 3^b * 5^c)
# We truncate indices up to some max_n to approximate the sum.

def sum_triple(max_n):
    total = 0.0
    for a in range(1, max_n+1):
        for b in range(a, max_n+1):
            for c in range(b, max_n+1):
                val = 1 / (2**a * 3**b * 5**c)
                total += val
    return total

def main():
    print("Enumerating partial sums for increasing max_n:")
    for n in range(1, 6):
        s = sum_triple(n)
        print(f"max_n = {n}, partial sum = {s:.12f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This program prints partial sums for increasing truncation limits and can help conjecture the exact value.
