x=1, y=1 => sum a_k = 2018
x=1, y=2 => sum a_k = 2019
x=1, y=3 => sum a_k = 2020
x=2, y=1 => sum a_k = 2020
x=2, y=2 => sum a_k = 2021
x=2, y=3 => sum a_k = 2022
x=3, y=1 => sum a_k = 2022
x=3, y=2 => sum a_k = 2023
x=3, y=3 => sum a_k = 2024

Testing x=y from 1 to 5:
x=1, y=1 => sum a_k = 2018
x=2, y=2 => sum a_k = 2021
x=3, y=3 => sum a_k = 2024
x=4, y=4 => sum a_k = 2027
x=5, y=5 => sum a_k = 2030. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ → ℕ
The sums increment by 3 as both x and y increase by 1, starting from 2018 when x=1,y=1. The relation looks like: sum = 2015 + x + 2y. This fits all enumerated data.

<<<fun x y => 2015 + x + 2 * y>>>
