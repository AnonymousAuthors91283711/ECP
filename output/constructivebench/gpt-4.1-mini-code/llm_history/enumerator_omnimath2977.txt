[write_program]
The problem defines a custom operation nabla(a,b) = a^b * b^a and wants to find nabla(2,3). The code sets an abbreviation omnimath2977_answer := ? and wants to prove nabla 2 3 = omnimath2977_answer. 

To assist, I will write a Python program that enumerates values a,b in a small range (like 1 to 5), computes nabla(a,b) = a^b * b^a, and prints them streaming. This will verify nabla(2,3) = 2^3 * 3^2 = 8 * 9 = 72 explicitly. Then print the answer explicitly. 

The code will output results for pairs (a,b) from 1 to 5 and print the value with exact natural numbers, printing nabla(2,3) explicitly. The code will be Python 3, no input needed, minimize output length.

```python
# Enumerate nabla(a,b)=a^b*b^a for small a,b to conjecture and verify nabla(2,3)=72

def nabla(a,b):
    return a**b * b**a

def main():
    limit = 5
    for a in range(1, limit+1):
        for b in range(1, limit+1):
            val = nabla(a,b)
            print(f"nabla({a},{b}) = {val}")
    # Explicitly print the answer for (2,3)
    print(f"Answer nabla(2,3) = {nabla(2,3)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
