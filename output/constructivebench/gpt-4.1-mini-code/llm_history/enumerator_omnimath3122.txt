The problem gives a sequence \( s(n) = 43 - 4n \) and asks for the number of natural numbers \( n \) such that \( s(n) > 0 \).

We want to enumerate \( n \in \mathbb{N} \) with \( 43 - 4n > 0 \), i.e., \( n < \frac{43}{4} = 10.75 \). Since \( n \) is a natural number starting at 0, \( n \) runs from 0 to 10 inclusive.

Let's write a Python program to enumerate these values and output the count.

```python
# Enumerate n in N (natural numbers starting at 0) where s(n) = 43 - 4n > 0
def s(n): 
    return 43 - 4 * n

# We test n from 0 upwards until s(n) <= 0
n = 0
count = 0
while True:
    val = s(n)
    if val > 0:
        print(f"n={n}, s(n)={val} > 0")
        count += 1
        n += 1
    else:
        break

print(f"Total n with s(n)>0: {count}")
```
