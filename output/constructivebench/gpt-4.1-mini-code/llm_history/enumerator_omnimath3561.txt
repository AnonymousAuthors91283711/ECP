The problem involves finding the minimal integer \( k \geq 2 \) such that for any subset \( P \) of \(\{2, \ldots, k\}\), if \( P \cup \{2,\ldots,k\} = \{2,\ldots,k\} \) and \( P \neq \{2,\ldots,k\} \), then \( P \) contains a triple \( (a,b,c) \) with \( a,b,c \in P \) and \( a \times b = c \).

In other words, every proper subset \( P \subsetneq \{2,\ldots,k\} \) whose union with \(\{2,\ldots,k\}\) is the whole set (trivially true) must contain a multiplicative triple. The condition boils down to: any proper subset \( P \subsetneq \{2, \ldots, k\} \) contains \( a,b,c \in P \) with \( a \times b = c \).

Thus, if a proper subset \( P \) avoids such a triple, it contradicts the property, so the minimal such \( k \) where no proper subset can avoid multiplicative triples is the answer.

We will enumerate \( k \) starting from 2 upwards, generate all proper subsets \( P \) of \(\{2,\ldots,k\}\) and check if any \( P \) has no multiplicative triple. If any exists, \( k \) is not the minimal. We look for the smallest \( k \) with no such \( P \).

To manage complexity, limit \( k \leq 10 \).

The program enumerates candidate \( k \), subsets \( P \), checks multiplicative triples, and prints candidate \( k \) and subsets failing or passing the condition to conjecture the minimal such \( k \).

```python
# Enumerate minimal kâ‰¥2 such that any proper subset P of {2,...,k} contains a,b,c in P with a*b=c
# We check all 2^{k-1}-2 proper subsets (excluding empty and full set) for multiplicative triples

        # For performance, consider subsets of size at least 2 (singletons cannot have triple)
        for size in range(1, len(E)):
            for P in combinations(E, size):
                if P == tuple(E):
                    continue
