theorem omnimath897 :
  let D := (100 : ℕ).divisors
  let Z := Finset.Icc 1 100
  (∑ d in D, ∑ z in Z, if d ∣ z then (1 : ℚ) else 0) / (D.card * Z.card) = omnimath897_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Divisors of 100: [1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100]
Number of divisors: 9
Number of numbers in Z: 100
d=1: count divisible = 100, partial sum = 100
d=2: count divisible = 50, partial sum = 150
d=4: count divisible = 25, partial sum = 175
d=5: count divisible = 20, partial sum = 195
d=10: count divisible = 10, partial sum = 205
d=20: count divisible = 5, partial sum = 210
d=25: count divisible = 4, partial sum = 214
d=50: count divisible = 2, partial sum = 216
d=100: count divisible = 1, partial sum = 217

Final value = total / (|D|*|Z|) = 217/9*100 = 0.2411111111111111. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
<<<217 / (9 * 100 : ℚ)>>>
