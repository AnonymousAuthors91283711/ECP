. Enumerated answers: Parameters:
a = 1990, b = 1992, m = 19911992, n = 19911990

Checking valuations for each prime factor of 1991:
Prime 11:
v_p(a+b) = 1
v_p(gcd(m,n)) = 0
Valuation v_p of sum is 1
Prime 181:
v_p(a+b) = 1
v_p(gcd(m,n)) = 0
Valuation v_p of sum is 1

Hence the maximal k with 1991^k divides the sum is minimal of valuations above, which is 1. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
