The problem appears related to finding the least nonnegative real number \( t \) such that 
\[ 5 \times \frac{t}{60} - 3 \times \frac{t}{60} = 1. \]
This simplifies to 
\[ \left(5 - 3\right) \times \frac{t}{60} = 1 \Rightarrow 2 \times \frac{t}{60} = 1. \]

We want to confirm this solution by enumerating possible \( t \) values in small increments and checking whether the equation holds. Since this is linear, it'll illustrate the search approach.

```python
# Enumerate values of t in increments of 0.1 to find when 5*(t/60) - 3*(t/60) equals 1.
# Print the candidates and the minimal solution.

def f(t):
    return 5 * (t / 60) - 3 * (t / 60)

threshold = 2  # Search up to t=2 minutes for demonstration
found = False
min_t = None

t = 0.0
while t <= threshold:
    val = f(t)
    # Use exact equality by rational numbers: here float comparison is fine due to problem form.
    if abs(val - 1) < 1e-9:  # Accepting floating epsilon for equality due to float arithmetic.
        print(f"Candidate t = {t:.6f} gives f(t) = {val:.6f}")
        if min_t is None or t < min_t:
            min_t = t
            found = True
    t += 0.1

if found:
    print(f"Minimal t satisfying 5*(t/60) - 3*(t/60) = 1 is {min_t:.6f}")
else:
    print("No t in [0,2] found satisfying the condition exactly.")
```
