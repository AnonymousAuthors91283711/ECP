  Set.Finite S ∧ Nat.card S = olympiadbench3085_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating polynomials p with degree ≤7, content=1, integer roots, and p.reverse roots = p.roots. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<8>>> 
The set S contains exactly the reciprocal polynomials with integer roots and content 1 up to degree 7, which essentially corresponds to the 8 monic polynomials with roots ±1 or 0 within degree ≤ 7, matching enumerated count.
