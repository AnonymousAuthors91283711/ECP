The given conditions are:

hq : q = 9

hseq : (3*p - q) - p = (3*p + q) - (3*p - q)

Let's simplify the equation hseq:

(3*p - q) - p = (3*p + q) - (3*p - q)

=> 3p - q - p = 3p + q - 3p + q

=> 2p - q = 2q

=> 2p = 3q

=> p = 3q/2

Since q = 9, it follows p = 27/2.

The expression of interest is:

(3*p + q) + 2010 * ((3*p + q) - (3*p - q))

Substitute p=27/2 and q=9:

3*(27/2) = 81/2 = 40.5

3*p + q = 40.5 + 9 = 49.5

3*p - q = 40.5 - 9 = 31.5

Difference = (3*p + q) - (3*p - q) = 49.5 - 31.5 = 18

Final expression = 49.5 + 2010 * 18 = 49.5 + 36180 = 36229.5

In fraction form, 36229.5 = 72459/2.

Lean does not allow noncomputable definitions by default for real numbers involving division, so we mark the definition noncomputable. Also, we use `noncomputable def` instead of `abbrev` for real expressions involving division.

Hence, the corrected Lean expression should be:

noncomputable def P2010AMCA_10_answer : ℝ := (3*(27/2) + 9) + 2010 * ((3*(27/2) + 9) - (3*(27/2) - 9))

Expression = 72459/2 (36229.5). Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The problem states that q = 9 and the equation
(3*p - q) - p = (3*p + q) - (3*p - q)
holds. Solving this, we can find p = 27/2. Then we want to find 
(3*p + q) + 2010 * ((3*p + q) - (3*p - q)).

Plugging in p=27/2 and q=9 gives a concrete numeric answer. We just need to express that number as a real number in Lean. Since 27/2 = 13.5, let's write everything symbolically:

3*p + q = 3*(27/2) + 9 = 81/2 + 9 = (81 + 18)/2 = 99/2

3*p - q = 81/2 - 9 = (81 - 18)/2 = 63/2

So the difference (3*p + q) - (3*p - q) = (99/2 - 63/2) = 36/2 = 18

Hence, expression equals: (99/2) + 2010 * 18 = (99/2) + 36180 = (99/2) + (72360/2) = 72459/2

We can represent 72459/2 as a real number by using rational literals. In Lean, use (72459:ℝ)/2 or 72459/2 with coercion.

Also, the error in the original attempt is because "noncomputable def" is used inside an abbrev which expects a term, not a definition. To fix, just define P2010AMCA_10_answer as a term of ℝ, not as a def.

So the final correct expression in Lean is just:

(72459 : ℝ) / 2

This is closed form, exact, and consistent with the calculation.

The error occurs because the definition involves real division, which is noncomputable in Lean's current mathlib setup without the `noncomputable` keyword. To fix this, we should mark the definition as `noncomputable` so Lean accepts the division operation on ℝ.

The given expression corresponds to the closed form expression evaluated for p = 27/2 and q = 9. To generalize, from the problem statement and conditions, we can simplify the expression before substituting.

Given hq: q = 9  
and hseq: (3*p - q) - p = (3*p + q) - (3*p - q)  
We analyze the expression:

(3*p + q) + 2010 * ((3*p + q) - (3*p - q))  
= (3*p + q) + 2010 * (2*q)  
= (3*p + 9) + 2010 * 18  
= 3*p + 9 + 36180

Given from hseq:  
(3*p - 9) - p = (3*p + 9) - (3*p - 9)  
=> 3*p - 9 - p = 3*p + 9 - 3*p + 9  
=> 2*p - 9 = 18  
=> 2*p = 27  
=> p = 27 / 2

Substitute p into expression:  
3*(27/2) + 9 + 36180  
= (81/2) + 9 + 36180  
= (81/2) + (18/2) + 36180  
= (99/2) + 36180  
= (99 + 2*36180)/2 = (99 + 72360)/2 = 72459/2

Hence the answer is 72459/2.

Below is the fixed Lean code defining the answer noncomputably:

The error arises because the keyword `noncomputable def` is not valid inside an `abbrev` declaration. An `abbrev` must directly assign a term, not start a new definition. To fix this, simply define `P2010AMCA_10_answer` as an abbreviation to the expression `(72459 : ℝ) / 2`.

The problem's conditions give q = 9, and from the equation (3p - q) - p = (3p + q) - (3p - q), solving for p yields p = 27/2. Then, calculating (3p + q) + 2010 * ((3p + q) - (3p - q)) = 72459/2.

Thus, the cleaned-up and correct Lean expression is:
