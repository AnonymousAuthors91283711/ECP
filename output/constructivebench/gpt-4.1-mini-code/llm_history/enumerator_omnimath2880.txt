[write_program]
The problem involves variables with given relations:
x = 3
y = 2 * x = 6
z = 3 * y = 18
We want to find (x + y + z) / 3.

The Python program below enumerates values for x, y, z using these relations and prints the average immediately.

```python
# Enumerate over given relations and print the average

# Given constraints:
# x = 3
# y = 2 * x
# z = 3 * y
# We compute (x + y + z) / 3

x = 3
y = 2 * x
z = 3 * y

average = (x + y + z) / 3
print("x =", x)
print("y =", y)
print("z =", z)
print("(x + y + z)/3 =", average)
```
