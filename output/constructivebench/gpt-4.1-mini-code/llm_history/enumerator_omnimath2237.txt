The given problem involves a sequence \(a:\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}\) defined by a somewhat complex recurrence:
\[
a(n+1) = n \cdot \left\lfloor \frac{a(n)}{n} \right\rfloor + 1, \quad n>0
\]
with the condition \(a(30) = 30\). The theorem states that the number of positive integers \(x = a(1)\) that can produce \(a(30) = 30\) via this recurrence is \(\operatorname{encard} \{x > 0 \mid a_1 = x\}\).

The task is to enumerate all possible \(a(1)\) values such that \(a(30) = 30\).

We want to run this recurrence backwards from \(a(30)=30\) to \(a(1)\), enumerating all possible \(a(1)\). For each \(a(n+1)\) we may find many possible \(a(n)\) that could generate it by the forward formula.

**Key observations**:
- From the definition:
\[
a(n+1) = n \left\lfloor \frac{a(n)}{n} \right\rfloor + 1
\]
So
\[
a(n+1) - 1 = n \cdot q, \quad q = \left\lfloor \frac{a(n)}{n} \right\rfloor
\]
Thus \(q = \frac{a(n+1)-1}{n}\) (must be an integer).

- For given \(a(n+1)\), \(q = \frac{a(n+1)-1}{n}\) must be an integer, else no \(a(n)\) possible.

- Also \(a(n)\) must satisfy: \(q \leq \frac{a(n)}{n} < q+1\), i.e.,
\[
qn \leq a(n) < (q+1) n
\]
So \(a(n)\) belongs to the integer interval \([q n, (q+1) n - 1]\).

Therefore, for fixed \(a(n+1)\), the possible \(a(n)\) are:
\[
a(n) \in \left[ \frac{a(n+1) - 1}{n} \cdot n, \quad \frac{a(n+1) - 1}{n} \cdot n + (n - 1) \right]
\]

Hence the preimage set for \(a(n+1)\) forms a range of consecutive integers of length \(n\).

We want to start at \(a(30) = 30\), walk backwards to \(a(1)\) enumerating all possible sequences.

**Algorithm**:

- Initialize current possibilities at step 30 as the set: \(\{30\}\).
- For \(n\) from 29 down to 1:
  - For each \(b\) in current possibilities (representing possible \(a(n+1)\)):
    - Compute \(q = (b-1)/n\). If not integer, discard.
    - Possible \(a(n)\) are \(q n, q n + 1, ..., q n + (n-1)\).
  - Union over all \(b\) possible \(a(n)\).
- At the end, the set of possible \(a(1)\) is the union obtained.
- Output each \(a(1) > 0\).

**We will implement this efficiently using sets.**

```python
# enumerator.py
def main():
    # Start from a(30)=30
    current = {30}
    for n in range(29, 0, -1):
        next_set = set()
        for b in current:
            diff = b - 1
            if diff % n != 0:
                continue
            q = diff // n
            # interval: [q*n, q*n + n - 1]
            interval_start = q * n
            interval_end = interval_start + n - 1
            # add all candidates
            for a_n in range(interval_start, interval_end + 1):
                if a_n > 0:  # positive integers only
                    next_set.add(a_n)
        current = next_set

    print("Parameters: a(30)=30")
    print(f"Number of valid a(1): {len(current)}")
    print("Enumerated candidates for a(1):")
    for x in sorted(current):
        print(x)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This program enumerates all \(a(1)\) for which the recurrence with \(a(30)=30\) holds. It prints each candidate immediately after the entire backward iteration (since the possible \(a(1)\) need to be collected).

The output length should be reasonable for this problem. The number of candidates grows roughly exponentially with \(n\) but the divisibility restrictions limit it. If too large, code can limit output (not requested here).
