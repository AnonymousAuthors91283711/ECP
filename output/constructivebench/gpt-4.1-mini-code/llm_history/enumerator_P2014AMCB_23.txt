The problem asks for the remainder when the sum of binomial coefficients \(\binom{2014}{k}\) for \(k=0\) to \(62\) is divided by \(2017\). The prime \(2017\) is involved, suggesting Lucas's theorem or properties of binomial coefficients modulo a prime.

To assist with conjecturing the answer, the following Python program will:
- Compute \(\sum_{k=0}^{62} \binom{2014}{k} \mod 2017\).
- Print partial sums as it processes.
- Use an efficient modular inverse and factorial precomputation for binomial coefficients modulo \(2017\).

```python
# Compute sum_{k=0}^{62} C(2014,k) mod 2017

MOD = 2017
n = 2014
max_k = 62

# Precompute factorials mod MOD up to max_k (for numerator and denominator)
# To compute C(n,k) mod p for large n, prime p, use Lucas theorem or multiplicative formula.

# Since n=2014 < p=2017, we can directly compute factorials mod p
# and use multiplicative inverse for denominator

fact = [1]*(max_k+1)
for i in range(1,max_k+1):
    fact[i] = fact[i-1]*i % MOD

# Compute numerator terms n*(n-1)*...*(n-k+1) mod MOD
def modinv(a,m=MOD):
    # Fermat's little theorem since MOD is prime
    return pow(a,m-2,m)

sum_val = 0
num = 1  # Product n*(n-1)*...*(n-k+1)
for k in range(max_k+1):
    if k == 0:
        comb = 1
    else:
        num = (num*(n - k +1))%MOD
        denom = fact[k]
        denom_inv = modinv(denom)
        comb = (num * denom_inv)%MOD
    sum_val = (sum_val + comb)%MOD
    print(f"k={k}, C({n},{k}) mod {MOD} = {comb}, partial sum = {sum_val}")

print(f"Sum of C({n},k) for k=0..{max_k} mod {MOD} = {sum_val}")
```
