The problem considers functions \( f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \) satisfying a functional equation involving iterates of \( f \) and the values \( f(f(n)) \). To explore possible such functions and values of \( f(1000) \), I will write a Python program to test candidate functions on small domains and look for patterns.

We enumerate possible \( f \) values on small sets \([1..N]\) for small \(N\) (e.g., \( N=5 \)) and check if the condition

\[
(f^{f(n)})(n) = \frac{n^2}{f(f(n))}
\]

holds for each \( n \). We'll consider functions \( f \) with values in \([1..M]\), with \(M\) small (say 5 or 6) for tractability. For integer division to be valid, we ensure the right side is an integer. We print each valid function's \( f(1000) \) guess if consistent.

Since direct brute force for \( n=1000 \) is impossible, we conjecture from small \(n\), showing printed candidate \(f(1000)\) values from sample functions.

```python
# Enumerate candidate functions f: [1..N] -> [1..M]
# Check condition (f^[f(n)])(n) == n*n / f(f(n)) where division is exact
# Print consistent functions and their candidate f(1000) values (extrapolated here as f(1) for demonstration).

N = 5  # small domain size
M = 6  # range max value

def iterate_f(f, x, k):
    # iterate f k times on x
    for _ in range(k):
        x = f[x-1]
    return x

def valid_function(f):
    # Check condition for all n in [1..N]
    for n in range(1, N+1):
        fn = f[n-1]
        ffn = f[fn-1] if 1 <= fn <= N else None
        if ffn is None or ffn == 0:
            return False
        lhs = iterate_f(f, n, fn)
        rhs_num = n*n
        if rhs_num % ffn != 0:
            return False
        rhs = rhs_num // ffn
        if lhs != rhs:
            return False
    return True

def backtrack(pos, f):
    if pos == N:
        if valid_function(f):
            # print the function and f(1000) guess as f(1)
            print("Valid f on [1..5]:", f, "=> guess f(1000):", f[0])
        return
    for val in range(1, M+1):
        f.append(val)
        backtrack(pos+1, f)
        f.pop()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    backtrack(0, [])
```
