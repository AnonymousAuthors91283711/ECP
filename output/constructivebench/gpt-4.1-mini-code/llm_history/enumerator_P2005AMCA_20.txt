The problem involves iterating a function \(f\) on the interval \([0,1]\) 2005 times and finding the number of \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f^{2005}(x) = \frac{1}{2}\). To enumerate possible answers, I will try simple sample functions \(f\) that are easy to handle computationally and calculate the set of solutions iteratively to see how iterated preimages of \(1/2\) appear. This might provide clues about the general problem or the nature of solutions.

```python
# This program explores iterations of simple functions f on [0,1] to find 
# how many solutions satisfy f^{2005}(x) = 1/2 numerically and structurally.

def iterate_preimages(f, y, n):
    # Find preimages of y under f, n times ideally.
    # For simple functions f, we can enumerate the preimages exactly.
    # But we approximate here using function inverse methods if possible.
    # Here we hardcode a few sample f functions and their inverses.

    if n == 0:
        # solutions to f^0(x) = x = y
        if 0 <= y <= 1:
            return {y}
        return set()
    
    # For this experiment, try some simple functions f and their inverses:
    # Let's try f(x) = 1 - x: involution, inverse = itself
    if f == '1-x':
        prev = iterate_preimages(f, y, n-1)
        return {1 - v for v in prev}
    
    # f(x) = x^2, inverse is sqrt(x) and -sqrt(x), but domain is [0,1], so sqrt only
    if f == 'x^2':
        prev = iterate_preimages(f, y, n-1)
        result = set()
        for v in prev:
            if 0 <= v <= 1:
                import math
                root = v**0.5
                if 0 <= root <= 1:
                    result.add(root)
        return result
    
    # f(x) = 4x(1-x): Logistic map, complicated inverse, approximate 2 inverse values
    # We'll do a numerical inverse by solving quadratic 4x(1-x) = y, x in [0,1]
    if f == 'logistic':
        prev = iterate_preimages(f, y, n-1)
        result = set()
        for v in prev:
            # solve 4x -4x**2 = v => 4x^2 -4x + v = 0
            a = 4
            b = -4
            c = v
            disc = b*b - 4*a*c
            if disc < 0:
                continue
            import math
            sqrt_disc = math.sqrt(disc)
            x1 = (-b + sqrt_disc) / (2*a)
            x2 = (-b - sqrt_disc) / (2*a)
            for x in (x1, x2):
                if 0 <= x <= 1:
                    result.add(x)
        return result
    
    return set()

    n = 2005
