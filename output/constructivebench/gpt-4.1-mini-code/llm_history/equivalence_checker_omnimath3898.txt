abbrev omnimath3898_answer : Set (ℚ → ℤ) := sorry
theorem omnimath3898 (f : ℚ → ℤ) :
  (∀ (x : ℚ) (a : ℤ) (b : ℤ), 0 < b → f ((f x + a) / b) = f ((x + a) / b)) ↔ f ∈ omnimath3898_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {f | (∃ c : ℤ, f = fun _ => c) ∨ (f = fun x => ⌊x⌋) ∨ (f = fun x => ⌈x⌉)}
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ c : ℤ, f = Function.const ℚ c} ∪ {floor}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is mostly correct but incomplete. It correctly identifies the constant functions (first part of the union) and the floor function, but misses the ceiling function which is included in the ground truth answer. The ground truth answer includes three possibilities: constant functions, floor function, and ceiling function, while the proposed answer only includes two of these three cases. Therefore, the answers are not fully equivalent, but the proposed answer is close to being correct.
