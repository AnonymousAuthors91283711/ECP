The problem states that \(2^x = 16\) and asks to find \(2^{x+3}\). Since \(16\) is \(2^4\), we expect \(x = 4\), leading to \(2^{x+3} = 2^{7} = 128\). To assist in conjecturing and verifying, I will enumerate values of \(x\) such that \(2^x = 16\) with small integer and fractional values (around 4), then compute \(2^{x+3}\). This will confirm the formula \(2^{x+3} = 8 \times 2^x = 8 \times 16 = 128\). The program will print candidate \(x\) values and associated \(2^{x+3}\) values.

```python
# Enumerate possible x such that 2^x = 16 near integer values, then compute 2^(x+3).
# Since 16 = 2^4, we confirm x=4 and output 2^(x+3) = 128.

import math

print("Enumerating x such that 2^x = 16 (testing candidates):")
target = 16
base = 2

# Test integer values near log2(16) = 4
for x_int in range(2, 7):
    val = base ** x_int
    if abs(val - target) < 1e-10:
        print(f"x = {x_int}, 2^x = {val}, 2^(x+3) = {base ** (x_int + 3)}")

# Test fractional x near 4 to illustrate uniqueness
for x_frac in [3.9, 4.0, 4.1]:
    val = base ** x_frac
    if abs(val - target) < 1.0:  # relaxed tolerance to observe closeness
        print(f"x = {x_frac:.1f}, 2^x = {val:.3f}, 2^(x+3) = {base ** (x_frac + 3):.3f}")
```
