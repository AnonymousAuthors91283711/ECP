[write_program]
The problem seems to be asking for the remainder when \(3 \times 542\) is divided by 10. The remainder can be found by calculating \((3 \times 542) \mod 10\).

The Python program will compute this value and print it.

```python
# Enumerate remainder values for 3 * 542 mod 10

a = 3
b = 542
modulus = 10

result = (a * b) % modulus
print(f"({a} * {b}) % {modulus} = {result}")
```
