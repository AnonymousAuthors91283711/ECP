The problem involves decomposing an \(m \times n\) rectangle into disjoint "hook" shaped subsets. The task is to enumerate pairs \((m,n)\) for which such a decomposition exists. Since the problem doesn't specify the exact form of "hook," I will consider "hook" shapes as connected sets shaped like an L, i.e., covers a row or column plus an arm.

I will try small \(m,n\) up to a threshold (like 6), enumerate possible hook decompositions and output whether it's possible or not. This provides sample data to help conjecture what pairs \((m,n)\) allow such a decomposition.

```python
from itertools import product

# Define rectangle points
def rectangle(m, n):
    return {(x, y) for x in range(m) for y in range(n)}

# Generate all "hook" shapes starting at a point inside m x n
def hooks(m, n):
    H = []
    points = rectangle(m, n)
    for x in range(m):
        for y in range(n):
            # Horizontal arm: from (x,y) to (x,y+k)
            for k in range(1, n - y):
                horiz = {(x, y+i) for i in range(k+1)}
                # Vertical arm: from (x,y) to (x+l,y)
                for l in range(1, m - x):
                    vert = {(x+j, y) for j in range(l+1)}
                    hook = horiz.union(vert)
                    H.append(hook)
    return H

# Check if a set can be partitioned into disjoint hooks covering rectangle exactly
def can_cover(m, n):
    rect = rectangle(m, n)
    hs = hooks(m, n)
    # Filter minimal hooks (could have many; limit complexity)
    hs = [h for h in hs if len(h) <= m+n - 1]
    # Use backtracking to cover rect exactly with disjoint hooks
    solutions = []

    def backtrack(used, cover):
        if cover == rect:
            solutions.append(True)
            print(f"Found cover for rectangle {m}x{n}")
            return True
        if len(solutions) > 0:
            return True  # only one solution needed
        # Try adding hooks that do not conflict and progress coverage
        uncovered = rect - cover
        if not uncovered:
            return False
        start = next(iter(uncovered))
        for h in hs:
            if start in h and h.isdisjoint(cover):
                if backtrack(used + [h], cover.union(h)):
                    return True
        return False

    return backtrack([], set())

# Enumerate for small m,n and print result
MAX = 6
for m in range(1, MAX+1):
    for n in range(1, MAX+1):
        possible = can_cover(m, n)
        print(f"({m},{n}): {'Possible' if possible else 'Impossible'}")
```
This program enumerates small rectangles, tries to cover them by "L" shaped hooks (defined as a horizontal arm starting at a point and vertical arm starting at the same point), and prints which dimensions are possible. This output helps conjecture which \((m,n)\) belong to `omnimath4316_answer`.
