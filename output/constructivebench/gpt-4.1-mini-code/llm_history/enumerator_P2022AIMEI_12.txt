This problem involves summing over all pairs of subsets of {0,...,n-1} that have equal size, and accumulating the size of their intersection. For large n (2021, 2022), direct enumeration is impossible. Instead, I will enumerate for small n to detect patterns, print partial results for those small n, and possibly conjecture a formula.

The formula involves summing |A ∩ B| over all pairs (A,B) of subsets of size k for k=0..n. Using combinatorics:

- Number of pairs (A,B) with |A|=|B|=k is C(n,k)^2.
- For fixed k, the total sum of |A∩B| over all such pairs is k * C(n,k)^2 * (expected number of elements in intersection).

Wait, better is to count it more directly:

Since we have symmetry, maybe sum over k=0..n:

S(n) = ∑_{k=0}^n ∑_{|A|=k} ∑_{|B|=k} |A∩B|

We can try to express S(n) in closed form. Alternatively, computing S(n) for small n and comparing values may help find a direct formula.

I will write a program computing S(n) directly for n up to 6, print the values, then compute gcd(S(2022), S(2021)) approximately or symbolically.

```python
from math import comb
from math import gcd

# Compute S(n) = sum over all pairs of subsets A,B of {0,...,n-1} with |A|=|B|, of |A ∩ B|.

def S(n):
    total = 0
    for k in range(n+1):  # size of A and B
        cnk = comb(n, k)
        # sum over all pairs (A,B) with |A|=|B|=k
        # For fixed k, the number of pairs (A,B) is cnk^2
        # The sum of |A ∩ B| over all such pairs can be computed as:
        # For each element in the n elements, count how many pairs (A,B) of size k both contain that element.
        # Number of subsets of size k containing a particular element is comb(n-1,k-1).
        # So number of pairs (A,B) containing the element is comb(n-1,k-1)^2
        # Since each element contributes that count to |A∩B|, total intersection summed is:
        intersection_sum = n * comb(n-1, k-1)**2 if k > 0 else 0
        total += intersection_sum
    return total

# Print S(n) for small n to detect pattern
for n in range(7):
    val = S(n)
    print(f"S({n}) = {val}")

# Now compute gcd and reduced sum for 2022 and 2021
p = S(2022)
q = S(2021)
d = gcd(p, q)
print(f"p = S(2022) = {p}")
print(f"q = S(2021) = {q}")
print(f"gcd(p, q) = {d}")
print(f"(p//d + q//d) % 1000 = {(p//d + q//d) % 1000}")
```
