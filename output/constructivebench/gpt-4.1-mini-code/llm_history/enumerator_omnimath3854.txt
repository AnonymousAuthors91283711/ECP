[write_program]
The problem statement is not provided, only some Lean code snippets are given. I will interpret this as a high school competition math problem that may relate to number theory or combinatorics. Since the problem is unclear, I will create a Python enumerator that demonstrates how small cases of a typical number theory or combinatorial condition might be enumerated, printing immediate results to help conjecture.

I will create a general enumerator to find integers n (say, between 1 and 50) where some hypothetical condition is met and print them immediately. This template can be adapted once the problem is clarified.

```python
# Enumerate n from 1 to 50 that satisfy sample conditions:
# For demonstration: print all n where n^2+1 is prime.
# This helps conjecture number theory patterns.

import math

def is_prime(x):
    if x < 2: return False
    if x == 2: return True
    if x % 2 == 0: return False
    for i in range(3, int(math.isqrt(x)) + 1, 2):
        if x % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

print("Checking n in [1..50] for n^2+1 prime:")

for n in range(1, 51):
    val = n*n + 1
    if is_prime(val):
        print(f"n={n}, n^2+1={val} is prime")
```

This outputs partial results as found. If you provide the exact problem statement, I can customize this enumeration accordingly.
