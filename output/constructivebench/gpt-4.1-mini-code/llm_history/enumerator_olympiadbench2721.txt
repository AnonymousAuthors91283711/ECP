The problem relates four integer variables with some given equalities:
- warnings = T + 2
- tickets = 20 (constant)
- arrests = T + 5
- The equation to solve is tickets + olympiadbench2721_answer + arrests = 20 * warnings

Given T, we want to find all possible answers for olympiadbench2721_answer satisfying that equation.

The strategy:
- Enumerate sample values for T (say 0 to 5)
- Compute warnings, tickets, arrests from formulas
- Solve for olympiadbench2721_answer exactly as an integer
- Print the parameters used and the corresponding answer

This will help conjecture a formula for olympiadbench2721_answer in terms of T.

```python
# Enumerate possible values of T to find olympiadbench2721_answer
for T in range(6):
    warnings = T + 2
    tickets = 20
    arrests = T + 5
    # Use the equation: tickets + answer + arrests = 20 * warnings
    answer = 20 * warnings - tickets - arrests
    print(f"T={T}, warnings={warnings}, tickets={tickets}, arrests={arrests} => olympiadbench2721_answer={answer}")
```
