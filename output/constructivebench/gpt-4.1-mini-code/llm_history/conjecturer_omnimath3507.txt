abbrev omnimath3507_answer : String := sorry
theorem omnimath3507 (graph : String) : 
  (∃ (f : ℝ → ℝ), (∀ x y, f x = f y) ∧ graph = omnimath3507_answer) ↔ graph = omnimath3507_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Constant c = -2, graph = 'y = -2'
Constant c = -1, graph = 'y = -1'
Constant c = 0, graph = 'y = 0'
Constant c = 1, graph = 'y = 1'
Constant c = 2, graph = 'y = 2'. Expected Answer Type: String
<<<"y = c">>>
