The provided Lean code defines a function \( r(S, n) \) which counts the number of ordered pairs \((p_1, p_2)\) of distinct elements from a set \( S \subseteq \mathbb{N} \) such that \( p_1 + p_2 = n \).

To assist in reasoning about properties of \( r \), let's enumerate \( r(S, n) \) for small sets \( S \) and integers \( n \). We will try a few small subsets \( S \subseteq \{1,2,3,4\} \) and \( n \in [2,8] \), printing the count of ordered distinct pairs summing to \( n \).

```python
# Enumerate r(S, n) = number of ordered pairs (p1, p2) in S Ã— S, 
# with p1 != p2 and p1 + p2 = n.

def r(S, n):
    count = 0
    S_list = sorted(S)
    S_set = set(S)
    # Iterate over p1 in S and check if p2 = n-p1 in S and distinct
    for p1 in S_list:
        p2 = n - p1
        if p2 in S_set and p2 != p1:
            count += 1
    return count

def powerset(s):
    # Return all subsets of s (excluding empty set)
    from itertools import chain, combinations
    s = list(s)
    return list(chain.from_iterable(combinations(s, r) for r in range(1, len(s)+1)))

S_universe = {1,2,3,4}
ns = range(2, 9)

print("Enumerating r(S,n) for subsets S of", S_universe, "and n in", list(ns))
for S in powerset(S_universe):
    S_set = set(S)
    print(f"S={S_set}")
    for n in ns:
        val = r(S_set, n)
        if val > 0:
            print(f"  n={n} => r={val}")
```
