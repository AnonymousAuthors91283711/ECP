The problem is about finding complex roots \(a,b,c\) of the polynomial \(X^3 - X + 1\), and some expression \(omnimath1206\_answer(a,b,c)\) that equals -2. To gain intuition, let's enumerate all roots numerically and experiment with symmetric functions in \(a,b,c\). We will evaluate the roots and print their values and possible symmetric combinations, seeking patterns or values close to -2.

```python
import cmath
import math

# Polynomial: x^3 - x + 1 = 0
# We want to find roots a,b,c and some function f(a,b,c) = -2
# Since omnimath1206_answer is unknown, we try symmetric expressions

def poly(x):
    return x**3 - x + 1

# Use numpy.roots for numerical root finding
import numpy as np

coeffs = [1, 0, -1, 1]  # x^3 - x + 1
roots = np.roots(coeffs)

print("Polynomial roots (approx):")
for i,r in enumerate(roots,1):
    print(f"root {i}: {r} (abs error: {abs(poly(r))})")

# Try symmetric expressions on roots:
# sum of roots, product of roots, sum of pairwise products
a,b,c = roots

# Sum of roots
s1 = a+b+c
print("\nSum of roots a+b+c =", s1)

# Sum of pairwise products
s2 = a*b + b*c + c*a
print("Sum of products a*b + b*c + c*a =", s2)

# Product of roots
p = a*b*c
print("Product of roots a*b*c =", p)

# Try common symmetric polynomial: s1^2 - 2*s2, or (a-b)^2+(b-c)^2+(c-a)^2 = 2(s1^2 -3 s2)
squares_diff = (a-b)**2 + (b-c)**2 + (c-a)**2
print("Sum of squared differences (a-b)^2+(b-c)^2+(c-a)^2 =", squares_diff)

# Try sum of cubes a^3 + b^3 + c^3
sum_cubes = a**3 + b**3 + c**3
print("Sum of cubes a^3 + b^3 + c^3 =", sum_cubes)

# Try the value (a+b+c)**3
print("(a+b+c)^3 =", s1**3)

# Check also a^3 - a + 1 for each root to see residuals
for i, r in enumerate((a,b,c),1):
    val = r**3 - r + 1
    print(f"Check root {i}: r^3 - r + 1 = {val} (should be near 0)")

# From here, one can conjecture possible expressions for omnimath1206_answer
```
