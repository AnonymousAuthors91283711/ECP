[write_program]
The problem looks for the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that \( 3^3 \cdot 5^5 \cdot 7^7 \) divides \( 149^n - 2^n \). Then, it wants the number of divisors of that \( n \).

To help, we can write a program that:
- Calculates \( M = 3^3 \cdot 5^5 \cdot 7^7 \).
- For increasing \( n \), checks if \( M \mid 149^n - 2^n \).
- Prints \( n \) when found.
- Prints the divisors count of \( n \).

Since \( M \) is large, use modular exponentiation to efficiently check divisibility.

Because \( M \) factors into powers of primes, it's more efficient to check modular congruences modulo each prime power and find the least common multiple of the orders mod each prime power. But here, we do a direct brute force for relatively small \( n \), printing reasonable intermediate steps.

```python
# Enumerate smallest n > 0 with (3^3 * 5^5 * 7^7) | (149^n - 2^n),
# then print number of divisors of such n.

from math import gcd

def mod_exp(base, exp, mod):
    result = 1
    base %= mod
    while exp > 0:
        if exp & 1:
            result = (result * base) % mod
        base = (base * base) % mod
        exp >>= 1
    return result

def divisors_count(x):
    count = 0
    i = 1
    while i*i <= x:
        if x % i == 0:
            count += 2 if i*i != x else 1
        i += 1
    return count

def main():
    p3 = 3**3
    p5 = 5**5
    p7 = 7**7
    M = p3 * p5 * p7

    print(f"M = 3^3*5^5*7^7 = {M}")

    # Check for n from 1 up to some limit (try up to 10^6)
    # but break early when found
    for n in range(1, 10**6+1):
        mod_val = (mod_exp(149, n, M) - mod_exp(2, n, M)) % M
        if mod_val == 0:
            print(f"Found n = {n} with M | (149^n - 2^n)")
            print(f"Number of divisors of n: {divisors_count(n)}")
            break
