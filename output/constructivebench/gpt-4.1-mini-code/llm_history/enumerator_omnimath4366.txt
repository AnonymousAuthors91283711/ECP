The problem involves finding all triples of positive integers \((x, y, z)\) such that 

\[
\left(1 + \frac{x}{y+z}\right)^2 + \left(1 + \frac{y}{z+x}\right)^2 + \left(1 + \frac{z}{x+y}\right)^2 = \frac{27}{4}.
\]

To assist in conjecturing the solutions, the Python program enumerates triples of small positive integers and checks the equation exactly with rational arithmetic. It prints each satisfying triple immediately and finally summarizes how many solutions were found.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# We test all triples (x,y,z) with 1 <= x,y,z <= N for small N
N = 20  # Adjust as needed to keep output short and runtime reasonable
target = Fraction(27,4)

print(f"Enumerating positive integer triples (x,y,z) with x,y,z <= {N}:")

count = 0
for x in range(1, N+1):
    for y in range(1, N+1):
        for z in range(1, N+1):
            # Compute each term exactly as Fraction
            a = 1 + Fraction(x, y+z)
            b = 1 + Fraction(y, z+x)
            c = 1 + Fraction(z, x+y)
            val = a*a + b*b + c*c
            if val == target:
                count += 1
                print(f"Solution #{count}: x={x}, y={y}, z={z}")

print(f"Total solutions found with x,y,z <= {N}: {count}")
```
