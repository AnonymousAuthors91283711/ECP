The problem involves two people (Ray and Tom) traveling the same distance with different gas efficiencies. Given:
- Ray uses `gas_ray = miles / 40` gallons,
- Tom uses `gas_tom = miles / 10` gallons,
we want to evaluate or conjecture the value of the expression:
\[
\frac{2 \times miles}{gas\_ray + gas\_tom}
\]
for various values of `miles`. I'll write a Python program to compute this expression for sample integer values of miles, focusing on exact rational arithmetic and printing results immediately to detect patterns useful for a formal proof.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def main():
    print("miles | 2*miles/(gas_ray + gas_tom)")
    for miles in range(1, 21):  # test first 20 positive integers
        gas_ray = Fraction(miles, 40)
        gas_tom = Fraction(miles, 10)
        # Compute the expression exactly
        val = Fraction(2 * miles, gas_ray + gas_tom)
        print(f"{miles:5} | {val}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
