The problem is to find real positive \( x \) such that:
\[
2^{\frac{\log(x^2)}{\log 10}} = 3 \cdot 2^{1 + \frac{\log x}{\log 10}} + 16.
\]

Rewrite the equation and try values for \( x \) to get exact or near exact solutions using Python. We will enumerate over rational powers of 10 (as the logarithms suggest) and check if the equation nearly holds.

```python
import math

# The equation is:
# 2^(log(x^2)/log(10)) = 3 * 2^(1 + log(x)/log(10)) + 16
# Rewrite log base 10 as log10
#
# Set y = log10(x), then:
# Left = 2^(2y)
# Right = 3 * 2^(1 + y) + 16 = 3 * 2 * 2^y + 16 = 6 * 2^y + 16
#
# So 2^(2y) = 6 * 2^y + 16
# Let z = 2^y, then z^2 = 6z + 16
# z^2 - 6z - 16 = 0
#
# Solve quadratic:
# z = [6 ± sqrt(36 + 64)] / 2 = [6 ± 10]/2
#
# z1 = (6+10)/2 = 16/2 = 8
# z2 = (6-10)/2 = -4/2 = -2 (discard negative)
#
# So z=8=2^y
# y = log2(8) = 3
# Recall y = log10(x), so x = 10^y = 10^3 = 1000

# Just to verify programmatically and also enumerate some values around 1000.

eps = 1e-10

def f(x):
    if x <= 0:
        return None
    left = 2 ** (math.log(x*x, 10))
    right = 3 * (2 ** (1 + math.log(x, 10))) + 16
    return left, right

print("Testing exact and near-exact values:")

# Check x = 10^k for k in 0 to 5 in steps of 1

    x = 10 ** k

    print(f"x=10^{k}={x}: left={left:.10f}, right={right:.10f}, diff={diff:.3e}")
    if diff < eps:
        print(f"-> Found solution x = {x}")
