The issue arises because you try to define omnimath2901_answer as a constant ℝ without parameters, but the answer depends on x, which is a variable parameter in the theorem statement. You can't refer to x at the top-level without passing it explicitly.

Since x is given in the theorem, and in particular in the hypothesis, to write the answer as a function depending on x, you can make omnimath2901_answer a function from ℝ to ℝ.

However, since in the theorem x is fixed by hypothesis hx : x = 5, you can simply substitute x=5 to get the value y = 14 - 5 = 9.

Hence the closed-form answer expression is just 9, a constant real number.

Alternatively, to generalize you can define

omnimath2901_answer (x : ℝ) := 14 - x

but here since the theorem fixes x = 5, the answer reduces to 9.

Therefore, the answer expression that directly compiles and matches the theorem statement is the constant 9.

Explanation: The problem states (x + y)/2 = 7, so x + y = 14, and given x=5, y=9.

Thus:

<<<9>>>
