[write_program]
The problem involves natural numbers \(D, e, h\) satisfying given equations and inequalities:
- \(D > 0\)
- \(e = 9h\)
- \(4(e + h) = 3e + Dh + 16\)
- \(3e + Dh = \frac{3(D e + 3h)}{2}\)

We want to find the possible values of \(e + h\).

I will write a Python program that tries small natural numbers for \(D\) and \(h\) (since \(e = 9h\)) to find values that satisfy the equations exactly, printing every valid \((D, e, h)\) and corresponding \(e+h\). This can help conjecture the value of \(e + h\).

The search space will be limited for efficiency and brevity (say \(D, h\) from 1 to 20).

```python
# Enumerate (D,h) with D>0, h>0, e=9h, and test the two equations exactly.
# Print all triples (D,e,h) that satisfy both equations exactly.
# Then print e+h values found.

def main():
    print("Enumerating valid (D,e,h) with D,h in [1..20]:")
    found_sums = set()
    for D in range(1, 21):
        for h in range(1, 21):
            e = 9 * h
            # Check first equation: 4(e+h) = 3e + D h + 16
            lhs1 = 4 * (e + h)
            rhs1 = 3 * e + D * h + 16
            if lhs1 != rhs1:
                continue
            # Check second equation: 3e + D h = 3(D e + 3 h)/2
            # The right side should be an integer, so check divisibility by 2
            numerator = 3 * (D * e + 3 * h)
            if numerator % 2 != 0:
                continue
            rhs2 = numerator // 2
            lhs2 = 3 * e + D * h
            if lhs2 != rhs2:
                continue
            s = e + h
            print(f"D={D}, e={e}, h={h} => e+h={s}")
            found_sums.add(s)
    if found_sums:
        min_sum = min(found_sums)
        max_sum = max(found_sums)
        print(f"Minimum e+h found: {min_sum}")
        print(f"Maximum e+h found: {max_sum}")
    else:
        print("No solutions found in range.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
