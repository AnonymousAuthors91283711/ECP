Ground Truth Answer: 1999008 / 1999012
Proposed Answer: 3998016 / (3998016 + 4)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step:

1. The problem calculates two types of pairs:
   - sameColorPairs: Sum of n*(n-1) for each color count
   - redGreenPairs: Fixed as 2*2 = 4

2. Calculating sameColorPairs:
   - For all colors with count=2: 8 colors * (2*(2-1)) = 8*2 = 16
   - For copper (count=2000): 2000*1999 = 3,998,000
   - Total sameColorPairs = 16 + 3,998,000 = 3,998,016

3. Denominator is sameColorPairs + redGreenPairs = 3,998,016 + 4 = 3,998,020

4. The fraction should be 3,998,016 / 3,998,020

5. Ground truth answer simplifies to:
   1,999,008 / 1,999,012 (divided numerator and denominator by 2)

6. Proposed answer shows:
   3,998,016 / (3,998,016 + 4) which is exactly our calculation

The proposed answer is mathematically equivalent to the ground truth answer, just in a different (non-simplified) form.
