The problem involves finding the smallest natural number \( N \) such that for all \( k \in \{0,\dots,11\} \), the value \((k+1) \times \text{remaining\_coins}(N,k) / 12\) is a positive integer divisible by 12. The recurrence for remaining_coins is given, and the problem claims the minimum such \( N \) is \( 12! \). Let's write a program to test values of \( N \) near \( 12! \) and print those satisfying the divisibility and positivity conditions.

```python
from math import factorial

def remaining_coins(N, k):
    # Compute remaining_coins(N, k) using the recurrence given:
    # remaining_coins(N,0) = N
    # remaining_coins(N,k+1) = remaining_coins(N,k) - ((k+1)*remaining_coins(N,k))//12
    rem = N
    for i in range(k):
        rem = rem - ((i+1)*rem)//12
    return rem

def test_N(N):
    # For k in 0..11, compute rem = remaining_coins(N,k)
    # Check (k+1)*rem is divisible by 12 and ((k+1)*rem)//12 > 0
    for k in range(12):
        rem = remaining_coins(N, k)
        val = (k+1)*rem
        if val % 12 != 0:
            return False
        if val // 12 <= 0:
            return False
    return True

factorial_12 = factorial(12)  # 479001600

print(f"Testing numbers around 12! = {factorial_12}")

# Test multiples of 12! from 1*12! to 3*12!
for m in range(1, 4):
    N = m*factorial_12
    if test_N(N):
        print(f"N = {N} passes conditions")

# Test a few values below 12! to see if any smaller satisfy the condition (to verify minimality)
for offset in range(-10, 1):
    N = factorial_12 + offset
    if N > 0 and test_N(N):
        print(f"N = {N} (near 12!) passes conditions")

print(f"Minimal candidate (from test) is probably {factorial_12}")
```
