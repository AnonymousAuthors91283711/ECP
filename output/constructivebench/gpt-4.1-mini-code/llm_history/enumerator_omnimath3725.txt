The problem considers a set \( s \) of 2009 points in the plane, split into blue and red subsets with sizes \( k \) and \( 2009-k \) respectively. Each blue point must have exactly two red points exactly distance 1 away. We want the largest possible \( k \).

We will try small \( |s| \) and enumerate possible values of \( k \) satisfying the conditions. We focus on constructing small examples to guess the maximal \( k \) and print all allowed \( k \).

```python
from itertools import combinations
import math

def dist(p, q):
    return math.dist(p, q)

def unit_circle_points_around(p, reds):
    # count red points distance exactly 1 from p
    return sum(abs(dist(p, r)-1) < 1e-9 for r in reds)

def check(k, s):
    # s is points set; enumerate all red subsets with size len(s)-k
    n = len(s)
    for red_indices in combinations(range(n), n - k):
        red = [s[i] for i in red_indices]
        blue = [s[i] for i in range(n) if i not in red_indices]
        if len(blue) != k:
            continue
        # check condition: each blue point has exactly 2 red points at distance 1
        if all(unit_circle_points_around(bp, red) == 2 for bp in blue):
            print(f"k={k}, red={red}, blue={blue}")
            return True
    return False

# We test small sets s with distinct rational coordinates on a grid,
# to keep code and output small.

print("Testing small samples to conjecture k for |s|=4")
s4 = [(0,0),(1,0),(0,1),(1,1)]  # square size 1 edges

for k in range(1,5):
    found = check(k, s4)
    if found:
        print(f"Possible k={k} for set {s4}")

print("Testing small samples to conjecture k for |s|=6")
s6 = [(0,0),(2,0),(1,math.sqrt(3)),(1,0.5),(0.5,math.sqrt(3)/2),(1.5,math.sqrt(3)/2)]
# roughly two equilateral triangles and midpoints
for k in range(1,7):
    found = check(k, s6)
    if found:
        print(f"Possible k={k} for set {s6}")

# Output conjecture for |s|=2009: guess maximum k might not exceed 2 * 2009 since each blue needs 2 red neighbors

print("Conjecture: For large |s|=2009, maximal k seems bounded by half of |s| or less.")
