The problem involves fractional calculations and remainders. We want to explore the expression:

1 - 7/10 - (1/3) * (1 - 7/10)

This simplifies to:

Starting with 1 - 7/10 = 3/10,
Maria took (1/3) of that: (1/3)*(3/10) = 1/10,
Remaining is 3/10 - 1/10 = 2/10 = 1/5.

We can verify by enumerating these calculations exactly with rationals.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Enumerate fractions related to the problem
whole = Fraction(1, 1)
initial_taken = Fraction(7, 10)
remainder = whole - initial_taken
print("Remainder after taking 7/10:", remainder)

# Maria takes 1/3 of the remainder
maria_took = Fraction(1, 3) * remainder
print("Maria took:", maria_took)

# Final amount left
final = remainder - maria_took
print("Final remainder after Maria took her part:", final)
```
