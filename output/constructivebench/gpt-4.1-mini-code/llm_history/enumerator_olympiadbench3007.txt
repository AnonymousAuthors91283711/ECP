The problem involves taking the product over \( n = 1 \) to \( 2019 \) of the product of the digits of \( n \) after replacing any digit that is 0 or 5 with 1, and then finding the remainder modulo 1000.

The program below enumerates these products for numbers from 1 to 2019 and computes their product mod 1000, printing each intermediate product mod 1000 to follow progress.

```python
# Enumerate over n=1..2019:
# For each n, replace digits 0 or 5 by 1 and multiply the digits.
# Find the product of all such values modulo 1000.
# Print intermediate products mod 1000 to trace computation (streaming).
# Since the product grows very large, keep reducing modulo 1000 at each step.

def digits_modified_product(n):
    prod = 1
    for d in str(n):
        digit = int(d)
        if digit == 0 or digit == 5:
            digit = 1
        prod *= digit
    return prod

def main():
    mod = 1000
    product_mod = 1
    for n in range(1, 2020):
        val = digits_modified_product(n)
        product_mod = (product_mod * val) % mod
        # print intermediate product mod 1000
        print(f'n={n}, val={val}, product_mod={product_mod}')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
