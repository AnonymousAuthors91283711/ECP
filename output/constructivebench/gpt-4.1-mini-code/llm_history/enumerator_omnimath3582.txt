The problem defines a functional equation for \( f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \):

\[
f(f(y)) + f(x-y) = f(x f(y) - x)
\]

We want to enumerate possible functions \(f\) satisfying this. Since \(f\) could be complicated, try simple forms first:

1. Constant functions \(f(x) = c\).
2. Linear functions \(f(x) = ax + b\).
3. Powers or special test values.

We can fix some test points and verify the functional equation holds. The code samples some values to find candidates.

```python
# Enumerate candidate functions for f: R -> R satisfying
# f(f(y)) + f(x - y) = f(x * f(y) - x)
# by testing simple forms: constant and linear functions.

def check_constant(c):
    # Check equation for a few sample (x, y)
    # f(x) = c
    # Left: f(f(y)) + f(x - y) = c + c = 2c
    # Right: f(x * f(y) - x) = f(x * c - x) = c
    # So 2c == c => c=0 only
    if 2 * c == c:
        print(f'Constant function f(x) = {c} satisfies equation.')

def check_linear(a, b):
    # f(x) = a x + b
    # Check equation for some sample (x, y)
    # f(f(y)) + f(x - y) = f(x * f(y) - x)
    # f(f(y)) = f(a y + b) = a (a y + b) + b = a^2 y + a b + b
    # f(x - y) = a(x - y) + b = a x - a y + b
    # Left = a^2 y + a b + b + a x - a y + b = a^2 y + a b + b + a x - a y + b
    # = a x + (a^2 y - a y) + (a b + 2b)
    # = a x + y (a^2 - a) + a b + 2 b
    # Right:
    # f(x * f(y) - x) = f(x (a y + b) - x) = f(x a y + x b - x) = a (x a y + x b - x) + b
    # = a^2 x y + a b x - a x + b
    # Equate coefficients left and right:
    # Coefficient of x y: right: a^2, left: 0 => implies a^2=0?
    # Wait left has no x y term, right does.
    # So for equality pointwise:
    # No x y term on left, implies a^2=0 => a=0.
    # Then linear reduces to constant f(x)=b.
    # From constant above, only f=0 should work.
    # Let's verify that by testing.

    for x in range(-3, 4):
        for y in range(-3, 4):
            left = a**2 * y + a * b + b + a * x - a * y + b
            right = a**2 * x * y + a * b * x - a * x + b
            if left != right:
                # Not satisfied, fail early
                return
    print(f'Linear function f(x) = {a}x + {b} satisfies equation.')

# Test constant functions
for c in range(-2, 3):
    check_constant(c)

# Test linear functions with a, b in small ranges
for a in [-1, 0, 1]:
    for b in [-1, 0, 1]:
        check_linear(a, b)
```
