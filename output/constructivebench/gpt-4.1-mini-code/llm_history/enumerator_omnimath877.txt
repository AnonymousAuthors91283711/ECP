The problem seems to ask for determining the supremum (sSup) of the set {x ∈ ℤ | |x * Z| ≤ 5}, where Z = 2 is given. Since x is an integer, this reduces to finding all integers x such that |2x| ≤ 5, i.e., |x| ≤ 2 (because 2*3=6 >5). Then, the supremum over these integers is 2.

To verify and enumerate the candidates in Python, we will test integers x with |2x| ≤ 5, print them, and output the supremum (max value).

```python
# Enumerate integers x with |2x| ≤ 5 and find supremum

Z = 2
bound = 5

print(f"Testing Z = {Z}, bound = {bound}")
candidates = []
# Since |2x| <= 5, |x| <= 2; check integers in range -3 to 3
for x in range(-3, 4):
    val = abs(x * Z)
    if val <= bound:
        print(f"x = {x}, |x*Z| = {val} <= {bound}")
        candidates.append(x)

if candidates:
    supremum = max(candidates)
    print(f"Supremum of {{x ∈ ℤ | |x * {Z}| ≤ {bound}}} is {supremum}")
else:
    print("No candidates found.")
```
