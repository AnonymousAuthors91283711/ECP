The problem involves counting the number of integers \( x \) such that \( \frac{5}{7} < x < \frac{28}{3} \).

The task is to enumerate all such integers explicitly, printing each, and finally print the count.

Since this inequality involves non-integer bounds, our program will:
- Calculate the integer bounds (strictly greater than 5/7 and strictly less than 28/3).
- Enumerate integers \( x \) between these bounds.
- Print each integer \( x \).
- Print the total count at the end as the conjectured answer.

```python
# Enumerate integers x where 5/7 < x < 28/3 and count them

def main():
    from fractions import Fraction
    
    lower = Fraction(5, 7)
    upper = Fraction(28,3)

    # The integers x must satisfy: x > 5/7 and x < 28/3
    # So x >= ceil(5/7 + epsilon) == 1 (since 5/7 ~0.714)
    # And x <= floor(28/3 - epsilon) == 9 (since 28/3 ~9.333)
    start = int(lower) + 1  # start from 1
    end = int(upper)        # floor(9.333) == 9

    count = 0
    for x in range(start, end +1):
        # Check inequalities strictly
        if lower < x < upper:
            print(x)
            count += 1
    print("Count:", count)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
