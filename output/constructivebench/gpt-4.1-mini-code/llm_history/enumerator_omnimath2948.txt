The equation to solve is 2x + 6 = 16. We can enumerate values of x from 0 upward and check which satisfy this equation, then output x + 4. Finally, output the answer for omnimath2948_answer.

```python
# Enumerate x satisfying 2*x + 6 = 16 and print x+4
for x in range(20):
    if 2*x + 6 == 16:
        print(f"x={x}, x+4={x+4}")
        omnimath2948_answer = x + 4
        print(f"omnimath2948_answer = {omnimath2948_answer}")
        break
```
