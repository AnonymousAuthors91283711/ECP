The problem is to find the smallest integer \( k \) such that there exist nonnegative integers \( a,b,c,d,e,f \) satisfying:
- \( a+b=26 \)
- \( a+b+c+d=41 \implies c+d=15 \)
- \( a+b+c+d+e+f=57 \implies e+f=16 \)
and
- \( k \) is the count of even numbers among \( a,b,c,d,e,f \).

We want to enumerate all tuples \((a,b,c,d,e,f)\) that satisfy these conditions and print the number of even numbers each tuple has, to conjecture the minimum possible \( k \).

```python
# Enumerate all nonnegative integers a,b,c,d,e,f with given sums:
# a+b=26, c+d=15, e+f=16
# For each tuple, count how many are even and print the count and values found.

def is_even(x):
    return x % 2 == 0

def count_even(t):
    return sum(is_even(x) for x in t)

def main():
    min_even = 7  # max possible evens is 6, so start higher to track min
    for a in range(27):
        b = 26 - a
        if b < 0:
            continue
        for c in range(16):
            d = 15 - c
            if d < 0:
                continue
            for e in range(17):
                f = 16 - e
                if f < 0:
                    continue
                t = (a,b,c,d,e,f)
                evens = count_even(t)
                print(f"evens={evens}, tuple={t}")
                if evens < min_even:
                    min_even = evens
    print(f"Minimal even count found: {min_even}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
