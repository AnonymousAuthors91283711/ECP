The problem seems to deal with sequences \(a_n\) within the interval \((0,d)\) that partition \([0,d]\) into subintervals with lengths bounded by \(1/n\) for each \(n\), and the goal is to find the least upper bound of all such \(d\).

To get insights, the program enumerates candidates for \(d\) in a small range and tries to construct sequences \(a_n\) for small \(n\) that satisfy the constraints approximately, checking if such sequences exist. It will print viable \(d\) values and the sequences found to assist conjecture formation.

```python
# Enumerate candidate d in [0.1, 3] steps 0.1
# For each d, for small n (1 to 5), attempt to construct sequence a_n meeting the interval conditions:
# - a[n] strictly in (0,d), increasing
# - partitions [0,d]
# - each subinterval length <= 1/n
# If such sequences exist for all n up to 5, print d and the sequences
# This hints at the supremum d for which such sequences exist.

def feasible_sequence(d, n):
    # Attempt to build a sequence a of length n with 0 < a[0] < ... < a[n-1] < d
    # satisfying subintervals length <= 1/n and a covering [0,d].
    # The subintervals are:
    # [0,a0], [a0,a1],..., [a_n-2,a_n-1], [a_n-1,d]
    # All lengths ≤ 1/n
    # Check if d ≤ 1 (from all subintervals sum)
    segment_len = 1 / n
    if d > segment_len * (n + 1):
        # d too large to have intervals ≤ 1/n
        return None
    # Try equal-spaced partition:
    # But we have n+1 intervals, so total length ≤ (n+1)/n >1. But d can be larger than 1.
    # The problem requires intervals ≤ 1/n, so maximal d = (n+1)/n
    # We'll try equal segments length = d/(n+1), no interval > 1/n
    interval_len = d / (n + 1)
    if interval_len > 1 / n:
        return None
    a = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        a.append(interval_len * i)
    # Check strict inclusion (a_i in (0,d)) is guaranteed
    # For uniqueness check, they are strictly increasing
    return a
