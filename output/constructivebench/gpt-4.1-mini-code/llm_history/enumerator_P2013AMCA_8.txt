The problem appears to involve real numbers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( x \neq 0 \), \( y \neq 0 \), \( x \neq y \), and satisfying the equation
\[
x + \frac{2}{x} = y + \frac{2}{y}.
\]
We want to find the value of \( xy \) in terms of \( x \) and \( y \).

A direct algebraic approach leads to a quadratic or rational relation. To assist in conjecturing the explicit formula, we enumerate possible \( (x, y, xy) \) triples for sample values of \( x, y \neq 0 \) with \( x \neq y \), checking the equation.

We'll try rational values on a small grid, print valid triples (only those satisfying the equation closely with some tolerance), and print the found \( xy \).

```python
# Enumerate rational x, y values (non-zero, distinct)
# Check x + 2/x == y + 2/y approximately
# Print (x, y, x*y) when condition holds
# Goal: conjecture a formula for xy from x, y data.

from fractions import Fraction

def approx_equal(a, b, tol=1e-10):
    return abs(a - b) < tol

vals = [Fraction(n, d) for n in range(-5, 6) for d in range(1, 6) if d != 0]
vals = [v for v in vals if v != 0]  # exclude zero

seen_answers = set()

print("Enumerating (x, y, xy) with x+2/x = y+2/y and x != y:")

for x in vals:
    for y in vals:
        if x == y:
            continue
        lhs = x + Fraction(2, 1) / x
        rhs = y + Fraction(2, 1) / y
        if lhs == rhs:
            xy = x * y
            if xy in seen_answers:
                continue
            seen_answers.add(xy)
            print(f"x={x}, y={y}, xy={xy}")

# From printed values, one can form conjectures about the relation for xy.
```
