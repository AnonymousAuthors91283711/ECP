The problem asks to characterize all nonzero integers \( k \) for which the quadratic equation \( kx^2 + 6x + k = 0 \) has two distinct real roots. We analyze the quadratic discriminant and identify all such integers \( k \). The program prints all nonzero integers \( k \) within a reasonable range that satisfy the condition.

```python
# Searching for integers k != 0 such that kx^2 + 6x + k = 0 has two distinct real solutions
# Discriminant D = 36 - 4*k*k, solutions are distinct iff D > 0
# Hence: 36 - 4*k^2 > 0  =>  4*k^2 < 36  =>  k^2 < 9  =>  -3 < k < 3, k !=0, k integer
# So, k in {-2,-1,1,2}
# Let's enumerate k in range -5..5 excluding 0 and check condition

def has_two_distinct_real_roots(k):
    D = 36 - 4 * k * k
    return D > 0

print("Enumerating all nonzero integers k with two distinct real roots for kx^2 + 6x + k = 0:")
candidates = []
for k in range(-5, 6):
    if k == 0:
        continue
    if has_two_distinct_real_roots(k):
        candidates.append(k)
        print("k =", k)

print("\nAll candidates found:")
print(sorted(candidates))
print("\nMinimum candidate:", min(candidates))
print("Maximum candidate:", max(candidates))
```
