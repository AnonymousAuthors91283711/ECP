Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: Nat.choose (300 + 3 - 1) (3 - 1)
<<<True>>>
The problem asks for the number of triples (a, b, c) of natural numbers that satisfy a + b + c = 300. This is a classic "stars and bars" combinatorics problem, where the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation x₁ + x₂ + ... + x_k = n is given by C(n + k - 1, k - 1). 

In this case:
- n = 300 (the total sum)
- k = 3 (the number of variables a, b, c)

The proposed answer correctly applies this formula: C(300 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(302, 2). This matches the standard combinatorial solution for counting the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation a + b + c = 300. Therefore, the proposed answer is correct.
