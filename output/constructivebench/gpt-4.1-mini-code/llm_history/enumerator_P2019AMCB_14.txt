The problem is about the set \( S = \{ d > 0 : d \mid 100000 \} \) consisting of positive divisors of 100000, and the set of all products \( p = d_1 \times d_2 \) where \( d_1, d_2 \in S \), \( d_1 \neq d_2 \). The goal is to count how many distinct such products exist.

To explore this, I'll:
- Enumerate divisors of 100,000.
- For each pair \(d_1, d_2\), \(d_1 \neq d_2\), compute the product.
- Collect unique products and count them.
- Print each product as found, then print the total count.

Since \(100000 = 10^5 = 2^5 \times 5^5\), it has \((5+1)(5+1) = 36\) divisors, so the search is manageable.

```python
def divisors(n):
    divs = []
    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divs.append(i)
            if n // i != i:
                divs.append(n // i)
    return sorted(divs)

def main():
    n = 100000
    S = divisors(n)
    print(f"Divisors of {n} ({len(S)} total):", S)
    products = set()
    # Enumerate unordered pairs with d1 != d2 to avoid duplicates
    for i, d1 in enumerate(S):
        for j in range(i+1, len(S)):
            d2 = S[j]
            p = d1 * d2
            if p not in products:
                products.add(p)
                print(p)
    print("Number of distinct products p = d1*d2 for d1 != d2 in S:", len(products))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
