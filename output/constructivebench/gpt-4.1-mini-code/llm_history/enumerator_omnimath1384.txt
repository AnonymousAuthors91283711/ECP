The problem involves complex polynomials and roots, asking for the ratio \( \frac{P(1)}{P(-1)} \) under given conditions. We cannot solve it directly but can enumerate over small-degree analogues to conjecture the value of this ratio. We'll try smaller degree versions of the polynomial \( f = X^n + 17 X^{n-1} + 1 \) with \( n = 2,3,4,5 \), find roots numerically, form the transformed roots \( r + \frac{1}{r} \), construct polynomial \( P \) with these roots, and compute \( P(1)/P(-1) \). This should reveal a pattern.

We will:
- Use sympy for polynomial and roots.
- For \( n = 2,3,4,5 \), build \( f = X^n + 17 X^{n-1} + 1 \).
- Find roots numerically.
- Form roots \( s_i = r_i + 1/r_i \).
- Build monic polynomial \( P \) with roots \( s_i \).
- Compute \( P(1)/P(-1) \), print it as exact or approximate value.

Limit enumerations to minimize output length.

# Enumerate small degree analogues to conjecture ratio P(1)/P(-1)
import sympy as sp

X = sp.Symbol('X')

    f = X**n + c*X**(n-1) + 1
    # find roots numerically
    roots = sp.nroots(f, n=15)
    return roots

def p_from_roots(roots):
    # Given roots, construct minimal polynomial with those roots
    # roots here are s = r + 1/r
    # We use sp.poly with roots
    return sp.poly(sp.prod(X - r for r in roots), X, domain='QQ')
