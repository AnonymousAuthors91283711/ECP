theorem P2011AMCA_4 :
  let third := 4
  let fourth := 2
  let fifth := 1
  (third * 12 + fourth * 15 + fifth * 10) / (third + fourth + fifth) = P2011AMCA_4_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 88 / 7
Proposed Answer: (4 * 12 + 2 * 15 + 1 * 10) / (4 + 2 + 1)
Let's evaluate the proposed answer step by step:

Numerator: (4 * 12 + 2 * 15 + 1 * 10) = (48 + 30 + 10) = 88
Denominator: (4 + 2 + 1) = 7

So the proposed answer simplifies to 88/7, which matches exactly with the ground truth answer.

<<<True>>>
