[write_program]
The problem seems to ask for the value(s) of \(x > 0\) such that \(\frac{x}{100} \cdot x = 4\), i.e., \( \frac{x^2}{100} = 4 \). Thus, \(x^2 = 400\), so the positive solution is \(x = 20\).

To enumerate and verify solutions, I'll write a Python program to check positive real numbers up to some reasonable range for when \(\frac{x}{100} \times x = 4\). Since this is a continuous problem, I'll discretize \(x\) in small steps and print those \(x\) for which the equality holds exactly (with tolerance for floating point) or very closely.

```python
import math

# The equation is (x/100)*x = 4 => x^2 = 400 => x=20 (positive)
# Enumerate candidate x in a range around 20 to find solutions
# We will print the candidate solutions found

def is_close(a, b, tol=1e-9):
    return abs(a - b) < tol

def main():
    print("Enumerating x for (x/100)*x = 4 with 0 < x <= 30")
    step = 0.01
    x = step
    while x <= 30:
        val = (x / 100) * x
        if is_close(val, 4):
            print(f"x = {x:.5f}, (x/100)*x = {val:.10f}")
        x += step
    # Since exact square root of 400 is 20, let's print it explicitly:
    x_exact = 20.0
    val_exact = (x_exact / 100) * x_exact
    print(f"Exact solution: x = {x_exact}, (x/100)*x = {val_exact}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
