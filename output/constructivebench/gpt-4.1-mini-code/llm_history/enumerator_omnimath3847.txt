The problem involves finding all functions \( g: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \) such that for every \( m, n \in \mathbb{N} \), the number \((g(m) + n)(g(n) + m)\) is a perfect square.

To assist in conjecturing the form of all such functions, the Python program below:
- Enumerates explicit functions from a small domain like \(\{0,1,2\}\) to a small range (e.g., 0 to 4).
- Tests if the condition holds for all pairs \((m,n)\) in \(\{0,1,2\}\).
- Prints the functions passing this check immediately.

This approach potentially highlights patterns or candidate functions for the solution set `omnimath3847_answer`.

```python
# enumerator.py
from math import isqrt

def is_square(x):
    if x < 0:
        return False
    r = isqrt(x)
    return r*r == x

# We'll try functions g from {0,1,2} -> {0,...,4} (small sample to guess)
domain = [0,1,2]
range_max = 4

def check_g(g):
    # Check for all m,n in domain whether (g(m)+n)*(g(n)+m) is a perfect square
    for m in domain:
        for n in domain:
            val = (g[m]+n)*(g[n]+m)
            if not is_square(val):
                return False
    return True

from itertools import product

print("Enumerating functions g: {0,1,2} -> {0..4} satisfying the condition...")
count = 0
for values in product(range(range_max+1), repeat=len(domain)):
    g = list(values)
    if check_g(g):
        print("Valid g:", g)
        count += 1
print(f"Total valid functions found: {count}")
```
