The problem involves enumerating paths on the 4-dimensional hypercube (vertices are 0-1 vectors of length 4) indexed by Fin 5 with certain properties:
- s 0 = 0 vector (all zeros)
- s 4 = 1 vector (all ones)
- consecutive vertices differ by an edge (differ in exactly one coordinate)
- consecutive vertices are not equal

We want to enumerate all such sequences s: Fin 5 â†’ vertices that start at 0000, end at 1111, with each adjacent pair differing in exactly one bit, and which are strictly different.

This is essentially enumerating 5-step paths from 0000 to 1111 on the 4D hypercube graph, which differ by edges in each step.

We can write a program to:
- represent vertices as 4-bit integers (0..15)
- edges: differ in exactly one bit (Hamming distance = 1)
- find all 5-long sequences (5 vertices with indices 0..4), s.t.
  s0 = 0 (0b0000)
  s4 = 15 (0b1111)
  adjacent entries differ by exactly one bit
- enumerate and print all such sequences

We will print each sequence found directly in bitstring form, then print the total number at the end.

```python
# Enumerate 5-long paths on 4D hypercube from 0000 to 1111 with consecutive vertices differing by one bit

def neighbors(v):
    # vertices differing from v in exactly one bit (flip each bit)
    nbrs = []
    for i in range(4):
        nbr = v ^ (1 << i)
        nbrs.append(nbr)
    return nbrs

start = 0  # 0000 binary
end = 15   # 1111 binary

paths = []

def dfs(path):
    if len(path) == 5:
        if path[-1] == end:
            # Print path as bitstrings
            print(' -> '.join(f'{v:04b}' for v in path))
            paths.append(path[:])
        return
    last = path[-1]
    for nxt in neighbors(last):
        if nxt != path[-1]:  # consecutive different (always true here)
            # No explicit restriction on repeats beyond consecutive 
            dfs(path + [nxt])

dfs([start])
print(f'Total paths found: {len(paths)}')
```
