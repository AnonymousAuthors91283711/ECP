This problem appears to relate to finding the minimum radius \( r \) such that a certain condition involving time and net water intake is met. The constants hint at a scenario where time to shore is 15 minutes (1 mile at 4 mph means 1/4 hour), then converted to minutes (15), and the inequality \((10 - r) \times t' \leq 30\) involves net water intake capped at 30 gallons.

To explore this, I will enumerate candidate values for \( r \) in a small range [0, 10], checking the inequality for incrementally increasing \( r \), and print all those that satisfy it, then identify the minimum. Since the problem is continuous and involves real numbers, I'll sample with a small step (0.01) to approximate the minimal \( r \).

```python
# Enumerate values of r from 0 to 10 with step 0.01
# Compute (10 - r)*15 and print those for which it is ≤30.
# Print all candidates, then the minimum value.

step = 0.01
r_values = []
t_prime = 15  # minutes

print("Enumerating candidates r where (10 - r)*15 <= 30:")
r = 0.0
while r <= 10:
    net_water = (10 - r)*t_prime
    if net_water <= 30:
        print(f"r = {r:.2f}, net water = {net_water:.2f} ≤ 30")
        r_values.append(r)
    r += step

if r_values:
    min_r = min(r_values)
    print(f"\nMinimum r satisfying the condition: {min_r:.2f}")
else:
    print("No r in [0,10] satisfies the condition.")
```
