Ground Truth Answer: {0, -1, -3/2}
Proposed Answer: {x : ℝ | x = -3 ∨ x = -1 ∨ x = 0}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves solving a logarithmic equation with multiple constraints on x.

2. The ground truth answer gives three specific solutions: {0, -1, -3/2}

3. The proposed answer gives a different set: {x : ℝ | x = -3 ∨ x = -1 ∨ x = 0}

Key differences:
- The proposed answer includes x = -3 which is not in the ground truth
- The proposed answer is missing x = -3/2 which is in the ground truth
- Both include x = -1 and x = 0

Checking x = -3:
- Substituting x = -3 into the original equation would make logb(5*(-3)+9) undefined since 5*(-3)+9 = -6 ≤ 0
- Therefore x = -3 should not be a solution

Checking x = -3/2:
- This is a valid solution that satisfies all conditions but is missing from the proposed answer

Conclusion: The proposed answer is incorrect as it includes an invalid solution (-3) and misses a valid one (-3/2).
