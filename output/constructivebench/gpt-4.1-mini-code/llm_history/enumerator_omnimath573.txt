[write_program]
The problem involves finding the maximal winning probability given three boxes with known characteristics and a strategy function s mapping pairs of Fin 2 to Bool. To assist, the program enumerates all possible Boolean strategies (there are 2^(2*2) = 16 total) for the inputs (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1), computes the corresponding winning probability for the given boxes configuration, prints each probability found (as a rational), and finally prints the maximum winning probability found. This helps conjecture the supremum, which matches the provided calculation (1 + 1 + 0.5)/3 = 5/6.

```python
# Enumerate all Boolean strategies for s: Fin 2 × Fin 2 → Bool (4 inputs each 0 or 1)
# Inputs considered only for boxes: (0,0), (1,1), (0,1)
# Winning probabilities: 
# (1/3)* (if s(0,0) then 1 else 0) + (1/3)* (if s(1,1) then 1 else 0) + (1/3)* (if s(0,1) then 1/2 else 0)
# Print all values found immediately, then max.

from fractions import Fraction

# all inputs s(d1,d2) for d1, d2 in {0,1}
# total of 4 inputs; each input 0 or 1 -> 2^4=16 strategies
max_p = Fraction(0,1)
for mask in range(16):
    # Extract bits for s(0,0), s(0,1), s(1,0), s(1,1)
    # We'll only use s(0,0), s(0,1), s(1,1)
    s_00 = (mask >> 0) & 1
    s_01 = (mask >> 1) & 1
    s_10 = (mask >> 2) & 1  # unused for boxes, but part of domain
    s_11 = (mask >> 3) & 1

    # Compute winning probability per provided formula
    p = Fraction(1,3)*s_00 + Fraction(1,3)*s_11 + Fraction(1,3)*Fraction(1,2)*s_01

    print(f"Strategy mask {mask:04b}: win_prob = {p}")

    if p > max_p:
        max_p = p

print(f"Maximum winning probability found: {max_p}")
```
