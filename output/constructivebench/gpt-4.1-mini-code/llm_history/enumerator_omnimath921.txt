The problem asks for the number of subsets \( S \) of \( \text{Fin }2014 \times \text{Fin }4 \) such that the cardinality of the image of the first coordinate (projection to \(\text{Fin }2014\)) has odd size.

We will:
- Work with smaller parameters \(n\) (instead of 2014) and \(k\) (instead of 4),
- Enumerate all subsets of \( \text{Fin }n \times \text{Fin }k \),
- Calculate the set of first coordinates appearing in \(S\),
- Check if the size of that projection is odd,
- Print all intermediate counts for a few small pairs \((n, k)\).

This enumeration grows exponentially, so we restrict to small \( n,k \leq 4 \).

from itertools import chain, combinations, product

def powerset(iterable):
    "powerset([1,2,3]) -> () (1,) (2,) (3,) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3) (1,2,3)"
    s = list(iterable)
    return chain.from_iterable(combinations(s, r) for r in range(len(s)+1))

def count_odd_projection_subsets(n, k):
    """
    Count subsets S of Fin n x Fin k for which
    the size of projection on first coordinate is odd.
    """
    universe = list(product(range(n), range(k)))
    count = 0
    for subset in powerset(universe):
        if not subset:
            # empty set has projection set size 0, not odd
            continue
        # projection on first coordinate
        proj = set(x for x,_ in subset)
        if len(proj) % 2 == 1:
            count += 1
            # print each valid subset size or content as partial result (summarize to avoid overflow)
            print(f"Valid subset size: {len(subset)}, projection size: {len(proj)}")
    print(f"Total valid subsets with odd projection size (n={n}, k={k}): {count}\n")
    return count

    # Test small examples
    for n in [2,3]:
        for k in [2,3]:
            print(f"--- n={n}, k={k} ---")
            count_odd_projection_subsets(n, k)
