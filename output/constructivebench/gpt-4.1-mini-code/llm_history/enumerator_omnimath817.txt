The problem seems to ask for the count of integers \( n \) from 2 to 100 for which \((n-2)!\) is not divisible by \( n \). Equivalently, we want to find how many \( n \in [2,100] \) satisfy \( n \nmid (n-2)! \).

Wilson's theorem and related properties suggest that for primes \( p \), \((p-1)! \equiv -1 \mod p\), but here we have \((n-2)!\) instead, so this is a slightly different scenario.

I will enumerate all \( n \in [2,100] \) and check if \((n-2)!\) modulo \( n \) is zero or not, printing each \( n \) for which it is NOT divisible. Then, print the total count at the end.

This can help conjecture the behavior, e.g., whether primes or composites correspond to the property.

```python
from math import factorial

def main():
    count = 0
    # Precompute factorials up to 98 for efficiency
    fact = [1]*(99)
    for i in range(1,99):
        fact[i] = fact[i-1]*i

    print("n where n does NOT divide (n-2)! for n in [2..100]:")
    for n in range(2,101):
        val = fact[n-2] % n
        if val != 0:
            print(n)
            count += 1
    print("Total count:", count)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
