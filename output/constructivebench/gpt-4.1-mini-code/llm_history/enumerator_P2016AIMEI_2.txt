The problem involves computing a sum of joint probabilities where probabilities are proportional to k for k = 1 to 6, then finding the simplified fraction m/n and their sum m+n. We'll enumerate the sum explicitly, compute the fraction in lowest terms, and print the fraction together with m+n. Since k ranges from 1 to 6, we limit the sum accordingly.

```python
from math import gcd

# prob(k) = k for k=1..6, else 0
prob = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6]

total_weight = sum(prob)  # sum 1..6 = 21

# norm_prob(k) = prob(k)/total_weight
norm_prob = [p / total_weight for p in prob]

# Compute sum over x=0..6 of joint_prob(x,7-x)
# joint_prob(a,b) = norm_prob[a]*norm_prob[b]
# norm_prob[0] = 0 so terms with x=0 or 7 are zero
# So x ranges from 1 to 6

numerator = 0
denominator = total_weight * total_weight

for x in range(1,7):
    a = prob[x]
    b_index = 7 - x
    b = prob[b_index] if b_index <= 6 else 0
    numerator += a * b

# The sum is numerator / denominator (total_weight^2)
# numerator is integer sum of prob[x]*prob[7-x] over x=1..6

# Reduce fraction numerator/denominator
g = gcd(numerator, denominator)
m = numerator // g
n = denominator // g

print(f"Sum numerator/denominator = {m}/{n}")
print(f"m + n = {m + n}")
```
