The problem involves iterating a function that sums the cubes of the digits of a number many times. The goal is to find the value of applying the digit cube sum function 2005 times to the number 2005.

To explore this, we can simulate the iteration for various initial numbers and iteration counts, printing intermediate results to conjecture the fixed points or cycles reached.

```python
def digit_cubes_sum(n):
    return sum(int(d)**3 for d in str(n))

def iterate_digit_cubes_sum(n, k):
    current = n
    for i in range(1, k+1):
        current = digit_cubes_sum(current)
        print(f"Iteration {i}, value = {current}")
        # Usually these sequences stabilize quickly; if so, no need to continue grazing.
        # We stop early if a fixed point is reached.
        if i > 1 and current == previous:
            break
        previous = current
    return current

def test_samples():
    samples = [2005, 1, 153, 370, 371, 407, 0, 9999]
    for n in samples:
        print(f"Starting with n = {n}")
        current = n
        previous = None
        for i in range(1, 20):
            current = digit_cubes_sum(current)
            print(f"  Iter {i}: {current}")
            if current == previous:
                print(f"  Fixed point reached at iteration {i}: {current}")
                break
            previous = current
        print("---")

def main():
    print("Iterating digit cubes sum starting at 2005 for 20 steps:")
    current = 2005
    previous = None
    for i in range(1, 21):
        current = digit_cubes_sum(current)
        print(f"Step {i}: {current}")
        if current == previous:
            print(f"Sequence stabilizes at {current} after {i} iterations.")
            break
        previous = current
    else:
        print(f"No stabilization detected after 20 iterations; last value {current}")

    print("\nRunning sample tests on diverse inputs:")
    test_samples()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
