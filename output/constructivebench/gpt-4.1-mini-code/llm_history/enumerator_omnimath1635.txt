The problem asks to determine the least positive integer \( n \) such that no multiple of \( n \) is representable as a sum of 100 powers of 2 (with exponents given by functions \( a \) from a 100-element set to natural numbers). We want to find the minimal \( n > 0 \) for which the set \(\{ m \cdot n \mid m \in \mathbb{N} \}\) contains no "fancy" number (i.e., no sum of exactly 100 powers of 2).

To explore this, the program will:

- Enumerate sums \(\sum_{i=1}^{100} 2^{a_i}\) where \(a_i\) are nonnegative integers.
- Since the order of \(a_i\) does not affect the sum, but permutations do not change sums, we consider nondecreasing sequences \((a_0 \le a_1 \le \cdots \le a_{99})\) to avoid duplicates.
- We will generate sums for reasonably small exponent ranges to catalog "fancy" numbers.
- For sample values of \( n \) (e.g., up to small limits), check if any multiple of \( n \) up to a threshold appears in these fancy numbers.
- Print each potential candidate \( n \) for which no multiple appears.
- Finally, print the smallest such \(n\).

Due to combinatorial explosion, a direct brute force for all possible \(a\) is impossible, but exploring sums where exponents are all equal or vary in a narrow range may provide candidates to conjecture the true answer.

```python
# Enumerate sums of the form sum_{i=1}^{100} 2^{a_i} with a_i in [e_min, e_max]
# We consider nondecreasing exponents to avoid duplicates.

def gen_fancy_sums(e_min, e_max):
    # For simplicity, consider sequences where all exponents are equal or form "blocks"
    # to cover some representative sums
    # All equal: sum = 100 * 2^e
    # Also, sums with 50 exponents e and 50 exponents e+1: sum = 50*2^e + 50*2^{e+1}
    # and variations with small offsets for coverage

    fancy = set()
    for e in range(e_min, e_max+1):
        s = 100 * (2**e)
        fancy.add(s)
    for e in range(e_min, e_max):
        s = 50*(2**e) + 50*(2**(e+1))
        fancy.add(s)
    # add some triples with 33,33,34 counts for slightly more coverage
    for e in range(e_min, e_max-1):
        s = 33*(2**e) + 33*(2**(e+1)) + 34*(2**(e+2))
        fancy.add(s)
    return fancy

def multiples_check(n, fancy, limit):
    # Check if there is any multiple m*n <= limit in fancy
    m = 1
    while m*n <= limit:
        if m*n in fancy:
            return True
        m += 1
    return False

def main():
    e_min, e_max = 0, 7  # sample small exponent ranges
    fancy = gen_fancy_sums(e_min, e_max)
    limit = max(fancy)*2  # checking multiples up to this value
    print(f"Generated {len(fancy)} fancy sums with exponents {e_min} to {e_max}")
    candidates = []
    for n in range(1, 50):
        has_multiple = multiples_check(n, fancy, limit)
        if not has_multiple:
            print(f"Candidate n = {n}: no multiple in fancy sums up to {limit}")
            candidates.append(n)
    if candidates:
        print(f"Minimal n with no multiple fancy sum: {min(candidates)}")
