Given the high-school level subtraction problem "943 - 87", the program will simply compute this difference and print it. It also prints the intermediate steps for better insight, demonstrating enumeration (here trivial since it's direct subtraction).

```python
# Compute and enumerate intermediate values for 943 - 87

def subtract(a, b):
    print(f"Starting subtraction: {a} - {b}")
    
    # For enumeration, show each decrement from 943 down by 1, 87 times
    current = a
    for i in range(b):
        current -= 1
        print(f"After subtracting {i+1}, value is {current}")
    
    return current

def main():
    a = 943
    b = 87
    print(f"Parameters: a={a}, b={b}")
    answer = subtract(a, b)
    print(f"Final answer (943 - 87) = {answer}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
