[write_program]
The problem defines a function \( f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \) with:
- \( f(1) = 1 \)
- If \( n > 0 \) and \( n \) is even, then \( f(n) = f(n/2) \)
- If \( n > 1 \) and \( n \) is odd, then \( f(n) = f(n-1) + 1 \)

We want to find \( f(50) \).

We will write a Python program to compute \( f(n) \) for \( n \leq 50 \) using the recurrence and print values to assist conjecturing the function's behavior.

```python
# Compute f(n) based on given rules:
# f(1) = 1
# if n even > 0: f(n) = f(n//2)
# if n odd > 1: f(n) = f(n-1) + 1

def f(n, memo={1:1}):
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    if n % 2 == 0:
        memo[n] = f(n//2)
    else:  # n odd and n>1
        memo[n] = f(n-1) + 1
    # Print each computed value immediately
    print(f"f({n}) = {memo[n]}")
    return memo[n]

def main():
    # Compute and print f(n) for n=1 to 50
    print("Computing f(n) for n=1 to 50:")
    for i in range(2, 51):
        f(i)

    # Explicitly output f(50)
    print(f"\nAnswer: f(50) = {f(50)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
