The problem is to find positive integers \(m,n\) that are coprime, satisfy \(\frac{m}{n} = \frac{2}{5} + \frac{8}{25}\), and then find all such pairs and their sums \(m+n\). Since the fraction sum is \(\frac{18}{25}\), we want to find coprime pairs \((m,n)\) with \(m/n = 18/25\). But fractions can be scaled, so to keep \(m,n\) integral with ratio \(18/25\), \(m = 18k\) and \(n = 25k\) for some positive integer \(k\). The pair \((18k,25k)\) is coprime only if \(k=1\) because 18 and 25 are coprime. Then \(m+n = 43\). So the answer seems to be 43, but let's write a program to verify and enumerate all possible \(m,n\) up to a limit.

```python
# Enumerate pairs (m,n) with positive integers m,n, gcd=1, m/n=2/5+8/25=18/25.
# Verify sum m+n for such pairs and print them.

from math import gcd

# Target fraction numerator and denominator
target_num = 2*25 + 8*5  # 2/5 + 8/25 -> common denominator 25: (2*5 + 8) / 25 = 18/25
target_den = 25

def is_equals_fraction(m, n):
    return m * target_den == n * target_num

max_k = 10  # We'll check multiples up to 10 to ensure no hidden solutions.

for k in range(1, max_k + 1):
    m = target_num * k
    n = target_den * k
    if gcd(m, n) == 1 and is_equals_fraction(m, n):
        print(f"Found coprime pair: m={m}, n={n}, sum={m+n}")

print("Minimum sum m+n:", target_num + target_den)
```
