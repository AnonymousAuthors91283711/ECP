abbrev omnimath3269_answer : Set (Polynomial ℝ × Polynomial ℝ) := sorry
theorem omnimath3269 (p q : Polynomial ℝ) :
    (∀ x : ℝ, eval x (p * q.comp (X + 1) - p.comp (X + 1) * q) = 1) ↔ (p, q) ∈ omnimath3269_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating pairs (p,q) of degrees <= 1 with coefficients in [-3..3]:. Expected Answer Type: Set (Polynomial ℝ × Polynomial ℝ)
<<<
{(p, q) | ∃ a b c d r : ℝ, (p = C a + C b * X) ∧ (q = C c + C d * X) ∧ (a * (c + d) - c * (a + b) = r) ∧ (b * d = 0) ∧ (∀ x, eval x (p * q.comp (X + 1) - p.comp (X + 1) * q) = r)}
