Ground Truth Answer: 11/6
Proposed Answer: (5 : ℚ) / 6
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is calculating the expected number of matches between the first 5 dice rolls and the 6th dice roll in a sequence of 6 fair dice rolls.

2. For each of the first 5 dice, the probability it matches the 6th die is 1/6 (since the dice are independent and fair).

3. By linearity of expectation, the expected number of matches is the sum of expectations for each of the first 5 dice matching the 6th, which is 5 * (1/6) = 5/6.

4. The ground truth answer claims 11/6, which would be incorrect as it's more than 1 match expected per die.

5. The proposed answer of 5/6 correctly follows from the linearity of expectation argument.
