The problem asks for the number of 3-element subsets \( s \) from the set \(\{1,\ldots,6\} \times \{1,\ldots,6\}\) such that any two distinct elements in \( s \) have different first coordinates and different second coordinates. Another way to view this condition is choosing 3 elements that form a partial matching in a 6x6 grid with no two sharing a row or column.

We want to enumerate all such sets \( s \), for example by picking 3 distinct rows and 3 distinct columns and permuting columns among rows to form these sets.

The program will:
- Pick 3 rows out of 6
- Pick 3 columns out of 6
- Permute the selected columns among the selected rows
- Each such matching of 3 pairs satisfies the condition.
- Count and print each set size-wise and then print the total count at the end.

```python
from itertools import combinations, permutations

N = 6
k = 3

total = 0
rows_list = list(combinations(range(N), k))
cols_list = list(combinations(range(N), k))

for rows in rows_list:
    for cols in cols_list:
        # Permute columns over fixed rows to create sets of pairs
        for perm in permutations(cols):
            s = {(rows[i], perm[i]) for i in range(k)}
            print(s)
            total += 1

print("Total number of sets with the property:", total)
```
