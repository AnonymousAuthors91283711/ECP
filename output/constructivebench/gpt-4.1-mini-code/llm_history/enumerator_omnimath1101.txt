The problem is to find the number of triples \((k,m,n)\) with \(k,m,n \leq 100\) satisfying the equation
\[ 2^m n - 2^n m = 2^k. \]

We will enumerate all triples \((k,m,n)\) in the given range and check the equation exactly. We print each triple satisfying the equation immediately and count them. At the end, we print the total count as the conjectured answer.

```python
# Enumerate triples (k,m,n) with k,m,n ≤ 100 satisfying
# 2^m * n - 2^n * m = 2^k.
# Print each triple when found and count total solutions.

def main():
    limit = 100
    count = 0
    pow2 = [1 << i for i in range(limit+1)]  # Precompute 2^i for efficiency
    
    for m in range(limit+1):
        for n in range(limit+1):
            lhs = pow2[m]*n - pow2[n]*m
            if lhs <= 0:
                continue  # RHS=2^k >0, so lhs must be positive
            # Check if lhs is a power of two and if k ≤ limit
            # Check if lhs is power of two: lhs & (lhs - 1) == 0
            if lhs & (lhs - 1) == 0:
                # Find k as log2(lhs)
                k = lhs.bit_length()-1
                if k <= limit:
                    print(f"(k,m,n) = ({k},{m},{n}) with 2^{m}*{n} - 2^{n}*{m} = 2^{k}")
                    count += 1
    print("Total solutions:", count)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
