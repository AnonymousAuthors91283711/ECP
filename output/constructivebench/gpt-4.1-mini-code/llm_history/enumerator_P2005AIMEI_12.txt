The problem involves counting how many values \( n \leq 2005 \) make \( S(n+1) \) odd or even, where:
\[
S(n) = \sum_{k=1}^{n} d(k)
\]
and \( d(k) \) is the number of divisors of \( k \).

Key observations:
- \( d(k) \) is odd iff \( k \) is a perfect square.
- So the parity of \( S(n) \) is the parity of the count of perfect squares up to \( n \).

We want to enumerate \( n \) in range \( 1..2005 \), compute parity of \( S(n+1) \), count odds and evens, then print the counts and their difference.

```python
# Enumerate parity of sum of divisor counts for n up to 2005
# Since d(k) is odd iff k is a perfect square,
# parity of S(n) = parity of count of perfect squares â‰¤ n.

MAX_N = 2005

def count_perfect_squares(x):
    # Count perfect squares <= x
    return int(x**0.5)

odd_count = 0
even_count = 0

print(f"n\tS(n+1)%2")
for n in range(1, MAX_N + 1):
    # S(n+1) parity = parity of count of squares <= n+1
    c = count_perfect_squares(n + 1)
    parity = c % 2
    if parity == 1:
        odd_count += 1
    else:
        even_count += 1
    print(f"{n}\t{parity}")

print(f"Odd count: {odd_count}")
print(f"Even count: {even_count}")
print(f"|Odd - Even| = {abs(odd_count - even_count)}")
```
