[write_program]
The problem defines an 8x8 grid with a base case of 1s on the top row and left column, and each other cell is the sum of all cells above and to the left (strictly) of it. We want to find grid[7][7].

We'll write a Python program to compute this grid, printing cells as they are computed, and finally print the answer for grid[7][7].

```python
def main():
    n = 8
    # Initialize grid with zeros
    grid = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]
    
    # Set base cases: first row and first column to 1
    for i in range(n):
        grid[0][i] = 1
        grid[i][0] = 1
    
    # Compute the rest according to the rule:
    # grid[i][j] = sum of grid[k][l] for k < i and l < j
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(1, n):
            s = 0
            for k in range(i):
                for l in range(j):
                    s += grid[k][l]
            grid[i][j] = s
            print(f"grid[{i}][{j}] = {s}")
    
    print(f"Answer: grid[7][7] = {grid[7][7]}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
