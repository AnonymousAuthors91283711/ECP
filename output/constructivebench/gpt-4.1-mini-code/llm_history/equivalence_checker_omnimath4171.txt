Ground Truth Answer: ∅
Proposed Answer: {(1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 0), (2, 1), (18, 7)}
Let me analyze this carefully:

1. The problem is asking for integer solutions (x,y) to the equation (x^7 - 1)/(x - 1) = y^5 - 1.

2. The ground truth answer claims there are no solutions (empty set).

3. The proposed answer suggests 5 potential solutions.

Let's test the proposed solutions:

- For (1,0): Left side becomes 0/0 (undefined), so invalid
- For (0,-1): Left side = 1, right side = -2 → doesn't satisfy
- For (0,0): Left side = 1, right side = -1 → doesn't satisfy
- For (2,1): Left side = 127, right side = 0 → doesn't satisfy
- For (18,7): Left side is extremely large, right side is 16806 → doesn't satisfy

The ground truth is correct - none of the proposed solutions actually work, and there appear to be no valid integer solutions. The proposed answer is incorrect.

<<<False>>>
