theorem omnimath257 (n : ℕ) (h : 1 < n) :
  (∃ (a : ℕ → ℤ), (∀ k, a k ≠ 0) ∧ (∀ k, ∑ i in Finset.range n, (i + 1) * a ((i + 1) * k) = 0)) ↔ n ∈ omnimath257_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Trying n=2 with sequence length 4 and constraints k=1..2
No sequence found for n=2 in tested range
Trying n=3 with sequence length 9 and constraints k=1..3
Skipping n=3 due to large length 9
