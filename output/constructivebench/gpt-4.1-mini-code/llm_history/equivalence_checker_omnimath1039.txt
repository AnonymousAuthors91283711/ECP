theorem omnimath1039 :
  ∑ j in Finset.range 2014, (1 : ℚ) / ((j.succ : ℚ)^2014 * ∏ i in (Finset.range 2014).erase j, ((i.succ : ℚ)^2014 - (j.succ : ℚ)^2014)) = omnimath1039_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 1 / (Nat.factorial 2014 : ℚ)^2014
Proposed Answer: (1 : ℚ) / (2014 : ℚ) ^ 2014
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves a complex summation over j from 0 to 2013 (Finset.range 2014) with a denominator that includes a product term.

2. The ground truth answer involves the factorial of 2014 raised to the 2014th power in the denominator.

3. The proposed answer has simply 2014 raised to the 2014th power in the denominator.

The key difference:
- (2014!)^2014 grows much faster than 2014^2014 (since 2014! is approximately (2014/e)^2014 * √(2π*2014) by Stirling's approximation)
- The factorial term suggests the answer involves permutations or combinations, while the proposed answer is much simpler

Given that the ground truth involves factorial while the proposed answer doesn't, and considering the complexity of the original sum, these answers are not equivalent.
