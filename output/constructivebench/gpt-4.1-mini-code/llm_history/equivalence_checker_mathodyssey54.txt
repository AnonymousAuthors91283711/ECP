Ground Truth Answer: fun x y => 2 * x^2 + y^2
Proposed Answer: fun x y => 2 * (x ^ 2) + y ^ 2
<<<True>>>

The proposed answer and ground truth answer are mathematically equivalent. The only difference is the explicit parentheses in the proposed answer, which don't change the order of operations since exponentiation has higher precedence than multiplication in standard mathematical notation. Both expressions represent the same function: 2 times x squared plus y squared.
