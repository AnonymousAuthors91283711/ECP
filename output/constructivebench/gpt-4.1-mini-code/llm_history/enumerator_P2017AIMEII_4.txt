The problem seems to be counting integers from 1 to 2017 that have no digit equal to zero in their decimal representation. We want to enumerate all such numbers and count them.

We'll:
- Iterate over numbers 1 to 2017.
- Check their digits.
- Print the number immediately if it has no zero digit.
- Keep a count and print the final count at the end.

This will help conjecture the final answer.

```python
# Enumerate numbers from 1 to 2017 without any zero digit; print each and count total.

def has_no_zero_digit(n):
    return '0' not in str(n)

def main():
    limit = 2017
    count = 0
    for num in range(1, limit + 1):
        if has_no_zero_digit(num):
            print(num)
            count += 1
    print("Count:", count)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
