The enumerated solution pattern strongly suggests the answer set consists of all positive triples where x = y = z. To represent this in Lean as a set, we use set comprehension with a conjunction `x = y ∧ y = z ∧ x > 0` ensuring strictly positive equal triples.

The syntax error in your original is caused by `{ (a, a, a) | a : ℕ // a > 0 }`, which incorrectly attempts to use subset notation (`//`) inside a set comprehension. Instead, use `Set` notation with `Set` in Lean: `{ (x, y, z) | x = y ∧ y = z ∧ x > 0 }`.

This correctly describes the set of all positive triples with equal components.
