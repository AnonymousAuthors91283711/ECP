[write_program]
This problem involves maximizing the expression \( z = x^2 + xy + 2y^2 \) subject to the constraint \( x^2 - xy + 2y^2 = 8 \) with \( x, y > 0 \). To explore candidates for the maximum, we can:

1. Enumerate positive rational approximations for \( x \) and \( y \).
2. Test whether they satisfy the constraint (approximately, within a tolerance).
3. Compute \( z \) for those points.
4. Track the largest \( z \) found.

We will print \( (x, y, z) \) for all candidates near the constraint. Since exact solutions may be difficult, the program will sample values systematically and print results as found.

```python
import math

# Constraint: x^2 - x*y + 2*y^2 = 8, x, y > 0
# Objective: Maximize z = x^2 + x*y + 2*y^2

def close_to_constraint(x, y, tol=1e-5):
    return abs(x**2 - x*y + 2*y**2 - 8) < tol

def main():
    best_z = -math.inf
    # Sample positive x,y in a reasonable range
    # Since x^2 and y^2 are involved, max x,y ~ sqrt(8) ~ 3
    step = 0.05
    x_vals = [i*step for i in range(1, int(3/step)+1)]
    y_vals = x_vals
    
    print("Candidates meeting constraint (x, y, z):")
    for x in x_vals:
        for y in y_vals:
            if close_to_constraint(x, y):
                z = x**2 + x*y + 2*y**2
                print(f"x={x:.3f}, y={y:.3f}, z={z:.6f}")
                if z > best_z:
                    best_z = z
    print(f"Approximate maximum z found: {best_z:.6f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
