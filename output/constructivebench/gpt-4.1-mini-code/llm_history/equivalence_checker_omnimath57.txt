Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: let u : ℕ → ℕ := fun x => (2 * x - 1)^2
{p : ℕ × ℕ | ∃ k : ℕ, k > 0 ∧ (p = (u k, u (k + 1)) ∨ p = (u (k + 1), u k))}
<<<None>>>
Since the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's intentionally left undefined in Lean), we cannot compare it with the proposed answer. The proposed answer defines a specific set of pairs based on a function u, but without knowing the actual ground truth, we cannot determine equivalence. Therefore, the answer is None (unsure about equivalence).
