The problem involves real numbers \( a, b \) with certain conditions and a relation involving logarithms. Our task is to investigate the value of \(\frac{\log b}{\log a}\) given:

1. \(0 < a \neq 1\)
2. \(0 < b\)
3. \(\log (a^2) > 0\)
4. \(2 \pi \log (a^2) = \log (b^4)\)

Notice:
- \(\log (a^2) = 2 \log a > 0 \implies \log a > 0 \implies a > 1\)
- From the equation \(2 \pi \log (a^2) = \log (b^4)\), we get \(2 \pi \cdot 2 \log a = 4 \log b \Rightarrow 4 \pi \log a = 4 \log b \Rightarrow \log b = \pi \log a\)
- Thus \(\frac{\log b}{\log a} = \pi\)

We want to check this numerically for sample values of \(a\) and \(b\) satisfying the conditions to observe the ratio \(\frac{\log b}{\log a}\).

The following Python program tests a few \(a > 1\), computes \(b\) from the given equation, and prints \(\frac{\log b}{\log a}\) to confirm it approaches \(\pi\).

```python
import math

print("Enumerating (a, b) and ratio log(b)/log(a) for samples satisfying conditions:")

for a_multiplier in [2, 3, 10]:
    a = a_multiplier
    log_a = math.log(a)
    # From 2 * pi * log(a^2) = log(b^4)
    # log(b^4) = 4 * log(b)
    # So 4*log(b) = 2*pi * 2 * log(a) = 4 * pi * log(a)
    # => log(b) = pi * log(a)
    log_b = math.pi * log_a
    b = math.exp(log_b)
    ratio = log_b / log_a
    print(f"a={a:.5f}, b={b:.5f}, log(b)/log(a) = {ratio:.10f}")

print("\nConjecture: log(b)/log(a) = Ï€")
```

This approach respects the conditions and confirms the ratio equals \(\pi\) numerically.
