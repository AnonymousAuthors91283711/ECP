The problem involves a function `omnimath3464_answer(n)` defined on integers `n`, which produces an integer output, and a conjecture or theorem that for every integer `n`, `omnimath3464_answer(n)` is odd. Since the function is unspecified (`sorry`), we cannot directly prove the theorem, but we can attempt to enumerate values for sample integers to observe the parity of the output.

We will:
- Define a placeholder function `omnimath3464_answer(n)` with some sample behaviors to explore possibilities.
- Enumerate `n` over a range of integers, compute `omnimath3464_answer(n)`.
- Print the values, focusing on parity (oddness).
- Use small sample values, e.g., from -5 to 5.
  
Since the exact function is missing, we must simulate a range of executable possibilities. For demonstration, we will assume some polynomial or arithmetic forms and print outputs, emphasizing oddness detection. This will assist in conjecturing patterns that might lead to a proof.

```python
# Sample enumerator for possible function outputs and parity testing.

def omnimath3464_answer(n):
    # Placeholder: test multiple candidate functions to guess properties.
    # We try a few formulas:
    # 1. f(n) = 2n + 1 (always odd)
    # 2. f(n) = n^2 + n + 1 (often odd)
    # 3. f(n) = n^3 + 3 (various parity)
    # To simulate different behaviors, cycle among these:
    if n % 3 == 0:
        return 2 * n + 1
    elif n % 3 == 1:
        return n * n + n + 1
    else:
        return n * n * n + 3

def is_odd(x):
    return x % 2 == 1

def main():
    print("n\tomnimath3464_answer(n)\tOdd?")
    for n in range(-5, 6):
        val = omnimath3464_answer(n)
        odd = is_odd(val)
        print(f"{n}\t{val}\t{odd}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
