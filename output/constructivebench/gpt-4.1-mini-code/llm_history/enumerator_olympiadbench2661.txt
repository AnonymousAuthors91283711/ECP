The problem is to find the least natural number \(K\) such that \(4 \times 3 \times 2 \times K \geq 70\). Since \(4 \times 3 \times 2 = 24\), the inequality simplifies to \(24K \geq 70\), so we want the smallest \(K \in \mathbb{N}\) with \(24K \geq 70\).

The program will enumerate natural numbers \(K\) starting from 1, check the inequality, print the candidates meeting the condition, and finally output the least such \(K\).

```python
# Enumerate natural numbers K to find least K with 4*3*2*K >= 70
def main():
    product = 4 * 3 * 2  # 24
    threshold = 70
    print(f"Looking for least K with {product} * K >= {threshold}")

    for K in range(1, 10):  # small range to cover candidates
        value = product * K
        if value >= threshold:
            print(f"K = {K} => {product} * {K} = {value} >= {threshold}")
            print(f"Least such K is {K}")
            break
        else:
            print(f"K = {K} => {value} < {threshold}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
