Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: 2
Since the problem is about finding the cardinality of a solution set for a given equation with constraints, and the proposed answer is "2" (suggesting there are exactly 2 pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions), but the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's not provided for comparison), I cannot verify the equivalence.

The problem appears to be a competition-level math problem, and without the actual ground truth answer or more information about the solution set, I cannot determine if the proposed answer is correct, partially correct, or incorrect.
