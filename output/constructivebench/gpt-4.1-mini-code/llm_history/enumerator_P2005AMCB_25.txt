This problem involves counting valid moves of ants on the vertices of an octahedron, where each ant has 4 choices (adjacent vertices). We want to enumerate valid functions from vertices to vertices respecting adjacency and count how many satisfy certain properties.

We will model the octahedron's vertices as numbers 0 to 5, define adjacency sets, then enumerate all functions f : vertices → vertices where f(v) ∈ adj(v). For each such function, we print it, count total and successful outcomes (defined by the problem's combinatorial condition), and then print results.

```python
# Enumerate functions f: vertices -> vertices with f(v) in adj(v)
# Vertices = {0,...,5}
# Octahedron adjacency:
# Each vertex connects to exactly 4 others (not itself or one opposite vertex)
# For octahedron:
# vertices: 0-5
# opposite pairs: (0,1), (2,3), (4,5)
# adjacency: each vertex connected to all except itself and opposite

def adj(v):
    opposites = {0:1,1:0,2:3,3:2,4:5,5:4}
    return [x for x in range(6) if x != v and x != opposites[v]]

def main():
    vertices = range(6)
    choices = [adj(v) for v in vertices]
    total_outcomes = 1
    for c in choices:
        total_outcomes *= len(c)  # should be 4^6 = 4096
    
    successful = 0
    # According to problem commentary: successful_outcomes = 5*4^4 = 1280
    # Let's try to find functions f with no collisions or some property:
    # The problem likely counts functions with no collisions or some configuration,
    # but since it's not given, we enumerate all and print for pattern recognition.
    
    from itertools import product
    count = 0
    for f in product(*choices):
        # Print each function immediately
        print(f"f: {f}")
        # (Optional) check some property here. For example, unique images (ant destinations) count:
        if len(set(f)) == 6:  # injectivity - each ant goes to distinct vertex
            successful += 1
            print(f"  (injective)")

        count += 1
        if count >= 20:  # limit output to avoid excess tokens
            break

    print(f"Total outcomes (should be 4^6): {total_outcomes}")
    print(f"Successful outcomes found (distinct images): {successful}")
    # Below is the problem's known count:
    print(f"Given successful outcomes from problem statement: 5*4^4 = {5*4**4}")

    main()
