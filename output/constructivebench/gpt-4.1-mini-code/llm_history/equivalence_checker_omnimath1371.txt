Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {x : ℝ | ∃ A B : ℝ, A + B = 1 ∧ (∀ n : ℕ, A * 2^n + B * (-3)^n > 0) ∧ x = A * 2^(2007) + B * (-3)^(2007)}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer captures the general form of solutions to the recurrence relation (a linear combination of 2^n and (-3)^n terms), and correctly includes the initial condition A+B=1. However, it's missing the crucial constraint that must hold for all n (not just n=2007) - the positivity condition ∀n, a' n > 0. The proposed answer includes a positivity condition, but it's not immediately clear that this form exactly matches all possible solutions that satisfy the original problem's constraints. The answer is close but needs verification that the positivity condition is equivalent to the original problem's hapos condition.
