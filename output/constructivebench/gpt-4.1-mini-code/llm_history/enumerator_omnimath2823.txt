[write_program]
The given problem suggests simplifying the expression \(\frac{5-2}{2+1}\) which is \(\frac{3}{3}\). This evaluates to 1. To align with the instructions, we can write a program that enumerates values for numerator and denominator in small ranges, computes the fraction, and prints the simplified result. This helps to conjecture that \(\frac{3}{3} = 1\).

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Enumerate numerator and denominator in a small range including values around given ones
for numerator in range(0, 6):
    for denominator in range(1, 6):
        val = Fraction(numerator, denominator)
        # Print the fraction and its evaluation as a fraction (exact)
        print(f"({numerator})/({denominator}) = {val} = {float(val):.4f}")

# Enumerate specifically around numerator=5-2 and denominator=2+1
num = 5 - 2
den = 2 + 1
val = Fraction(num, den)
print(f"Exact value for (5-2)/(2+1): {val} = {float(val):.4f}")
```
