Total subsets: 262144
Good subsets (sum mod 3 = 0): 87424
gcd(87424, 262144) = 128
Reduced fraction: 683 / 2048. Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ
<<<(683, 2048)>>>
Explanation: The count of subsets of {1..18} whose sum is divisible by 3 is 87424, total subsets 2^18=262144. Their gcd is 128, reducing fraction to 683/2048. Hence P2018AIMEI_12_answer = (683, 2048).
