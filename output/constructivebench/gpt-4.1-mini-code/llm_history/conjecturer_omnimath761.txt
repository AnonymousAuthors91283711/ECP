Formula value at n=14: 421. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The error happens because omnimath761_answer was declared to be a natural number (ℕ), but the proposed answer is a function ℕ → ℕ. The problem asks for the cardinality after 14 iterations: ncard ((T^[14] {(0, 0)})) = omnimath761_answer, a natural number. So we don't need a function, just the number at n=14.

From the enumerated answers, the sizes match the formula:
size(n) = 2 * n * (n + 1) + 1.

Plug in n=14:
2 * 14 * 15 + 1 = 2 * 210 + 1 = 421.

Hence the final answer is 421.

<<<421>>>
