[write_program]
The problem is to study the values of the function 
\[ A(a,b,c) = \frac{2 - a^3}{a} + \frac{2 - b^3}{b} + \frac{2 - c^3}{c} \]
under the constraints \(a,b,c > 0\) and \(a + b + c = 3\), and find its minimum value.

To explore this, I'll enumerate triples \((a,b,c)\) with positive rational values summing to 3, calculate \(A(a,b,c)\), and track candidates for the minimum. Because the problem is symmetric and smooth, I'll discretize \(a\) and \(b\) and set \(c = 3 - a - b\) for efficiency.

The program prints each found value and finally prints the minimal value found. I'll use small step size to keep output size reasonable.

```python
# Enumerate (a,b,c) with a,b,c > 0 and a+b+c=3, compute A(a,b,c), print values, find minimum
def A(a,b,c):
    # Avoid division by zero
    if a <= 0 or b <= 0 or c <= 0:
        return None
    return (2 - a**3)/a + (2 - b**3)/b + (2 - c**3)/c

step = 0.2
n = int(3/step)+1

min_val = None
min_triplet = None

print("Enumerating values for A(a,b,c) with a,b,c > 0 and a+b+c=3 (step=0.2):")

for i in range(1, n):  # a from 0.2 up to 3-step
    a = i*step
    for j in range(1, n):
        b = j*step
        c = 3 - a - b
        if c <= 0:
            continue
        val = A(a,b,c)
        if val is None:
            continue
        print(f"a={a:.1f}, b={b:.1f}, c={c:.1f}, A={val:.6f}")
        if (min_val is None) or (val < min_val):
            min_val = val
            min_triplet = (a,b,c)

print("\nMinimum value found:")
print(f"A_min = {min_val:.6f} at (a,b,c) = ({min_triplet[0]:.3f}, {min_triplet[1]:.3f}, {min_triplet[2]:.3f})")
```
