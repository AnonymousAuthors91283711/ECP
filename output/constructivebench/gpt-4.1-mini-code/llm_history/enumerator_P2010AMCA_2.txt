The problem seems to involve finding the greatest integer n equal to the sum âˆ‘_{i=0}^5 (100 - i). Since the summation index runs from 0 to 5, it's a fixed sum of six integers starting from 100 down to 95. We'll compute this sum and then print it as a candidate answer.

```python
# Compute sum of 6 terms: 100, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95
total = 0
for i in range(6):
    term = 100 - i
    print(f"Term {i}: {term}")
    total += term
print(f"Sum of terms: {total}")
```
