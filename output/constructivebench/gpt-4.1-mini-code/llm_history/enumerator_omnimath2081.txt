The problem asks to find the least value of the set \(\{y \mid \exists x \in \mathbb{R}, y = f^{[4]}(x) \}\), where \(f(x) = x^2 + 6x + 7\) and \(f^{[4]}\) is the fourth iterate of \(f\), i.e., \(f\) composed with itself 4 times.

The goal is to enumerate and approximate the values of \(f^{[n]}(x)\) for various \(x\) and \(n=4\), try to find possible least values, and conjecture the minimum. We will:
- Implement \(f\)
- Implement iteration \(f^{[n]}(x)\)
- For various \(x\) in a small range, compute \(f^{[4]}(x)\), print values
- Then output the approximate minimal value found.

We rely on exact arithmetic as far as possible or float approximations when needed and print immediately.

```python
# enumerator.py
def f(x):
    return x*x + 6*x + 7

def iterate_f(x, n):
    for _ in range(n):
        x = f(x)
    return x

def main():
    print("Enumerating f^{[4]}(x) for x in range(-10 to 10 by 0.5):")
    values = []
    xs = [i*0.5 for i in range(-20, 21)]  # x from -10 to 10 step 0.5
    for x in xs:
        y = iterate_f(x, 4)
        print(f"f^{4}({x}) = {y}")
        values.append(y)
    min_y = min(values)
    print(f"\nMinimum value found for f^{4}(x) over tested x: {min_y}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
