The problem is to find all real numbers \( x \) with \( 0 < x < 360 \) satisfying the equation:
\[
\sqrt{3} \cos(10^\circ) = \cos(40^\circ) + \sin(x^\circ).
\]

We will enumerate \( x \) in the range \( 1^\circ \) to \( 359^\circ \), compute the right side for each \( x \), and check if it matches the left side value exactly or approximately (due to floating-point precision). We print every \( x \) that meets the condition closely, then summarize the solutions.

```python
import math

# Define constants
left_val = math.sqrt(3) * math.cos(math.radians(10))

print(f"Left side value: {left_val:.10f}")

# We'll allow a small tolerance for floating point comparisons
tolerance = 1e-10

solutions = []

for x in range(1, 360):
    right_val = math.cos(math.radians(40)) + math.sin(math.radians(x))
    if abs(right_val - left_val) < tolerance:
        print(f"Solution found: x = {x} degrees")
        solutions.append(x)

if solutions:
    print("\nAll solutions found:")
    for sol in solutions:
        print(sol)
else:
    print("No integer-degree solutions found within tolerance.")
```
This enumerates possible integer solutions in degrees, streaming partial results immediately and identifying solutions conforming to the given equation.
