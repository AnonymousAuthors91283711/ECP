The problem is to find the least natural number \( c > 0 \) such that there exist distinct \( a, b \) with \( 42 \mid a \), \( 72 \mid b \), all distinct from \( c \), and \( a, b, c \) form a triangle (triangle inequality).

We try small values of \( c \) and enumerate \( a, b \) multiples of 42 and 72, respectively, checking the conditions.

```python
# Find the minimal c > 0 such that there exist distinct a,b distinct from c,
# with 42 | a, 72 | b and a,b,c satisfy triangle inequalities.

def multiples(n, limit):
    # Generate multiples of n up to limit for efficiency
    m = n
    while m <= limit:
        yield m
        m += n

MAX_C = 500  # Search up to 500 for demonstration

found_answers = []

for c in range(1, MAX_C+1):
    # We want to find a,b distinct, all distinct from c, with 42|a,72|b
    # and triangle inequalities:
    # a + b > c, a + c > b, b + c > a
    # Also distinctness: a != b, b != c, a != c
    # We'll search a,b in reasonable range [42, 3*MAX_C]
    limit_ab = 3*MAX_C
    for a in multiples(42, limit_ab):
        if a == c:
            continue
        for b in multiples(72, limit_ab):
            if b == c or a == b:
                continue
            if (a + b > c) and (a + c > b) and (b + c > a):
                print(f"Candidate c={c} with a={a}, b={b}")
                found_answers.append(c)
                break
        else:
            continue
        break

if found_answers:
    minimal_c = min(found_answers)
    print(f"Minimal c found: {minimal_c}")
else:
    print("No suitable c found up to", MAX_C)
```
