The problem involves a polynomial \( P \) over the reals satisfying, for all x: 
\[ P(x) = P(0) + P(1) \cdot x + P(2) \cdot x^2. \]

Also given is \( P(-1) = 1 \).

Our goal is to find (or enumerate) possible values of \( P(3) \).

Since the relation holds for all real \( x \), this implies that \( P \) coincides with the polynomial \( Q(x) = P(0) + P(1) x + P(2) x^2 \) for all \( x \). So \( P = Q \). Since \( Q \) is quadratic, \( P \) must be quadratic or of degree â‰¤ 2.

The given condition \( P(-1) = 1 \) gives one equation on \( P(0), P(1), P(2) \):
\[
P(-1) = P(0) + P(1)(-1) + P(2)(-1)^2 = 1.
\]

So:
\[
P(0) - P(1) + P(2) = 1.
\]

The value to find is
\[
P(3) = P(0) + 3 P(1) + 9 P(2).
\]

We want to find all triples \((a,b,c) = (P(0), P(1), P(2))\) satisfying
\[
a - b + c = 1
\]
and print the corresponding \( P(3) = a + 3 b + 9 c \).

Since \( a, b, c \) are real values, \( P(3) \) can vary infinitely. But we want to enumerate some sample values by choosing some rational \( a,b \), then getting \( c = 1 - a + b \).

Let's pick \( a, b \) from a small integer range, say \(-2, -1, 0, 1, 2\), compute \( c \), then print:

\( P(3) = a + 3b + 9c = a + 3b + 9(1 - a + b) = a + 3b + 9 - 9a + 9b = 9 - 8a + 12b \).

Let's just enumerate over \( a, b \) in [-2,2], print \( a,b,c \) and \( P(3) \).

This will give insights on the range of \( P(3) \).

```python
# Enumerate possible (a,b) integers in [-2,2]
# Compute c = 1 - a + b
# Compute P(3) = a + 3b + 9c = 9 - 8a + 12b
# Print (a,b,c) and P(3)

def main():
    print("Enumerating candidates for P(3) given P(0)=a, P(1)=b, P(2)=c with a - b + c=1")
    print("Format: a, b, c, P(3)")
    for a in range(-2, 3):
        for b in range(-2, 3):
            c = 1 - a + b
            p3 = a + 3*b + 9*c  # Or use formula: 9 -8*a + 12*b
            print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, P(3)={p3}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
