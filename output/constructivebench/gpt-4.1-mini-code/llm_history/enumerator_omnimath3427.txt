The problem involves five natural numbers \(a,b,c,d,e\) with given inequalities and equalities. We want to find the greatest element among these five numbers under the given constraints. Since the exact form of the answer function is unknown (it's marked as `sorry`), we will enumerate integer tuples \((a,b,c,d,e)\) satisfying the constraints, print all values \(a,b,c,d,e\) and their maximum for verification, and conjecture the true answer. We prioritize exact values by working with integers.

Constraints from the question:
- \(b + d > a + d \implies b > a\)
- \(c + e > b + e \implies c > b\)
- \(b + d = c\)
- \(a + c = b + e\)

We choose small sample values (e.g., \(a,b,c,d,e\) in \([0..10]\)) to find feasible tuples.

```python
# Enumerate (a,b,c,d,e) in range 0..10 satisfying
# b > a, c > b, b + d = c, a + c = b + e and print sets and max values.

max_val_found = None
max_tuple = None

for a in range(11):
    for b in range(a+1, 11):  # b > a
        for c in range(b+1, 11):  # c > b
            # From b + d = c => d = c - b
            d = c - b
            if d < 0 or d > 10:
                continue
            # From a + c = b + e => e = a + c - b
            e = a + c - b
            if e < 0 or e > 10:
                continue
            # Check range for e and d
            tuple_vals = (a,b,c,d,e)
            vals_set = {a,b,c,d,e}
            x_max = max(vals_set)
            print(f"a={a} b={b} c={c} d={d} e={e} set={vals_set} max={x_max}")
            # Track global max value
            if max_val_found is None or x_max > max_val_found:
                max_val_found = x_max
                max_tuple = tuple_vals

print(f"\nCandidate greatest element is {max_val_found} from tuple {max_tuple}")
```
