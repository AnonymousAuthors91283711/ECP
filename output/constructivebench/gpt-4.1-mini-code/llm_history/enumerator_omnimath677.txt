The problem involves summing binomial coefficients \(\binom{n}{k}\) for \(k\) such that \(k \equiv 1 \pmod{3}\). We want to explore this sum for various \(n\) to conjecture a pattern or closed form, especially focusing on \(n=2003\).

The program enumerates \(n\) in a small range, computes the sum \(\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{n}{k}\) over \(k\) where \(k \equiv 1 \pmod{3}\), and prints results. This helps detect structure (e.g., in terms of powers, roots of unity sums).

```python
from math import comb

# Explore the sum of binomial coefficients \binom{n}{k} with k ≡ 1 (mod 3) for small n
print("n  sum_{k ≡ 1 mod 3} C(n,k)")
for n in range(10, 31):  # sample n values to detect pattern
    s = sum(comb(n, k) for k in range(n+1) if k % 3 == 1)
    print(f"{n} {s}")

# For n=2003
n = 2003
s_2003 = sum(comb(n, k) for k in range(n+1) if k % 3 == 1)
print(f"n={n}, sum for k ≡ 1 mod 3: {s_2003}")
```
