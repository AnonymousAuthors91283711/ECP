The problem asks to find all real numbers \( s \) such that \( 4s = 28 \). We want to enumerate possible values of \( s \) and confirm the solution.

```python
# Enumerate possible real s satisfying 4*s = 28
# We know the exact answer: s = 28/4 = 7
# We'll directly print this value as the primary solution
# and verify by enumeration around it.

print("Checking values of s for 4*s = 28:")

# Exact solution
s_exact = 28 / 4
print(f"Exact solution: s = {s_exact}")

# Enumerate candidate s in small integral range near exact solution
for s in range(5, 10):
    lhs = 4 * s
    if lhs == 28:
        print(f"s = {s} satisfies 4*s=28")

# Enumerate s with fractional values near 7 with step 0.25
step = 0.25
start = 6.5
end = 7.5
current = start
while current <= end:
    lhs = 4 * current
    if abs(lhs - 28) < 1e-9:
        print(f"s = {current} satisfies 4*s=28")
    current += step
```
