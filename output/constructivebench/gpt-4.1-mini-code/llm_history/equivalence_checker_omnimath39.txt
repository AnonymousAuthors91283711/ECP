Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {a : ℕ | a > 0 ∧ a ∣ 37}
<<<None>>>

Since the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's not provided), and the problem involves a complex mathematical condition about divisibility and set membership, I cannot determine whether the proposed answer {a : ℕ | a > 0 ∧ a ∣ 37} is equivalent to the actual solution. The problem appears to be about finding natural numbers a > 0 where certain conditions about divisibility by 37 hold for combinations of elements from a 6-element set of integers, but without knowing the correct answer, I cannot verify the equivalence.
