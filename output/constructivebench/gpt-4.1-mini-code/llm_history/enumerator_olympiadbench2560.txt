The problem is to find all real pairs \((x,y)\) satisfying the system
\[
\begin{cases}
x^2 - x y + 8 = 0, \\
x^2 - 8 x + y = 0.
\end{cases}
\]

We can solve for \(y\) from the second equation: \(y = 8x - x^2\). Substitute in the first:

\[
x^2 - x(8x - x^2) + 8 = 0 \implies x^2 - 8x^2 + x^3 + 8 = 0 \implies x^3 - 7x^2 + 8 = 0.
\]

We can enumerate all real roots of \(x^3 - 7x^2 + 8=0\) in a reasonable range and compute \(y\). Print integer candidates first and also rational approximations for any roots found.

```python
import math

def f(x):
    return x**3 - 7*x**2 + 8

def find_roots():
    # Check integers in range -2 to 8 (because polynomial changes sign near these)
    candidates = []
    for x in range(-2, 9):
        val = f(x)
        if val == 0:
            candidates.append(float(x))
            print(f"Exact integer root found: x={x}")
    # Check for sign changes to isolate roots for bisection
    roots = []
    intervals = []
    for a in range(-2, 8):
        if f(a)*f(a+1) < 0:
            intervals.append((a, a+1))
    # Bisection for roots in intervals
    for (a,b) in intervals:
        low, high = a, b
        for _ in range(30):  # ~1e-9 precision
            mid = (low+high)/2
            if f(low)*f(mid) <=0:
                high = mid
            else:
                low = mid
        root = (low+high)/2
        # check if root near integer already found
        if not any(abs(root - c) < 1e-6 for c in candidates):
            roots.append(root)
            print(f"Approximate root found by bisection: x={root:.9f}")
    return candidates + roots

def main():
    xs = find_roots()
    for x in xs:
        y = 8*x - x**2
        # Check if (x,y) satisfies first equation closely
        check = x**2 - x*y + 8
        if abs(check) < 1e-6:
            # Try to print exact values if x is integer or simple fraction
            if abs(x - round(x)) < 1e-12 and abs(y - round(y)) < 1e-12:
                print(f"Solution: x={int(round(x))}, y={int(round(y))}")
            else:
                print(f"Solution: x={x:.9f}, y={y:.9f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
