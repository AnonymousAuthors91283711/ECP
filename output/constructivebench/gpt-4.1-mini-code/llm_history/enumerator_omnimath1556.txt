The problem asks to find a polynomial \(P\) over the rationals with roots exactly \(\{ \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{2}, 2, 4 \}\), such that the product of its leading coefficient and the product of the roots is 1, the polynomial evaluated at 1 equals 1, and the polynomial evaluated at 0 equals some rational number (the unknown answer to find).

We want to find all such polynomials \(P\) and the corresponding value \(P(0)\). The roots determine that \(P(x) = a (x - \frac{1}{4})(x - \frac{1}{2})(x - 2)(x - 4)\) for some rational leading coefficient \(a\). The product of roots is \( \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 4 = 1\), so the leading coefficient \(a\) satisfies \( a \times 1 = 1 \implies a = 1 \).

Plugging in the condition \(P(1) = 1\) will verify the polynomial, but here \(a = 1\) fixed, we can then calculate \(P(0) = ?\).

I'll write a Python program to enumerate candidate polynomials (in our case just one) and compute \(P(0)\). We'll print the roots, the leading coefficient, and \(P(0)\).

```python
# Enumerate polynomials with roots 1/4, 1/2, 2, 4 over Q and leading coefficient a
# satisfying a * product(roots) = 1 and P(1) = 1.
from fractions import Fraction

roots = [Fraction(1,4), Fraction(1,2), 2, 4]
prod_roots = 1
for r in roots:
    prod_roots *= r  # Should be 1

# Leading coefficient a must satisfy a * prod_roots = 1 -> a = 1
a = Fraction(1,1) / prod_roots

print("Roots:", roots)
print("Product of roots:", prod_roots)
print("Leading coefficient a:", a)

# Define polynomial P(x) = a * product(x - r_i)
def P(x):
    val = a
    for r in roots:
        val *= (x - r)
    return val

# Check P(1)
val_at_1 = P(1)
print("P(1) =", val_at_1)

# Compute P(0)
val_at_0 = P(0)
print("P(0) =", val_at_0)
```
