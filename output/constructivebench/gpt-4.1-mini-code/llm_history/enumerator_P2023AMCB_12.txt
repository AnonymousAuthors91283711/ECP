[write_program]
The problem defines a custom complex operation and relates it to a condition involving the complex number z, its square, and a constant. To understand the possible values of |z| (the modulus of z) that satisfy the equation custom_op z z = z^2 + 40, I'll write a Python program that tries multiple complex numbers z (with integer real and imaginary parts within a small range) and checks when custom_op(z, z) equals z^2 + 40. Then I'll print the |z| for those matches.

```python
# Define custom_op(u,v) = re(u)*re(v) + im(u)*im(v)*1j
# Equation: custom_op(z,z) = z**2 + 40
# We want to find |z| where this holds. We'll search z = x + yj with -10 <= x,y <= 10.

def custom_op(u,v):
    return u.real*v.real + u.imag*v.imag*1j

def approximately_equal(a,b,eps=1e-9):
    return abs(a-b) < eps

found_moduli = set()

for x in range(-10,11):
    for y in range(-10,11):
        z = complex(x,y)
        left = custom_op(z,z)
        right = z**2 + 40
        if approximately_equal(left.real, right.real) and approximately_equal(left.imag, right.imag):
            modulus = abs(z)
            found_moduli.add(modulus)
            print(f"z = {z}, |z| = {modulus}")

# Print all distinct moduli found
print("All found |z| values (not necessarily unique):")
for m in sorted(found_moduli):
    print(m)
```
