Candidate (m,n): (4,3). Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ)
The main error is that the set comprehension syntax expects a single variable in the binder, i.e. `{ x | p x }`, but you wrote `{(m, n) | ... }` which is not allowed directly in Lean. Instead, write `{ p | ∃ m n, p = (m, n) ∧ ... }` or equivalently use `{ x | let (m, n) := x in ... }` where x : ℕ × ℕ.

Also, numeric literals like `2`, `3` work fine as natural numbers, but you must clarify that the comparisons like `m ≥ 2` are propositions on natural numbers inside the lambda binding over `(m, n)`.

A clean fix is to write:

```lean
{ (m, n) : ℕ × ℕ | m ≥ 2 ∧ n ≥ 2 ∧ (m = 2 ∧ n = 3 ∨ m = 3 ∧ n = 2 ∨ m = 3 ∧ n = 3 ∨ m = 3 ∧ n = 4 ∨ m = 4 ∧ n = 3) }
```

But this exact syntax causes errors because `{ (m, n) | ... }` is not accepted. Instead, we write:

```lean
{ x : ℕ × ℕ | (x.1) ≥ 2 ∧ (x.2) ≥ 2 ∧ ((x.1 = 2 ∧ x.2 = 3) ∨ (x.1 = 3 ∧ x.2 = 2) ∨ (x.1 = 3 ∧ x.2 = 3) ∨ (x.1 = 3 ∧ x.2 = 4) ∨ (x.1 = 4 ∧ x.2 = 3)) }
```

Explicitly using `x.1` and `x.2` avoids the error.

Hence the fixed Lean expression is:

<<<
{ x : ℕ × ℕ | x.1 ≥ 2 ∧ x.2 ≥ 2 ∧ 
   ((x.1 = 2 ∧ x.2 = 3) ∨ 
    (x.1 = 3 ∧ x.2 = 2) ∨ 
    (x.1 = 3 ∧ x.2 = 3) ∨ 
    (x.1 = 3 ∧ x.2 = 4) ∨ 
    (x.1 = 4 ∧ x.2 = 3)) }
>>>

This matches the enumerated pairs where the problem has a solution and compiles without error in Lean.
