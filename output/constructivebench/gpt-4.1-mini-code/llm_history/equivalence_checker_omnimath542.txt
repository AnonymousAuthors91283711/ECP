Ground Truth Answer: 320 * π / 180  -- Convert degrees to radians
Proposed Answer: 3 * π / 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find all x in (0, π) that satisfy the trigonometric equation:
   1 + sin x / sin (4x) = sin (3x) / sin (2x)
   and then sum these solutions.

2. The ground truth answer is 320π/180, which simplifies to 16π/9.

3. The proposed answer is 3π/4.

4. To verify, let's find the actual solutions:
   - The equation simplifies to sin(2x)sin(4x) + sin(x)sin(2x) = sin(3x)sin(4x)
   - Using trigonometric identities, we can find solutions at x = π/3 and x = 5π/9
   - Summing these: π/3 + 5π/9 = 8π/9 ≈ 2.7925
   - 16π/9 ≈ 5.585 (twice 8π/9, suggesting two complete cycles)
   - 3π/4 ≈ 2.3562 (doesn't match)

The proposed answer (3π/4) doesn't match the ground truth (16π/9) or the actual sum of solutions (8π/9).
