The problem defines a real-valued function \( f \) with inequalities and boundary conditions, and asks for a characterization of \( f \). 

To explore the conditions:

- \( f(x) + f(y) + 1 \geq f(x+y) \) and \( f(x+y) \geq f(x) + f(y) \) for all real \( x,y \).
- \( f(0) \geq f(x) \) for all \( x \in [0,1) \).
- \( f(-1) = -1 \), \( f(1) = 1 \).

These imply that \( f \) is "almost" superadditive plus 1, yet also bounded and monotone in some sense.

We will enumerate candidate functions \( f \) on some small discrete domain to check the inequalities and boundary conditions. We'll try functions represented as piecewise linear on integer points from -2 to 2 to gain insight and print candidates meeting the inequalities approximately.

```python
# Enumerate candidate functions f defined on integers from -2 to 2 satisfying
# given inequalities. The search is naive but illustrates possible f values.

import itertools

def check_conditions(f_values):
    # f_values: dict from int x in [-2..2] to float f(x)

    # Check inequalities for all x,y in domain
    for x in range(-2,3):
        for y in range(-2,3):
            lhs = f_values[x] + f_values[y] +1
            mid = f_values.get(x+y, None)
            if mid is None:
                continue
            if lhs < mid - 1e-9:
                return False
            if mid < f_values[x] + f_values[y] - 1e-9:
                return False
    # Check f(0) >= f(x) for x in [0,1)
    # We only have integers, so x=0 valid
    # To approximate [0,1), use x=0 only
    for x in [0]:
        if f_values[0] < f_values[x] - 1e-9:
            return False
    # Check f(-1) = -1 and f(1) = 1 approximately
    if abs(f_values[-1]+1) > 1e-6:
        return False
    if abs(f_values[1]-1) > 1e-6:
        return False
    return True

domain = range(-2,3)
# We try f_values with increments of 0.5 in [-2,2]
vals = [-2, -1.5, -1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5,2]

count = 0
for f_vals_tuple in itertools.product(vals, repeat=5):  # -2,-1,0,1,2
    f_values = dict()
    # Map -2,-1,0,1,2 to candidate values
    for i,x in enumerate([-2,-1,0,1,2]):
        f_values[x] = f_vals_tuple[i]
    # Skip if hard boundary conditions not satisfied exactly
    if abs(f_values[-1]+1) > 1e-6 or abs(f_values[1]-1) > 1e-6:
        continue
    # Extend f to domain by linear interpolation for missing if needed
    # But here, check only at points we have
    # Check conditions
    if check_conditions(f_values):
        count += 1
        print(f"Candidate f on points: {f_values}")
        # Only print first few candidates
        if count >= 10:
            break
```
