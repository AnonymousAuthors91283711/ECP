The problem involves characterizing functions \( f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) that are strictly monotone and satisfy a polynomial-like functional equation \( f(xy) = P(f(x), f(y)) \) for all positive \( x, y \), where \( P \) is a bivariate polynomial. We want to explore candidate functions and polynomials to identify such functions.

We enumerate candidates by testing simple polynomial forms for \( P \), and types of strictly monotone functions: powers and exponentials, which naturally convert products to sums or products after transformation. We check small-degree polynomials \( P \) and simple functions \( f \) on a small grid of \( x, y > 0 \). Immediate outputs are the tuples \((f,P)\) satisfying the relation to help conjecture the solution set.
