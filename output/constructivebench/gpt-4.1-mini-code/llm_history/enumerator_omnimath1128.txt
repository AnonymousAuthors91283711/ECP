The problem is to count the number of Boolean functions on a 15-element cycle with exactly 6 true values, where every false value must have a true neighbor. We want to enumerate subsets of size 6 from {0,...,14} with no two false elements isolated from true neighbors.

This corresponds to subsets of size 6 where the 9 false elements are such that none is isolated, i.e., the complement subset of size 9 has no isolated points on the cycle. Equivalently, the complement set of false values forms connected "blocks" covering all points or at least no isolated point.

We can enumerate all 6-subsets of a 15-element set, check the false positions and ensure all false elements have at least one true neighbor in the cycle, then count.

To limit output (tokens), print each valid 6-subset immediately, then print the total count at the end.

```python
from itertools import combinations

n = 15
k = 6

def has_true_neighbor(true_set, x):
    # true_set is set of positions where f(x) = True
    # For a false x, check if neighbors (x-1)%n or (x+1)%n are in true_set
    return ((x -1) % n in true_set) or ((x +1) % n in true_set)

count = 0
for subset in combinations(range(n), k):
    true_set = set(subset)
    # Check condition: for each false x, it must have a true neighbor
    false_positions = set(range(n)) - true_set
    if all(has_true_neighbor(true_set, x) for x in false_positions):
        count +=1
        print(f"Valid subset #{count}: {subset}")

print("Total count:", count)
```
