The problem asks for the count of integers \( n \) in the range 1 to 50 for which \((n^2)! \) is divisible by \((n!)^n\).

We want to find all \( n \in [1,50] \) such that \((n^2)! \equiv 0 \pmod{(n!)^n}\).

This can be tested by checking if the prime factorization of \((n!)^n\) is contained in that of \((n^2)!\).

We will write a program to enumerate all such \( n \) by computing prime factorization counts and checking divisibility conditions efficiently using Legendre's formula.

```python
# Enumerate n in [1..50] such that (n^2)! divisible by (n!)^n.
# Using prime factorization count via Legendre's formula for factorials.

def prime_sieve(limit):
    sieve = [True] * (limit+1)
    sieve[0] = sieve[1] = False
    for i in range(2,int(limit**0.5)+1):
        if sieve[i]:
            for j in range(i*i, limit+1, i):
                sieve[j] = False
    return [p for p in range(2,limit+1) if sieve[p]]

def legendre_factorial_power(n,p):
    """Count exponent of prime p in n!"""
    count = 0
    div = p
    while div <= n:
        count += n//div
        div *= p
    return count

def check_divisibility(n, primes):
    # Check if (n^2)! divisible by (n!)^n by comparing prime exponents
    # For each prime p: exp_p((n^2)!) >= n * exp_p(n!)
    for p in primes:
        exp_n2_fact = legendre_factorial_power(n*n, p)
        exp_n_fact = legendre_factorial_power(n, p)
        if exp_n2_fact < n * exp_n_fact:
            return False
    return True

def main():
    limit=50
    primes = prime_sieve(limit*limit)
    answers = []
    for n in range(1, limit+1):
        if check_divisibility(n, primes):
            print(f"n={n} satisfies (({n}^2)! divisible by (n!)^{n})")
            answers.append(n)
    print(f"Total count: {len(answers)}")

if __name__=="__main__":
    main()
```
