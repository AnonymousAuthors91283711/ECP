The main issue is that the expression depends on real functions like `Real.sqrt` and division, which make the expression noncomputable. To make it compile, we need to mark the constant as `noncomputable` and keep the same expression, which is the sum of the lengths of the intervals.

Note: The sum of the interval lengths is  
`(1 - √2 - (-1)) + (1/2 - 0) + (1 + √2 - 1) = (2 - √2) + (1/2) + (√2) = 2.5`.

Hence the closed form is the sum 2.5, but since the problem might want the exact irrational form, we keep the expression with `Real.sqrt`.

We fix the definition by making it noncomputable.

The error stems from trying to declare `noncomputable def` where the problem expects an abbreviation or a closed-form expression. The proper way to define the answer is as an abbreviation `abbrev` (or `def`) without `noncomputable` or repeated definition declaration.

Furthermore, the sum of the lengths of intervals simplifies to (1 - √2 + 1) + (1/2) + (1 + √2 - 1) - (-1) simplifies to 2.5, as the enumerated answers show. The question specifically expressed the sum of these intervals as the final answer, which is 2.5 exactly.

Hence, the best succinct and correct Lean expression is:

<<<2.5>>>
