The problem involves a polynomial \( f \) satisfying:
- \( f(0) = 1 \)
- \( f(2) + f(3) = 125 \)
- \( f(x) f(2x^2) = f(2x^3 + x) \) for all real \( x \).

We want to find \( f(5) \).

To assist with conjecturing \( f(5) \), we enumerate polynomials \( f \) of small degree with the condition \( f(0) = 1 \), then check if they satisfy the functional equation at sample points and the condition \( f(2) + f(3) = 125 \). We print those that fit partially or fully, then print candidate \( f(5) \).

```python
import itertools

def eval_poly(coeffs, x):
    return sum(c * x**i for i, c in enumerate(coeffs))

def check_feq(coeffs, test_xs):
    # Checks f(x)*f(2x^2) = f(2x^3 + x) at several x values
    for x in test_xs:
        lhs = eval_poly(coeffs, x) * eval_poly(coeffs, 2*x**2)
        rhs = eval_poly(coeffs, 2*x**3 + x)
        if abs(lhs - rhs) > 1e-8:
            return False
    return True

max_deg = 4  # limit degree for tractability
test_xs = [0.1, 0.5, 1]  # sample test points to check functional eqn approximately
found = set()

for deg in range(1, max_deg+1):
    # f(0) = 1 fixes constant term = 1
    # coeffs: [1, c1, c2, ..., c_deg]
    # To keep search space small, let ci in integers [-5..5]
    for coeffs_rest in itertools.product(range(-5,6), repeat=deg):
        coeffs = (1,) + coeffs_rest
        # Check f(2)+f(3)=125
        v2 = eval_poly(coeffs, 2)
        v3 = eval_poly(coeffs, 3)
        if v2+v3 != 125:
            continue
        # Check functional eqn on test points (approximate)
        if not check_feq(coeffs, test_xs):
            continue
        f5 = eval_poly(coeffs, 5)
        # print candidate polynomial and f(5)
        poly_str = " + ".join(f"{c}x^{i}" if i>0 else str(c) for i,c in enumerate(coeffs) if c!=0)
        ans_line = f"Degree {deg}, coeffs={coeffs}, f(5)={f5}"
        if ans_line not in found:
            print(ans_line)
            found.add(ans_line)

# After enumeration, print extremal answer found if desired
if found:
    f5_values = [float(line.split("f(5)=")[-1]) for line in found]
    print("Candidate f(5) values:", sorted(set(f5_values)))
```
