The problem considers permutations of digits 1 to 9 placed on vertices 0 to 8 arranged in a cycle, so that the sum of the digits on any 3 consecutive vertices is divisible by 3. We want to count the number of such permutations.

To explore, we will:
- Consider the equivalence classes of numbers modulo 3, since divisibility by 3 depends on residues mod 3.
- Enumerate permutations of digits 1-9 and check if the sum of digits on every triplet (i, i+1, i+2) mod 3 = 0.
- Print each valid permutation count immediately.
- Stop after enumerating all or after printing a reasonable number to conjecture the answer.

Since enumerating all 9! = 362,880 permutations might be costly, we will optimize by handling residues first and limit the output.

```python
import itertools

# digits = 1 to 9
digits = list(range(1, 10))

def mod3_triplet_sum_zero(perm):
    n = len(perm)
    for i in range(n):
        s = perm[i % n] + perm[(i+1) % n] + perm[(i+2) % n]
        if s % 3 != 0:
            return False
    return True

count = 0
max_print = 10  # limit output lines

print("Valid permutations with sum of every 3 consecutive digits divisible by 3:")

for perm in itertools.permutations(digits):
    if mod3_triplet_sum_zero(perm):
        count += 1
        if count <= max_print:
            print(perm)
        elif count == max_print + 1:
            print("... more valid permutations ...")

print(f"Total valid permutations found: {count}")
```
