[write_program]
The problem involves a sequence defined for natural numbers \( k > 0 \) with the formula: 
\[ a_k = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{3(-2)^k}. \]

We will write a Python program to enumerate values for \( k \) from 1 to 10, printing exact fractional values using `fractions.Fraction` where possible, and also the decimal approximations for better intuition.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def omnimath3382(k):
    # exact value as a fraction: 1/6 + 1/(3 * (-2)^k)
    denom = 3 * (-2)**k
    return Fraction(1, 6) + Fraction(1, denom)

print("Enumerating omnimath3382_answer for k=1 to 10:")
for k in range(1, 11):
    val = omnimath3382(k)
    print(f"k={k}: exact = {val}, approx = {float(val)}")
```
