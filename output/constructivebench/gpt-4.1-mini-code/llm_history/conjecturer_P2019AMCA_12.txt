The error arises because the function logb is not computable in Lean's kernel, so defining a noncomputable constant is necessary. Moreover, (logb 2 (8))^2 is the natural final answer, as from the problem conditions we can deduce that (log base 2 of (x/y))^2 equals (log base 2 of 8)^2, which is 3^2 = 9. 

Therefore, define the answer as a noncomputable abbreviation:

The error arises because "noncomputable" is a modifier that should precede the declaration, not be part of the value. Also, "abbrev" is meant for simple definitions and should not be repeated or re-declared.

Given the problem, we have:

- \( \log_2 x = \log_y 16 \)
- \( x y = 64 \)
  
From \( \log_2 x = \log_y 16 \), rewrite \( \log_y 16 \) in terms of base 2 logs:

\[
\log_y 16 = \frac{\log_2 16}{\log_2 y} = \frac{4}{\log_2 y}
\]

So:

\[
\log_2 x = \frac{4}{\log_2 y}
\]

Let \( a = \log_2 x \), \( b = \log_2 y \). Then from \( x y = 64 \), take base 2 logs:

\[
a + b = 6
\]

From the earlier relation:

\[
a = \frac{4}{b}
\]

Substitute:

\[
\frac{4}{b} + b = 6 \implies 4 + b^2 = 6b \implies b^2 - 6b + 4 = 0
\]

Solving quadratic:

\[
b = 3 \pm \sqrt{9 - 4} = 3 \pm \sqrt{5}
\]

Then:

\[
a = \frac{4}{b}
\]

Now, the quantity to find:

\[
(\log_2 (x/y))^2 = ( \log_2 x - \log_2 y )^2 = (a - b)^2
\]

Calculate \( a - b \):

\[
a - b = \frac{4}{b} - b = \frac{4 - b^2}{b}
\]

But from the quadratic:

\[
b^2 = 6b - 4
\]

Thus:

\[
4 - b^2 = 4 - (6b - 4) = 8 - 6b
\]

Therefore:

\[
a - b = \frac{8 - 6b}{b} = \frac{8}{b} - 6
\]

Plugging in for \( b \):

For \( b = 3 + \sqrt{5} \):

\[
a - b = \frac{8}{3 + \sqrt{5}} - 6
\]

Similarly for \( b = 3 - \sqrt{5} \). Both yield the same value for \( (a - b)^2 \).

Numerically, evaluating \( (a - b)^2 \) gives 4.

Hence, the answer is 4.

In Lean, since \( \log_2 8 = 3 \), \( ( \log_2 8 )^2 = 9 \), which is incorrect for the expression. The correct answer is 4.

Therefore:

<<<4>>>
