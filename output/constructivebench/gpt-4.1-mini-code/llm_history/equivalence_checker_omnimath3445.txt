abbrev omnimath3445_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath3445 :
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | 100 * 2^n > 10000 * (1/2)^n} omnimath3445_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 2004
Proposed Answer: 4
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest natural number n where 100 * 2^n > 10000 * (1/2)^n.

2. Let's simplify the inequality:
   100 * 2^n > 10000 * (1/2)^n
   => 2^n * (1/2)^(-n) > 100
   => 2^n * 2^n > 100
   => (2^n)^2 > 100
   => 2^n > 10
   => n > log₂(10) ≈ 3.3219

3. The smallest integer n satisfying this is n=4.

4. The ground truth answer of 2004 is clearly incorrect as it's orders of magnitude larger than needed.

5. The proposed answer of 4 correctly solves the inequality.

The ground truth answer appears to be a typo or error, while the proposed answer is mathematically correct.
