The problem involves exploring the expression \(((x-y)^2 - (y-x)^2)^2\) and conjecturing a simplified form or properties. Since for real numbers \(x, y\), \((x-y)^2 = (y-x)^2\), the inside of the square is zero, suggesting the entire expression is zero for all \(x, y\).

We'll enumerate some example values to confirm this experimentally and print the expression value.

```python
# Enumerate sample real values for x, y and print ((x - y)^2 - (y - x)^2)^2

def main():
    samples = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]
    for x in samples:
        for y in samples:
            val = ((x - y)**2 - (y - x)**2)**2
            print(f"x={x}, y={y} => ((x - y)^2 - (y - x)^2)^2 = {val}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
