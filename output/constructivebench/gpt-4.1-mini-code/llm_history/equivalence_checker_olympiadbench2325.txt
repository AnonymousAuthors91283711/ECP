Ground Truth Answer: fun (x, y) => 
    let x1 := x + y
    let x2 := x1 * y
    let y3 := y + 1
    let x4 := x2 + y3
    let x5 := x4 * y3
    let y6 := y3 + 1
    x5
Proposed Answer: fun p : ℕ × ℕ => (p.1 + 1) * (p.2 + 1) ^ 2 - p.2 * (p.2 + 1) * (2 * p.2 + 1) / 6
Let's analyze both answers:

1. Ground Truth Answer:
- Computes through a series of steps:
  x1 = x + y
  x2 = x1 * y = (x + y)*y
  y3 = y + 1
  x4 = x2 + y3 = (x + y)*y + (y + 1)
  x5 = x4 * y3 = [(x + y)*y + (y + 1)]*(y + 1)
  y6 = y + 2 (not used in final result)
  Final result is x5

2. Proposed Answer:
- Uses a different formula:
  (x + 1)*(y + 1)^2 - [y*(y + 1)*(2y + 1)/6]

Let's test both with the given example (10,2):

Ground Truth:
x1 = 12
x2 = 24
y3 = 3
x4 = 27
x5 = 81
But wait - this doesn't match the theorem's claim of 340. There seems to be a discrepancy in the ground truth answer's implementation versus the theorem statement.

Proposed Answer:
(10+1)*(2+1)^2 - [2*3*5/6] = 11*9 - 5 = 99-5 = 94
This also doesn't match 340.

However, looking at the structure, the proposed answer is a completely different formula from the ground truth answer's computation steps. They are not equivalent in any way.
