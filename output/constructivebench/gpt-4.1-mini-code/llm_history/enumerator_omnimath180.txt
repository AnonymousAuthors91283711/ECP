[write_program]
Let's interpret the problem as follows: for given positive integers p and q, we want the smallest natural number n such that for every multiset s of n natural numbers, there exists some element a in s so that if we form the new multiset t by removing two copies of a from s and adding a+p and a+q, then t also contains some element b such that b is repeated (like a appears twice in s, b should also appear twice in t). 

Our goal is to find candidate values of n for various small (p,q), ensuring that this "double-presence" condition holds and output candidates as found.

To do this efficiently:
- We'll try small p,q like (1,1), (1,2), (2,3).
- For n from 1 to a small limit (like 5-7), enumerate all multisets s of size n from a range 0..10 (to keep computation feasible),
- For each s, check if there exists such an a fulfilling the conditions,
- If no such a exists for some s, n is too small.
- Otherwise, print candidate n for that (p,q).

Since an exhaustive search is expensive, we'll limit the domain and n, and just produce samples to conjecture minimal n.

def multiset_subtract(ms, elements):
    # ms and elements are multisets (represented as Counters)
    res = ms.copy()
    for e in elements:
        if res[e] == 0:
            return None  # can't remove
        res[e] -= 1
        if res[e] == 0:
            del res[e]
    return res

def contains_double(ms):
    return any(v > 1 for v in ms.values())

def check_condition(s, p, q):
    count_s = Counter(s)
    # Try all a in s with count >= 2 (since we remove two 'a's)
    candidates = [a for a, c in count_s.items() if c >= 2]
    if not candidates:
        return True  # vacuously true (no such a)
    for a in candidates:
        # Form t by removing two a's and adding a+p, a+q
        t = count_s.copy()
        t[a] -= 2
        if t[a] <= 0:
            del t[a]
        t[a + p] = t.get(a + p, 0) + 1
        t[a + q] = t.get(a + q, 0) + 1
        # Check if t has some element with count >= 2
        if contains_double(t):
            return True
    return False
