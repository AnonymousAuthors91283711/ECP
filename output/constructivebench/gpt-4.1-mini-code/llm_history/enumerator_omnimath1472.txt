[write_program]
The problem looks like evaluating a trigonometric expression involving tan²(20°), sin²(20°), and simplifying it to a constant value. I'll write a Python program that:

- Iterates over degree values close to 20° to confirm the pattern
- Prints the exact fraction form using sympy when possible
- Prints decimal approximations as well to verify consistency
- Prints the final simplified exact answer for 20°

```python
import math
from sympy import symbols, sin, tan, pi, simplify, Rational, N

# angle in degrees to radians
def deg_to_rad(d):
    return d * pi / 180

x = symbols('x')
# expression as symbolic function of x degrees
def expr_deg(x_deg):
    x_rad = deg_to_rad(x_deg)
    t = tan(x_rad)
    s = sin(x_rad)
    # given expression
    return (t**2 - s**2) / (t**2 * s**2)

# We'll test for x = 15,16,...,25 degrees to conjecture pattern
for deg in range(15, 26):
    val = expr_deg(deg)
    val_simp = simplify(val)
    val_num = N(val)
    print(f"x={deg}°: expr = {val_simp}, approx={val_num:.6f}")

# Now print exact simplified form for 20 degrees
val_20 = expr_deg(20)
val_20_simp = simplify(val_20)
print("\nExact simplified value for 20°:")
print(val_20_simp)
print("Decimal approximation:")
print(N(val_20_simp))
```
