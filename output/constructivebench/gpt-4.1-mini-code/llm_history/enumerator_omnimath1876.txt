The problem is to find the least positive integer \( n \) such that there exists a complex number \( z \) with positive real and imaginary parts for which \( z^n = (\overline{z})^n \).

We explore small values of \( n \), and for each \( n \), search over angles \(\theta \in (0, \pi/2)\) (since \( z \) has positive real and imaginary parts, its argument lies in the first quadrant) and magnitudes \( r > 0 \) to see if such \( z \) exists.

Given \( z = r(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta) \), \(\overline{z} = r(\cos \theta - i \sin \theta) \).

Then,

\[ z^n = r^n (\cos n\theta + i \sin n\theta), \]
\[ (\overline{z})^n = r^n (\cos n\theta - i \sin n\theta). \]

Equality \( z^n = (\overline{z})^n \) requires:

\[ i \sin n\theta = - i \sin n\theta \implies \sin n\theta = 0. \]

Since \( \sin n\theta = 0 \), \( n\theta = k \pi \) for some integer \( k \).

Now \(\theta \in (0, \pi/2)\), so

\[ \frac{k\pi}{n} = \theta \in (0, \pi/2) \Rightarrow k \in \{1, \ldots, \lfloor n \cdot \frac{1}{2} \rfloor \}. \]

Also, \( k\pi/n \) must be in the open interval \( (0, \pi/2) \).

We want to find the least \( n \) for which a rational \( k/n \) exists with \( 0 < k < n/2 \).

Moreover, \( z \) also must satisfy \( z^n = (\overline{z})^n \).

But from the above, the magnitude \( r \) cancels out so \( r \) can be any positive number, so focusing on \(\theta\) is sufficient.

Hence, for any \( n \), check if there is \( k \in \mathbb{Z} \) with \( 0 < k < n/2 \) such that \( \theta = \frac{k\pi}{n} \in (0,\pi/2) \).

If such \( k \) exists and \( z \) can be chosen accordingly, then \( n \) is an answer.

Our code will enumerate \( n = 1 \ldots 20 \), and for each \( n \), list all \( k \) satisfying \( 0 < k < n/2 \) and print the corresponding angles in radians and degrees, indicating candidate \( n \).

```python
from math import pi, degrees

# Enumerate n from 1 to 20
print("Candidate n values and corresponding k for which z^n = (conj(z))^n can hold with positive re and im parts:")
for n in range(1, 21):
    ks = []
    for k in range(1, n):
        # must satisfy 0 < k < n/2 to have angle in (0, pi/2)
        if 0 < k < n/2:
            theta = k * pi / n
            # theta in (0, pi/2) guaranteed by above, but double-check
            if 0 < theta < pi/2:
                ks.append(k)
    if ks:
        print(f"n={n}, valid k={ks}")
        for k in ks:
            theta = k * pi / n
            print(f"  k={k}, theta={theta:.5f} rad â‰ˆ {degrees(theta):.2f} degrees")

print("\nSmallest n with such k>0 and k<n/2 indicates the least n with required property.")
```
