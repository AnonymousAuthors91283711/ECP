This problem asks for the number of integer pairs \((x,y)\) with positive \(x,y\) satisfying:

\[ x^2 - 8x + y^2 + 4y = 5. \]

We enumerate positive integer pairs \(x,y\) for \(1 \leq x,y \leq 20\) and test the equation; this bound is heuristic but should be large enough since quadratics grow quickly. We print each pair immediately. After enumeration, we count and print the total number of solutions.

```python
# Enumerate positive integer pairs (x,y) satisfying x^2 -8x + y^2 +4y = 5
# Print solutions immediately and then print total count.

def main():
    count = 0
    # Choose a reasonable upper bound for search
    max_val = 20
    for x in range(1, max_val + 1):
        for y in range(1, max_val + 1):
            val = x*x - 8*x + y*y + 4*y
            if val == 5:
                print(f"Solution found: x={x}, y={y}")
                count += 1
    print(f"Total solutions with x,y in [1,{max_val}]: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
