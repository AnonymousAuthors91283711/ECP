The problem is to find the smallest sum \( s = a + b + c + d \) where \(a,b,c,d\) are distinct perfect squares such that \(a^b = c^d\). We want to enumerate all quadruples of distinct square integers \(a,b,c,d\) satisfying \(a^b = c^d\) and find the minimal sum.

We consider small perfect squares for \(a,b,c,d\) to find candidates, then print them as found, ending with the minimal sum found.

```python
import math

# Generate some perfect squares up to a small threshold
max_val = 20  # to keep search space small for demonstration
squares = [i*i for i in range(1, max_val+1)]

# To avoid large powers we use tuple (base, exponent)
# We'll search for quadruples (a,b,c,d) with a,b,c,d âˆˆ squares, distinct values,
# satisfying a^b = c^d
# We'll enumerate all combinations with small values

found_solutions = []

def fast_pow(base, exp):
    # Use pow with integer base and exponent
    # But base and exponent can be large so careful not to overflow too heavily
    # power results won't fit in int if numbers too large, so keep small ranges
    return pow(base, exp)

# We'll try all distinct a,b,c,d squares with some limits
for a in squares:
    for b in squares:
        if b == a:
            continue
        for c in squares:
            if c in (a,b):
                continue
            for d in squares:
                if d in (a,b,c):
                    continue
                # To limit search, skip if sum already bigger than found min
                s = a+b+c+d
                # Check a^b == c^d quickly by comparing logs or direct pow (if not too big)
                try:
                    val1 = fast_pow(a,b)
                    val2 = fast_pow(c,d)
                except OverflowError:
                    # skip too big powers
                    continue
                if val1 == val2:
                    print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}, sum={s}")
                    found_solutions.append(s)

if found_solutions:
    print("Minimum sum found:", min(found_solutions))
else:
    print("No solutions found in searched range.")
```
