The problem involves a 99-position circular arrangement colored with red/blue, with a transformation rule changing one position's color at each step, starting from an alternating red-blue pattern and ending with the last position yellow. I will enumerate small step counts, simulate color sequences, and check the constraints to conjecture the minimal steps needed.

```python
# Enumerate steps and simulate color changes on 99-length sequences,
# where each step changes exactly one position's color, checking conditions.
# The starting pattern is alternating red/blue.
# The final pattern is same as start, except position 98 is yellow.

N = 99
RED, BLUE, YELLOW = 'R', 'B', 'Y'

def start_pattern():
    return [RED if i % 2 == 0 else BLUE for i in range(N)]

def end_pattern():
    # Positions < 98 same as start; 98 is yellow
    arr = start_pattern()
    arr[98] = YELLOW
    return arr

def neighbors(i):
    # Return the pair of neighbors for position i modulo N
    return ((i - 1) % N, (i + 1) % N)

def violates_condition(arr):
    # Check that for every position i,
    # neighbor positions j satisfy arr[j] != arr[i]
    # condition: forall i, forall j with (j+1)%99 == i % 99 => arr[i] != arr[j]
    # Here, j s.t. j+1 mod 99 = i mod 99 means j = i-1 mod 99
    # So neighbors influencing i is (i-1) mod 99 only
    for i in range(N):
        j = (i - 1) % N
        if arr[i] == arr[j]:
            return True
    return False

    if violates_condition(end):
        print("End pattern violates condition")
        # Possibly can't achieve required end?
    queue = deque()
    queue.append( (0, start) )
    visited = {tuple(start):0}

    while queue:
        step, arr = queue.popleft()
        print_step(step, arr)
        if step == max_steps:

            colors = {RED, BLUE, YELLOW} - {arr[k]}
            for c in colors:
                new_arr = arr[:]
                new_arr[k] = c
                # Enforcement: 
                # 1. Exactly one position changes color (we did that)
                # 2. Condition for chosen k: forall j with (j+1)%N == k, arr[t][j] != arr[t+1][k]
                # j with (j+1)%N == k => j = k-1 mod N
                j = (k - 1) % N
                if arr[j] == new_arr[k]:
                    continue
                # 3. For i != k, colors remain the same (done)
