The problem involves finding triples of positive integers (a, b, c) such that the expressions a*b - c, b*c - a, and c*a - b are all powers of two. We'll enumerate small values for a, b, c to identify such triples.

```python
# Enumerate triples (a,b,c) with 1 ≤ a,b,c ≤ N where:
# a*b - c, b*c - a, c*a - b are all powers of two (>0).

def is_power_of_two(x):
    return x > 0 and (x & (x - 1)) == 0

N = 20
found = []

print(f"Enumerating triples (a,b,c) with 1 ≤ a,b,c ≤ {N}:")

for a in range(1, N+1):
    for b in range(1, N+1):
        for c in range(1, N+1):
            x = a*b - c
            y = b*c - a
            z = c*a - b
            if is_power_of_two(x) and is_power_of_two(y) and is_power_of_two(z):
                triple = (a,b,c)
                found.append(triple)
                print(triple, "with values:", f"{x}=2^{x.bit_length()-1}", f"{y}=2^{y.bit_length()-1}", f"{z}=2^{z.bit_length()-1}")

print(f"\nTotal found: {len(found)}")
if found:
    # Find triple with minimal sum (a+b+c)
    min_sum = min(sum(t) for t in found)
    min_triples = [t for t in found if sum(t) == min_sum]
    print(f"Minimal sum triple(s): {min_triples} with sum {min_sum}")
```
