This problem seems to ask for an exact rational enumeration related to the expression (1/2 * 1/2 + 1/3 * 1/2). The goal is to find the exact rational value.

```python
# Enumerate the value of the expression (1/2 * 1/2 + 1/3 * 1/2)
from fractions import Fraction

def main():
    a = Fraction(1, 2)
    b = Fraction(1, 3)
    c = Fraction(1, 2)

    val1 = a * c
    val2 = b * c
    total = val1 + val2

    # Print intermediate values
    print(f'1/2 * 1/2 = {val1}')          # 1/4
    print(f'1/3 * 1/2 = {val2}')          # 1/6
    print(f'(1/2 * 1/2) + (1/3 * 1/2) = {total}')  # 5/12

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
