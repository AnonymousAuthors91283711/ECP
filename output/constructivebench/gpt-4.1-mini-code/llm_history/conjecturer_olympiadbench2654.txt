<<<2 * (25! / 25)>>>
Explanation: Charlie's image must be adjacent to either Chris or Abby's image, so (f charlie).val is either one less or one more than (f x).val for x in {chris, abby}. Counting permutations where 0's image is adjacent to 1 or 2 gives 2*(T-1)*(T-1)! = 2 * 24 * 24! = 2 * (25! / 25). The probability divides by 25!. Hence, the answer is 2/25 = 2 * (25! / 25) / 25!.
