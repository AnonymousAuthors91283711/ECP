open Nat

noncomputable abbrev omnimath1126_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath1126 (p : ℝ) (hp : 0 ≤ p ∧ p ≤ 1) :
  (Nat.choose 4 2 * p^2 * (1 - p)^2 = Nat.choose 4 3 * p^3 * (1 - p)) ↔ p = omnimath1126_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Checking roots of equation: C(4,2)*p^2*(1-p)^2 = C(4,3)*p^3*(1-p)
p = 0.00 is a root exactly
Approximate root near p = 0.60000
p = 1.00 is a root exactly
p = 0 is a root exactly
p = 1 is a root exactly. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<1/2>>>
