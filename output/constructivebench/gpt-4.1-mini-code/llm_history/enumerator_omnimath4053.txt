The problem involves understanding polynomials \( P \) over integers such that for all natural numbers \( n > 0 \) with a large number of prime factors (more than \(2023^{2023}\)), the value \( P(n) \) is positive and the number of prime factors of \( |P(n)| \) is at most the number of prime factors of \( n \).

A plausible conjecture (common in number theory and polynomial factorization problems) is that such polynomials are products of linear polynomials with positive leading coefficients, potentially powers of \( x \) times units, or constant positive integers. The program below will enumerate some small integer polynomials \( P \) (degree 0 or 1 with small coefficients), and test the property for increasing \( n \) (with specified prime factors), printing those that seem to satisfy the condition for all tested \( n \).

We sample \( n \) as product of small primes to produce \( n \) with varying prime factor counts, and check the condition.

```python
# Enumerate integer polynomials P(x) = a*x + b with small integer coefficients a,b
# For each P, test for several n with sizable prime factor counts, whether:
#   1) P(n) > 0
#   2) number of prime factors of |P(n)| â‰¤ number of prime factors of n
# We print polynomials passing all tests.

    # Return cardinality of prime factors with multiplicity
    return prime_factor_count(n)

def generate_n(primes, target_count):
    # Sequentially multiply primes until count reached or surpassed
    n = 1
    count = 0
    idx = 0
    while count < target_count:
        n *= primes[idx % len(primes)]
        count += 1
        idx += 1
    return n

    # Test polynomial P(x) = a x + b
    # For n with prime factor counts from 2 to 7, test the condition
    for k in range(2, 8):
        n = generate_n(primes, k)
        val = a*n + b
        if val <= 0:
            return False
        if prime_factors_mult(abs(val)) > k:
            return False
    return True
