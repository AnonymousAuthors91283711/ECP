Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {x : ℤ | x > 0 ∧ ∀ p : ℕ, Nat.Prime p → p ∣ Int.natAbs x → ∀ n : ℕ, n ≥ 1 → ¬(p ∣ Int.natAbs (2 ^ n + 3 ^ n + 6 ^ n - 1))}

The proposed answer is mostly correct in its expression but has some technical differences from what would be expected. The key points:
1. It correctly captures the condition that x must be positive and coprime with all a(n)
2. However, it uses Int.natAbs where the original problem works directly with ℤ
3. The formulation with prime divisors is equivalent to the coprimality condition, but less direct
4. The ground truth answer would likely be expressed more simply in terms of ℤ.coprime

The answer is conceptually correct but technically different in implementation.
