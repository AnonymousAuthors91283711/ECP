The problem is to find the least natural number \( n \) for which there exists a function \( k : \text{Fin } n \to \mathbb{N} \) such that \(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} k_i \cdot 35 \geq 500\). Because the factor 35 is constant, the problem reduces to finding the minimal \( n \) so that summing any \( k_i \cdot 35 \) terms can reach at least 500.

Since \( k_i \) are natural numbers (including zero), setting any \( k_i \) suitably large will increase the sum. However, the problem implicitly assumes a condition on \( k \) (e.g., \( k \) bounded), but as stated it seems trivial (for \( n=1 \), choosing \( k_0=15 \) works since \( 15 \cdot 35=525 \geq 500 \)).

Hence likely there is more subtlety. The original Lean theorem appears incomplete (the `sorry` placeholder), but since the problem is about enumerating answers, I will write a program that for sample values of \( n \), enumerates all possible \( k : \text{Fin } n \to \mathbb{N} \) with small bounds to check which \( n \) allows \(\sum k_i \cdot 35 \geq 500\).

To keep computations manageable, I will assume \( k_i \in \{0, \ldots, M\} \) where \( M \) is small. I will select \( n \) from 1 to 15 and \( M=15 \) (since 15*35=525, enough to surpass 500 with one term).

The program will print \( n \) and example \( k \) that satisfy the condition. It will also print the minimal such \( n \).

```python
# Enumerate minimal n so that exists k: Fin n -> N with sum(k_i * 35) >= 500
# For computation tractability, restrict k_i in [0..15].
# Print first found k for each n meeting the condition and minimal n.

M = 15  # max k_i value
TARGET = 500
factor = 35

def try_n(n):
    # We attempt all k tuples (k_0,...,k_{n-1}) with k_i in [0..M]
    # To keep computation feasible, try the simplest approach:
    # Since each k_i can add up to 35*M=525 >500 alone,
    # the problem boils down to having at least one k_i >= ceil(500/35)=15 
    # so for n=1, k=[15] works
    # Let's confirm by printing such k for each n.
    
    # Because arbitrary ks allowed, for any n>=1, choosing one k_i=15 and rest zero works.
    k = [0]*n
    k[0] = (TARGET + factor -1)//factor  # minimal k_0 to reach TARGET
    s = sum(x*factor for x in k)
    if s >= TARGET:
        print(f"n={n}, example k={k}, sum={s}")
        return True
    return False

def main():
    minimal_n = None
    for n in range(1, 16):
        if try_n(n):
            minimal_n = n
            break
    print(f"Minimal n with sum(k_i * 35) >= 500 exists: {minimal_n}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The output will show minimal n found is 1 with \( k_0=15 \) achieving 525â‰¥500. This aligns with trivial reasoning that only one element is needed.
