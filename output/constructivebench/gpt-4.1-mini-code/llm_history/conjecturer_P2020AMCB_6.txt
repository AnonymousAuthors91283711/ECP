abbrev P2020AMCB_6_answer : ℕ → Prop := sorry
theorem P2020AMCB_6 (n : ℕ) (h : 9 ≤ n) : P2020AMCB_6_answer n := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating values of n in [9..20] and some properties to conjecture patterns:
n = 9, property = 9
n = 10, property = 1
n = 11, property = 2
n = 12, property = 3
n = 13, property = 4
n = 14, property = 5
n = 15, property = 6
n = 16, property = 7
n = 17, property = 8
n = 18, property = 9
n = 19, property = 10
n = 20, property = 2. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → Prop
<<<fun n => (n - 9) % 11 + 1 = 9>>>
