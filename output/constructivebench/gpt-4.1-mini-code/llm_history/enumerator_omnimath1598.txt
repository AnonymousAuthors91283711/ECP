[write_program]
The given code snippet appears to be from Lean/Theorem Prover code, involving the expected value of some random variable or experiment. You want a Python enumerator script to approximate or find the expected value related to parameters 8 and 1000, and then output the floor of the expected value divided by 10, presumably as an integer. Since the exact context of expectedValue(8,1000) isn't fully specified, I will assume it is to be computed or simulated somehow.

I will write a Python program that simulates or approximates the expected value with parameters 8 and 1000, then prints intermediate results first, then prints the floor of expectedValue/10.

Since the problem statement is minimal, I will interpret it as (for example) the expected sum of 8 rolls of a 1000-sided die or something similarly scaled. To fit the high-school competition level, I will simulate or precisely compute possible values, print partial sums or counts if necessary.

```python
# Enumerating expected value for the number of successes or sum of throws with parameters 8 and 1000.
# As the original function expectedValue(8,1000) is unspecified, we assume it's the expected sum of 8 i.i.d. uniform variables on 1..1000.
# Expected value = 8 * (1000+1)/2 = 8*500.5=4004. So floor(4004/10) = 400.
# We'll confirm by enumeration of small samples and simulation.

def main():
    n, sides = 8, 1000
    # Exact expected value for uniform discrete variable on 1..sides is (sides+1)/2
    ev_single = (sides + 1) / 2
    ev_total = n * ev_single
    print(f"Parameters: n={n}, sides={sides}")
    print(f"Exact expected value for one variable: {ev_single}")
    print(f"Exact expected value for sum of {n} variables: {ev_total}")
    print(f"Floor of expected value divided by 10: {int(ev_total//10)}")

    # To verify by simulation, do a small monte carlo
    import random
    trials = 10**5
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(trials):
        s = sum(random.randint(1, sides) for _ in range(n))
        total_sum += s
        if i % 20000 == 0 and i > 0:
            approx_ev = total_sum / i
            print(f"Trial {i}: Approximate expected value so far: {approx_ev:.2f}")
    approx_ev = total_sum / trials
    print(f"Approximate expected value after {trials} trials: {approx_ev:.2f}")
    print(f"Floor of approximated expected value / 10: {int(approx_ev // 10)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This meets the requirements:
- Prints parameters.
- Prints exact values directly.
- Simulates and prints partial approximations.
- Prints the final integral floor value as used in the theorem.
