The problem describes a set of functions \( f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \) satisfying three conditions:

1. \( f(1) = 1 \).
2. \( f \) is nondecreasing on positive integers, i.e., \( a \le b \implies f(a) \le f(b) \) for \( a, b > 0 \).
3. For all \( a > 0 \), \( f(2a) = f(a) + 1 \).

We want to count how many functions \( t : \{1, \ldots, 2014\} \to \mathbb{N} \) arise as restrictions of such \( f \).

---

**Key observations:**

- Condition 3 relates values at indices differing by a factor of 2, increasing by 1 each time we double argument.
- Condition 2 implies monotonicity.
- Starting from \( f(1)=1 \), repeatedly doubling increases the function additively.
- For any \( n \), the value \( f(n) \) depends on \( f(\)odd part of \( n \)) plus how many times 2 divides \( n \).

We can try to generate consistent sequences for indices up to 2014. The odd part of each \( n \) determines a base value, then the power of two adds shifts.

The odd numbers less than or equal to 2014 are roughly half, about 1007.

We suspect the values on odd numbers fully determine \( f \):

- For each odd number \( o \), define \( g(o) := f(o) \).
- For any \( n = 2^k \cdot o \), \( f(n) = g(o) + k \).

Since \( f \) is monotone on all positive integers, and doubles relate values, the sequence \( g \) on odd numbers must be increasing in a certain controlled way when combined with the doubling increments.

---

**Approach to enumerate:**

- The function is completely determined by the values on odd numbers.
- Sort all odd numbers from 1 to 2014: \( o_1 = 1 < o_2 < \cdots < o_m \) with \( m \approx 1007 \).
- We have \( g(o_1) = f(1) = 1 \).
- For each pair \( o_i < o_j \), the monotonicity implies:
  
  \[
  f(o_i) \le f(o_j)
  \quad \Rightarrow \quad
  g(o_i) \le g(o_j)
  \]
  
  but due to doubling, the interplay is more complex.

- The doubling condition for \( n = 2^k \cdot o \) says:
  
  \[
  f(2^k o) = g(o) + k
  \]
  
- Finally, monotonicity \( a \le b \implies f(a) \le f(b) \).

---

We can check monotonicity on all pairs \( (a,b) \), but it's large.

Better to just generate plausible \( g \) sequences for odds, then check full monotonicity.

We will try small examples to gain insight.

---

**Enumerate functions \( f \) with domain \( \{1,\ldots,n\} \) where \( n \) is small (e.g., n=8):**

- List odd numbers: 1,3,5,7
- \( g(1) = 1 \)
- \( g(3), g(5), g(7) \) are nondecreasing, i.e. \( 1 = g(1) \leq g(3) \leq g(5) \leq g(7) \).
- For each odd \( o \), \( f(2^k o) = g(o) + k \), if \( 2^k o \le 8 \).
- Check monotonicity on all \( a \le b \).

---

We will write a python program that:

- For n = 8 (extendable to larger n),
- enumerates all sequences \( g \) on odd numbers in [1,n] with \( g(1) = 1 \) and \( g \) nondecreasing,
- derives \( f \) up to n,
- checks monotonicity over all pairs \( a \le b \),
- prints each valid \( f \),
- counts total number.

This will provide insight into the problem.

Due to output length limit, we run for n=8.

```python
# Enumerate functions f: {1..n} -> N satisfying
#  f(1)=1,
#  f nondecreasing for positive integers,
#  f(2a) = f(a) + 1 for all a with 2a <= n.
#
# f is determined by values g on odd numbers in [1..n]:
# for n=8, odd numbers = [1,3,5,7]
# g(1)=1 fixed, enumerate g(3), g(5), g(7) nondecreasing with g(i) >=1.
# For each g, define f(i) = g(odd_part(i)) + v2(i),
# then check monotonicity of f on [1..n].

def v2(x):
    # count powers of 2 dividing x
    c = 0
    while x % 2 == 0:
        x //= 2
        c += 1
    return c

def odd_part(x):
    while x % 2 == 0:
        x //= 2
    return x

n = 8
odds = [x for x in range(1, n+1, 2)]
# g(1) = 1 fixed
# g(i) >= 1, nondecreasing on odds
# We guess values up to a small max for enumeration, say max_g_val = 5

max_g_val = 5
from itertools import product

# produce all nondecreasing sequences g for odds,
# with g[0] = 1 fixed

def nondecreasing_sequences(length, start=1, max_val=5):
    # generate all nondecreasing integer lists of length 'length' starting with 'start'
    # first element = start fixed
    if length == 1:
        yield [start]
        return
    # For next elements >= previous
    for g_rest in nondecreasing_sequences(length-1, start, max_val):
        # yield will be handled in outer calls
        pass

# more efficient: recursive helper with partial seq
def gen_nondec(prefix, length, max_val):
    if len(prefix) == length:
        yield prefix
        return
    last = prefix[-1]
    for val in range(last, max_val+1):
        yield from gen_nondec(prefix+[val], length, max_val)

valid_fs = []
count = 0

for g in gen_nondec([1], len(odds), max_g_val):
    # build f
    f = {}
    possible = True
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        op = odd_part(i)
        vt = v2(i)
        gi = g[odds.index(op)]
        f[i] = gi + vt
        # f(i) must be >=1 as g elements >=1 and vt >=0

    # check monotonicity: for all a <= b, f(a) <= f(b)
    # since n small, brute force check all pairs
    for a in range(1, n+1):
        for b in range(a+1, n+1):
            if f[a] > f[b]:
                possible = False
                break
        if not possible:
            break
    if possible:
        count += 1
        print(f"Valid f with g = {g}, f-values: {[f[i] for i in range(1,n+1)]}")

print(f"Total valid functions f for n={n} with max_g_val={max_g_val}: {count}")
```

This code enumerates all candidate functions from the restricted parameterization and prints each valid function \( f \) immediately along with the sequence \( g \) on odd numbers. It then prints the total count of valid functions found.

By increasing \( n \) and \( \text{max_g_val} \) (within reason), one can experimentally approach the count for \( n=2014 \).

This helps conjecture the size of the set in the problem.
