The problem is to find the number of positive integers x such that:
log(x - 40) + log(60 - x) < 2,
with x > 0, and presumably with the domain restrictions x - 40 > 0 and 60 - x > 0 for the logs to be defined.

We interpret log as the natural logarithm (ln). The valid x satisfy:
40 < x < 60,
and x is a positive integer.

We want to count integers x in (40, 60) such that ln(x-40) + ln(60 - x) < 2,
which is ln[(x-40)(60-x)] < 2,
i.e. (x-40)(60-x) < e^2.

We will enumerate all integer x from 41 to 59, compute the product (x-40)*(60-x), check if it is less than e^2, and print all such x, then print the count.

```python
import math

def main():
    e2 = math.exp(2)  # e^2
    count = 0
    print("x in (40,60) with log(x-40)+log(60-x) < 2:")
    for x in range(41, 60):
        prod = (x - 40) * (60 - x)
        # print prod and check inequality
        if prod < e2:
            print(f"x={x}, (x-40)*(60-x)={prod} < e^2={e2:.4f}")
            count += 1
    print(f"Total count: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
