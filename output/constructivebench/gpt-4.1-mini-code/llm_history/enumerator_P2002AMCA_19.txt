The problem asks to find the number of real values \( x \) such that \( f(f(x)) = 6 \), given a piecewise function \( f \) defined on five intervals with specified constant values (6, 2, 4, 2, 6) on the respective intervals.

The function has these intervals with constants:
- \( (-\infty, a) \to 6 \)
- \( [a, b] \to 2 \)
- \( (b, c) \to 4 \)
- \( [c, d] \to 2 \)
- \( (d, \infty) \to 6 \)

with \( a < b < c < d \).

The goal is to determine the cardinality \( | \{ x : f(f(x)) = 6 \} | \).

This suggests iterating over the possible outputs of \( f(x) \), then checking which inputs lead to \( f(x) \) values for which \( f(f(x)) = 6 \).

To assist with conjecture, I will enumerate over sample values for \( a,b,c,d \) to check how many solutions \( x \) satisfy \( f(f(x))=6 \).

The possible values of \( f(x) \) are \( \{2,4,6\} \), so \( f(f(x)) = 6 \) means \( f(x) \in \{x : f(x)=y \text{ and } f(y) = 6 \} \).

Enumerating the preimages of 6 under \( f \) and counting how many \( x \) satisfy \( f(x) \in \text{these preimages} \).

We will pick concrete values for \( a,b,c,d \) with \( a<b<c<d \) and compute the sets.

The program below prints partial results immediately.

    # We want to find the cardinality of {x : f(f(x)) = 6}
    # Let S = { x : f(f(x))=6 }
    # Since f takes values 2,4,6, we consider f(x) values that yield f(f(x))=6
    # i.e. f(x) in preimage of 6
    # preimage_6 = {x : f(x)=6} = (-∞,a) ∪ (d,∞)
    # So we want x with f(x) ∈ (-∞,a) ∪ (d,∞)
    # But f(x) ∈ {2,4,6}, so f(x)=6 only works if f(x)=6, i.e. x ∈ preimage_6
    # So f(x) ∈ {6} to have f(f(x))=6
    # So {x : f(f(x))=6} = {x : f(x) = 6} = preimage_6 = (-∞,a) ∪ (d,∞)
    #
    # But is that all? No, because f(f(x)) = 6 means f(x) in set of x where f(x) = 6.

    # cardinality infinite, but problem probably wants #elements in set {x} which is real set,
    # so infinite; but question asks for cardinality in natural numbers symbolically.
