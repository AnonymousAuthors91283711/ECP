This problem involves the infinite sum:  
\[
\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{2^{2^n}}{4^{2^n} - 1}
\]  
We want to numerically explore the partial sums to conjecture the closed form.

We rewrite terms:  
\[
\frac{2^{2^n}}{4^{2^n} - 1} = \frac{2^{2^n}}{(2^2)^{2^n} - 1} = \frac{2^{2^n}}{2^{2^{n+1}} - 1}
\]

For rapidly growing denominators, terms quickly become tiny.

The program below computes partial sums for n=0 to max_n, prints each term and cumulative sum to identify patterns.

```python
# Enumerate partial sums of sum_{n=0}^\infty 2^{2^n} / (4^{2^n} - 1) to observe convergence

def main():
    max_n = 10  # Enough to see convergence behavior
    total = 0.0
    print("n term                  partial_sum")
    for n in range(max_n+1):
        numerator = 2 ** (2 ** n)
        denominator = (4 ** (2 ** n)) - 1
        term = numerator / denominator
        total += term
        print(f"{n} {term:.16f} {total:.16f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
