Sum of k^k for k=1 to 30300 mod 101 = 98
Sum of k^k for k=1 to 30303 mod 101 = 29. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The sums modulo 101 appear to have a period related to 3030, since 30303 = 10*3030 + 3 and the partial sums step by 3030 show a cycle-like pattern. Adding the last three terms (30301^30301 + 30302^30302 + 30303^30303) mod 101 to the sum mod 101 for 30300 terms (which is 98) yields 29. The final answer is thus 29.
