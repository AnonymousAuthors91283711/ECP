The problem asks for the number of triples (x, y, n) in natural numbers with x > 0, y > 0, n > 1, such that x^n - y^n = 2^100.

To approach this, let's enumerate possible n values (say up to a reasonable small max), and for each n, try to find x,y satisfying x^n - y^n = 2^100.

Because 2^100 is large, and x^n - y^n = 2^100, for given n, y must be close to x, especially for large n.

Use integer nth root approximations to guess y for each x or vice versa.

We prioritize exact values and print each found solution immediately.

We print some parameter values to illustrate the search.

```python
# Enumerate triples (x,y,n) with x>0,y>0,n>1 and x^n - y^n = 2^100
# For efficiency, limit n to small values (2 <= n <= 10)
# For each n, try candidate y values and compute x accordingly

def is_perfect_nth_power(value, n):
    # Check if value is a perfect nth power, return (True, root) or (False, None)
    root = int(round(value ** (1/n)))
    # Check candidates around root due to rounding
    for r in (root-1, root, root+1):
        if r > 0 and r ** n == value:
            return True, r
    return False, None

def main():
    target = 2**100
    max_n = 10
    print(f"Searching solutions for x^n - y^n = 2^100 with 2 <= n <= {max_n}")
    count = 0
    for n in range(2, max_n+1):
        # For x^n - y^n = 2^100, try y in a range (we estimate range)
        # Since 2^100 is large, y ~ (x^n - 2^100)^{1/n} or x ~ (y^n + 2^100)^{1/n}
        # We'll try y from 1 up to approx (2^100)^{1/n} + 10
        max_y = int(round((target) ** (1/n))) + 10
        for y in range(1, max_y):
            val = target + y**n
            is_p, x = is_perfect_nth_power(val, n)
            if is_p and x > 0 and x > y:
                count +=1
                print(f"Found triple #{count}: (x={x}, y={y}, n={n}), since {x}^{n} - {y}^{n} = 2^{100}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
