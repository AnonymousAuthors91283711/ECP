The problem involves a sequence \( a_n \) of positive real numbers satisfying, for each \( k \),
\[
\sum_{n=0}^\infty \binom{n}{k} a_n = \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^k.
\]
We want to evaluate
\[
S = \sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^{n+1} a_n.
\]

To explore patterns, I will enumerate sequences \(a_n\) on a truncated range \(n=0..N\) for small \(N\), and check whether the binomial sums equal \((1/5)^k\) for \(k=0..N\). This provides a linear system of equations on \(a_0,\ldots,a_N\) that can be solved numerically or symbolically. Then I compute \(S\) and print results for various \(N\).

This helps conjecture the value of the infinite sum \(S\).

```python
from math import comb
import numpy as np

def test_N(N):
    # Build matrix M where M[k,n] = comb(n,k)
    M = np.zeros((N+1,N+1))
    for k in range(N+1):
        for n in range(N+1):
            # comb(n,k) is 0 if k > n
            M[k,n] = comb(n,k)
    # RHS vector b = [(1/5)^k for k=0..N]
    b = np.array([(1/5)**k for k in range(N+1)])
    # Solve M a = b for a
    try:
        a = np.linalg.solve(M,b)
    except np.linalg.LinAlgError:
        print(f"N={N}: Singular matrix, skipping")
        return
    # Check positivity condition
    if all(ai > 0 for ai in a):
        # Compute S = sum (-1)^{n+1} a_n
        S = sum(((-1)**(n+1))*a[n] for n in range(N+1))
        print(f"N={N}, a_n approx =", ['{:.5f}'.format(x) for x in a])
        print(f"Sum S = sum (-1)^(n+1) * a_n approx = {S:.8f}")
    else:
        print(f"N={N}: a_n not all positive, solution discarded")

print("Enumerating solutions for small N with sums matching (1/5)^k:")
for N in range(3,7):
    test_N(N)
```
