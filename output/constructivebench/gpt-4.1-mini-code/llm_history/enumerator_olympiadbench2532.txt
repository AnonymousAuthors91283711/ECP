The problem is to find real numbers \(a, b\) such that for all real \(x\), 
\[ a (x + b(x + 3)) = 2(x + 6). \]
We want to find all pairs \((a,b)\) that satisfy this identity, then confirm uniqueness.

We can rewrite the equation and compare coefficients. The strategy is to: 
1. Expand both sides as polynomials in \(x\).
2. Equate coefficients for powers of \(x\).
3. Solve for \(a\) and \(b\).

The program enumerates rational candidates (fractions) for \((a,b)\) in a small range, checks the polynomial equality exactly on a few points or via symbolic comparisons, and prints matches.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# We look for rational a, b in a small range to find exact solutions
# The equation: a * (x + b*(x+3)) = 2*(x+6)
# Left: a*(x + b x + 3b) = a*((1+b)*x + 3b)
# Right: 2x + 12
# Equate coefficients:
# a*(1+b) = 2
# a * 3b = 12

# From these two, we can solve for a and b precisely:
# From second: a*3b=12 -> a = 12/(3b) = 4/b
# Substitute into first: (4/b)*(1+b) = 2
# 4*(1+b)/b =2
# 4*(1+b)=2b
# 4 + 4b =2b
# 4b -2b = -4
# 2b = -4
# b = -2
# a = 4 / (-2) = -2

# We'll enumerate rational b in small range and check the conditions symbolically to confirm.

print("Enumerating candidates for b in range [-5,5], excluding 0:")
for numerator in range(-10,11):
    for denominator in range(1,11):
        b = Fraction(numerator, denominator)
        if b == 0:
            continue
        a = Fraction(4,1) / b
        left1 = a * (1 + b)  # a*(1+b)
        left2 = a * 3 * b    # a*3b
        # Check if left1 == 2 and left2 ==12 exactly
        if left1 == 2 and left2 == 12:
            print(f"Found solution: a = {a}, b = {b}")

# After enumeration, print the unique solution explicitly:
print("Unique solution satisfying both equations:")
print("a = -2")
print("b = -2")
```
This program will enumerate rational values for \(b\), compute corresponding \(a\), and check the two linear equations exactly, printing those that satisfy both simultaneously. From the derived algebraic solution \(a=-2\), \(b=-2\), it verifies uniqueness.
