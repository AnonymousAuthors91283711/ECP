The problem involves counting elements in overlapping sets (blackHair and glasses) with given totals. We want to enumerate possible values of `blackHair - both` given constraints.

```python
# Enumerate possible values of blackHair, glasses, both, total 20
# blackHair >= both, glasses >= both, both <= min(blackHair, glasses)
print("Enumerating blackHair - both values with given constraints:")

total = 20
glasses = 5
blackHair_values = range(1, total + 1)

for blackHair in blackHair_values:
    for both in range(0, min(blackHair, glasses) + 1):
        # Check that total number of people is consistent
        if (blackHair + glasses - both) <= total:
            value = blackHair - both
            print(f"blackHair={blackHair}, both={both} => blackHair - both = {value}")
```
