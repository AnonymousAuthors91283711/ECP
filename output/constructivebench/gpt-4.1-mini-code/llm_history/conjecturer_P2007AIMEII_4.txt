theorem P2007AIMEII_4 :
  ∃ (w₁ w₂ : ℕ), -- widget and whoosit production rates per worker per hour
  (100 * w₁ = 300 ∧ 100 * w₂ = 200) ∧ -- first condition
  (2 * 60 * w₁ = 240 ∧ 2 * 60 * w₂ = 300) ∧ -- second condition
  (3 * 50 * w₂ = P2007AIMEII_4_answer) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating possible (w1, w2) with conditions and computing 3*50*w2:
w1=3, w2=2 satisfy cond1; 3*50*w2=300. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<300>>>
