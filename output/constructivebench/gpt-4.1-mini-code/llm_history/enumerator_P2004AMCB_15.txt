The problem looks for natural numbers j, b both less than 100 such that:

- The tens digit of j equals the units digit of b.
- The units digit of j equals the tens digit of b.
- j + 5 = 2 * (b + 5)
- The absolute difference |j - b| equals some number P2004AMCB_15_answer.

We want to find (j, b) pairs meeting these conditions and output |j - b| values to conjecture the answer.

We'll enumerate all j,b < 100, check the digit conditions, check the equation, then print each satisfying |j-b| immediately. We print the parameters j,b as well for clarity.

```python
# Enumerate (j,b) pairs with j,b < 100 that satisfy:
#   tens(j) = units(b)
#   units(j) = tens(b)
#   j+5 = 2*(b+5)
# Then print |j-b| values found immediately.

def tens(x): return x // 10
def units(x): return x % 10

def main():
    print("Listing solutions with j,b < 100:")
    diffs = []
    for j in range(100):
        for b in range(100):
            if tens(j) == units(b) and units(j) == tens(b):
                if j + 5 == 2 * (b + 5):
                    diff = abs(j - b)
                    print(f"j={j}, b={b}, |j-b|={diff}")
                    diffs.append(diff)
    if diffs:
        print(f"Minimum |j-b| = {min(diffs)}")
    else:
        print("No solutions found")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
