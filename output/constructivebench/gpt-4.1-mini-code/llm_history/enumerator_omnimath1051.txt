The function W is defined recursively:  
- \( W(n, 0) = n^n \)  
- For \( k > 0 \), \( W(n, k) = W(W(n, k-1), k-1) \).

The problem asks to find \( W(555, 2) \mod 1000 \).

Let's enumerate smaller values of \( W(n, k) \) with varying \(n,k\) to conjecture the pattern, then compute the specific value modulo 1000 with direct calculations and print intermediate results immediately.

```python
# Enumerate W(n, k) for small n and k based on definition
def W(n, k):
    if k == 0:
        return n**n
    else:
        return W(W(n, k-1), k-1)

mod = 1000

# Explore samples for small n,k
print("Samples W(n,k) mod 1000 for n=1..5, k=0..3:")
for n in range(1, 6):
    for k in range(0, 4):
        val = W(n, k) % mod
        print(f"W({n},{k}) ≡ {val} (mod 1000)")

# Specifically compute and print W(555, 0), W(555, 1), W(555, 2) mod 1000 with streaming output
print("\nComputing W(555,0) mod 1000 = 555^555 mod 1000...")
w_555_0 = pow(555, 555, mod)
print(f"W(555,0) ≡ {w_555_0} (mod 1000)")

print("Computing W(555,1) = W(W(555,0), 0) = W(w_555_0,0) = (w_555_0)^(w_555_0) mod 1000...")
w_555_1 = pow(w_555_0, w_555_0, mod)
print(f"W(555,1) ≡ {w_555_1} (mod 1000)")

print("Computing W(555,2) = W(W(555,1), 1) = W(w_555_1,1) = W(W(w_555_1,0),0)...")
# Compute W(555,2) = W(W(555,1),1):
# W(555,2) = W(W(555,1),1) = W(W(w_555_1,0),0) = (W(w_555_1,0))^(W(w_555_1,0))
w_w_555_1_0 = pow(w_555_1, w_555_1, mod)  # W(w_555_1,0)
w_555_2 = pow(w_w_555_1_0, w_w_555_1_0, mod)
print(f"W(555,2) ≡ {w_555_2} (mod 1000)")
```
