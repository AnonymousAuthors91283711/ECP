theorem omnimath137 (R : ℚ) (hR : 0 ≤ R) :
  let (a, b, c, d, e, f) := omnimath137_answer
  |(a * (R : ℝ)^2 + b * (R : ℝ) + c) / (d * (R : ℝ)^2 + e * (R : ℝ) + f) - 2^(1/3 : ℝ)| < |(R : ℝ) - 2^(1/3 : ℝ)| := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: (0, 2, 2, 1, 0, 2)
Proposed Answer: (2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for integer coefficients (a,b,c,d,e,f) such that the rational function approximates 2^(1/3) better than the linear approximation R itself.

2. The ground truth answer (0,2,2,1,0,2) gives the function (2R + 2)/(R² + 2).

3. The proposed answer (2,2,2,1,2,2) gives the function (2R² + 2R + 2)/(R² + 2R + 2).

4. For R near 2^(1/3) ≈ 1.2599:
   - Ground truth: (2*1.2599 + 2)/(1.2599² + 2) ≈ 1.2599 (exact approximation)
   - Proposed: (2*1.2599² + 2*1.2599 + 2)/(1.2599² + 2*1.2599 + 2) ≈ 1.2586 (less accurate)

5. The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the inequality condition as well as the ground truth.
