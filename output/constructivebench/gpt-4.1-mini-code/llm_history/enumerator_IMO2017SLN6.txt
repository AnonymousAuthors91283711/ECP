The problem asks to find the smallest positive integer \( n \) for which there exists an infinite set \( s \) of vectors with positive rational entries indexed by \( \{0, \dots, n-1\} \), such that both the sum of the coordinates and the sum of their reciprocals are integers for every vector in \( s \).

To assist in conjecturing and proving the minimal such \( n \), I will enumerate candidate values of \( n \) starting from 1 up to a small threshold (e.g., 5), try to find some explicit examples of vectors where sums and sums of reciprocals are integers, and print any found instances.

Enumerating all infinite sets is impossible, so I will instead, for each fixed \( n \), search for a few sample vectors with the properties: positive rationals, integer sum, integer reciprocal sum. This might help us see if \( n=1 \), \( n=2 \), etc. are plausible.

```python
from fractions import Fraction
from itertools import product

def positive_rationals(limit=5):
    # Generate positive rationals with numerator and denominator <= limit
    for num in range(1, limit+1):
        for den in range(1, limit+1):
            yield Fraction(num, den)

def test_n(n, samples=50):
    print(f"Testing n={n}")
    # Generate candidate vectors of length n with entries from positive rationals up to limit
    limit = 5
    rationals = list(positive_rationals(limit))
    found_vectors = []
    count_tests = 0
    # We try product with repetition: all n-tuples in rationals
    for vec in product(rationals, repeat=n):
        count_tests += 1
        if count_tests > samples*100:  # limit total attempts
            break
        # Only positive, already guaranteed
        s = sum(vec)
        r = sum(1/x for x in vec)
        # Check if both sums are integers
        if s.denominator == 1 and r.denominator == 1:
            print(f"Found vector: {[float(x) for x in vec]} sum={s} reciprocal_sum={r}")
            found_vectors.append(vec)
            if len(found_vectors) >= samples:
                break
    if not found_vectors:
        print(f"No vectors found for n={n} with integer sums and reciprocal sums.")

def main():
    for n in range(1, 6):
        test_n(n)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
