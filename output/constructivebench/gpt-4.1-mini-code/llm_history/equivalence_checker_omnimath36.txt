Ground Truth Answer: False
Proposed Answer: ∀ a b : ℕ, 0 < a → 0 < b → ∃ n : ℕ, 0 < n ∧ a ∣ (b ^ n - n)
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is indeed equivalent to the negation of the original statement. The original statement is a negation of an existence claim, which is equivalent to a universal claim that for all a and b with 0 < a and 0 < b, there exists some n > 0 such that a divides (b^n - n). This is exactly what the proposed answer states. Therefore, the answers are equivalent.
