[write_program]
The given problem involves solving an equation with sums over a list of numbers. The summation is from 1 to 99 (since List.range 99 is 0 to 98, and n+1 shifts it to 1 to 99). The sum is thus the sum of the first 99 positive integers. Then we add x, divide by 101, and set equal to 100 * x. The goal is to find x.

The equation is:  
(sum_{n=1}^{99} n + x) / 101 = 100 * x

We want to find x as a real number.

I will write a Python program that:

- computes the sum of the first 99 positive integers exactly,
- solves the linear equation for x exactly,
- prints the sum, the equation rearrangement, and the solution x.

```python
# Enumerate values and solve the equation:
# (sum_{n=1}^{99} n + x)/101 = 100*x

def main():
    # sum of first 99 positive integers:
    n = 99
    s = n * (n + 1) // 2
    print(f"Sum of first {n} positive integers: {s}")
    
    # Equation: (s + x)/101 = 100*x
    # Multiply both sides by 101: s + x = 101*100*x = 10,100*x
    # Rearranged: s = 10,100*x - x = (10,099)*x
    # So x = s / 10099
    x = s / 10099
    print(f"Solution x = s / 10099 = {x}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
