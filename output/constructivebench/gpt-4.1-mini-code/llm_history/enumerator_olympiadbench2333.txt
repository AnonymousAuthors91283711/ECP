The problem seems to involve finding integer coefficients \( a, b, c, d \) (with \( d \neq 0 \)) representing the function olympiadbench2333_answer(p) as a rational function in \( p \), where \( p \in [0,1] \). Since the exact function is unspecified, we'll try to discover possible rational approximations of a sample function over various small integer coefficients, printing valid candidates immediately.

As a proxy, I'll assume a sample function over \( p \in [0,1] \) to explore. Let's take \( f(p) = p^2 \) for demonstration and enumerate all integer quadruples \( (a,b,c,d) \) with \(|a|,|b|,|c|,d \leq 5\), \( d \neq 0 \), that satisfy

\[
\frac{a p^2 + b p + c}{d} = p^2
\]

at some sample points \( p \).

We print all such quadruples that match exactly on the chosen set of sample points. This enumerates candidates for the representation. This helps conjecture the exact formula form or whether it exists.

```python
# Enumerate integer coefficients a,b,c,d with small bounds representing f(p) as rational function on [0,1]
def f(p):  # Sample function to approximate; change if needed
    return p**2

# Use sample points in [0,1]
sample_points = [0, 0.5, 1]
MAX_COEFF = 5

def approx_equal(x, y, tol=1e-12):
    return abs(x - y) < tol

print("Enumerating rational forms (a p^2 + b p + c)/ d approximating f(p) = p^2 at p in", sample_points)
for d in range(1, MAX_COEFF + 1):  # positive d only to reduce duplicates (sign absorbed into numerator)
    for a in range(-MAX_COEFF, MAX_COEFF + 1):
        for b in range(-MAX_COEFF, MAX_COEFF + 1):
            for c in range(-MAX_COEFF, MAX_COEFF + 1):
                # Check if (a p^2 + b p + c)/d == f(p) for all sample points
                matches = True
                for p in sample_points:
                    lhs = (a * p**2 + b * p + c)/d
                    rhs = f(p)
                    if not approx_equal(lhs, rhs):
                        matches = False
                        break
                if matches and d != 0:
                    print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}")

# For extremal enumeration, also show minimal denominator representations found
# The above prints all found immediately as required    
```
