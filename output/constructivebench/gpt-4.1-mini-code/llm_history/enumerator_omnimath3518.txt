The problem is essentially to solve the equation ((input - 8) / 2) + 16 = 32 for input ∈ ℕ (natural numbers). Here, division is integer division (assuming nat division).

We want to enumerate natural numbers input for which ((input - 8) / 2) + 16 = 32 holds.

Rewrite the equation:

((input - 8) / 2) + 16 = 32

=> (input - 8)/2 = 16

=> input - 8 = 32

=> input = 40

Since the right hand side is a natural number, we check integer division doesn't break the equality. For input=40:

((40-8)/2)+16 = (32/2)+16 = 16 +16 = 32, perfect.

Let's enumerate inputs from 0 to 80 and print which satisfy the equation.

```python
# Program enumerates natural numbers input (0 to 80)
# Prints those inputs satisfying ((input - 8)//2)+16 == 32

def satisfies_equation(n):
    if n >= 8:
        return ((n - 8) // 2) + 16 == 32
    else:
        # if n < 8, division would be of negative number or not defined typically
        # but since domain is natural numbers, n >= 0, integer division still works
        return ((n - 8) // 2) + 16 == 32

print("Enumerating inputs n with ((n-8)//2) +16 == 32 for n in [0..80]:")

candidates = []
for n in range(81):
    if satisfies_equation(n):
        print(n)
        candidates.append(n)

# Output the unique candidate if exists
if candidates:
    print("Unique input that satisfies equation:", candidates[0])
else:
    print("No input satisfies the equation.")
```

This program enumerates inputs from 0 to 80 printing all satisfying inputs, and then outputs the unique solution.
