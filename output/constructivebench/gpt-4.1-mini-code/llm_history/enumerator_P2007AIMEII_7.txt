The problem involves finding the greatest integer \( m \) such that there exists an integer \( k \) and a function \( n : \{0,\dots,69\} \to \mathbb{N} \) satisfying:

- For all \( i \), \( k = \lfloor \sqrt[3]{n_i} \rfloor \),
- For all \( i \), \( k \mid n_i \),
- And for some \( i \), \( m = \frac{n_i}{|k|} \).

The task is to find the maximum such \( m \).

We enumerate possible \( k \) and associate \( n_i \) as multiples of \( k \) whose cube roots have integer floor equal to \( k \). This means:

\[
k = \lfloor \sqrt[3]{n_i} \rfloor
\]
\[
k \leq \sqrt[3]{n_i} < k + 1
\]
\[
k^3 \leq n_i < (k+1)^3
\]
and also \( k \mid n_i \).

Then \( m = \frac{n_i}{|k|} \) where \( n_i \) is in the range above and divisible by \( k \).

For each \( k \), \( m \) can be any integer in

\[
\left[\frac{k^3}{|k|}, \frac{(k+1)^3 - 1}{|k|}\right]
\]

where numerator is an integer multiple of \( k \).

Since \( k \) is an integer, and \( k = \lfloor \sqrt[3]{n_i} \rfloor \), and \( n_i \geq 0 \), \( k \) should be non-negative. Let's try \( k \in [1,10] \) (since \( 70 \) entries, cube roots likely small).

Enumerate \( k \) from 1 to 10, find all \( m \) candidates in each range, and output them.

```python
# Enumerate possible m as per problem constraints

def main():
    # For n_i: floor(cube_root(n_i)) = k
    # so k^3 <= n_i < (k+1)^3
    # and k divides n_i
    # m = n_i / k
    
    print("Enumerating candidates for m:")
    max_m = 0
    max_k = 0
    max_n = 0

    # k in natural numbers (positive integers)
    for k in range(1, 11):  # limit k to 10 for computation
        start = k**3
        end = (k+1)**3 - 1
        # n_i multiples of k in [start, end]
        # For n_i in this range divisible by k, list m = n_i // k
        for n_i in range(start, end+1):
            if n_i % k == 0:
                m = n_i // k
                print(f"k={k}, n_i={n_i}, m={m}")
                if m > max_m:
                    max_m = m
                    max_k = k
                    max_n = n_i

    print(f"\nMaximum m found: {max_m} (with k={max_k}, n_i={max_n})")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
