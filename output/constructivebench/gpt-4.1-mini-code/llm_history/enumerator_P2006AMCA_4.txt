The problem appears to be to find the greatest sum of the decimal digits of a time represented as "h:mm" where h is hours from 1 to 12 and m is minutes from 0 to 59. The sum of digits is digits of hours + digits of minutes summed.

We want to enumerate all possible (h, m) values, compute the digit sums, print them, then find the maximum digit sum.

```python
# Enumerate hours 1 to 12, minutes 0 to 59
# Compute digit sums of h and m, print each sum immediately
# Keep track of max sum and print it at end

def digit_sum(n: int) -> int:
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

max_sum = -1

for h in range(1, 13):
    for m in range(60):
        s = digit_sum(h) + digit_sum(m)
        print(f"h={h}, m={m:02d}, sum={s}")
        if s > max_sum:
            max_sum = s

print(f"Maximum digit sum = {max_sum}")
```
