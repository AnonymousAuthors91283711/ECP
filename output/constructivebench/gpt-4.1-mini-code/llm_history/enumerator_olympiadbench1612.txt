The problem involves counting the difference between the number of integers from 1 to 2^n whose binary digit sum is even and those whose binary digit sum is odd.

Key insight: This is related to the parity of the sum of binary digits ("weight"). It's well-known this difference equals 0 or Â±1 for powers of two.

To explore and conjecture the closed form for n=2017, I will write a Python program that:
- Computes the difference for small n (from 1 to, e.g., 20),
- Prints all intermediate results immediately,
- Prints n and the difference for each,
- Highlights if difference is constant or has some pattern.

This helps conjecture the answer for n=2017 without direct huge computations.

```python
def bit_weight(k):
    return bin(k).count('1')

def main():
    print("n, difference (count even weight - count odd weight)")
    # Check for small n to conjecture pattern
    for n in range(1, 21):
        limit = 2**n
        even_count = 0
        odd_count = 0
        for k in range(1, limit + 1):
            if bit_weight(k) % 2 == 0:
                even_count += 1
            else:
                odd_count += 1
        diff = even_count - odd_count
        print(f"{n}, {diff}")
    print("\nConjecture: for n>=1, difference = 0 or 1 or -1")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
