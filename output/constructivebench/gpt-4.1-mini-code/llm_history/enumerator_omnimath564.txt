The problem is to find all natural numbers \( n > 1 \) such that \(\frac{n^2 + 7n + 136}{n-1}\) is a perfect square (an integer square \(m^2\)).

We can rewrite the expression and search for such \( n \) by enumerating \( n \) and checking the condition. We'll enumerate \( n \) starting from 2 up to some reasonable limit (e.g., 1000), compute the expression, check divisibility and perfect square status, and print each solution immediately.

```python
import math

# Enumerate n > 1 for n up to 1000
for n in range(2, 1001):
    numerator = n**2 + 7*n + 136
    denominator = n - 1
    if numerator % denominator == 0:
        val = numerator // denominator
        root = int(math.isqrt(val))  # integer square root
        if root * root == val:
            print(f"n = {n}, m^2 = {val} (m = {root})")
```
