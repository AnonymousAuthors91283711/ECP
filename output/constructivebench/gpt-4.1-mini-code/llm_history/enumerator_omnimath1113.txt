The problem involves enumerating rolls of 5 dice with faces 0 to 19, counting how many rolls have at least three 20s (faces showing 19), and among those, how many have all 5 dice showing 19. To assist this, we enumerate all rolls, count those meeting the criteria, and print partial results.

```python
from itertools import product

def main():
    dice_faces = range(20)
    roll_length = 5

    total = 0  # rolls with at least 3 dice = 19
    success = 0  # rolls with exactly 5 dice = 19

    # enumerate all rolls
    for roll in product(dice_faces, repeat=roll_length):
        count_19 = roll.count(19)
        if count_19 >= 3:
            total += 1
            if count_19 == 5:
                success += 1
            # print every partial result found (printing counts and current roll)
            print(f"Roll {roll} has {count_19} dice showing 19")

    # print final counts
    print(f"Total rolls with at least three 19s: {total}")
    print(f"Rolls with exactly five 19s: {success}")
    if total > 0:
        print(f"Ratio success/total = {success}/{total} = {success/total}")

if __name__=="__main__":
    main()
```
