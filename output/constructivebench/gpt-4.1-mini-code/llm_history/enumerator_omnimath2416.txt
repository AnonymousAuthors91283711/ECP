The problem defines a function \( S(m,n) = \sum_{i=1}^m i \cdot n = n \frac{m(m+1)}{2} \). Given \( S(m,n) = 120 \) and \( S(m^3, n^3) = 4032000 \), we want to find \( S(m^2, n^2) \).

To explore this, we enumerate integer pairs \((m, n)\) consistent with the first two equations and compute \( S(m^2, n^2) \). We print candidates as found.

```python
# Enumerate potential (m,n) satisfying given conditions and output S(m^2,n^2)
def S(m, n):
    return n * m * (m + 1) // 2

def main():
    # Given:
    target1 = 120
    target2 = 4032000

    # Minimal search range based on trial: m,n > 0 and S(m,n) = 120
    # Try m,n up to 50 to stay efficient
    for m in range(1, 51):
        for n in range(1, 51):
            val1 = S(m, n)
            if val1 == target1:
                # Check S(m^3, n^3)
                m3 = m**3
                n3 = n**3
                val2 = S(m3, n3)
                if val2 == target2:
                    m2 = m**2
                    n2 = n**2
                    val_ans = S(m2, n2)
                    print(f"m={m}, n={n}, S(m^2, n^2)={val_ans}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
