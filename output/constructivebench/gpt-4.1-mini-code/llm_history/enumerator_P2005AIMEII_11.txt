[write_program]
The problem defines a sequence \(a_k\) with given initial values \(a_0 = 37\), \(a_1 = 72\), and \(a_m = 0\), and a recurrence relation \(a_{k+2} = a_k - \frac{3}{a_{k+1}}\). We want to find \(m\), the length of such a sequence ending in zero. We will enumerate \(m\) and compute the sequence values to detect when \(a_m = 0\).

The program below:
- Tries values of \(m\) from 2 up to a certain limit.
- Iteratively computes the sequence \(a_k\) with exact rational arithmetic (using `fractions.Fraction`) to avoid floating-point inaccuracies.
- Prints each sequence end when \(a_m = 0\).
- At the end, prints the smallest \(m\) for which this holds.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Sequence defined by:
# a0 = 37
# a1 = 72
# a_{k+2} = a_k - 3 / a_{k+1}
# Find m > 0 such that a_m = 0

def check_sequence(m):
    a = [Fraction(37), Fraction(72)]
    for k in range(m - 1):
        # Avoid division by zero
        if a[k+1] == 0:
            return None
        next_val = a[k] - Fraction(3,1) / a[k+1]
        a.append(next_val)
    return a

max_m = 15  # reasonable upper bound for search
candidates = []
for m in range(2, max_m + 1):
    seq = check_sequence(m)
    if seq is None:
        continue
    if seq[m] == 0:
        print(f"m = {m}, sequence end a_m = 0 reached:")
        print([float(x) if x.denominator != 1 else int(x) for x in seq])
        candidates.append(m)

if candidates:
    print("\nMinimum m with a_m = 0:", min(candidates))
else:
    print("No m with a_m = 0 found up to", max_m)
```
