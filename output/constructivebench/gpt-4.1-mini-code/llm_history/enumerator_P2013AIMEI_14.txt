The problem involves an angle \(\theta\) in the interval \((\pi/2, \pi)\) satisfying \(\frac{\sin \theta}{1+\cos \theta} = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{7}\), and the goal appears to be finding coprime natural numbers \(m,n\) such that \(\sin \theta = -\frac{m}{n}\) and \(m+n\) is some minimal or unique number.

We will numerically search rational approximations \(-\frac{m}{n}\) for \(\sin \theta\) with \(m,n\) small and coprime, and check if corresponding \(\theta\) satisfies the equation. Since \(\theta \in (\pi/2, \pi)\), \(\sin \theta\) is positive, but the hypothesis has a negative sign on \(\sin \theta = -m/n\), so \(-m/n > 0 \Rightarrow m/n < 0\), which can't happen for positive \(m,n\). Possibly the sign convention means \(\sin \theta\) is negative or the problem expects negative signs specifically, but we will try small values for \(m,n\).

Let's enumerate:

1. Compute the target value \(v = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{7}\).
2. For \(m,n\) up to 30, \(m<n\) (to keep fraction <1), coprime check.
3. Check if there exists \(\theta\) that satisfies \(\theta \in (\pi/2, \pi)\) and \(\frac{\sin \theta}{1+\cos \theta} = v\) with \(\sin \theta = -m/n\).
4. Because \(\sin \theta/(1+\cos \theta) = \tan(\theta/2)\) (half angle formula), we can rewrite \( \frac{\sin \theta}{1+\cos \theta} = \tan(\theta/2) \).

Hence \(\tan(\theta/2) = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{7}\). This uniquely determines \(\theta/2\), so \(\theta = 2 \arctan(\frac{2\sqrt{2}}{7}) \approx 0.785\) radians, which is less than \(\pi/2\), contradicting \(\theta \in (\pi/2, \pi)\). But since \(\theta\in(\pi/2, \pi)\), \(\theta/2 \in (\pi/4, \pi/2)\), so \(\tan(\theta/2)\) should be >1, but \(2\sqrt{2}/7\approx 0.404\), less than 1.

Checking if the equation had a missing sign: \(\frac{\sin\theta}{1+\cos\theta} =\tan(\theta/2)\). For \(\theta \in (\pi/2, \pi)\), \(1+\cos \theta >0\) as \(\cos \theta \in (-1,0)\), so denominator positive.

The equation requires finding integers \(m,n\) with \(\sin \theta = -\frac{m}{n}\) negative since \(\sin \theta = -m/n\) but \(\theta\in (\pi/2 , \pi)\), \(\sin \theta\) positive; this indicates a sign confusion. Perhaps the problem expects negative \(\sin \theta\), so we try \(\theta \in (\pi, 3\pi/2)\) range instead.

Anyway, to follow instructions and generate candidate values for \( (m,n) \), check coprimality and approximate \(\sin \theta\) corresponding to the given ratio and print candidates.

We'll use the formula \(\sin \theta = \frac{2 \tan(\theta/2)}{1+\tan^2(\theta/2)}\). Knowing \(\tan(\theta/2) = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{7}\), calculate \(\sin \theta\) exactly, then look for coprime integer approximations \((m,n)\) with \(m+n\) minimized.

```python
from math import sqrt
from fractions import Fraction
from math import gcd

# Target value for tan(theta/2)
target = 2 * sqrt(2)/7

# Compute sin(theta) from tan(theta/2):
# sin(theta) = 2*t/(1 + t^2)
t = target
s = 2*t/(1 + t*t)  # sin(theta) exact float

# Search for coprime m,n with sin(theta) ~ m/n (positive value)
# Limiting denominators up to 30 for manageable output
max_denom = 30

# Print the exact sin value
print(f'sin(theta) exact value: {s} (~{Fraction(s).limit_denominator(max_denom)})')

# Enumerate fractions close to s
candidates = []
for n in range(1, max_denom+1):
    m_approx = round(s * n)
    for m in [m_approx-1, m_approx, m_approx+1]:
        if m > 0 and m <= n and gcd(m, n) == 1:
            approx = m / n
            diff = abs(approx - s)
            if diff < 0.01:  # close enough tolerance
                print(f'Possible: m={m}, n={n}, m+n={m+n}, approx sin={approx:.5f}')
                candidates.append((m,n,m+n))

# Output candidate with minimal m+n
if candidates:
    m_min, n_min, s_min = min(candidates, key=lambda x: x[2])
    print(f'Minimum m+n = {s_min} with m={m_min}, n={n_min}')
else:
    print("No suitable candidates found within tolerance.")
