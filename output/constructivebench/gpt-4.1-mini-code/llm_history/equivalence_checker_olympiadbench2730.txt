Ground Truth Answer: fun T => (T - 13) * (30 - 16) / (20 - 13) + 16
Proposed Answer: fun T => 2 * (T - 5)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes an arithmetic sequence where:
   - aₙ = a₁ + (n-1)d
   - a₁₆ = 13
   - a₃₀ = 20

2. The ground truth answer correctly solves for n in terms of T:
   - First finds the common difference d = (20-13)/(30-16) = 7/14 = 0.5
   - Then uses aₙ = 13 + (n-16)*0.5 to solve for n
   - Rearranges to get n = 2(T-13) + 16 = 2T - 26 + 16 = 2T - 10

3. The proposed answer gives n = 2(T-5) = 2T - 10

4. Comparing both:
   - Ground truth: n = 2T - 10
   - Proposed: n = 2T - 10

The two answers are algebraically identical, just written in different forms.
