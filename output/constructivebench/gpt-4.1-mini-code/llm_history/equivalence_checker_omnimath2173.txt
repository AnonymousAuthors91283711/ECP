abbrev omnimath2173_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath2173 : 
  ∑ k in Finset.range (2^2014), (k ^^^ (k / 2)) = omnimath2173_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 2^2013 * (2^2014 - 1)
Proposed Answer: 2 ^ (2014 - 1) * 2014
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves a sum of XOR operations (denoted by ^^^) between numbers and their halves over a range up to 2^2014.

2. The ground truth answer is 2^2013 * (2^2014 - 1), which simplifies to 2^(2013 + 2014) - 2^2013 = 2^4027 - 2^2013.

3. The proposed answer is 2^(2014 - 1) * 2014, which equals 2^2013 * 2014.

Comparing these:
- The ground truth grows exponentially with 2^4027
- The proposed answer grows exponentially with 2^2013 but multiplied by a linear term (2014)

These are clearly not equivalent. The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't match the exponential growth pattern of the ground truth.

<<<False>>>
