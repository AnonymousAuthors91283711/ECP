The problem seems to concern polynomials \( P \) and \( Q \) of degree at most \( n \) satisfying a functional equation:
\[
(P \cdot X^{n+1} + Q \cdot (X+1)^{n+1})(x) = 1 \quad \text{for all } x,
\]
and asks for the evaluation \(\operatorname{eval}_{-1/2}(Q)\).

We can try to numerically construct such \(P,Q\) for small \(n\), solve for their coefficients, and compute \(Q(-1/2)\) to conjecture the closed form \(\text{omnimath3761\_answer}(n)\).

```python
from sympy import symbols, Poly, solve, Rational, simplify

x = symbols('x')
max_n = 6  # test n=0..6

for n in range(max_n+1):
    # Define coefficients of P and Q as unknowns
    p_coeffs = symbols(f'p0:{n+1}')
    q_coeffs = symbols(f'q0:{n+1}')
    
    # Build polynomials P and Q
    P = sum(p_coeffs[i]*x**i for i in range(n+1))
    Q = sum(q_coeffs[i]*x**i for i in range(n+1))
    
    # Build the polynomial from condition:
    # P * x^{n+1} + Q * (x+1)^{n+1} == 1 for all x
    poly_eq = Poly(P*x**(n+1) + Q*(x+1)**(n+1) - 1, x)
    
    # Extract coefficients and form equations=0 for all powers
    eqs = [poly_eq.coeff_monomial(x**k) for k in range(2*n+2)]
    
    # Solve for p_i, q_i
    sol = solve(eqs, p_coeffs+q_coeffs, dict=True)
    if not sol:
        print(f"n={n}: No solution found")
        continue
    sol = sol[0]
    # Evaluate Q(-1/2)
    q_expr = Q.subs(sol)
    val = simplify(q_expr.subs(x, Rational(-1,2)))
    print(f"n={n}, Q(-1/2) = {val}")
```
This code enumerates \(n=0\) to 6, constructing and solving the system for coefficients, and prints the exact rational (or simplified) value of \(Q(-1/2)\) for each \(n\). This helps find or conjecture a closed form.
