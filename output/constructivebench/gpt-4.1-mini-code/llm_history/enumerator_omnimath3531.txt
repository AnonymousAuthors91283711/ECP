[write_program]
The problem seems to involve identifying and enumerating a sorted list of real numbers that exactly correspond to the set {3, 5/2, √10}. To assist in conjecturing or verifying this, I will write a Python program that prints these numbers and checks membership by computing approximate numeric values to verify their order.

```python
import math

# Enumerate the set elements
values = [3, 5/2, math.sqrt(10)]

# Sort the values and print approximations and exact expressions
labels = ["3", "5/2", "√10"]

# Pair approximate value with label for sorting
paired = list(zip(values, labels))
paired.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

print("Sorted values and exact representations:")
for val, label in paired:
    print(f"{label} ≈ {val:.6f}")

print("\nConfirm that these three are the only values in the supposed list:")
# Check membership by thresholds and approximations
for test_val in [2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.16]:
    membership = any(abs(test_val - v) < 1e-6 for v in values)
    print(f"{test_val} in set? {membership}")
```
