The problem is to find the smallest sum \( s \) of a sorted list \( ns \) of 6 natural numbers, where each number \( n \) and its successor \( n+1 \) together have exactly 7 divisors. We enumerate lists of length 6 sorted in non-decreasing order, check the divisor condition, and output sums as we find valid lists. Then, we find and print the minimal sum.

```python
def divisors_count(x):
    # Efficient divisor count: count divisors of x
    count = 0
    i = 1
    while i*i <= x:
        if x % i == 0:
            count += 2 if i*i != x else 1
        i += 1
    return count

def valid(n):
    # (number_of_divisors(n) + number_of_divisors(n+1)) == 7
    return divisors_count(n) + divisors_count(n+1) == 7

def main():
    # We search n from small numbers upwards where valid(n) = True
    candidates = [n for n in range(1, 100) if valid(n)]
    # Enumerate sorted 6-lists with repetitions from candidates
    # Sorting: non-decreasing means n0 <= n1 <= ... <= n5
    # We only consider small candidates given problem scale
    answers = set()
    length = 6
    from itertools import combinations_with_replacement
    print("Candidates where divisors(n)+divisors(n+1)=7:")
    print(candidates)
    for ns in combinations_with_replacement(candidates, length):
        if all(valid(n) for n in ns):
            s = sum(ns)
            print(f"Found valid ns={ns}, sum={s}")
            answers.add(s)
    if answers:
        print("Minimum sum:", min(answers))
    else:
        print("No valid lists found.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
