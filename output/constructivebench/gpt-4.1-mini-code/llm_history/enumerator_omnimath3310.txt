The problem involves solving for real numbers \(x\) satisfying:

\[
x = \sqrt{x - \frac{1}{x}} + \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{x}}.
\]

We want to find all such \(x\), in particular the unique \(y=\text{omnimath3310_answer}\).

To explore solutions and conjecture the exact answer, we can enumerate real values \(x\) around interesting ranges and check the equality. Because the domain must satisfy the radicands \(\geq 0\):

- \(x - \frac{1}{x} \geq 0\)
- \(1 - \frac{1}{x} \geq 0\)

which restricts \(x\) to positive values, or at least carefully chosen values.

We'll enumerate \(x\) in a range, compute RHS from the formula, and check how close it is to \(x\). Printing candidates with small error will allow conjecturing the actual solution. We will also try to solve the equivalent algebraic equation symbolically (if possible).

Below is the Python enumerator program enumerating real \(x\) values >0.5 and printing approximate matches:

```python
# enumerator.py
import math

def f(x):
    # returns right hand side sqrt(x - 1/x) + sqrt(1 - 1/x), or None if not defined
    try:
        t1 = x - 1/x
        t2 = 1 - 1/x
        if t1 < 0 or t2 < 0:
            return None
        return math.sqrt(t1) + math.sqrt(t2)
    except:
        return None

def approx_eq(a, b, eps=1e-8):
    return abs(a-b) < eps

print("# Enumerating solutions to x = sqrt(x - 1/x) + sqrt(1 - 1/x)")
print("# Checking for x in [0.5, 10] with step 0.001")

candidates = []
step = 0.001
x = 0.5
while x <= 10:
    rhs = f(x)
    if rhs is not None:
        if approx_eq(rhs, x, eps=1e-5):
            print(f"x ≈ {x:.6f}, rhs ≈ {rhs:.6f}")
            candidates.append(x)
    x += step

# print distinct candidates up to precision 5 decimals
distinct = []
for c in candidates:
    if not any(abs(c-d) < 1e-5 for d in distinct):
        distinct.append(c)

print("\n# Distinct solutions found (approx):")
for d in distinct:
    print(f"x ≈ {d:.6f}")

# print minimum solution found as likely candidate answer
if distinct:
    answer = min(distinct)
    print(f"\n# Candidate omnimath3310_answer ≈ {answer:.6f}")
else:
    print("# No solutions found in the enumeration range.")
```

This code will print all \(x\) around 0.5 to 10 where the equality holds nearly, helping conjecture the answer, which later can be proven rigorously.
