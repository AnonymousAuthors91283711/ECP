Ground Truth Answer: {fun x => x, fun x => -x}
Proposed Answer: {f | ∀ x, f x = x} ∪ {f | ∀ x, f x = -x}
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. Both describe the set of functions where each function is either the identity function (f(x) = x) or the negation function (f(x) = -x). The proposed answer uses set builder notation to express this as a union of two sets, which is mathematically equivalent to explicitly listing the two functions.
