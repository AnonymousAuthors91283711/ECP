abbrev omnimath629_answer : ℕ → ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath629 (n : ℕ) :
  let Sn := Icc 1 n
  let T := { (A, B, C) : Set Sn × Set Sn × Set Sn | A ⊆ B ∧ (Sn \ A) ⊆ C }
  Nat.card T = omnimath629_answer n := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n=1, |T|=4
n=2, |T|=16
n=3, |T|=64
n=4, |T|=256. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
The pattern of |T| matches 4^n for n ≥ 1, considering T is defined over subsets of Sn of size n and conditions are compatible with this count.
