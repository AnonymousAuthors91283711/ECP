This problem deals with finding all real values k for which the quartic polynomial
r^4 + k r^3 + r^2 + 4 k r + 16 = 0
has exactly one distinct real root.

To approach this, we'll:
- Enumerate possible k values over a reasonable range.
- For each k, find the roots of the quartic using numpy.roots.
- Determine the number of distinct real roots.
- Print k values for which exactly 1 distinct real root is found.

Since this is a challenging problem about the special multiplicity of roots, we'll try small integer k values first and print findings immediately.

```python
import numpy as np

def distinct_real_roots(coeffs, tol=1e-8):
    roots = np.roots(coeffs)
    real_roots = [r.real for r in roots if abs(r.imag) < tol]
    distinct_roots = set()
    for rr in real_roots:
        # Group roots by tolerance to count distinct roots
        if all(abs(rr - dr) > tol for dr in distinct_roots):
            distinct_roots.add(rr)
    return distinct_roots

print("Enumerating k in range -20 to 20:")
for k in range(-20, 21):
    coeffs = [1, k, 1, 4*k, 16]
    dr = distinct_real_roots(coeffs)
    if len(dr) == 1:
        print(f"k = {k}, unique real root at approximately {next(iter(dr))}")

# We can extend search to fractional k near found candidates later if needed
```
