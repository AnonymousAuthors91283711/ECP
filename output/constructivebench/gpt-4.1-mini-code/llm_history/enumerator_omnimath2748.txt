[write_program]
The provided snippet is a Lean proof skeleton that seems to involve some simple arithmetic expression `2 * 0 + 2 * 4`. The expression evaluates to `8`, so the answer should be `8`. To follow your instructions, I will write a Python program that enumerates values of the form `2*a + 2*b` for small values of `a` and `b` (e.g., 0 to 4), is streaming results immediately, and confirms which values occur.

This enumeration helps conjecture the plausible answer `8` based on the example `2*0 + 2*4`.

```python
# Enumerate values of 2*a + 2*b for small a,b to explore possible sums

def main():
    max_val = 4
    answers = set()
    print("Enumerating 2*a + 2*b for a,b in [0..4]:")
    for a in range(max_val + 1):
        for b in range(max_val + 1):
            val = 2 * a + 2 * b
            if val not in answers:
                answers.add(val)
                print(val)
    # Output the answer corresponding to a=0,b=4 explicitly
    print("Answer for a=0,b=4 is:", 2*0 + 2*4)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
