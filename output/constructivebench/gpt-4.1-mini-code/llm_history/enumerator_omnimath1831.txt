[write_program]
The problem deals with complex numbers \(a, b, c\) satisfying the system:
\[
a^2 = b - c, \quad b^2 = c - a, \quad c^2 = a - b,
\]
and asks about the possible values of \(a + b + c\).

I will write a Python program that tries small integer or rational values for \(a, b\) and \(c\) in a certain range and checks if these equations hold exactly (over complex numbers this can be tricky, but here I will try only integer or simple rational tuples). When a triple satisfies the system, the program will print the corresponding \(a+b+c\).

Since exact floating comparison is tricky, I will stick to integer or rational candidates, and verify the identities exactly (again assuming exact arithmetic for integers). This enumeration will help conjecture the possible sums.

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solveset, S, sqrt
from sympy.abc import a, b, c
from sympy import simplify

# Define the system
equations = [
    Eq(a**2, b - c),
    Eq(b**2, c - a),
    Eq(c**2, a - b)
]

# We will try integer values for a, b, c from -3 to 3 inclusive.
# For each triple, check if system holds.
# When true, print the sum a+b+c (as exact integer)

def check_system(a_, b_, c_):
    return (a_**2 == b_ - c_ and b_**2 == c_ - a_ and c_**2 == a_ - b_)

results = set()

print("Testing integer triples (a,b,c) with values in [-3,3]")

for A in range(-3, 4):
    for B in range(-3, 4):
        for C in range(-3, 4):
            if check_system(A, B, C):
                s = A + B + C
                if s not in results:
                    results.add(s)
                    print(f"Found solution with (a,b,c)=({A},{B},{C}), sum = {s}")

print()
if results:
    print(f"Possible sums observed: {sorted(results)}")
    print(f"Minimum sum: {min(results)}")
    print(f"Maximum sum: {max(results)}")
else:
    print("No integer solutions found in given range.")
```

This enumeration searches for integer solutions and prints the sums found, enabling conjecture of the possible sums \(a+b+c\).
