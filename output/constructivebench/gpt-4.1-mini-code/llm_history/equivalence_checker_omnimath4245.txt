theorem omnimath4245 (a b : ℕ) :
  (10 ≤ a ∧ a ≤ 99 ∧ 10 ≤ b ∧ b ≤ 99 ∧

Ground Truth Answer: {(19, 95), (16, 64), (11, 11), (26, 65), (22, 22), (33, 33), 
    (49, 98), (44, 44), (55, 55), (66, 66), (77, 77), (88, 88), (99, 99)}
Proposed Answer: {(a, b) | ∃ c d : ℕ, c < 10 ∧ d < 10 ∧ a = 10 * c + d ∧ b = 10 * d + c ∧ a * b = b * a ∧ 10 ≤ a ∧ a ≤ 99 ∧ 10 ≤ b ∧ b ≤ 99}

The proposed answer is mostly correct but has an unnecessary condition `a * b = b * a` which is always true (commutativity of multiplication) and doesn't help filter solutions. The ground truth answer lists all specific solutions that satisfy the conditions, while the proposed answer gives a general form. The proposed answer would technically include all correct pairs, but is less precise than the ground truth answer. The actual solutions in the ground truth answer do satisfy the proposed conditions.
