Ground Truth Answer: (fun x => x, Polynomial.X)
Proposed Answer: (fun x => x, X)
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer (fun x => x, X) is equivalent to the ground truth answer (fun x => x, Polynomial.X) because:
1. The identity function fun x => x is the same in both answers
2. In Lean/Mathlib, X is just a shorthand notation for Polynomial.X when working with polynomials
3. Both answers satisfy all the given conditions in the theorem (hf, hP, hP0, h)
4. The polynomial X (or Polynomial.X) has coeff 1 at degree 1 and 0 elsewhere, satisfying hP, and eval 0 = 0 satisfies hP0
