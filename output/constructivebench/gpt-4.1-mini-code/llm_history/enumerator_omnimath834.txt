The problem involves an equilateral triangle \(ABC\) with side length 18 in the complex plane, and the sum of its vertices satisfies \(\lvert a+b+c \rvert = 36\). We want to enumerate possible values of \(\lvert bc + ca + ab \rvert\).

We can parametrize \(a, b, c\) using complex numbers on the plane, ensuring that pairwise distances are 18 and \(\lvert a+b+c \rvert = 36\). Then, compute \( |bc + ca + ab| \).

Let's check some small variants by rotating and translating the triangle to satisfy the conditions approximately for various configurations, then print the values found for \( |bc+ca+ab| \). This helps conjecture the correct value.

```python
import cmath
import math

# side length
s = 18

# The equilateral triangle vertices can be represented as complex numbers:
# b and c at s on x-axis and at s*exp(i*2pi/3), a can be shifted by adding some vector w so that |a+b+c|=36
# We try various translations w = x + iy with small grids.

# First, set b=0 for convenience, then c = 18 on real axis.
# a must be at position forming equilateral triangle:
# Since |a-b|=18 and |b-c|=18, and |c-a|=18, 
# If b=0, c=18+0j, then a = 9 + 9*sqrt(3)*i or a=9 - 9*sqrt(3)*i
# We'll consider only +ve imaginary part.

b = 0 + 0j
c = 18 + 0j
a_base = 9 + 9 * math.sqrt(3) * 1j

# To vary sum = a+b+c magnitude, try adding w to all 3 points (translation)
# Let w range in small set so that |(a+w)+(b+w)+(c+w)|=|a+b+c+3w| = 36
# sum_0 = a_base + b + c
sum_0 = a_base + b + c

# sum_0 magnitude
mag_sum_0 = abs(sum_0)

# We want to find w so that |sum_0 + 3w|=36
# Let w = x + yi, then
# |sum_0 + 3w| = 36
# try grid x,y to satisfy this approx, then compute |bc + ca + ab|

# Since b=0, convenient to consider abc without offset,
# But original abc + w gives vertices, distances remain 18 (translation), so condition on side remains,
# translation doesn't affect distances, polygon shape unchanged.

# So side lengths fixed, now check for which w magnitude |sum_0 + 3w|=36

# We try integer x,y in [-10,10]

def magnitude_poly(a,b,c):
    return abs(b*c + c*a + a*b)

print(f"Base configuration sum magnitude: {mag_sum_0:.5f}")

found_values = set()

for dx in range(-10,11):
    for dy in range(-10,11):
        w = complex(dx, dy)
        new_sum = sum_0 + 3*w
        if abs(new_sum - 36) < 0.1:  # accept within tolerance
            # new vertices:
            a = a_base + w
            b1 = b + w
            c1 = c + w
            val = magnitude_poly(a, b1, c1)
            val_rounded = round(val, 5)
            if val_rounded not in found_values:
                found_values.add(val_rounded)
                print(f"w=({dx},{dy}) sum={abs(new_sum):.5f} |bc+ca+ab|={val_rounded}")

# print minimum
if found_values:
    min_val = min(found_values)
    print(f"Minimum |bc+ca+ab| found: {min_val:.5f}")
```
