The problem involves the function \( f(x) = x^2 (1 - x)^2 \) defined on the real numbers. The theorem states that \( f(0) + f(1) \) equals some constant value \( P2019AMCB_8\_answer \), and we want to find and verify this value.

We will enumerate values of \( f(x) \) at x=0 and x=1, compute their sum, and print the exact value. Since the function is explicitly known and the evaluations simple, the sum should be zero; nevertheless, we'll print it programmatically to assist conjecturing or confirming the answer.

```python
# Enumerate given function f(x) = x^2 * (1 - x)^2 at x=0 and x=1 and sum
def f(x):
    return x**2 * (1 - x)**2

x_values = [0, 1]
print("Function: f(x) = x^2 * (1 - x)^2")
results = []
for x in x_values:
    val = f(x)
    print(f"f({x}) = {val}")
    results.append(val)

total = sum(results)
print(f"Sum f(0) + f(1) = {total}")
```
