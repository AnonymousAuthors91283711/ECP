The problem involves sets \( S \subseteq \{0,1,\ldots,15\} \) that are closed under doubling modulo 16. The property \( P(S) \) is:
\[
P(S) \iff \forall x \in S, 2x \mod 16 \in S.
\]

We want to enumerate all subsets \( S \) of \(\{0,\ldots,15\}\) that satisfy this property.

Key observations:
- The set must be closed under the operation \( x \mapsto 2x \mod 16 \).
- The operation defines disjoint orbits on \(\{0,\ldots,15\}\).
- Any \( S \) with property \( P \) is a union of orbits of the doubling map.
- Zero is a fixed point since \(2\cdot 0=0\).

The orbits can be found by iterating the doubling map from each element and grouping those elements reachable by repeated doubling.

The program enumerates all orbits and then enumerates all subsets formed by unions of orbits. Each such subset is printed. Finally, it prints the total count.

```python
# Enumerate sets S ⊆ {0..15} closed under x → 2x mod 16 (doubling mod16)
# Idea: such sets are unions of orbits under doubling mod16

def doubling_orbit(start):
    orbit = []
    x = start
    while x not in orbit:
        orbit.append(x)
        x = (2*x) % 16
    return orbit

def main():
    seen = set()
    orbits = []
    # find orbits
    for i in range(16):
        if i not in seen:
            o = doubling_orbit(i)
            orbits.append(o)
            seen.update(o)
    print("orbits:", orbits)
    
    n = len(orbits)
    count = 0
    # enumerate all unions of orbits -> closed sets
    # total 2^n subsets
    for mask in range(1<<n):
        S = set()
        for i in range(n):
            if (mask >> i) & 1:
                S.update(orbits[i])
        print("Closed set:", sorted(S))
        count += 1
    print("Total closed sets:", count)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
