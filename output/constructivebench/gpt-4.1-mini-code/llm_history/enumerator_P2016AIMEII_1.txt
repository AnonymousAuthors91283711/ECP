This problem is about finding a positive integer \( a \) (called `P2016AIMEII_1_answer` here) along with \( b, c, r, d \) satisfying the conditions:
- \( a < b < c \),
- \( a + b + c = 444 \),
- \( b = a r \),
- \( c = a r^2 \),
- \( (a - 5) + d = b - 9 \),
- \( (b - 9) + d = c - 25 \).

Our goal is to enumerate plausible integer values \( a \), along with \( b, c, r, d \) that satisfy these equations for small \( a \) and \( r \) as natural numbers.

Key points:
- \( a, b, c, r, d \) are integers,
- From the geometric progression: \( b = a r \), \( c = a r^2 \). \( r \) should be an integer greater than 1 because \( a < b < c \),
- The sum condition: \( a + a r + a r^2 = 444 \Rightarrow a(1 + r + r^2) = 444 \),
- The conditions with \( d \) yield relationships between \( a, b, c \).

We will:
- Loop over possible integers \( r \) from 2 up to some small threshold,
- Calculate \( a = 444 / (1 + r + r^2) \) if integer,
- Then calculate \( b, c \),
- Solve for \( d \) using the linear equations,
- Check whether \( d \) is integer and all inequalities hold,
- Print the quadruple and answer candidates.

```python
# Enumerate integer triples (a,b,c,r,d) satisfying given conditions from a 2016 AIME problem
# Using that b = a r, c = a r^2, a(1+r+r^2)=444, and linear relations on d.

def main():
    total = 444
    print("Enumerating possible (a,b,c,r,d)...")
    # r must be integer >= 2 (since a < b < c and b = a*r, c=a*r^2)
    for r in range(2, 20):
        denom = 1 + r + r*r
        if total % denom != 0:
            continue
        a = total // denom
        b = a * r
        c = a * r * r
        if not (a < b < c):
            continue
        # From the given equations:
        # (a-5) + d = b - 9  => d = b - 9 - (a -5) = b - a -4
        # (b - 9) + d = c - 25 => d = c - 25 - (b - 9) = c - b - 16
        # Equate two expressions for d:
        d1 = b - a - 4
        d2 = c - b - 16
        if d1 != d2:
            continue
        d = d1
        # Check if d is integer (it is), no additional check needed
        print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, r={r}, d={d}")
    print("Enumeration complete.")
