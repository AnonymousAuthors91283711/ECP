The problem defines a sequence of days where each day eats a fraction of the current number of items, and the last day ends with exactly 1 item left. We want to find the smallest positive integer \( n \) that satisfies the conditions.

The conditions:
- Day 1: \( \text{day1} = n - \lfloor n/2 \rfloor \)
- Day 2: \( \text{day2} = \text{day1} - \lfloor 2 \times \text{day1}/3 \rfloor \)
- Day 3: \( \text{day3} = \text{day2} - \lfloor 3 \times \text{day2}/4 \rfloor \)
- Day 4: \( \text{day4} = \text{day3} - \lfloor 4 \times \text{day3}/5 \rfloor \)
- Day 5: \( \text{day5} = \text{day4} - \lfloor 5 \times \text{day4}/6 \rfloor \)

and we want \( \text{day5} = 1 \).

We'll search for \( n \) starting from 1 upwards, printing each \( n \) that yields \( \text{day5} = 1 \), then report the smallest such \( n \).

```python
# Enumerate n to find minimal n with given day5=1 condition
def day_transform(n):
    day1 = n - n // 2
    day2 = day1 - (2 * day1) // 3
    day3 = day2 - (3 * day2) // 4
    day4 = day3 - (4 * day3) // 5
    day5 = day4 - (5 * day4) // 6
    return day5

def main():
    found = []
    for n in range(1, 1000):  # upper bound is arbitrary; adjust if needed
        if day_transform(n) == 1:
            print(f"n = {n} yields day5 = 1")
            found.append(n)
            if len(found) > 20:  # limit to avoid excess output
                break
    if found:
        print(f"Minimal n with day5=1 is {min(found)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
