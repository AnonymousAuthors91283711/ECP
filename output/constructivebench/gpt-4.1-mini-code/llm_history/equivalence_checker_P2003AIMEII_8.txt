Ground Truth Answer: 348
Proposed Answer: 1848 + 5 * (1716 - 1440)
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer.

The problem describes two arithmetic sequences:
1. Sequence 1: a₁, a₁ + d₁, a₁ + 2d₁, ..., a₁ + 7d₁
2. Sequence 2: a₂, a₂ + d₂, a₂ + 2d₂, ..., a₂ + 7d₂

We're given:
1. a₁ * a₂ = 1440 (initial terms product)
2. (a₁ + d₁)(a₂ + d₂) = 1716 (next terms product)
3. (a₁ + 2d₁)(a₂ + 2d₂) = 1848 (terms after that product)
And we need to find (a₁ + 7d₁)(a₂ + 7d₂)

The proposed answer suggests calculating this as:
1848 + 5 * (1716 - 1440)

Let's evaluate this:
1716 - 1440 = 276
5 * 276 = 1380
1848 + 1380 = 3228

But the ground truth answer is 348, which is very different from 3228.

The proposed answer seems to be attempting a linear extrapolation, but this approach is incorrect because we're dealing with products of terms from two arithmetic sequences, not a single sequence. The relationship is quadratic, not linear.
