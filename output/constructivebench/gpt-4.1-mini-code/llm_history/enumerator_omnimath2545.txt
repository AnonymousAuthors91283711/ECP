The problem is to compute the sum over k from 0 to 8 of choose(8,k)*(1/2)^8 with k≥4. This is a partial sum of a binomial distribution's tail probabilities at p=1/2, n=8. Let's enumerate all terms k=4 to 8 exactly and print each term and the partial sum to conjecture the answer.

```python
from math import comb
from fractions import Fraction

n = 8
p = Fraction(1, 2)

print(f"Enumerating sum of C({n}, k)*(1/2)^8 for k≥4:")

total = Fraction(0,1)
for k in range(9):
    if k >= 4:
        val = Fraction(comb(n,k)) * p**n
        total += val
        print(f"k={k}, term=C({n},{k})*(1/2)^{n} = {val} (~{float(val):.6f}), partial sum = {total} (~{float(total):.6f})")

print(f"Answer (exact fraction): {total}")
print(f"Answer (decimal approx): {float(total):.6f}")
```
