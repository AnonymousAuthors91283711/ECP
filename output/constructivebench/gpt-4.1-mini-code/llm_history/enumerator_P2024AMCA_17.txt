This problem involves three integer variables \(a, b, c\) constrained by the equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
ab + c = 100 \\
bc + a = 87 \\
ca + b = 60
\end{cases}
\]
We want to find the value of \(ab + bc + ca\).

To assist the proof, I will enumerate all integer triples \((a, b, c)\) within a reasonable range (say, \(-20\) to \(20\)) that satisfy the three equations exactly, then print out each triple and compute \(ab + bc + ca\). This will help conjecture the value of the sum and verify uniqueness.

```python
# Enumerate integer triples (a,b,c) with -20 <= a,b,c <= 20 satisfying:
# a*b + c = 100, b*c + a = 87, c*a + b = 60
# Print each solution and the value ab + bc + ca

def main():
    for a in range(-20, 21):
        for b in range(-20, 21):
            # From the first equation: c = 100 - a*b
            c = 100 - a*b
            if c < -20 or c > 20:
                continue
            # Check second equation: b*c + a == 87
            if b*c + a != 87:
                continue
            # Check third equation: c*a + b == 60
            if c*a + b != 60:
                continue
            s = a*b + b*c + c*a
            print(f"Found solution: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, ab+bc+ca={s}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
