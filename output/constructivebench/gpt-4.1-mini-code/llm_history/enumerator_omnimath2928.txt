The problem involves finding the smallest number \( n \geq 100000 \) divisible by 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15, then extracting the tens digit of \( n/10 \) modulo 10. To explore this, the program will:
- Compute the LCM of 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.
- Multiply by 7 as suggested (to surpass 100000).
- Print the candidate \( n \) and the digit \((n/10) \% 10\).
- Verify minimality with respect to the constraints.

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def multi_lcm(nums):
    l = 1
    for x in nums:
        l = lcm(l, x)
    return l

# Divisors given
divisors = [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]

base_lcm = multi_lcm(divisors)
# Find smallest multiple >= 100000
start_k = (100000 + base_lcm - 1) // base_lcm

print(f"LCM of {divisors} is {base_lcm}")
print(f"Starting multiplier k from {start_k} to find n >= 100000")

for k in range(start_k, start_k + 5):  # check few multiples for safety
    n = base_lcm * k
    # Must be divisible by all divisors by construction
    if n >= 100000:
        digit = (n // 10) % 10
        print(f"n = {n}, (n//10)%10 = {digit}")

# Output minimal candidate explicitly
min_n = base_lcm * start_k
min_digit = (min_n // 10) % 10
print(f"Minimal n: {min_n}, digit: {min_digit}")
```
