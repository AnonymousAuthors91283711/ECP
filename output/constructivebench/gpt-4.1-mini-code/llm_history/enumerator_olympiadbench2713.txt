The problem is to find the exact value of the sum \(\cos^3\left(\frac{2\pi}{7}\right) + \cos^3\left(\frac{4\pi}{7}\right) + \cos^3\left(\frac{8\pi}{7}\right)\).

This is a classic trigonometric sum related to roots of unity and Chebyshev polynomials. To assist in conjecturing the exact value, we'll numerically approximate each term and the sum, printing results immediately. Since the problem involves the 7th roots of unity, let's also compute the cosines for multiples of \(2\pi/7\) and their cubes, printing them out.

```python
import math

# Angles to consider, related to k*2*pi/7 for k=1 to 6 (excluding k=0)
# The problem asks for k=1 (2pi/7), k=2 (4pi/7), and k=4 (8pi/7 mod 2pi)
angles = [2*math.pi/7, 4*math.pi/7, 8*math.pi/7]

print("Enumerating cos^3(theta) for theta = 2pi/7, 4pi/7, 8pi/7:")
cos_cubes = []
for theta in angles:
    c = math.cos(theta)
    c3 = c**3
    cos_cubes.append(c3)
    print(f"cos({theta:.5f}) = {c:.10f}, cos^3 = {c3:.10f}")

total = sum(cos_cubes)
print(f"Sum: {total:.10f}")

# To gather more insight, print cosines and cubes of all 6 values k*2pi/7 for k=1..6
print("\nCos and cos^3 for k=1 to 6 times 2pi/7:")
all_cos_cubes = []
for k in range(1,7):
    angle = 2*math.pi*k/7
    c = math.cos(angle)
    c3 = c**3
    all_cos_cubes.append(c3)
    print(f"k={k}, angle={angle:.5f}, cos={c:.10f}, cos^3={c3:.10f}")

print("\nSum of all cos^3(k*2pi/7), k=1..6:")
print(f"{sum(all_cos_cubes):.10f}")
```
