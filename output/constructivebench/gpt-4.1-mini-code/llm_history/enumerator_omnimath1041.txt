The problem is to find the greatest size \( n \) of a subset \( S \) of \(\{0, \ldots, 42\}\) for which each element \( m \in S \) satisfies:

\[
|\{ x \in S : x < m \}| < \frac{m}{2}.
\]

We enumerate all subsets \( S \subseteq \{0,\ldots,42\} \), check the condition for each, and track the maximum size found. To keep it efficient, we generate subsets by increasing sizes and stop when no valid subset of that size exists. We print each candidate size as soon as found.

```python
# Enumerate subsets S of {0,...,42} with condition:
# for each m in S, number of elements less than m in S < m/2
# Print sizes of such subsets and the maximum size.

from itertools import combinations

max_n = 0
max_S = None
universe = list(range(43))

def valid(S):
    S_sorted = sorted(S)
    for idx, m in enumerate(S_sorted):
        # number of S elements less than m is idx (since S_sorted sorted ascending)
        if idx >= m / 2:
            return False
    return True

# We try subset sizes from large down to small to find max early
for size in range(43, 0, -1):
    found = False
    # Iterate combinations of 'size' from universe
    for comb in combinations(universe, size):
        if valid(comb):
            print(f"Valid subset size found: {size}, example: {comb}")
            found = True
            max_n = size
            max_S = comb
            break  # print only one example per size for brevity
    if found:
        # Once found max size subset, stop
        break

print(f"Maximum valid subset size: {max_n}")
```
