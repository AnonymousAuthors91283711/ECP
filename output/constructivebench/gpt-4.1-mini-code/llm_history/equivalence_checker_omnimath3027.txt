  Real.sqrt ((Real.sqrt 81 + Real.sqrt 81) / 2) = omnimath3027_answer :=
sorry

Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: 3
Let me analyze this problem carefully.

The problem involves evaluating the expression:
Real.sqrt ((Real.sqrt 81 + Real.sqrt 81) / 2)

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Real.sqrt 81 = 9 (since 9 × 9 = 81)
2. So numerator becomes (9 + 9) = 18
3. Denominator is 2, so we have 18/2 = 9
4. Now we take Real.sqrt of 9, which is 3

The proposed answer is indeed 3, which matches our step-by-step calculation. The ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" which typically means it's intentionally left blank in Lean proofs, but based on the mathematical evaluation, the proposed answer is correct.

<<<True>>>
