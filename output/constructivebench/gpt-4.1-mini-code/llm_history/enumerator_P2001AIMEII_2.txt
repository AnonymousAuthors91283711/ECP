This problem involves bounding the intersection size \( B \) of two sets \( S \) and \( F \) with given size constraints and total union size. We want to enumerate all feasible values of \( B \) given:

- \( S + F - B = 2001 \)
- \( 0.80 \times 2001 \leq S \leq 0.85 \times 2001 \)
- \( 0.30 \times 2001 \leq F \leq 0.40 \times 2001 \)
- \( B \leq \min(S, F) \)

We will iterate over reasonable \( S, F \) in these integer ranges, find \( B \), and print all feasible \( B \). Then print the minimum and maximum \( B \), and their difference.

```python
# Enumerate values of S, F, B satisfying constraints to find range of B = |S âˆ© F|
def main():
    total = 2001
    S_lb = int(0.80 * total)  # lower bound for S
    S_ub = int(0.85 * total)  # upper bound for S
    F_lb = int(0.30 * total)  # lower bound for F
    F_ub = int(0.40 * total)  # upper bound for F

    feasible_B = set()

    # Iterate over integer S, F in bounds
    for S in range(S_lb, S_ub + 1):
        for F in range(F_lb, F_ub + 1):
            # From S + F - B = total, get B
            B = S + F - total
            if B <= 0:
                continue  # B must be positive since it's intersection size
            if B <= min(S, F):
                feasible_B.add(B)
                print(f"Feasible B={B} for S={S}, F={F}")

    if feasible_B:
        m = min(feasible_B)
        M = max(feasible_B)
        print(f"Minimum feasible B: {m}")
        print(f"Maximum feasible B: {M}")
        print(f"Difference M - m: {M - m}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
