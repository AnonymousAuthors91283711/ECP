[write_program]
The problem asks to find the unique real number \( x \) with \( 0 < x < 90 \) such that \( 90 - x = \frac{1}{4}(180 - x) \). The task is to enumerate the solution(s) to assist in conjecturing the true answer.

We can rewrite the equation and solve it exactly, but here we will write a program that checks values of \( x \) in the interval \((0, 90)\), and prints those values where the equation holds (or nearly holds), focusing on exact fractional calculations or small integer values by enumeration. Since the equation can be rearranged to a simpler form, the program will also compute the exact solution for reference.

```python
# Enumerate candidates x in (0,90) to find x satisfying 90 - x = 0.25 * (180 - x)
# We'll check values with some granularity and print solutions that satisfy the equation exactly or approximately.

def check_equation(x):
    left = 90 - x
    right = 0.25 * (180 - x)
    return abs(left - right) < 1e-9  # tolerance

def main():
    print("Checking values x in (0, 90)...")
    # We expect one solution, let's try integer and fractional candidates
    # Check integer values first
    for x in range(1, 90):
        if check_equation(x):
            print(f"Found integer solution: x = {x}")
    # Check tenths
    step = 0.1
    x = step
    while x < 90:
        if check_equation(x):
            print(f"Found solution at x = {x}")
        x += step
    print("Deriving exact solution from equation:")
    # Solve: 90 - x = (1/4)(180 - x)
    # => 90 - x = 45 - x/4
    # => 90 - 45 = - x/4 + x
    # => 45 = (3/4) x
    # => x = 45 * (4/3) = 60
    x_exact = 60
    print(f"Exact solution: x = {x_exact}")
