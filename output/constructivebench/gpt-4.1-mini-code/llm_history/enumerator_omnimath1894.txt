The problem asks to characterize all real functions \( f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) satisfying the functional equation

\[
f(x^2 + f(y)) = f(f(x)) + f(y^2) + 2 f(x y)
\]

for all real \( x,y \).

A standard approach is to try candidate functions, especially polynomials of low degree, such as constants, linear, quadratic, etc. The equation has quadratic terms and nested \( f \), so quadratic candidates are natural.

This program will test all polynomials of degree up to 2 with integer coefficients in a small range and check if the equation holds for several sample points (because infinite verification is impossible). If it holds on these points, print the polynomial as a candidate solution.

This enumeration can help conjecture the true solution set.

```python
import itertools

def poly(x, coeffs):
    # coeffs = (a0, a1, a2) for a0 + a1*x + a2*x^2
    return coeffs[0] + coeffs[1]*x + coeffs[2]*x*x

# Check the functional equation for a candidate polynomial f with given coeffs
def check_eq(coeffs):
    # test on selected sample points
    xs = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]
    ys = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]
    for x in xs:
        fx = poly(x, coeffs)
        ffx = poly(fx, coeffs)
        for y in ys:
            fy = poly(y, coeffs)
            lhs = poly(x*x + fy, coeffs)
            rhs = ffx + poly(y*y, coeffs) + 2*poly(x*y, coeffs)
            if lhs != rhs:
                return False
    return True

print("Testing quadratic polynomials f(x)=a0 + a1 x + a2 x^2 with coefficients in [-3,3]")
for a0, a1, a2 in itertools.product(range(-3,4), repeat=3):
    # skip trivial (0,0,0) as always zero function
    # will be printed anyway
    if check_eq((a0,a1,a2)):
        print(f"Candidate solution: f(x) = {a2} x^2 + {a1} x + {a0}")

# To help conjecture, key known solutions may appear among candidates.
```
