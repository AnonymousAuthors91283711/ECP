The problem is to find the smallest nonnegative integer \( t \) such that there exist positive rational painting rates \( p, h_1, h_2 \) with \( h_1 \neq h_2 \) satisfying the given coverage equations for three days' work durations adjusted by \( t \). We will enumerate candidates for \( t \) starting from 0 upwards, then for each \( t \), try simple rational values for \( p, h_1, h_2 \) (with small denominators), and check if the three equations are simultaneously satisfied exactly.

Since the problem involves fractions and equations, we'll optimize by expressing the system algebraically:

The given conditions are:
- \( (p + h_1 + h_2)(480 - t) = \frac{1}{2} \)
- \( (h_1 + h_2)(372 - t) = \frac{24}{100} = \frac{6}{25} \)
- \( p (672 - t) = \frac{1}{2} \)

From the last, \( p = \frac{1/2}{672 - t} \).

From the second, \( h_1 + h_2 = \frac{6/25}{372 - t} = \frac{6}{25 (372 - t)} \).

Then the first becomes:

\[
\left(\frac{1/2}{672 - t} + h_1 + h_2 \right)(480 - t) = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Substitute \( h_1 + h_2 \):

\[
\left(\frac{1/2}{672 - t} + \frac{6}{25 (372 - t)} \right)(480 - t) = \frac{1}{2}
\]

We check for integer \( t \) if this equation holds exactly (as a rational equality). If so, then for that \( t \), find \( h_1, h_2 \) positive rationals with \( h_1 \neq h_2 \) and sum equal to the value above, so any differing splitting works.

Therefore, the main constraint is the above equation. We'll enumerate \( t = 0,1,\ldots,100 \) and check the equality exactly with fractions. For each \( t \) making the equation true, we print it with sample values of \( p, h_1, h_2 \). We'll show \( h_1, h_2 \) splitting the sum with a small difference.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def check_t(t):
    # Compute p, hsum
    den_p = 672 - t
    den_h = 372 - t
    den_m = 480 - t
    if den_p <= 0 or den_h <= 0 or den_m <= 0:
        return None
    p = Fraction(1,2) / den_p
    hsum = Fraction(6,25) / den_h
    lhs = (p + hsum) * den_m
    if lhs == Fraction(1,2):
        # Find h1, h2 different positive rationals summing to hsum
        # Try h1 = hsum * 1/3, h2 = hsum * 2/3 (different positive)
        h1 = hsum * Fraction(1,3)
        h2 = hsum - h1
        # Check positivity and difference
        if h1 > 0 and h2 > 0 and h1 != h2:
            return (t, p, h1, h2)
    return None

print("t | p (rate p) | h1       | h2       | Check sums")
for t in range(0,101):
    res = check_t(t)
    if res:
        t, p, h1, h2 = res
        # Verify all conditions numerically for safety
        cond1 = (p + h1 + h2)*(480 - t) == Fraction(1,2)
        cond2 = (h1 + h2)*(372 - t) == Fraction(6,25)
        cond3 = p*(672 - t) == Fraction(1,2)
        print(f"{t} | {p} | {h1} | {h2} | {cond1}, {cond2}, {cond3}")
# From above output, smallest feasible t is minimal solution.
```
This script enumerates \( t \) and checks exact fraction equality, printing all valid solutions to conjecture the minimal \( t \).
