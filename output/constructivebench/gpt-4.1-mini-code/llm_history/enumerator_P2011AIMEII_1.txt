The problem involves finding positive coprime integers \( m \) and \( n \) such that \((n - m) \cdot 9 = 2 \left(\frac{n}{2} - 2m \right)\). Based on this equation, the program will enumerate small positive integers \(m, n\), check coprimality and the equation condition, and print valid pairs along with their sum \(m + n\). It searches for all valid pairs where \(m, n \leq 100\) to guess the sum value and check uniqueness.

```python
from math import gcd

# Enumerate positive coprime pairs (m,n) with m,n<=100 satisfying:
# (n - m)*9 = 2*(n/2 - 2*m)  => integer n/2 needed

max_val = 100
found_sums = set()

for m in range(1, max_val+1):
    for n in range(m+1, max_val+1):  # n > m to make (n - m) positive (optional)
        if gcd(m, n) == 1 and n % 2 == 0:
            left = (n - m) * 9
            right = 2 * (n//2 - 2 * m)
            if left == right:
                s = m + n
                found_sums.add(s)
                print(f"Found (m,n)=({m},{n}), sum={s}")

# Report the unique sums found
if len(found_sums) == 1:
    s = next(iter(found_sums))
    print(f"Unique sum satisfying conditions: {s}")
else:
    print("Multiple sums found:", sorted(found_sums))
```
