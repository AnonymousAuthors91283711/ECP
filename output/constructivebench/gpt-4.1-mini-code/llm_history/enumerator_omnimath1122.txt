[write_program]
The problem deals with evaluating the sum of two probabilities in a binomial-like expression. We want to find the exact value of 

C(6,4)*(2/3)^5*(1/3)^2 + C(6,4)*(1/3)^5*(2/3)^2

where C(6,4) is "6 choose 4".

We will write a Python program to compute and print these values step-by-step, then print the summed answer as a rational number.

```python
from math import comb
from fractions import Fraction

def print_probabilities():
    n = 6
    k = 4
    c = comb(n, k)  # choose(6,4)
    # Define fractions precisely
    p1 = Fraction(2,3)
    q1 = Fraction(1,3)
    term1 = c * (p1**5) * (q1**2)
    term2 = c * (q1**5) * (p1**2)
    
    print(f"choose({n},{k}) = {c}")
    print(f"(2/3)^5 = {p1**5}")
    print(f"(1/3)^2 = {q1**2}")
    print(f"Term 1 = C(6,4)*(2/3)^5*(1/3)^2 = {term1}")
    print(f"(1/3)^5 = {q1**5}")
    print(f"(2/3)^2 = {p1**2}")
    print(f"Term 2 = C(6,4)*(1/3)^5*(2/3)^2 = {term2}")
    
    answer = term1 + term2
    print(f"Sum = Term 1 + Term 2 = {answer}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print_probabilities()
```
