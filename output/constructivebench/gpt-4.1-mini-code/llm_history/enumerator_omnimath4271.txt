The problem is to find positive integers \(m, n\) such that:
\[
\frac{1}{n^2} - \frac{3}{2n^3} = \frac{1}{m^2}
\]
and to identify the unique pair \((m,n)\) satisfying this.

We will enumerate over small positive integers \(m,n\), compute the left and right sides exactly as rational numbers, and print pairs that satisfy this equality exactly.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Enumerate positive integers m,n up to a limit
LIMIT = 1000

for n in range(1, LIMIT+1):
    left = Fraction(1, n**2) - Fraction(3, 2 * n**3)
    for m in range(1, LIMIT+1):
        right = Fraction(1, m**2)
        if left == right:
            print(f"Found solution: m={m}, n={n}, (1/n^2 - 3/(2 n^3)) = 1/m^2 = {left}")
```
