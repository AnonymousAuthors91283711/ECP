The problem requires finding the number of positive integer solutions \((m,n)\) to the linear Diophantine equation:
\[ 20m + 12n = 2012 \]

We will enumerate pairs of positive integers \(m, n\) satisfying the equation, print them as we find them, and finally output the count of such pairs.

```python
# Enumerate positive integer solutions (m,n) to 20m + 12n = 2012
# Print each solution as found, then print total count.

def main():
    total = 0
    target = 2012
    for m in range(1, target // 20 + 1):  # m > 0
        remainder = target - 20 * m
        # Check if remainder is positive and divisible by 12
        if remainder > 0 and remainder % 12 == 0:
            n = remainder // 12
            if n > 0:
                print(f"m={m}, n={n}")
                total += 1
    print(f"Total solutions: {total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
