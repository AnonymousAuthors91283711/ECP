The problem asks to find all natural numbers \(x\) such that 
\[ 2^x \cdot (4 - x) = 2x + 4. \]

We will iterate over some values of \(x \in \mathbb{N}\), check the equality, and print all solutions found. Then we will conjecture about the complete solution set from this enumeration.

```python
# Enumerate x in a reasonable range and print those satisfying 2^x * (4 - x) = 2x + 4

def check_eq(x):
    return (2**x) * (4 - x) == 2*x + 4

print("Testing for x in 0..20")
for x in range(21):
    if check_eq(x):
        print("Solution found:", x)
```
