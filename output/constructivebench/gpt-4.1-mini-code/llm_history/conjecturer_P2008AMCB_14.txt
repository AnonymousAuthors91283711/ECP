  log b / log a = P2008AMCB_14_answer a b := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating (a, b) and ratio log(b)/log(a) for samples satisfying conditions:
a=2.00000, b=8.82498, log(b)/log(a) = 3.1415926536
a=3.00000, b=31.54428, log(b)/log(a) = 3.1415926536
a=10.00000, b=1385.45573, log(b)/log(a) = 3.1415926536

Conjecture: log(b)/log(a) = π. Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ → ℝ
<<<fun a b => Real.pi>>>
