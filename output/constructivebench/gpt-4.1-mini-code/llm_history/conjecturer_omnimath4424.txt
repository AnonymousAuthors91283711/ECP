The error comes from attempting to refer to `a₀`, which is a variable in the theorem's context, inside the definition of `omnimath4424_answer`, which is outside that context. To fix it, we must make `omnimath4424_answer` a predicate dependent on `a₀ : ℕ`, so it can be expressed with `a₀` visible.

From the recurrence:

aₙ = 5 * aₙ₋₁ + 4, a₀ given.

The closed form for this linear recurrence is:

aₙ = C * 5^n - 1, for some constant C depending on a₀.

Checking the initial term:

a₀ = C * 5^0 - 1 = C - 1 ⇒ C = a₀ + 1

So:

aₙ = (a₀ + 1) * 5^n - 1

In particular,

a₅₄ = (a₀ + 1) * 5^{54} - 1

We want 2013 | a₅₄ ⇒ 2013 divides ((a₀ + 1) * 5^{54} - 1)

Which rearranged is:

(a₀ + 1) * 5^{54} ≡ 1 (mod 2013)

So

a₀ + 1 ≡ inverse_mod(5^{54}, 2013) mod 2013

We can call this inverse modulus `inv`.

Hence,

a₀ ≡ inv - 1 mod 2013

Enumerated answers seem to show a particular representative `1533`.

Thus, the answer is that there exists k : ℕ such that

a₀ = 1533 + 2013 * k

This involves mentioning `a₀` in the predicate, so we define

`omnimath4424_answer (a₀ : ℕ) : Prop := ∃ k : ℕ, a₀ = 1533 + 2013 * k`

Then the theorem statement becomes

`∀ a₀ > 0, ... ↔ omnimath4424_answer a₀`

Hence, the fixed and general answer is:

1533. Expected Answer Type: Prop
The error comes from trying to define `omnimath4424_answer` as a `Prop` with a lambda expression with an argument, which is not valid syntax. Instead, `omnimath4424_answer` should be a proposition parameterized by `a₀`.

Given the problem, the sequence \((a_n)\) is defined by:
- \(a_0 = a₀ > 0\)
- \(a_n = 5a_{n-1} + 4\) for \(n \ge 1\)

We want the characterization of \(a₀\) such that \(2013 \mid a_{54}\).

We can solve the recurrence explicitly:
\[
a_n = 5^n a_0 + 4 \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 5^k = 5^n a_0 + 4 \cdot \frac{5^n - 1}{5 -1} = 5^n a_0 + (5^n -1)
\]
Since denominator 4 is used, the sum is \(\frac{5^n - 1}{4}\), multiplied by 4 cancels.

Therefore:
\[
a_n = 5^n a_0 + (5^n -1)
\]

Hence:
\[
a_{54} = 5^{54} a_0 + (5^{54} -1)
\]

We want \(2013 \mid a_{54}\), which is equivalent to:
\[
a_{54} \equiv 0 \pmod{2013} \implies 5^{54} a_0 + (5^{54} -1) \equiv 0 \pmod{2013}
\]
\[
\implies 5^{54} a_0 \equiv - (5^{54} -1) \pmod{2013}
\]
\[
\implies 5^{54} a_0 \equiv 1 - 5^{54} \pmod{2013}
\]

Now multiply both sides by the inverse of \(5^{54}\) mod 2013 (exists because 2013 and 5 are coprime):

\[
a_0 \equiv (1 - 5^{54}) \cdot (5^{54})^{-1} \pmod{2013}
\]

Simplify:
\[
a_0 \equiv 5^{-54} - 1 \pmod{2013}
\]

But \(5^{-54} \equiv 5^{(-54 \bmod  \phi(2013))} \pmod{2013}\), using Euler's theorem. So compute \(5^{54} \bmod 2013\) to find a numeric value.

The enumerated answer says \(a_0 \equiv 1533 \pmod{2013}\).

Therefore, the proposition is:
\[
\exists k: \mathbb{N}, a_0 = 1533 + 2013 k
\]

To fix syntax and fit Lean's style, `omnimath4424_answer` should be a predicate on \(a_0\):

```lean
def omnimath4424_answer (a₀ : ℕ) : Prop := ∃ k : ℕ, a₀ = 1533 + 2013 * k
```

Or equivalently with `∃ k, a₀ ≡ 1533 [MOD 2013]`.

But the problem requires a `Prop` value named `omnimath4424_answer` likely parameterized by \(a_0\).

Hence, the corrected Lean expression enclosed in `<<< >>>` is:

The error arises because `abbrev` expects a term, but `def` is being used inside it, which is not allowed. Also, you declared `omnimath4424_answer` twice.

Since `omnimath4424_answer` should be a `Prop` depending on `a₀`, declare it as a function returning `Prop`, without conflicting declarations.

Given the recurrence and the divisibility condition at n=54, the enumerated answers suggest that `a₀` must lie in the arithmetic progression starting at 1533 with difference 2013.

Hence, the corrected answer is a function of `a₀` that states there exists `k` such that `a₀ = 1533 + 2013 * k`. This aligns with the enumerated solutions and the problem's condition.

Explanation:

The error arises because `omnimath4424_answer` is declared as a `Prop`, but your expression is a function from `ℕ` to `Prop`. To fix it, you need to incorporate the given `a₀` value as a parameter and express the proposition accordingly.

The problem states: there exists a sequence `(a : ℕ → ℕ)` with `a 0 = a₀ > 0`, satisfying the recurrence `a n = 5 * a (n-1) + 4` for `n ≥ 1`, and `2013` divides `a 54`.

By solving the recurrence, one finds explicit formula for `a_n` in terms of `a₀`:

- The homogeneous part has characteristic root `5`, with general solution `a_n = C*5^n - 1`.
- Using the initial condition `a_0 = a₀ = C - 1`, so `C = a₀ + 1`.
- Hence, `a_n = (a₀ + 1)*5^n - 1`.

For `a_54` divisible by 2013, require:

`2013 | a_54 = (a₀ + 1)*5^54 -1 --> a₀ +1 ≡ 5^{-54} mod 2013`

Calculate `a₀ ≡ 5^{-54} -1 mod 2013`, which reduces to `a₀ = 1533 + 2013*k` for some `k`.

Thus the answer should be a proposition stating existence of `k` such that `a₀ = 1533 + 2013 * k`.

Because the given `omnimath4424_answer` is of type `Prop`, and `a₀` is a parameter of the theorem, incorporate `a₀` into `omnimath4424_answer` as a parameter.

Hence propose:

`abbrev omnimath4424_answer (a₀ : ℕ) : Prop := ∃ k : ℕ, a₀ = 1533 + 2013 * k`

Final answer enclosed:
