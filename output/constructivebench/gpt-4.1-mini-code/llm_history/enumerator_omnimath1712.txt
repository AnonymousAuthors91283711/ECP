The problem suggests a function \( f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R} \) with \( f(x+y) = f(x)f(y) \) and \( f(x) > 0 \). Such functions are known to be exponential functions \( f(n) = a^n \) with some base \( a > 0 \).

Given \( f(19) = 524288 \times k \), we want to find \( f(4) \) in terms of \( k \).

- Since \( f(19) = a^{19} = 524288 \times k \),
- and \( f(4) = a^4 \),
- then \( f(4) = (f(19))^{4/19} = (524288 \times k)^{4/19} \).

Note that \( 524288 = 2^{19} \). This simplifies to:

\[
f(4) = (2^{19} \times k)^{4/19} = 2^4 \times k^{4/19} = 16 \times k^{4/19}.
\]

We can verify this numerically for some values of \( k \), printing values for \( f(4) \).

```python
# Enumerate possible values of f(4) given f(19) = 524288 * k
# for sample values of k > 0 and check the exponential relation f(n+m) = f(n)*f(m).

def f4_from_k(k):
    # f(4) = 16 * k**(4/19)
    return 16 * k**(4/19)

def main():
    print("Enumerating f(4) values from various k with f(19) = 524288 * k")
    # sample k values including 1 (where f(19)=2^19), and a few others
    ks = [0.5, 1, 2, 10]
    for k in ks:
        f4 = f4_from_k(k)
        print(f"k = {k}, f(4) = {f4:.10f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This program outputs sample values for \( f(4) \) given \( k \) and the functional equation, illustrating how \( f(4) \) depends on \( k \), which supports the conjecture \( f(4) = 16 \cdot k^{4/19} \).
