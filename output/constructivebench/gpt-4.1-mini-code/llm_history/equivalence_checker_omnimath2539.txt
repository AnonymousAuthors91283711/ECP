Ground Truth Answer: (3, 28)
Proposed Answer: (1, 8)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a pair of coprime natural numbers (m, n) that satisfy:
   - The product ∏(1 - 1/(i+2)) for i from 0 to 6 equals m/n
   - 100*m + n = 108

2. Calculating the product:
   ∏(1 - 1/(i+2)) from i=0 to 6 = (1/2)*(2/3)*(3/4)*(4/5)*(5/6)*(6/7)*(7/8) = 1/8

3. Ground Truth Answer (3, 28):
   - 3 and 28 are coprime
   - 3/28 ≠ 1/8
   - 100*3 + 28 = 328 ≠ 108

4. Proposed Answer (1, 8):
   - 1 and 8 are coprime
   - 1/8 = 1/8 (matches the product)
   - 100*1 + 8 = 108 (matches the equation)

The ground truth answer doesn't satisfy either condition, while the proposed answer satisfies both perfectly. This suggests the ground truth answer might be incorrect or for a different problem.
