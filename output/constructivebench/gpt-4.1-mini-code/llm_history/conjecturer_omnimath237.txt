abbrev omnimath237_answer : Set (Int × Int × Int) := sorry
theorem omnimath237 (a b c : Int) :
    a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = a^2 * b^2 ↔ (a, b, c) ∈ omnimath237_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: (a,b,c)=(0,0,0) satisfies a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = a^2 * b^2. Expected Answer Type: Set (Int × Int × Int)
<<<{(a,b,c) | (a = 0 ∧ b = 0 ∧ c = 0) ∨ (a = 1 ∧ b = 0 ∧ c = 0) ∨ (a = 0 ∧ b = 1 ∧ c = 0)}>>>
