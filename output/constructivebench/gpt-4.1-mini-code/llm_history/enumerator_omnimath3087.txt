[write_program]
The expression simplifies to \( \frac{4x}{x + 2x} = \frac{4x}{3x} = \frac{4}{3} \) for any \( x \neq 0 \). To assist in conjecturing this, I'll write a program that evaluates the function for values x > 0 and print results immediately.

```python
# Enumerate values of x and compute 4*x / (x + 2*x) = 4/3
def f(x):
    return 4 * x / (x + 2 * x)

print("Enumerating values for x from 1 to 10:")
for x in range(1, 11):
    val = f(x)
    print(f"x = {x}, value = {val}")

print("Conjecture: value is always 4/3 when x != 0")
```
