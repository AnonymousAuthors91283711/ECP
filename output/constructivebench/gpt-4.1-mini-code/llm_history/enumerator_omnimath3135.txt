[write_program]
The problem is about a finite set S and the fraction of ordered pairs (a,b) with a ≠ b such that a*b = 0. We want to find the ratio of favorable pairs to total pairs, where S = {-3, -1, 0, 2, 4}.

I'll write a Python program to compute:
- The set S,
- The pairs with a ≠ b,
- The pairs where a*b = 0,
- The ratio favorable/total as a rational number,
and print the intermediate and final results.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def main():
    S = {-3, -1, 0, 2, 4}
    print("Set S:", S)
    pairs = [(a,b) for a in S for b in S if a != b]
    total_pairs = len(pairs)
    print("Total pairs (a != b):", total_pairs)
    favorable = [(a,b) for (a,b) in pairs if a * b == 0]
    favorable_count = len(favorable)
    print("Favorable pairs (a*b==0):", favorable_count)
    print("Favorable pairs list:", favorable)
    ratio = Fraction(favorable_count, total_pairs)
    print("Ratio favorable/total as Fraction:", ratio)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
