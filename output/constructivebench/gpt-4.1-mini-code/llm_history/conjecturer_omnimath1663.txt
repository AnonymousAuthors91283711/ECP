abbrev omnimath1663_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath1663 :
  ∃ (p q : ℚ[X]), degree p ≤ 2 ∧ degree q ≤ 2 ∧
  (∀ n ∈ ({1, 2, 3, 4, 5} : Finset ℕ), eval (n : ℚ) p / eval (n : ℚ) q = (n : ℚ)^3) ∧
  eval 0 p / eval 0 q = omnimath1663_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Searching for integer polynomials p,q with coefficients in [-5..5].... Expected Answer Type: ℚ
