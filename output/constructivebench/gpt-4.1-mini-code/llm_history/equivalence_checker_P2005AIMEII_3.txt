Ground Truth Answer: (9, 10)
Proposed Answer: (89, 90)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding a unique rational number r (in reduced form) that satisfies certain conditions related to infinite series sums.

2. The conditions involve:
   - A geometric series sum ∑(a*r^n) = 2005
   - The sum of squares ∑(a*r^n)^2 = 20050
   - r must be in (-1,1) for the series to converge

3. For a geometric series ∑(a*r^n), the sum is a/(1-r) = 2005
4. For the squared series ∑(a²*r^(2n)), the sum is a²/(1-r²) = 20050

5. Solving these equations:
   - From first equation: a = 2005(1-r)
   - Substitute into second: (2005(1-r))²/(1-r²) = 20050
   - Simplify: 2005²(1-r)²/((1-r)(1+r)) = 20050
   - Further simplify: 2005²(1-r)/(1+r) = 20050
   - Solve for r: (1-r)/(1+r) = 20050/2005² = 2/401
   - Cross multiply: 401(1-r) = 2(1+r)
   - 401 - 401r = 2 + 2r
   - 399 = 403r
   - r = 399/403 = 0.99007... (but this doesn't match either answer)

Wait, this suggests neither (9,10) nor (89,90) is correct. However, the ground truth is given as (9,10), which would be r=0.9.

Let me check with r=0.9:
- a = 2005(1-0.9) = 200.5
- Sum of squares: (200.5)²/(1-0.81) = 40200.25/0.19 ≈ 211580.26 ≠ 20050

This doesn't match. Similarly for r=89/90≈0.9889:
- a ≈ 2005(1-0.9889) ≈ 22.2555
- Sum of squares ≈ (22.2555)²/(1-(89/90)²) ≈ 495.257/(0.0219) ≈ 22614.47 ≠ 20050

Neither answer seems to satisfy the original conditions. However, since the ground truth is given as (9,10), and the proposed answer is different, they are not equivalent.

<<<False>>>
