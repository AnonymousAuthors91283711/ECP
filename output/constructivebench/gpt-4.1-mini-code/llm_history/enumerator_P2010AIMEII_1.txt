The problem involves finding the greatest multiple of 36 such that every digit is an even digit and all digits are distinct. The example given in the theorem hints at the number formed by digits [8,6,4,2,0]. We want to enumerate such numbers divisible by 36, with distinct even digits, and find the maximum.

For n digits, choose distinct even digits from {0,2,4,6,8}, form numbers divisible by 36, and print them. We'll check divisibility by 36 = 4 * 9: last two digits divisible by 4, and sum of digits divisible by 9.

We print all such numbers up to 5 digits (since only 5 distinct even digits), then print the max.

```python
from itertools import permutations

def divisible_by_4(n):
    # Last two digits form number divisible by 4
    if n < 10:
        return n % 4 == 0
    return int(str(n)[-2:]) % 4 == 0

def divisible_by_9(n):
    return sum(map(int, str(n))) % 9 == 0

even_digits = ['0','2','4','6','8']
results = []
max_num = -1

# Since digits must be distinct, length <= 5
for length in range(1, 6):
    for p in permutations(even_digits, length):
        if p[0] == '0':  # no leading zero
            continue
        num = int(''.join(p))
        if divisible_by_4(num) and divisible_by_9(num):
            print(num)
            results.append(num)
            if num > max_num:
                max_num = num

print("MAX:", max_num)
```
