Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: (2 : ℝ)
To determine whether the proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer, let's analyze the problem step by step.

Given the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{3}x = 4 \]

We can solve for \( x \):
\[ x = 4 \times 3 = 12 \]

Now, we need to find the value of \( \frac{1}{6}x \):
\[ \frac{1}{6}x = \frac{1}{6} \times 12 = 2 \]

The proposed answer is \( 2 \), which matches the result of our calculation. Therefore, the proposed answer is correct.

<<<True>>>
