Ground Truth Answer: 142
Proposed Answer: 49
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive sequence x_sequence where each term depends on the previous term through functions p (least prime not dividing x) and q (product of primes less than p(x)).

2. The question asks for the smallest index n where x_sequence(n) = 1995.

3. The ground truth answer is 142, meaning it takes 142 steps in the sequence to reach 1995.

4. The proposed answer is 49, which is significantly smaller than 142.

Given that:
- The sequence grows in a complex way based on prime factors
- 1995 = 3×5×7×19 (a product of several primes)
- It's highly unlikely the sequence could reach this composite number in just 49 steps
- The ground truth answer comes from a reliable source

The proposed answer of 49 is clearly incorrect compared to the verified answer of 142.
