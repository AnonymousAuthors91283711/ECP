The problem involves finding natural numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that:
- \(a + b = 17402\)
- \(a\) is divisible by 10
- \(b = \frac{a}{10}\)
- Then, compute \(a - b\)

Rearranging:
- Since \(b = \frac{a}{10}\), then
- \(a + \frac{a}{10} = 17402 \implies \frac{11}{10} a = 17402 \implies a = \frac{17402 \times 10}{11}\)

Check if \(a\) is an integer divisible by 10, then compute \(b\) and \(a-b\).

This program enumerates possible \(a\) multiples of 10 to check, prints valid answers immediately, and outputs \(a-b\).

```python
# Enumerate a multiple of 10 with b = a/10 and a+b=17402, print a,b,a-b immediately.

def main():
    total = 17402
    for a in range(0, total+1, 10):  # a must be divisible by 10
        if a * 11 == total * 10:
            b = a // 10
            print(f"a={a}, b={b}, a-b={a - b}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
