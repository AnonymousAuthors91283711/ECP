The problem involves a function \( f:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N} \) satisfying a functional equation with iterates. The key equation is:
\[
(f^{f(a)}(a+1)) = (a+1) \cdot f(b)
\]
for all positive integers \(a,b\).

We want to explore small values for \(a,b\) and candidate functions \(f\) to find patterns or constraints. Let's try some simple functions and enumerate possible values of \(f(n)\) for small \(n\). We will test \(f^{f(a)}(a+1)\) for \(a,b\in\{1,2,3\}\) and see what \(f\) satisfy the equation.

We print candidate values as we find them, prioritizing exact values.

```python
# Enumerate candidates for f: ℕ₊ → ℕ₊ satisfying (f^[f(a)](a+1)) = (a+1)*f(b)
# We'll try all functions f with f(n) in small range [1..5] for n=1..3,
# then check the functional equation for a,b in 1..3.

def iterate_f(f, x, times):
    # iterate f times iterations starting at x
    for _ in range(times):
        x = f[x]
    return x

def valid_f(f):
    # Validate for a,b in 1..3
    for a in range(1,4):
        for b in range(1,4):
            lhs = iterate_f(f, a+1, f[a])
            rhs = (a+1)*f[b]
            if lhs != rhs:
                return False
    return True

def main():
    from itertools import product

    domain = [1,2,3]
    range_vals = [1,2,3,4,5]

    print("Trying candidate functions f with domain {1,2,3} and range in [1..5]")
    # enumerate all functions f: {1,2,3} → {1..5}
    for vals in product(range_vals, repeat=3):
        f = {k:v for k,v in zip(domain, vals)}
        if valid_f(f):
            print(f"Valid f found: f(1)={f[1]}, f(2)={f[2]}, f(3)={f[3]}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This prints all candidate functions satisfying the relation for \(a,b=1..3\), which helps conjecture the explicit formula \( IMO2023SLN8\_answer \).
