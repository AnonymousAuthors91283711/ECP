This problem deals with computing probabilities of specific combinations in choosing balls from two groups and then evaluating the ratio of these probabilities. To explore possible answers, I'll enumerate the combinations directly for small parameters (4 chosen from 10, with subgroups of size 4 and 6), calculate the exact rational probabilities, and print the simplified fraction p_win / p_prize.

```python
from math import comb
from fractions import Fraction

# Parameters for testing
n_total = 10  # Total number of balls
n_group1 = 4  # Size of first group (e.g. winning balls)
n_group2 = n_total - n_group1  # Size of second group
n_chosen = 4  # Number of balls drawn

# Compute p_win = probability all 4 chosen come from group1 (4 choose 4)*(6 choose 0) / (10 choose 4)
p_win = Fraction(comb(n_group1, 4) * comb(n_group2, 0), comb(n_total, n_chosen))
print(f"p_win = {p_win} (~{float(p_win):.6f})")

# Compute p_prize = probability that at least 2 of the chosen balls are from group1 (sum k=2 to 4 of comb(4,k)*comb(6,4-k)) / comb(10,4)
s = 0
print("p_prize terms:")
for k in range(2, 5):
    term = Fraction(comb(n_group1, k) * comb(n_group2, n_chosen - k), comb(n_total, n_chosen))
    s += term
    print(f" k={k}: {term} (~{float(term):.6f})")

p_prize = s
print(f"p_prize = {p_prize} (~{float(p_prize):.6f})")

# Compute ratio p_win / p_prize as a simplified fraction
ratio = p_win / p_prize
print(f"p_win / p_prize = {ratio} (~{float(ratio):.6f})")
```
