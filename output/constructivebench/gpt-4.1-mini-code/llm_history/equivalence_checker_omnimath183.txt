  (∑ k in Finset.range 89, 1 / (cos (π * k / 180) * cos (π * (k + 1) / 180))) = omnimath183_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: cos (π / 180) / (sin (π / 180))^2
Proposed Answer: 1 / (sin (π / 180)) * (tan (π * 89 / 180) + 1)
Let me analyze the equivalence between the proposed answer and the ground truth answer.

The ground truth is: cos(π/180) / (sin(π/180))²
The proposed answer is: 1/sin(π/180) * (tan(89π/180) + 1)

Let's simplify the proposed answer:
1. tan(89π/180) = sin(89π/180)/cos(89π/180)
2. The expression becomes: (1/sin(π/180)) * (sin(89π/180)/cos(89π/180) + 1)

Now let's examine the ground truth:
cos(π/180)/sin²(π/180) = (1/sin(π/180)) * (cos(π/180)/sin(π/180)) = (1/sin(π/180)) * cot(π/180)

These two expressions are not equivalent. The proposed answer involves terms with 89π/180 while the ground truth only has π/180 terms. Also, the trigonometric identities don't show any direct equivalence between cot(π/180) and (tan(89π/180) + 1).
