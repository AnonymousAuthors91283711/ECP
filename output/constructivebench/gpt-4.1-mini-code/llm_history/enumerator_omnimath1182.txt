The problem asks about the maximum absolute value of the determinant of a 17×17 matrix whose entries are all ±1. This is a known type of combinatorial matrix problem related to Hadamard matrices and determinant bounds. To explore possible determinant values and conjecture the maximum, I will enumerate determinants of smaller such ±1 matrices to identify patterns or candidates for the maximum. Due to combinatorial explosion, I will try matrices of smaller sizes (e.g. 1 to 5) with entries ±1 and output their determinants, then show candidates for the max determinant for each dimension.

```python
import numpy as np
from itertools import product

def all_pm1_matrices(n):
    # Generate all n×n matrices with entries ±1
    # To manage runtime, limit enumeration for n <= 4 only
    # For n > 4, do random sampling
    if n <= 4:
        for entries in product([1, -1], repeat=n*n):
            mat = np.array(entries).reshape(n, n)
            yield mat
    else:
        # For larger n, sample randomly to get some candidates
        # We'll output some random examples
        for _ in range(50):
            mat = np.random.choice([1, -1], size=(n, n))
            yield mat

def main():
    # We'll print sample determinant ranges for n=1..5
    for n in range(1, 6):
        print(f"n = {n}")
        det_candidates = set()
        for M in all_pm1_matrices(n):
            det = int(round(np.linalg.det(M)))
            det_candidates.add(abs(det))
            print(abs(det))
        max_det = max(det_candidates)
        print(f"Max |det| for n={n}: {max_det}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This program enumerates all ±1 matrices for sizes up to 4 (feasible), then prints out absolute values of their determinants. For n=5, it samples randomly a few matrices due to combinatorial complexity. It outputs the absolute determinants and max observed values to assist with conjecturing the maximum value at n=17.
