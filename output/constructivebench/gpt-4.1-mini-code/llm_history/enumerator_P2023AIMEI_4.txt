The problem involves the prime factorization of \(13!\) and identifying integers \(m\) such that \(m \mid 13!\) and \( \frac{13!}{m} \) is a perfect square. The set \(m\) such that \(13! = m \cdot k^2\) means \(m\) is the "square-free" part of \(13!\) relative to some \(k\).

Key points:
- Prime factorization of \(13!\) is given by primes and exponents.
- \(m\) must be a divisor of \(13!\).
- The factorization of \(m\) consists of primes raised to either 0 or 1, so that when the exponents of \(13!\) are reduced mod 2, \(m\) accounts exactly for the primes with odd exponent powers.
- \(m\) is a product of primes raised to either 0 or 1 when the exponent in \(13!\) is odd, and 0 when even.
- The set of all such \(m\) is the set of all square-free factors of \(13!\) matching these parity conditions.
- The problem asks for the sum of all such \(m\).

We will:
- Calculate exponents for primes in \(13!\).
- Mod 2 reduce exponents, generating all possible \(m\).
- Sum all \(m\).
- Decompose sum into prime factorization and print answers stepwise.

```python
from math import factorial

# Primes and exponents for 13!
primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]

# Compute exponent of prime p in n!
def prime_exp_in_factorial(n, p):
    count = 0
    x = p
    while x <= n:
        count += n // x
        x *= p
    return count

n = 13
exps = [prime_exp_in_factorial(n, p) for p in primes]

# We want all m such that there exists k with 13! = m * k^2
# This means for each prime:
# exp_in_m mod 2 = exp_in_13! mod 2

# exponent parity for each prime
parities = [e % 2 for e in exps]

# m must have prime exponents either 0 or 1, matching parity in multiset sense
# But m must be a divisor of 13!, so exponent either 0 or 1 (square-free)
# In fact, m is the product of primes whose exponent in 13! is odd raised to 1 or 0, to build all subsets
# Actually, we need all m such that 13!/m = k^2 => m includes all primes with odd exponent exactly once
# Because exp_13! - exp_m must be even => exp_m matches parity of exp_13!

# Thus, for each prime:
# m exponent = parity (0 or 1)

# The set m_set contains exactly one such m, which is the product of primes with odd exponents
# But in the problem statement, it seems to ask for all such m with positive exponent guessing from theorem
# But the square root condition forces m uniquely to primes with odd exponent powers to the power 1

# Re-examining problem, "m_set = { m : 0 < m and exists k, 13! = m * k^2 }" meaning m is exactly the square-free part of 13!.

# In our case, such m are divisors of 13! with exponents matching parity of 13! exponents:
# That is, use exponents that are either 0 or 1 such that exp_m â‰¡ exp_13! (mod 2)

# However the problem statement and theorem shows six primes and exponents, sum over m in m_set.

# To enumerate all m, for each prime p:
# If parity = 1, exponent of m can be only 1
# If parity = 0, exponent of m can be 0 or 1 (because even exponents difference stays even)
# Wait, difference exp_13! - exp_m must be even
# So for primes with exp_13! even, exp_m must be even modular 2, so exponent in m is 0
# For primes with exp_13! odd, exp_m must be 1

# So m is fixed to product of all primes with odd exponent power exactly once.
# So unique m

squarefree_m = 1
for p, parity in zip(primes, parities):
    if parity == 1:
        squarefree_m *= p

# sum_m is sum over the finite set m_set, from problem it might be expanded by some condition
# But from reasoning sum of all such m is just squarefree_m (only one m)

# But the problem states m_set finite, and shows sum of m in m_set.

# So maybe m are all divisors of squarefree_m? That is, all divisors of squarefree part?

# If 13! = m * k^2, then m divides squarefree_m

# So m_set = divisors of squarefree_m (all divisors of squarefree part)

# Let's enumerate divisors of squarefree_m:

def divisors(n):
    divs = []
    def rec(i, curr):
        if i == len(primes):
            divs.append(curr)
            return
        p = primes[i]
        if n % p == 0:
            if p & n:
                rec(i+1, curr)
                rec(i+1, curr*p)
            else:
                rec(i+1, curr)
        else:
            rec(i+1, curr)
    # This function is complicated, skip it, use simpler method: since squarefree_m is small product,
    # just do subsets of primes with exponent=1 or 0 if prime divides squarefree_m
    sqf_primes = [p for p in primes if squarefree_m % p == 0]
    divs = []
    def backtrack(idx=0, val=1):
        if idx == len(sqf_primes):
            divs.append(val)
            return
        backtrack(idx+1,val)
        backtrack(idx+1,val*sqf_primes[idx])
    backtrack()
    return divs

divs = divisors(squarefree_m)

sum_m = sum(divs)

# Now factor sum_m into primes from primes list
# Factor sum_m by trial division with primes list
def factor_sum(n, primes):
    factors = []
    for p in primes:
        count = 0
        while n % p == 0:
            n //= p
            count += 1
        factors.append(count)
    return factors

factor_counts = factor_sum(sum_m, primes)
exp_letters = ['a','b','c','d','e','f']

for p, e in zip(primes, factor_counts):
    if e > 0:
        print(f"{p}^{e}", end=' * ')
print(f"\nSum of all m in m_set = {sum_m}")

print("Exponent sum:", sum(factor_counts))
```

The code above enumerates all divisors \(m\) for which \(13! = m \cdot k^2\) holds. It calculates the sum of all such \(m\), then factorizes the sum. The output will help conjecture the exact prime factorization and sum of exponents required in the original theorem.
