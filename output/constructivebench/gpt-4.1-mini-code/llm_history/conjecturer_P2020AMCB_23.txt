Testing n = 2
Possible n = 2
Testing n = 3
Possible n = 3
Testing n = 4
Counterexample with modified points at indices 0,2:
z = [(-1+0j), 1j, (1+0j), (-0-1j)]
Testing n = 5
Possible n = 5
Testing n = 6
Counterexample with modified points at indices 0,3:

Testing n = 7
Possible n = 7
Testing n = 8
Counterexample with modified points at indices 0,4:
z = [(-1+0j), (0.707+0.707j), 1j, (-0.707+0.707j), (1+0j), (-0.707-0.707j), (-0-1j), (0.707-0.707j)]
Testing n = 9
Possible n = 9
Testing n = 10
Counterexample with modified points at indices 0,5:
z = [(-1+0j), (0.809+0.588j), (0.309+0.951j), (-0.309+0.951j), (-0.809+0.588j), (1+0j), (-0.809-0.588j), (-0.309-0.951j), (0.309-0.951j), (0.809-0.588j)]
End of enumeration.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<9>>> 
The largest n for which the points on the unit circle summing to zero must be nth roots of unity is 9, as seen from the enumeration where n=4,6,8,10 fail but n=9 passes.
