The problem is about finding positive angles \(A, B, C\) summing to \(\pi\) with \( \cos A = \frac{p + q \sqrt{r}}{s} \), where \(p, q, r, s\) satisfy certain properties including coprimality, \(r\) is squarefree and not a perfect square, and \(p+q+r+s\) gives the desired answer. To assist conjecturing the answer, I'll enumerate small values for \(p, q, r, s\) with \(r\) squarefree (up to a small limit), check that \(\frac{p + q \sqrt{r}}{s}\) lies in \([-1,1]\), and print candidates along with \(p+q+r+s\).

This will print possible quadruples and their sums. This data may suggest the true \(p+q+r+s\). We only pick small values for enumeration feasibility.

# Check if n is squarefree: no square prime factors.

    if n < 1:
        return False
    i = 2
    while i*i <= n:
        count = 0
        while n % (i*i) == 0:
            return False  # divisible by square >1
        i += 1
    return True

# Check if two integers are coprime

    while b:
        a,b = b, a%b
    return a

    return gcd(a,b) == 1

def enumerate_candidates(max_val=10):
    # We'll search over p,q,s up to max_val and r squarefree up to max_val
    # p,q can be zero or positive, but q != 0 since sqrt(r) term is required
    for r in range(2, max_val+1):
        if not is_squarefree(r):
            continue
        # r should not be a perfect square: check that
        root = int(round(math.sqrt(r)))
        if root*root == r:
            continue
        for s in range(1, max_val+1):

                    # skip q=0 since no sqrt term
                    if q == 0:
                        continue
                    # Check coprimality of (p+q) and s as per problem
                    if not is_coprime(p+q, s):
                        continue
                    val = (p + q*math.sqrt(r))/s
                    if -1 <= val <= 1:
                        # compute sum line p+q+r+s
                        ssum = p + q + r + s
                        print(f"p={p}, q={q}, r={r}, s={s}, cosA={val:.5f}, sum={ssum}")
