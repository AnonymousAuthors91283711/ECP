The problem involves counting non-increasing functions from a finite set of size n=10 to itself, distinguishing those with fixed points and those without. We want to compute:

(number of non-increasing functions with at least one fixed point) - (number of non-increasing functions with no fixed points).

Since the domain and codomain are {0,...,9}, we can enumerate all non-increasing functions f: {0,...,9} → {0,...,9}. A function is non-increasing if for all i<j, f(j) ≤ f(i).

We can represent a non-increasing function by a sequence (f(0), ..., f(9)) with f(0) ≥ f(1) ≥ ... ≥ f(9), each in 0..9.

For each such function, we check whether there is an x with f(x) = x (fixed point). We count accordingly.

We will enumerate all non-increasing sequences efficiently using backtracking and print partial counts progressively.

```python
# Enumerate non-increasing functions f: {0,...,9} -> {0,...,9}
# Count difference between #with fixed point and #without fixed point

n = 10
max_val = n - 1

count_with_fixed = 0
count_without_fixed = 0

def backtrack(pos, prev_val, arr):
    global count_with_fixed, count_without_fixed
    if pos == n:
        # Check for fixed point
        has_fixed = any(arr[i] == i for i in range(n))
        if has_fixed:
            count_with_fixed += 1
            print(f"with_fixed +1: total = {count_with_fixed - count_without_fixed}")
        else:
            count_without_fixed += 1
            print(f"without_fixed +1: total = {count_with_fixed - count_without_fixed}")
        return
    # Choose f(pos) ≤ prev_val from 0..prev_val
    start = prev_val if pos > 0 else max_val
    for val in range(start, -1, -1):
        arr[pos] = val
        backtrack(pos+1, val, arr)

print("Starting enumeration with n=10...")
arr = [0]*n
backtrack(0, max_val, arr)

print("Final difference (with_fixed - without_fixed):", count_with_fixed - count_without_fixed)
```
