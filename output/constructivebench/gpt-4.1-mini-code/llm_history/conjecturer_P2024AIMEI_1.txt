Lean Error Message: Error 1: At line 5 column 7, which is at "P2024AIMEI_1_answer " in "abbrev P2024AIMEI_1_answer : ℝ := let s := 2.5", there is an error: failed to compile definition, consider marking it as 'noncomputable' because it depends on 'Real.instDivInvMonoid', and it does not have executable code.
. Enumerated Answers: s, t, value = 9/(s+0.5)+t/60
2.50, 24.000, 3.400. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The error is due to the use of division in real numbers which requires `noncomputable` in Lean to handle real field operations like division. To fix this, mark the abbreviation as `noncomputable` and directly provide the closed form numeric answer, since numerical substitution yields the value:
Given s = 2.5, t = 24,

P2024AIMEI_1_answer = 9 / (2.5 + 0.5) + 24 / 60
                   = 9 / 3 + 0.4
                   = 3 + 0.4
                   = 3.4

So the closed form numeric answer is 3.4, which is a real number and fits the expected answer type ℝ.

Thus, the final answer to put in Lean is just the numeral `3.4` with `noncomputable` modifier for definitions that use real division if needed.
