The problem involves finding cubic polynomials \(f\) and \(g\) with real coefficients where \(f = x^3 + a x^2 + b x + c\), and \(g\) has 3 distinct nonzero roots which are also roots of \(f\), and \(f(1)\) equals some special value we want to explore.

We want to enumerate candidates for triple roots of \(g\), then fit \(a,b,c\) accordingly, and print the values \(f(1)\). By trying all triples of distinct nonzero roots (sampled from small integers and fractions), we can conjecture the possible values of \(f(1)\).

```python
from fractions import Fraction
from itertools import combinations
from sympy import Poly, symbols, Eq, solve, Rational

x = symbols('x')

# Test roots r1, r2, r3 distinct, nonzero
# We'll try small rationals: +-1, +-2, +-1/2
candidates = [Fraction(n, d) for n in [-2, -1, 1, 2] for d in [1, 2]]
# Filter out zero
candidates = [r for r in candidates if r != 0]

seen = set()

print("Testing triples of distinct roots from:", candidates)
for roots in combinations(candidates, 3):
    # roots of g, which also are roots of f
    r1, r2, r3 = roots
    # impose f has these roots, f = (x-r1)(x-r2)(x-r3) = x^3 - (sum) x^2 + (sum of products) x - prod
    a = -(r1 + r2 + r3)
    b = r1*r2 + r2*r3 + r3*r1
    c = -r1*r2*r3

    # f(x) = x^3 + a x^2 + b x + c
    val_at_1 = 1 + a + b + c

    if val_at_1 not in seen:
        seen.add(val_at_1)
        print(f"Roots: {roots}, coefficients a,b,c=({float(a):.3g},{float(b):.3g},{float(c):.3g}), f(1)={float(val_at_1):.6g}")

# To highlight the minimal and maximal value of f(1) found:
f1_vals = sorted(seen)
print("\nMinimum f(1) found:", float(f1_vals[0]))
print("Maximum f(1) found:", float(f1_vals[-1]))
```
