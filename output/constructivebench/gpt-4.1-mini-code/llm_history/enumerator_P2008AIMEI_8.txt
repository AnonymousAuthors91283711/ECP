The problem asks to find all positive integers \( n \) such that 
\[
\arctan\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) + \arctan\left(\frac{1}{4}\right) + \arctan\left(\frac{1}{5}\right) + \arctan\left(\frac{1}{n}\right) = \frac{\pi}{4}.
\]

We will enumerate positive integers \( n \) and check which satisfy this equation with reasonable precision. The result will help guess the exact value of \( n \).

```python
import math

# We compute the sum of the three given arctans once
base_sum = math.atan(1/3) + math.atan(1/4) + math.atan(1/5)
target = math.pi / 4  # pi/4

print(f"Base sum (atan(1/3)+atan(1/4)+atan(1/5)) = {base_sum:.12f}")

# Enumerate n from 1 to 50 and check
for n in range(1, 51):
    val = base_sum + math.atan(1/n)
    # Check if val is very close to pi/4
    if abs(val - target) < 1e-12:
        # Print exact n and the sum found
        print(f"Found n = {n} where sum = {val:.15f} ≈ π/4")
    # Also print approximate sums for all n for pattern observation
    print(f"n={n}, sum={val:.15f}")

# From the output, one can conjecture the exact n.
```
