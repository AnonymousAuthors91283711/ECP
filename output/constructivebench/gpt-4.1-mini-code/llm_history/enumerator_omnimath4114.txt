The problem relates to a large number \( L = \frac{10^{2022} - 1}{9} \), which is a repunit number consisting of 2022 digits of 1. The task is to find the digit sum of the number \( 9L^2 + 2L \).

This is computationally extensive for direct calculation due to the size of \( L \), but we can experiment with smaller values of the length to conjecture a pattern. For instance, try \( n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \) digits of 1 for \( L \), then compute \( 9L^2 + 2L \), and sum its digits.

Below is a Python program that computes the digit sum for these smaller values and prints the results to help conjecture a pattern.

```python
# Enumerate the digit sums of 9*L^2 + 2*L for L = repunit of n digits (all 1's)
def repunit(n):
    return int('1' * n)

def digit_sum(x):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(x))

print("n  L          9*L^2 + 2*L             Digit Sum")
for n in range(1, 6):
    L = repunit(n)
    val = 9 * L * L + 2 * L
    dsum = digit_sum(val)
    print(f"{n:<2} {L:<10} {val:<25} {dsum}")

# From output, we can try to generalize or conjecture omnimath4114_answer
```
This should give a manageable output to analyze up to n=5, from which we might conjecture the digit sum for n=2022.
