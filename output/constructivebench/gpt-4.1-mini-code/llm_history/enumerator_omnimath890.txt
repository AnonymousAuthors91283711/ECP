[write_program]
The problem asks to find the greatest natural number \(a\) for which there exist positive integers \(b,c\) such that
\[
a + b + c = \gcd(a,b) + \gcd(b,c) + \gcd(c,a) + 120.
\]
To explore, I will enumerate triples \((a,b,c)\) for small values of \(a,b,c\) and check the condition. I will print all solutions and track the maximum \(a\) found. This might help conjecture the maximal \(a\).

```python
from math import gcd

max_a = 0
solutions_found = 0

# We'll check for a,b,c all up to 50 to keep output small and have some coverage
limit = 50

for a in range(1, limit+1):
    for b in range(1, limit+1):
        for c in range(1, limit+1):
            lhs = a + b + c
            rhs = gcd(a,b) + gcd(b,c) + gcd(c,a) + 120
            if lhs == rhs:
                print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c} satisfies a+b+c = sum(gcd pairs) + 120")
                if a > max_a:
                    max_a = a
                    print(f"New maximum a found: {max_a}")

print(f"Maximum a found under limit {limit}: {max_a}")
```
This program enumerates all triples with \(a,b,c \leq 50\), printing all that satisfy the equation and tracking the largest \(a\) found. Adjusting limit may discover higher values. This should assist in conjecturing the greatest \(a\).
