The system of equations is:
1) a + 5 = b
2) 5 + b = c
3) b + c = a

We want to find integer triples (a,b,c) satisfying these, then determine b.

I'll enumerate small integer values for a in a range, compute b and c accordingly, check the third equation, and print the matching triples along with b.

```python
# Enumerate integer triples (a,b,c) satisfying the system:
# a + 5 = b
# 5 + b = c
# b + c = a
# for small a in range -10 to 10, print all solutions found.

def main():
    for a in range(-10, 11):
        b = a + 5       # from hab: a + 5 = b
        c = 5 + b       # from hbc: 5 + b = c
        # check if b + c == a (hac)
        if b + c == a:
            print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, b={b}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

[refine_program]
The original program attempts to enumerate integer triples (a,b,c) satisfying the system of equations, but the chosen range for a (-10 to 10) results in no solutions found, as the system is inconsistent. Let's analyze the system:

Given:
1) a + 5 = b   => b = a + 5
2) 5 + b = c   => c = b + 5 = a + 10
3) b + c = a   => (a + 5) + (a + 10) = a  => 2a + 15 = a  => a = -15

So only a = -15 satisfies the system. Then b = a + 5 = -10 and c = b + 5 = -5.

The original program fails because it only tests a in [-10,10], too narrow to find a = -15.

Therefore, the program should test a range including -15 (e.g., -20 to 0).

The original program is rejected (<<<False>>>).

```python
# Enumerate integer triples (a,b,c) satisfying:
# a + 5 = b
# 5 + b = c
# b + c = a
# Print all solutions found, then print the corresponding b (the problem's answer).

def main():
    found = False
    for a in range(-20, 1):  # wider range to include correct solution a = -15
        b = a + 5
        c = b + 5
        if b + c == a:
            print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, b={b}")
            found = True
    if found:
        print("Answer: b =", b)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
