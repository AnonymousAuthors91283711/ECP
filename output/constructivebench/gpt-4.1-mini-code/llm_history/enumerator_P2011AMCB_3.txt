The problem involves finding a unique real number \( x \) such that \( A + x = B - x \), given \( A < B \). Algebraically, this simplifies to finding the midpoint between \( A \) and \( B \), i.e., \( x = \frac{B - A}{2} \).

To assist in conjecture and verification, the program below enumerates sample pairs \((A, B)\) with \( A < B \), computes \( x = \frac{B - A}{2} \), and prints the values along with the verification of the equation. This confirms uniqueness and correctness for sampled values without hardcoding any solution.

```python
# Enumerate sample pairs (A,B) with A < B and find x such that A+x = B-x
# We print results immediately upon finding them.

def find_x(A, B):
    if A < B:
        x = (B - A) / 2
        # Check equation validity exactly
        left = A + x
        right = B - x
        if abs(left - right) < 1e-12:  # Numerical tolerance for floating point
            print(f"A={A}, B={B}, x={x}, check: A+x={left}, B-x={right}")

# Generate samples for small integers and a few fractional values
sample_values = [-2, -1, 0, 0.5, 1, 2]

for A in sample_values:
    for B in sample_values:
        if A < B:
            find_x(A, B)
```
