The problem involves a finite sequence \(a_i\) indexed from 0 to 2004 (Fin 2005), satisfying linear equations involving sums of powers of indices. We want to find \(a_1\) explicitly.

The conditions are:
- For \(k=0,1,\ldots,2003\), \(\sum_{i=0}^{2004} a_i i^{k+1} = 0\).
- And \(\sum_{i=0}^{2004} a_i i^{2005} = 1\).

This forms a system of linear equations on \(a_i\), where the matrix of powers of indices resembles a Vandermonde matrix, but with powers from 1 to 2005 skipping the zero power condition.

We want to enumerate and identify \(a_1\).

To assist, I will write a Python program that models this for smaller \(n\) (say \(n=5\)) to understand \(a_1\) empirically, then output partial results of \(a_1\) for these toy cases. This will help conjecture the general formula.

```python
import numpy as np

def compute_a1(n):
    """
    For given n, solve for vector a (length n) satisfying:
    sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i * i^{k+1} = 0 for k=0..n-2
    sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i * i^{n} = 1
    Return a[1].
    """
    # Build matrix M of size n x n
    # Rows 0..n-2: k=0..n-2 --> powers p = k+1 = 1..n-1
    # Row n-1: power n
    M = np.zeros((n, n), dtype=float)
    indices = np.arange(n)
    for k in range(n-1):
        power = k + 1
        M[k, :] = indices ** power
    M[n-1, :] = indices ** n
    
    # Right hand side vector b
    b = np.zeros(n)
    b[-1] = 1
    
    # Solve linear system M a = b
    try:
        a = np.linalg.solve(M, b)
        return a[1]
    except np.linalg.LinAlgError:
        return None

# Enumerate solutions for small n
for n in range(3, 10):
    a1 = compute_a1(n)
    print(f"n={n}, a[1]={a1}")
```

This provides values for \(a_1\) in smaller analogous problems, aiding conjectures about the intended \(a_1\) for \(n=2005\).
