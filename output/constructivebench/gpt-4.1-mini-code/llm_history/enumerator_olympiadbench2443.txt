The problem is to find two-digit prime numbers \( n = 10t + u \) with digits \( t \) and \( u \) such that

\[
t^2 + 10u = u^2 + 10t.
\]

We want to enumerate all two-digit primes \( n \) (from 10 to 99) satisfying the equation and print them immediately.

```python
from sympy import isprime

# Enumerate two-digit numbers and check the condition and primality
for n in range(10, 100):
    t, u = divmod(n, 10)
    if t**2 + 10*u == u**2 + 10*t:
        if isprime(n):
            print(n)
```
