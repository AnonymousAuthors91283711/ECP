The original answer Real.sqrt 9 + Real.sqrt 4 is correct mathematically, but Lean refuses to compile it because Real.sqrt is noncomputable by default. To fix the error, simply mark the definition as noncomputable, which allows nonconstructive expressions like Real.sqrt to be used without compiling executable code.

Also, √9 = 3 and √4 = 2, so their sum is 5, which doesn’t match the approximate value 4 from the steps. Instead, from the approximation hints, the sum is √4 + √4 = 2 + 2 = 4, which exactly matches the value given.

Hence the correct closed form answer is Real.sqrt 4 + Real.sqrt 4, and mark the abbrev as noncomputable.

The expression \(\sqrt{13 + \sqrt{7 + \sqrt{4}}}\) can be simplified by recognizing the nested square roots and trying to express it as a sum of simpler square roots.

Note that \(\sqrt{4} = 2\), so the innermost root is \(\sqrt{7 + 2} = \sqrt{9} = 3\). Then the middle expression is \(13 + 3 = 16\), and \(\sqrt{16} = 4\).

Therefore,
\[
\sqrt{13 + \sqrt{7 + \sqrt{4}}} = \sqrt{13 + 3} = \sqrt{16} = 4.
\]

In Lean, to express this clearly without error, we just set the answer to 4.0 (of type ℝ). Note that "noncomputable" is a keyword that is used only before definitions, not inside an "abbrev" declaration directly; here "abbrev" is fine since 4.0 is computable.

Hence, the fixed answer is just `4.0`.

<<<4.0>>>
