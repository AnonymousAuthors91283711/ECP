The problem involves finding a natural number `omnimath3438_answer` equal to the sum of five terms, each being `5 * 5`. Essentially, it asks to compute the sum `5*5 + 5*5 + 5*5 + 5*5 + 5*5`. We write a Python program to enumerate partial sums and output the total.

```python
# Enumerate the partial sums of five terms, each 5*5 = 25
term = 5 * 5
total_sum = 0

for i in range(1, 6):
    total_sum += term
    print(f"Sum of {i} terms (each {term}): {total_sum}")

print(f"Final answer omnimath3438_answer = {total_sum}")
```
