The problem involves finding positive integers \(x, y\) such that
\[
x^2 + 84x + 2008 = y^2.
\]
We want to enumerate possible \((x,y)\) pairs that satisfy this, for small values of \(x\), and print each exact solution found. This will help to conjecture which \((x,y)\) satisfy the equation and identify the unique solution with \(P2008AIMEI_4\_answer(x,y) = 80\).

We rewrite the equation as
\[
y^2 - x^2 = 84x + 2008.
\]
We can enumerate \(x\) from 1 to some upper bound (around 100) to keep running time short, check if \(y^2 = x^2 + 84x + 2008\) is a perfect square, and print \((x,y)\).

```python
import math

def is_perfect_square(n: int) -> bool:
    r = int(math.isqrt(n))
    return r*r == n

def main():
    print("Enumerating (x,y) with x,y > 0 satisfying x^2 + 84x + 2008 = y^2")
    for x in range(1, 101):
        val = x*x + 84*x + 2008
        if is_perfect_square(val):
            y = int(math.isqrt(val))
            if y > 0:
                print(f"x={x}, y={y}, y^2={val}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
