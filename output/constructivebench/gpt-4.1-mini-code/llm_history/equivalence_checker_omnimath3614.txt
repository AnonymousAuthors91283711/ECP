Ground Truth Answer: {(0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 0), (2, 0, 2)}
Proposed Answer: {(1, 1, 0), (2, 0, 2)}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is missing the trivial solution (0, 0, 0) which satisfies the equation (0^5 + 0^4 + 1 = 1 = 3^0 * 7^0). The other two solutions are correct, but the omission of (0, 0, 0) makes the answer incomplete.
