The problem involves colorings of a \(4m \times 4m\) grid with constraints on blue points and their neighbors in the same row or column. For small \(m\), we enumerate all possible blue sets of size \(k\), checking for the constraints:

- Each blue point has at least 2 blue neighbors in its row or column.
- We want to find minimal \(k\) for which such a coloring exists.

We try \(m = 1, 2\) with increasing \(k\), enumerating subsets of the grid points. To keep the search feasible, we stop once we find any feasible set per \(k\).

```python
from itertools import combinations

def neighbors(pos, blue_set, n):
    r, c = pos
    return [p for p in blue_set if p != pos and (p[0] == r or p[1] == c)]

def check(blue_set, n):
    for pos in blue_set:
        if len(neighbors(pos, blue_set, n)) < 2:
            return False
    return True

def enumerate_for_m(m):
    n = 4*m
    points = [(r,c) for r in range(n) for c in range(n)]
    print(f"m = {m}, n = {n}, searching minimal k")

    for k in range(2, n*n+1):
        found = False
        # Enumerate subsets of size k
        for blue_subset in combinations(points, k):
            blue_set = set(blue_subset)
            if check(blue_set, n):
                print(f"Found feasible k = {k}")
                found = True
                break
        if found:
            print(f"Minimal feasible k for m={m} is {k}\n")
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    for m_test in [1,2]:
        enumerate_for_m(m_test)
```
