The problem involves a swimmer, biker, and runner with speeds related by factors:
- run_speed = 5 * swim_speed
- bike_speed = 2 * run_speed = 10 * swim_speed.

Given distances:
- swim: 0.5 miles
- bike: 30 miles
- run: 8 miles

The total time for the events is 4.25 hours, and we want to find bike_time in minutes (bike_time * 60).

This program enumerates swim_speed values and evaluates the conditions, printing all relevant triplets and the bike_time in minutes to help conjecture the exact answer.

```python
# Enumerate swim speeds to find times matching the total time 4.25 hours (exact equation)
# run_speed = 5 * swim_speed
# bike_speed = 2 * run_speed = 10 * swim_speed
# total_time = swim_time + bike_time + run_time = 0.5/swim_speed + 30/bike_speed + 8/run_speed = 4.25

print("swim_speed | run_speed | bike_speed | swim_time | bike_time (min) | run_time | total_time")
for denom in range(1, 301):  # try swim_speed = 1/denom from 0.0033 to 1.0
    swim_speed = 1 / denom
    run_speed = 5 * swim_speed
    bike_speed = 10 * swim_speed

    swim_time = 0.5 / swim_speed
    bike_time = 30 / bike_speed
    run_time = 8 / run_speed

    total_time = swim_time + bike_time + run_time
    # check total_time close to 4.25 with small tolerance
    if abs(total_time - 4.25) < 0.001:
        bike_time_min = bike_time * 60
        print(
            f"{swim_speed:.6f} | {run_speed:.6f} | {bike_speed:.6f} | "
            f"{swim_time:.6f} | {bike_time_min:.6f} | {run_time:.6f} | {total_time:.6f}"
        )
        # yield bike_time_min as candidate answers
        print(f"Candidate bike_time (minutes): {bike_time_min:.6f}")
```
