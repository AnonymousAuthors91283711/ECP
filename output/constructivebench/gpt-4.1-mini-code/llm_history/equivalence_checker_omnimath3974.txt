Ground Truth Answer: { f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ c : ℝ, f = fun x => c * x }
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ a : ℝ, ∀ x : ℝ, f x = a * x}
<<<True>>>

The ground truth answer and the proposed answer are equivalent. Both describe the set of all linear functions through the origin (i.e., functions of the form f(x) = c*x where c is a real constant). The only difference is in notation:
- Ground truth uses `fun x => c * x`
- Proposed answer uses `∀ x : ℝ, f x = a * x`

Both formulations capture exactly the same set of functions, just expressed slightly differently. The choice of variable name (c vs a) doesn't affect the meaning.
