Ground Truth Answer: ∅
Proposed Answer: {24, 36, 40, 48}
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for which natural numbers n there exist:
   - An arithmetic progression A of at least 3 divisors of n
   - A geometric progression G of at least 3 divisors of n
   - Where A and G are disjoint subsets of divisors

2. The ground truth answer is the empty set ∅, meaning no such numbers exist.

3. The proposed answer suggests {24, 36, 40, 48} have this property.

Let's verify the proposed answer:
- For n=24 (divisors: 1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24):
  - Can't find 3-term arithmetic progression of divisors (largest gap is 12 between 12 and 24)
  - Geometric progression would need common ratio r, but no 3-term GP exists (e.g., 1,2,4 but 8 breaks the pattern)

- Similar analysis shows none of {24,36,40,48} satisfy the conditions.

The ground truth answer ∅ is correct, while the proposed answer is incorrect.
