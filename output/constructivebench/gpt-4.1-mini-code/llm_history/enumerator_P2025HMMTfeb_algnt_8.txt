The problem asks to consider the infinite series sum of sign(sin(2^n)) / 2^n for n = 0 to infinity. We want to investigate the behavior and possible sum values for this series. We will enumerate the partial sums for n up to some maximum (like 50), printing each partial sum to observe convergence. Since the series involves sign(sin(2^n)), the terms are ±1/(2^n) depending on the sign of sin(2^n).

```python
import math

def sign(x):
    return 1 if x > 0 else -1 if x < 0 else 0

max_n = 50
partial_sum = 0.0

print("Enumerating partial sums of sum_{n=0}^∞ sign(sin(2^n)) / 2^n:")
for n in range(max_n + 1):
    term = sign(math.sin(2**n)) / (2**n)
    partial_sum += term
    # Print sum with exact fraction representation when term is ±1/2^n
    print(f"n={n}, term={sign(math.sin(2**n))}/2^{n} = {term:.6f}, partial_sum ≈ {partial_sum:.10f}")
```
