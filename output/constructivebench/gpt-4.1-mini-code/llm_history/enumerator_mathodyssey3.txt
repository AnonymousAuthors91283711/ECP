The problem gives a system of two linear equations with constraints on natural numbers c and s, and real number t > 1:

1) c * t + s = 100  
2) c + s * t = 101  

with c < s, c ≥ 1, t > 1, and s, c ∈ ℕ, t ∈ ℝ.

We want to find s values > 50 that satisfy these constraints.

We will:
- Enumerate integers c and s with 1 ≤ c < s ≤ 100 (since 100 appears in equations)
- For each pair (c,s), solve for t in real numbers using both equations
- Check if the two computed t’s are consistent and > 1
- Print all such (c,s,t) triples with s > 50
- Then identify unique s values found (conjectured answer)

```python
# Enumerate (c,s) with c < s, c≥1, s>50, up to 100, solve t from both equations and check equality and t >1.

def main():
    for s in range(51, 101):
        for c in range(1, s):
            # From first equation t = (100 - s)/c
            if c == 0:
                continue
            t1 = (100 - s)/c
            # From second equation t = (101 - c)/s
            t2 = (101 - c)/s
            # Check approximate equality of t1 and t2, within a small tolerance
            if abs(t1 - t2) < 1e-9 and t1 > 1:
                print(f"Found solution: c={c}, s={s}, t={t1}")
    # After enumeration, print the s value(s)
    print("\nConjectured mathodyssey3_answer(s) with s > 50 satisfying the system:")
    found_s = [s for s in range(51, 101) for c in range(1, s)
               if c !=0 and abs((100 - s)/c - (101 - c)/s) < 1e-9 and (100 - s)/c > 1]
    unique_s = sorted(set(found_s))
    for s in unique_s:
        print(f"s = {s}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
