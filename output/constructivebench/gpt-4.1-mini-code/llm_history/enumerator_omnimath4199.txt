The problem involves finding an integer \( n \) that can be written as a sum of 2017 squares (with repetition allowed) and such that the number of distinct multisets of 2017 squares summing to \( n \) is at least 2017.

To explore this:

- I will test sums of 2017 squares where each square is small (e.g., 0², 1², 2², 3², 4²).
- Enumerate multisets of these squares of length 2017.
- Count how many distinct multisets sum to the same \( n \).
- Print \( n \) and the corresponding count when count ≥ 2017.

Due to combinatorial explosion, we'll pick square numbers up to some small k², and then randomly vary the counts to generate sums.

I'll focus on sums formed by powers of 0²=0,1²=1,2²=4,3²=9,4²=16 only.

```python
from math import comb

def enum_multisets_sum_squares(length, squares):
    # Try multisets composed of squares with multiplicities summing to length
    # Each multiset is represented by counts of each square
    # We try to find sums with many distinct multisets.

    # Because length=2017 is large, enumerate all is impossible.
    # Instead, fix number of distinct squares used (from 1 to len(squares))
    # and enumerate possible count partitions (compositions) for length=2017.
    # For efficiency, limit max count per square.

    from collections import defaultdict

    max_count_per_square = min(30, length)  # limit max multiplicity to avoid explosion
    freq_sums = defaultdict(int)  # map sum n -> count of multisets

    def backtrack(idx, remaining, counts):
        if idx == len(squares):
            if remaining == 0:
                s = sum(c * sq for c, sq in zip(counts, squares))
                freq_sums[s] += 1
            return
        for c in range(min(max_count_per_square, remaining) + 1):
            counts[idx] = c
            backtrack(idx + 1, remaining - c, counts)

    # Backtrack over multiplicities to sum to length=2017
    # To limit search, consider only first 5 squares and max count per square small.
    backtrack(0, length, [0]*len(squares))
    return freq_sums

if __name__ == "__main__":
    length = 2017
    # Try squares up to 4^2
    squares = [0,1,4,9,16]
    print(f"Testing length={length} and squares={squares}")
    freq_sums = enum_multisets_sum_squares(length, squares)

    threshold = 2017
    candidates = []
    for s, count in freq_sums.items():
        if count >= threshold:
            print(f"Sum {s} can be written as sum of {length} squares in {count} distinct ways")
            candidates.append((s,count))

    if candidates:
        min_sum = min(c[0] for c in candidates)
        max_sum = max(c[0] for c in candidates)
        print(f"Minimum sum with ≥ {threshold} representations: {min_sum}")
        print(f"Maximum sum with ≥ {threshold} representations: {max_sum}")
    else:
        print(f"No sums found with ≥ {threshold} representations under given constraints.")
```
