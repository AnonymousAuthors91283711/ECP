The problem appears to involve finding the value of 0.3 * 200 exactly and verifying it equals some answer. We'll enumerate the product and print the exact value.

```python
# Enumerate the possible product of 0.3 * 200 as a fraction and decimal
def main():
    # Represent 0.3 exactly as 3/10
    numerator = 3 * 200
    denominator = 10
    # Simplify fraction if possible
    from math import gcd
    g = gcd(numerator, denominator)
    numerator //= g
    denominator //= g

    # Print the exact fraction first
    print(f"Exact fraction: {numerator}/{denominator}")
    # Print the decimal value
    decimal_value = numerator / denominator
    print(f"Decimal value: {decimal_value}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
