The problem involves finding the smallest cardinality \( k \) of a finite set \( S \subseteq \{1, \dots, n\} \) such that for every positive real number \(\beta\), if every element of \( S \) can be represented as \(\lfloor \beta m \rfloor\) for some integer \( m \), then every number in \(\{1, \dots, n\}\) can also be represented similarly.

To explore this, the program will:
- Enumerate small values of \( n \) (e.g., 1 to 10).
- For each \( n \), try subsets \( S \) of \( \{1,\ldots,n\} \) in increasing order of size.
- For each \( \beta \) sampled from a small set of positive rationals, check if every element of \( S \) can be expressed as \(\lfloor \beta m \rfloor\) for some integer \(m\) implies the entire interval \( \{1,\ldots,n\} \) can too.
- Print candidates \( k \) for each \( n \).

Given the complexity, we sample representative values of \( \beta \) and check the condition approximately to conjecture minimal cardinalities.

```python
# Enumerate minimal size k of S âŠ† {1,...,n} satisfying the given floor representability property.
# For small n (1 to 10), and subsets S by size k, check sampled beta values.
# Prints found k immediately upon verification.

    def in_S_representable():

            if not any(floor(beta*m) == s for m in range(1, n*10)):
                return False
        return True

    # If S representable, check all 1..n representable similarly
    if not in_S_representable():
        return True # hypothesis doesn't activate, so condition holds vacuously

                return k

    for n in range(1, 11):
        k = enumerate_min_k(n, betas)
        if k is None:
            print(f"n={n} no candidate found")
