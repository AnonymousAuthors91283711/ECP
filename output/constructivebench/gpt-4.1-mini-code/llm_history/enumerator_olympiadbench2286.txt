The problem involves an arithmetic sequence \( t(k) \) defined on natural numbers where:

- The common difference is \( d \) such that \( t(k+1) = t(k) + d \).
- \( t(3) = 5 \)
- \( t(n-2) = 95 \)
- The sum of the first \( n \) terms \( \sum_{k=1}^n t(k) = 1000 \)
- \( n > 5 \)

We want to find \( n \).

We know:
\[
t(k) = t(1) + (k-1)d
\]
Given \( t(3) = 5 \) gives:
\[
t(1) + 2d = 5
\]
Given \( t(n-2) = 95 \) gives:
\[
t(1) + (n-3)d = 95
\]
Sum of \( n \) terms:
\[
S_n = \frac{n}{2} [2 t(1) + (n-1)d] = 1000
\]

We can enumerate possible integer values of \( n > 5 \), and solve for \( d \) and \( t(1) \) using the two equations, then verify the sum equation.

We will enumerate \( n \) from 6 up to say 50, and check for integer \( d \), \( t(1) \) satisfying all conditions exactly and print the candidates.

```python
# Enumerate n > 5 to find integer arithmetic sequences meeting the conditions
# t(3) =5, t(n-2)=95, sum first n terms =1000
# t(k) = t1 + (k-1)*d

def try_n(n):
    # Given:
    # t1 + 2d =5
    # t1 + (n-3)*d =95
    # From two eqns:
    # (n-3)*d - 2d = 95 -5  => (n-5)d=90 => d=90/(n-5)
    denom = n - 5
    if denom == 0:
        return
    if 90 % denom != 0:
        return  # d not integer
    d = 90 // denom
    t1 = 5 - 2*d
    # Sum equation:
    # S = n/2 (2 t1 + (n-1) d) =1000
    lhs = n * (2*t1 + (n-1)*d)
    if lhs != 2000:
        return
    # print the found solution
    print(f"n={n}, d={d}, t1={t1}")

if __name__=="__main__":
    for n in range(6, 51):
        try_n(n)
```
This will print candidate n values with integer difference and initial term satisfying all constraints exactly. From output, we can conjecture the true value of n.
