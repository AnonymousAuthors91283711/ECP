The problem involves sequences \(a_i, b_i > 0\) with a product formula parameterized by an integer \(d\). For small \(n\), we want to enumerate candidates for \(d\) and check if such sequences exist. We try small values for \(n\) (e.g. 1 to 4), loop over possible \(d\) values up to some threshold, and search for positive integer sequences \(a_i, b_i\) with length \(n\) that satisfy the given product equation and inequalities.

The key is to enumerate small \(a_i, b_i\) (e.g. 1 to 5) and check the conditions exactly, printing any \(d\) found. By printing progressively, we allow conjecturing the minimal \(d\) for each \(n\).

```python
from itertools import product

def verify(n, d, a, b):
    # Check positivity
    if any(x <= 0 for x in a) or any(x <= 0 for x in b):
        return False
    # Precompute prefix products of b and suffix products of a
    prod_b = [1]*(n+1)
    for i in range(n):
        prod_b[i+1] = prod_b[i]*b[i]
    prod_a = [1]*(n+1)
    for i in reversed(range(n)):
        prod_a[i] = prod_a[i+1]*a[i]
    total = prod_a[0]
    # Check equations and inequalities
    for k in range(n):
        lhs = prod_b[k]*prod_a[k]
        rhs = total + k*d
        if lhs != rhs:
            return False
        if k < n-1:
            lhs_next = prod_b[k+1]*prod_a[k+1]
            if lhs >= lhs_next:
                return False
    return True

            # To avoid explosion, fix a[0] = 1 for normalization (scale invariance)
            for a in product(range(1, max_val+1), repeat=n):
