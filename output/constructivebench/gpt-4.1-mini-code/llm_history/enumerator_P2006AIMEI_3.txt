The problem seems to ask for the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that there exist digits \( d \) and \( k \) meeting some conditions related to the digits of \( n \), powers of 10, and division by 29. The formulation is a bit abstract, but it resembles problems about splitting or manipulating digits of \( n \) and divisibility constraints.

Our goal is to write a Python enumerator that tries positive integers \( n \), checks whether \( n \) satisfies:
- \( n > 0 \),
- there exists a digit \( d \) among the digits of \( n \),
- \( k = n - d \cdot 10^{m-1} \), where \( m = \) number of digits of \( n \),
- \( k = n / 29 \).

We want to enumerate candidates \( n \), print candidates as we find them, and ultimately identify the minimum \( n \) that satisfies this.

We'll:
- Enumerate \( n \) from 1 upwards, say up to some sensible upper bound.
- Extract digits of \( n \).
- For each digit \( d \), compute \( k \) and check if it satisfies the equation and if \( k \) is an integer.
- If conditions hold, print \( n, d, k \).
- Stop once we identify a smallest \( n \).

To avoid large unnecessary loops, we can set an upper bound, say 10^5 (since it's a high-school level problem, the answer likely isn't huge).

Let's implement this.

```python
# Enumerate positive integers n searching for the smallest n such that
# exists a digit d in n with k = n - d*10^(m-1) and k = n / 29
# where m is the number of digits of n.

def digits(n):
    return list(map(int, str(n)))

def main():
    # Set max search bound
    max_n = 100_000
    found = False
    for n in range(1, max_n+1):
        ds = digits(n)
        m = len(ds)
        p = 10**(m-1)
        for d in ds:
            k = n - d*p
            # k must be positive integer and n/29 == k exactly
            if k > 0 and n == 29*k:
                print(f"n={n}, d={d}, k={k}")
                found = True
                # Since we want smallest n, print and break
                break
        if found:
            print(f"Minimum n found: {n}")
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
