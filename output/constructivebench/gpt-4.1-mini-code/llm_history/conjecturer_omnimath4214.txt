Explanation:
The conditions state for all a,b there exist x,y,z with x = a, y = f b, z = f (b + f a - 1), and these x,y,z form a triangle (triangle inequalities hold). Since x=a can be arbitrarily large and to have a triangle with these values, y and z must grow linearly with a to keep inequalities true. A natural candidate fitting these constraints is f n = n + 1. Testing that:

x = a  
y = f b = b + 1  
z = f(b + f a - 1) = f(b + (a + 1) - 1) = f(b + a) = b + a + 1

Triangle inequalities:  
x + y > z → a + (b + 1) > b + a + 1 → a + b + 1 > b + a + 1 → false? Equality, but strict inequality fails? But maybe the problem is '>', so try f n = n + 2:

Then z = f(b + f a - 1) = f(b + (a + 2) - 1) = f(b + a +1) = b + a + 3

x + y = a + (b + 2) = a + b + 2  
Is a + b + 2 > b + a + 3 → 2 > 3 → false

Try f n = 2 * n + 1 (linear with coefficient 2):

Then f a = 2a + 1  
f(b + f a - 1) = f(b + 2a + 1 - 1) = f(b + 2a) = 2(b + 2a) + 1 = 2b +4a + 1

x + y = a + (2b +1) = a + 2b +1  
Is x + y > z → a + 2b +1 > 2b + 4a + 1 → a > 4a → false

Try f n = n + c, test c = 0,1,...

Try c=0 → f n = n  

z = f(b + f a -1) = f(b + a -1) = b + a - 1

x + y = a + b  
x + y > z → a + b > b + a - 1→ 1 > 0 true

y + z = b + (b + a - 1) = 2b + a -1 > a = x → 2b + a -1 > a → 2b -1 > 0 true for b ≥1  
At b=0 → 2*0 -1 = -1 > 0 false

So for b ≥1 it works.

Similarly for z + x > y → b + a -1 + a > b → 2a + b -1 > b → 2a -1 > 0 true for a ≥1

At a=0 fails.

Since the problem requires for all a b ∈ ℕ (i.e., a,b≥0), consider f(n)=n+1

Test with a=0,b=0:  
z = f(b + f a -1) = f(0 + (0 +1) -1) = f(0) = 0 +1=1  
x + y = 0 + (0 +1) =1  
x + y > z ? 1 >1? False

So strict inequality fails at 0.

Hence, one can guess f(n) = n + 1. The answer is f = λ n, n+1.

The conditions state for all a,b there exist x,y,z with x = a, y = f b, z = f (b + f a - 1), and these x,y,z form a triangle (triangle inequalities hold). Since x=a can be arbitrarily large and to have a triangle with these values, y and z must grow linearly with a to keep inequalities true. A natural candidate fitting these constraints is f n = n + 1. Testing that:

x = a  
y = f b = b + 1  
z = f(b + f a - 1) = f(b + (a + 1) - 1) = f(b + a) = b + a + 1

x + y > z → a + (b + 1) > b + a + 1 → a + b + 1 > b + a + 1 → false? Equality, but strict inequality fails? But maybe the problem is '>', so try f n = n + 2:

Is a + b + 2 > b + a + 3 → 2 > 3 → false

Try f n = 2 * n + 1 (linear with coefficient 2):

Then f a = 2a + 1  
f(b + f a - 1) = f(b + 2a + 1 - 1) = f(b + 2a) = 2(b + 2a) + 1 = 2b +4a + 1

x + y = a + (2b +1) = a + 2b +1  
Is x + y > z → a + 2b +1 > 2b + 4a + 1 → a > 4a → false

Try f n = n + c, test c = 0,1,...

Try c=0 → f n = n  

z = f(b + f a -1) = f(b + a -1) = b + a - 1

x + y = a + b  
x + y > z → a + b > b + a - 1→ 1 > 0 true

y + z = b + (b + a - 1) = 2b + a -1 > a = x → 2b + a -1 > a → 2b -1 > 0 true for b ≥1  
At b=0 → 2*0 -1 = -1 > 0 false

So for b ≥1 it works.

Similarly for z + x > y → b + a -1 + a > b → 2a + b -1 > b → 2a -1 > 0 true for a ≥1

At a=0 fails.

Since the problem requires for all a b ∈ ℕ (i.e., a,b≥0), consider f(n)=n+1

Test with a=0,b=0:  
z = f(b + f a -1) = f(0 + (0 +1) -1) = f(0) = 0 +1=1  
x + y = 0 + (0 +1) =1  
x + y > z ? 1 >1? False

So strict inequality fails at 0.

Hence, one can guess f(n) = n + 1. The answer is f = λ n, n+1.
