The problem involves measuring the proportion of the interval [0,1000] where the nested floor equality holds:
⌊⌊x / 2.5⌋ / 2.5⌋ = ⌊x / 6.25⌋.

To explore this, we can discretize x and check for all x in [0, 1000] whether the equality holds, then estimate the ratio numerically. Since floor functions are piecewise constant, a fine grid approximation with step size 0.01 suffices. Finally, print partial and approximate values.

```python
# Enumerate x in [0,1000] with step 0.01 and check floor equality
from math import floor

def main():
    a, b = 0, 1000
    step = 0.01
    total = int((b - a) / step) + 1
    count = 0
    for i in range(total):
        x = a + i * step
        val1 = floor(floor(x / 2.5) / 2.5)
        val2 = floor(x / 6.25)
        if val1 == val2:
            count += 1
            # Print count and current ratio every 100000 steps (streaming results)
            if count % 100000 == 0:
                ratio = count / (i + 1)
                print(f"Count: {count}, Step: {i}, Ratio: {ratio:.6f}")
    ratio = count / total
    print(f"Final ratio ≈ {ratio:.6f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
