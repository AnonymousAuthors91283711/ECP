Ground Truth Answer: fun a b c => ((b + c)/2, (a + c)/2, (a + b)/2)
Proposed Answer: fun a b c =>
  let Δ := (a + b + c) ^ 2 - 4 * (a * b + b * c + c * a);
  let x := (a + b + c - Real.sqrt Δ) / 4;
  let y := (a + b + c - 2 * x) / 2;
  let z := a + b + c - x - y;
  (x, y, z)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem states a system of equations:
   - x + y + z = a + b + c
   - 4xyz = a²x + b²y + c²z + abc

2. The ground truth answer suggests symmetric solutions where each variable is the average of the other two parameters.

3. The proposed answer introduces a discriminant Δ and provides a more complex solution involving square roots.

Key observations:
- The ground truth solution satisfies both equations when substituted
- The proposed solution's complexity suggests it might be solving a more general case
- The symmetric nature of the ground truth solution matches the symmetric nature of the problem statement
- The proposed solution doesn't simplify to the symmetric form in the general case

The answers are not equivalent because:
1. The proposed solution gives different values when a, b, c are not equal
2. The ground truth solution is always symmetric while the proposed one isn't
3. The proposed solution introduces unnecessary complexity when a simpler symmetric solution exists
