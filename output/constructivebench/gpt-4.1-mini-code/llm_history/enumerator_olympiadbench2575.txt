The problem is a system of three equations involving three real variables x, y, z and logarithms base 10:
```
x + log10(x) = y - 1
y + log10(y - 1) = z - 1
z + log10(z - 2) = x + 2
```
We want to find real triples (x,y,z) satisfying all simultaneously.

To explore solutions, I will enumerate x values in some range, then compute y from the first equation, check domain constraints for the logarithms, then compute z from the second equation, and finally verify if the third equation holds (within some tolerance for floats). I will print all triples found that satisfy the system within floating precision.

Note:
- log10 argument must be positive =>
  For first equation: x > 0
  For second equation: y - 1 > 0 => y > 1
  For third equation: z - 2 > 0 => z > 2

So domain constraints are x>0, y>1, z>2.

I will take x in range 0.1 to 10 with step 0.1, then compute y, check y>1, compute z, check z>2, then verify.

I print each approximate found solution immediately.

```python
import math

def log10(x):
    return math.log10(x)

def approx_equal(a,b, tol=1e-6):
    return abs(a-b) < tol

def main():
    print("Enumerating solutions (x,y,z) of the system approximately:")
    for i in range(1, 101):  # x from 0.1 to 10 by 0.1
        x = i * 0.1
        if x <= 0:
            continue
        # From eq1: y = x + log10(x) + 1
        y = x + math.log10(x) + 1
        if y <= 1:
            continue
        # From eq2: z = y + log10(y - 1) + 1
        if y - 1 <= 0:
            continue
        z = y + math.log10(y - 1) + 1
        if z <= 2:
            continue
        # Check eq3: z + log10(z - 2) ?= x + 2
        if z - 2 <= 0:
            continue
        lhs = z + math.log10(z - 2)
        rhs = x + 2
        if approx_equal(lhs, rhs):
            print(f"x={x:.3f}, y={y:.6f}, z={z:.6f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
