The problem involves counting families of pairwise disjoint subsets selected from a specific union of 2-element subsets of a 20-element set. The sets are arranged as pairs of consecutive elements and pairs using the defined functions `a` and `b`.

I will approximate the problem by enumerating small samples for n=4 (instead of 20), to keep computations feasible, then print all valid collections of disjoint edges from the union of edges.

```python
# Enumerate families of pairwise disjoint 2-element subsets from a set of edges defined similarly to the problem
# For feasibility, test with n=4 instead of 10 (so total 8 elements 0..7)
# Edges: pairs {2i,2i+1} for i in 0..3
#        pairs {2i, 2(i+1)} for i in 0..2 and {2i+1, 2(i+1)+1} for i in 0..2

from itertools import chain, combinations

n = 4
A = list(range(2*n))  # Elements 0..7

# Define edges according to a,b functions
edges = []
# Edges {a i, b i} = {2i, 2i+1}
for i in range(n):
    edges.append(frozenset({2*i, 2*i+1}))
# Edges {a i, a i+1} for i in 0..n-2
for i in range(n-1):
    edges.append(frozenset({2*i, 2*(i+1)}))
# Edges {b i, b i+1} for i in 0..n-2
for i in range(n-1):
    edges.append(frozenset({2*i+1, 2*(i+1)+1}))

edges = list(set(edges))  # Remove duplicates if any

print(f"Parameters n={n}, total elements={len(A)}, edges (sets of size 2):")
for e in edges:
    print(sorted(e))

# Get all subsets of edges
all_subsets = chain.from_iterable(combinations(edges, r) for r in range(len(edges)+1))

def disjoint_family(family):
    used = set()
    for edge in family:
        if used.intersection(edge):
            return False
        used.update(edge)
    return True

count = 0
max_size = 0
print("\nValid families of pairwise disjoint edges:")
for fam in all_subsets:
    if disjoint_family(fam):
        count += 1
        max_size = max(max_size, len(fam))
        print(sorted(sorted(e) for e in fam))

print(f"\nTotal valid families: {count}")
print(f"Maximum size of disjoint family: {max_size}")
```
