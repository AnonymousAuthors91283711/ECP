The problem is to find the greatest natural number \( k \in \{1,2,3,4\} \) such that for every \( n \in \{1,2,3,4\} \),
\[
\sum_{i=1}^4 |i-k| + |i-n| \leq \sum_{i=1}^4 |i-n| + |i-k|.
\]
Because addition is commutative, both sides are equal for each \(k,n\), so this inequality always holds. The problem might be misstated or require a condition I misunderstood, but I'll interpret the problem as finding the greatest \(k\) in \(\{1,2,3,4\}\) that minimizes the expression
\[
\sum_{i=1}^4 (|i-k| + |i-n|).
\]

To assist, the Python code will enumerate \(k,n\in \{1,2,3,4\}\) and compute these sums, printing those \(k\) where the sums are minimized. This enumeration may assist in conjecturing the correct answer.

```python
# Enumerate sums S(k,n) = sum_{i=1}^4 |i-k| + |i-n| for k,n in {1,...,4}
# Print all values, note minimal sums for each n, then find the max k minimizing sums.

def abs_dist(a, b):
    return abs(a - b)

def sum_abs_dist(k, n):
    return sum(abs_dist(i, k) + abs_dist(i, n) for i in range(1, 5))

# Store minimal sums per n
min_sums = {}

print("Enumerating sums S(k,n) = sum_{i=1}^4 (|i-k| + |i-n|) for k,n in {1..4}:")

for n in range(1, 5):
    min_sum = None
    candidates = []
    for k in range(1, 5):
        s = sum_abs_dist(k, n)
        print(f"k={k}, n={n} => sum = {s}")
        if (min_sum is None) or (s < min_sum):
            min_sum = s
            candidates = [k]
        elif s == min_sum:
            candidates.append(k)
    min_sums[n] = (min_sum, candidates)
    print(f"Minimum sum for n={n}: {min_sum} achieved by k={candidates}")

# Find k which appears as minimizer for all n
from collections import Counter

all_min_k = [k for n in min_sums for k in min_sums[n][1]]
count_k = Counter(all_min_k)
print("\nCounts of k appearing as minimal sum achievers across all n:")
for k in range(1,5):
    print(f"k={k}: {count_k[k]}")

max_k = max(k for k in range(1,5) if count_k[k]==4)
print(f"\nGreatest k achieving minimal sums for all n in [1..4] is {max_k}")
```
