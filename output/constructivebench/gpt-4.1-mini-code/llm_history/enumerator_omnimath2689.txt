The problem appears to relate two natural numbers `wednesdayPoints` and `fridayPoints` by a factor of 80/100 (which is 4/5). The theorem claims equivalence between `fridayPoints = wednesdayPoints * 80 / 100` and `fridayPoints = omnimath2689_answer wednesdayPoints`.

To explore this, a natural approach is to enumerate values of `wednesdayPoints`, compute `wednesdayPoints * 80 / 100` exactly as an integer division (floor), and check what values of `fridayPoints` satisfy the equation. We seek an integer function `omnimath2689_answer` that returns this exact value.

Below is a Python program enumerating some sample `wednesdayPoints` values, computing the expression exactly with integer operations, and printing them. This helps conjecture the explicit form of `omnimath2689_answer`.

```python
# Enumerate (wednesdayPoints, fridayPoints) such that fridayPoints = floor(wednesdayPoints * 80 / 100)
# to conjecture the function omnimath2689_answer(wednesdayPoints).

def omnimath2689_answer(wp: int) -> int:
    # Exact integer multiplication and division: equivalent to floor(wp * 80 / 100)
    return (wp * 80) // 100

def main():
    print("Enumerating wednesdayPoints and corresponding fridayPoints = wednesdayPoints*80//100")
    for wednesdayPoints in range(1, 21):  # small sample values
        fridayPoints = omnimath2689_answer(wednesdayPoints)
        print(f"wednesdayPoints = {wednesdayPoints}, fridayPoints = {fridayPoints}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
