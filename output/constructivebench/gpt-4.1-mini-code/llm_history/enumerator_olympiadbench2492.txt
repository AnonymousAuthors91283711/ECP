The problem considers the cartesian product Ω = A × B where A = {1,2,3,4,5} and B = {6,7,8}, and defines even_count as the number of pairs (a,b) in Ω such that a^b is even. We want to find the rational value of even_count / |Ω|.

To solve this, we'll enumerate all pairs (a,b), check if a^b is even, count those, and print the fraction. Since a^b's parity depends only on the parity of a, because even^anything is even, odd^anything is odd. So we'll check if a is even. This quickly speeds the problem.

```python
# Enumerate pairs (a,b) with a in {1,2,3,4,5}, b in {6,7,8}
# Count pairs where a^b is even, then print ratio.

from fractions import Fraction

A = [1,2,3,4,5]
B = [6,7,8]
total = len(A) * len(B)
even_count = 0

for a in A:
    is_a_even = (a % 2 == 0)
    # If a even, a^b always even; else always odd.
    count_for_a = len(B) if is_a_even else 0
    even_count += count_for_a
    # Stream printing counts per a
    print(f"a={a}: even_count contributed={count_for_a}")

result = Fraction(even_count, total)
print(f"Total even_count = {even_count}")
print(f"Total pairs = {total}")
print(f"Fraction even_count/total = {result}")
```
