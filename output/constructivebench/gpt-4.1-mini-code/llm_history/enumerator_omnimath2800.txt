The problem asks to find natural numbers \(m, n\) with \(m > 0\) and \(n > 1\) such that 
\[m^n = 2^{25} \cdot 3^{40}\]
and then determine \(m + n\).

A good approach is to enumerate possible \(n\) values (with \(n > 1\)) and factorize the exponents \(25\) and \(40\) by \(n\) to check if \(m\) can be represented as \(2^a 3^b\) with integer exponents \(a, b\). The condition is \(n\) divides both 25 and 40 in their prime factorization exponents after division. Since \(m^n = 2^{25} 3^{40}\), take \(n\)-th root:
\[m = 2^{25/n} 3^{40/n}\]
and \(25/n, 40/n\) must be integers.

We enumerate \(n>1\) divisors of 25 and 40 for which both are integers, then find \(m\) and print \(m+n\).

```python
# Enumerate possible (m,n) with m^n = 2^25 * 3^40, m>0, n>1, all integers
# m = 2^(25/n) * 3^(40/n), so 25/n and 40/n must be integers => n divides 25 and 40

def divisors(x):
    divs = []
    for i in range(1, x+1):
        if x % i == 0:
            divs.append(i)
    return divs

# Exponents in prime factorization
e2, e3 = 25, 40
n_candidates = [n for n in divisors(e2) if n > 1 and e3 % n == 0]

for n in n_candidates:
    a = e2 // n
    b = e3 // n
    # m = 2^a * 3^b
    m = (2 ** a) * (3 ** b)
    print(f"Found solution: m={m}, n={n}, m+n={m + n}")

if n_candidates:
    # To find extremal sum if required
    sums = [( (2**(e2//n))*(3**(e3//n)) + n ) for n in n_candidates]
    m_n_min = min(sums)
    print(f"Minimum m+n among found: {m_n_min}")
else:
    print("No solutions with n>1 found.")
```
