The given problem involves evaluating a product of terms \(\prod_{k=0}^8 \left(1 + 2 \times 10^{-(k+1)}\right)\), then taking the logarithm base \(\frac{1}{10}\). To assist in conjecturing the exact logarithm value, we enumerate and print the product and its logarithm for a few initial terms and the full product for \(k=0\) to \(8\).

```python
import math

# Since 1/10 is the base, log base 1/10( x ) = log( x ) / log(1/10)
def log_base_1_10(x):
    return math.log(x) / math.log(0.1)

prod = 1.0
for k in range(9):
    term = 1 + 2 * (0.1) ** (k + 1)
    prod *= term
    log_val = log_base_1_10(prod)
    print(f"k={k}, term={term:.15f}, partial product={prod:.15f}, log base 0.1 = {log_val:.15f}")

print(f"Final product for k=0 to 8: {prod:.15f}")
print(f"Logarithm base 1/10 of product: {log_base_1_10(prod):.15f}")
```
