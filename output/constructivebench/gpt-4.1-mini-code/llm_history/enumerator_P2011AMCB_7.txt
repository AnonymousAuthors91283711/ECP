The problem is about finding the greatest value of the ratio \( \frac{x}{y} \) for two-digit integers \( x, y \) such that their average is 60, i.e. \( \frac{x+y}{2} = 60 \). Equivalently, \( x + y = 120 \) with \( 10 \leq x, y \leq 99 \). We want to enumerate all such pairs \((x,y)\), compute \( \frac{x}{y} \), and identify the maximum ratio.

We'll try all pairs meeting \( x+y=120 \) with \(10 \leq x,y \leq 99\), print the ratio exactly as a fraction (no floating point approximation), and finally print the maximum ratio found.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def main():
    # Given constraints
    min_digit = 10
    max_digit = 99
    target_sum = 120

    max_ratio = None
    max_pair = None

    print("Enumerating fractions x/y with x+y=120 and 10 ≤ x,y ≤ 99:")

    for x in range(min_digit, max_digit + 1):
        y = target_sum - x
        if y < min_digit or y > max_digit:
            continue
        ratio = Fraction(x, y)
        print(f"x={x}, y={y} => Ratio = {ratio}")  # Fraction prints as a numerator/denominator if not integer

        if max_ratio is None or ratio > max_ratio:
            max_ratio = ratio
            max_pair = (x, y)

    print(f"\nMaximum ratio found: x={max_pair[0]}, y={max_pair[1]}, ratio = {max_ratio}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
