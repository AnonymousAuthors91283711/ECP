The problem counts positive integers up to 2009 where the floor of the base-2 logarithm is odd. The floor of log₂ n is the integer part of the exponent in the binary representation of n minus one. Odd floor log₂ means the highest power of two in n is 2^k where k is odd.

Enumerate n from 1 to 2009, compute floor(log₂ n), check if odd, count and print whenever condition holds.

```python
import math

def is_odd(x): 
    return x % 2 == 1

count = 0
for n in range(1, 2010):
    flog = math.floor(math.log2(n))
    if is_odd(flog):
        count += 1
        print(f"n={n}, floor(log2(n))={flog} (odd)")

print(f"Total count: {count}")
```
