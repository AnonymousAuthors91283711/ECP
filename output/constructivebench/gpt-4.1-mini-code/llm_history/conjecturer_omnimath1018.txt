abbrev omnimath1018_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath1018 (n : ℕ) (h : n > 0) :
  (¬∃ (k : ℕ), (∀ m ∈ Icc (k + 1) (k + n), ¬Nat.Prime m) ∧ k + n < n !) ↔ n ∈ omnimath1018_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Checking n from 1 to 10
n=1: No such k found with all composite in interval of length 1 below 1
Thus, n=1 ∈ omnimath1018_answer (no such k exists)
n=2: No such k found with all composite in interval of length 2 below 2
Thus, n=2 ∈ omnimath1018_answer (no such k exists)
n=3: No such k found with all composite in interval of length 3 below 6
Thus, n=3 ∈ omnimath1018_answer (no such k exists)
n=4: No such k found with all composite in interval of length 4 below 24
Thus, n=4 ∈ omnimath1018_answer (no such k exists)
n=5: Found k=23 with all composite in [24, 28], k+n=28 < 5!=120
Thus, n=5 ∉ omnimath1018_answer (such k exists)
n=6: Found k=89 with all composite in [90, 95], k+n=95 < 6!=720
Thus, n=6 ∉ omnimath1018_answer (such k exists)
n=7: Found k=89 with all composite in [90, 96], k+n=96 < 7!=5040
Thus, n=7 ∉ omnimath1018_answer (such k exists)
n=8: Found k=113 with all composite in [114, 121], k+n=121 < 8!=40320
Thus, n=8 ∉ omnimath1018_answer (such k exists)
n=9: Found k=113 with all composite in [114, 122], k+n=122 < 9!=362880
Thus, n=9 ∉ omnimath1018_answer (such k exists)
n=10: Found k=113 with all composite in [114, 123], k+n=123 < 10!=3628800
Thus, n=10 ∉ omnimath1018_answer (such k exists). Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
