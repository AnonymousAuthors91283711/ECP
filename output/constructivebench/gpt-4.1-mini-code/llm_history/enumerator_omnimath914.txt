The problem asks about integers \( a \) in the interval [2,101] such that the sequence \( (a^{2^n} \bmod 100) \) eventually stabilizes, i.e., becomes constant from some \( N \) onwards. We want to enumerate such \( a \) and find how many there are.

Key observations:
- We can try each \( a \in [2, 101] \).
- For each \( a \), compute powers \( a^{2^n} \bmod 100 \) until repetition or stabilization.
- Check if there's some \( N \) so that from \( N \) on, the residues stabilize.
- Print candidate \( a \).
- Finally print the count.

We'll limit up to a reasonable \( n \) because \( 2^n \) grows fast. We can check up to, say, \( n=10 \).

```python
# Enumerate a in [2..101], find all where a^{2^n} mod 100 stabilizes for some N>=1.
# Print each candidate immediately, then print total count.

def modpow(base, exp, mod):
    result = 1
    cur = base % mod
    e = exp
    while e > 0:
        if e & 1:
            result = (result * cur) % mod
        cur = (cur * cur) % mod
        e >>= 1
    return result

def sequence_stabilizes(a, mod=100, max_steps=15):
    vals = []
    for n in range(max_steps):
        exp = 2 ** n
        val = modpow(a, exp, mod)
        vals.append(val)
    # Check if from some N, vals[N:] are all equal
    for N in range(1, max_steps):
        if all(v == vals[N] for v in vals[N:]):
            return True
    return False

def main():
    count = 0
    for a in range(2, 102):
        if sequence_stabilizes(a):
            print(a)
            count += 1
    print("Total count:", count)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
