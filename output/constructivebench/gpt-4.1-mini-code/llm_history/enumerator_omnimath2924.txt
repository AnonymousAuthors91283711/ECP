The problem is to find the smallest number \( n \geq 100000 \) divisible by 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15, and of the form \( 100000 + k \times 10 \) for some integer \( k \). 

We want to enumerate values starting from 100000 and increasing by 10 each time, checking divisibility by all those numbers until we find the smallest such number.

```python
def lcm(a, b):
    from math import gcd
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def lcm_list(numbers):
    from functools import reduce
    from math import gcd
    def lcm(a, b):
        return a * b // gcd(a, b)
    return reduce(lcm, numbers, 1)

def main():
    divisors = [10,11,12,13,14,15]
    base = 100000
    step = 10
    l = lcm_list(divisors)  # Compute LCM for efficiency
    
    print(f"Divisors: {divisors}")
    print(f"LCM of divisors: {l}")
    
    # n must be >= 100000 and divisible by lcm
    # find the smallest multiple of lcm >= 100000 that is multiple of 10 (already included)
    start = (base + l - 1)//l * l  # smallest multiple of l >= base
    
    # we want n = 100000 + k*10, so check multiples of lcm starting from start, stepping by lcm
    # also confirm each matches n = 100000 + k * 10 form (should be always true as lcm multiple >= 100000 and divisible by 10)
    n = start
    while True:
        if n >= base and (n - base) % step == 0:
            k = (n - base) // step
            print(f"Found candidate: n={n}, k={k}")
            break
        n += l

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
