The problem is to find all integer pairs \((m,n)\) such that

\[
m^5 - n^5 = 16 m n.
\]

We'll enumerate integer pairs \((m,n)\) with small absolute values (e.g., \(-10 \leq m,n \leq 10\)) and print all solutions exactly.

```python
# Enumerate integer pairs (m, n) with |m|, |n| â‰¤ 10 to find all (m,n) 
# such that m^5 - n^5 = 16*m*n
def main():
    limit = 10
    for m in range(-limit, limit + 1):
        for n in range(-limit, limit + 1):
            # Skip trivial zero pair to avoid zero division if any later needed
            # But here no division needed, just check equation directly.
            lhs = m**5 - n**5
            rhs = 16 * m * n
            if lhs == rhs:
                print(f"Solution found: m={m}, n={n}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
