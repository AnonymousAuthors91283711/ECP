The problem appears to involve real parameters \( m, b \) with a condition relating their product \( m b \) to the interval \((-1, 0)\). To explore this, we'll enumerate some small integer values for \( m \) and \( b \), compute their products, and check which satisfy \( -1 < m b < 0 \). This helps conjecture which pairs belong to the solution set.

```python
# Enumerate (m, b) integer pairs where m, b in [-5,5], excluding zero to avoid trivial zero product.
# For each pair, check if product m*b lies in (-1, 0), and print it.

print("Enumerating integer pairs (m,b) with product in (-1,0):")

for m in range(-5, 6):
    if m == 0:
        continue
    for b in range(-5, 6):
        if b == 0:
            continue
        prod = m * b
        if -1 < prod < 0:
            print(f"m={m}, b={b}, product={prod}")

print("\nNow enumerating some rational pairs with smaller absolute values but fractional products:")

from fractions import Fraction

# Try small fractions for m and b with numerator and denominator in range -3..3
vals = [Fraction(n, d) for n in range(-3,4) for d in range(1,4) if d!=0 and n!=0]

for m in vals:
    for b in vals:
        prod = m * b
        # check product in (-1,0)
        if prod > Fraction(-1,1) and prod < 0:
            print(f"m={m}, b={b}, product={prod}")
```
