Ground Truth Answer: fun (m, n) => Nat.gcd (m + 1) n = 1
Proposed Answer: fun p : ℕ × ℕ =>
  let m := p.1
  let n := p.2
  ∃ d : ℕ, d ∣ m ∧ d ∣ n ∧
    ∃ q : Polynomial ℤ,
    (∑ k in Finset.range (m + 1), X^(n * k)) = (∑ k in Finset.range (m + 1), X^k) * q ∧
    (q = ∑ k in Finset.range (n / d), C ((-1 : ℤ) ^ k) * X^(d * k))
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

The ground truth states that gcd(m+1, n) = 1, meaning m+1 and n are coprime.

The proposed answer is more complex, suggesting there exists a divisor d of both m and n, with a specific polynomial form for q.

Key observations:
1. The ground truth focuses on the relationship between m+1 and n
2. The proposed answer focuses on divisors of m and n
3. The conditions are fundamentally different - one is about coprimality, the other about common divisors
4. The proposed answer's polynomial condition doesn't directly relate to the gcd condition

They are not equivalent because:
- The proposed answer would be true for many cases where gcd(m+1,n) ≠ 1
- The ground truth is much simpler and captures the exact condition needed
