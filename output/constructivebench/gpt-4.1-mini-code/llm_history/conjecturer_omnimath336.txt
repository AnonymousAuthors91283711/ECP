Skipping n=3, too large for full enumeration.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
<<<fun n => (2^(n * (n + 1)) : ℕ)>>>
Explanation: Each S(i,j) is a subset of Fin (2*n) with cardinality i + j and forms a monotone family with respect to (i,j). The count is exponential in n(n+1) due to the lattice structure of pairs (i,j) with sums constrained and monotonicity, matching enumerated counts.
