The problem involves summing k * (C(127, k) mod 8) for k=1 to 63. We want to find the value of this sum modulo 8. Due to the modulo involved inside the sum, and a large binomial coefficient, it's more straightforward to enumerate and sum exact residues. We will enumerate k from 1 to 63, compute C(127, k) mod 8, multiply by k, sum all, and print the partial results. Finally, print the total sum.

```python
from math import comb

def mod8_comb(n, k):
    # Compute C(n, k) mod 8 using Python's comb and mod
    return comb(n, k) % 8

def main():
    n = 127
    total = 0
    print(f"Enumerating for n={n}, k=1..63")
    for k in range(1, 64):
        c_mod = mod8_comb(n, k)  # C(127, k) mod 8
        val = k * c_mod
        total += val
        print(f"k={k}: C({n},{k}) mod 8 = {c_mod}, term = {val}, partial sum = {total}")
    print(f"Total sum = {total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
