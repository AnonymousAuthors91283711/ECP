  omnimath352_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating sums S(k,n) = sum_{i=1}^4 (|i-k| + |i-n|) for k,n in {1..4}:
k=1, n=1 => sum = 12
k=2, n=1 => sum = 10
k=3, n=1 => sum = 10
k=4, n=1 => sum = 12
Minimum sum for n=1: 10 achieved by k=[2, 3]
k=1, n=2 => sum = 10
k=2, n=2 => sum = 8
k=3, n=2 => sum = 8
k=4, n=2 => sum = 10
Minimum sum for n=2: 8 achieved by k=[2, 3]
k=1, n=3 => sum = 10
k=2, n=3 => sum = 8
k=3, n=3 => sum = 8
k=4, n=3 => sum = 10
Minimum sum for n=3: 8 achieved by k=[2, 3]
k=1, n=4 => sum = 12
k=2, n=4 => sum = 10
k=3, n=4 => sum = 10
k=4, n=4 => sum = 12
Minimum sum for n=4: 10 achieved by k=[2, 3]

Counts of k appearing as minimal sum achievers across all n:
k=1: 0
k=2: 4
k=3: 4
k=4: 0

Greatest k achieving minimal sums for all n in [1..4] is 3. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
