The problem involves a sequence \(a_i\) indexed by \(i \in \{0, \ldots, 2019\}\) of positive integers with divisibility conditions for indices \(i \geq 2\):
- \(a_{i+1}\) is divisible by \(a_i\),
- \(a_{i+1}\) is divisible by \(a_i + a_{i-1}\).

We want to find or conjecture the minimal possible \(a_{2019}\).

To investigate, we'll try smaller sequences and print possible values of \(a_n\) for small \(n\), examining the growth pattern and divisibility constraints to assist in conjecturing \(a_{2019}\).

```python
# Enumerate sequences (a_0, a_1, ..., a_n) with positive integers subject to:
# For i >= 2:
#   a_{i+1} % a_i == 0
#   a_{i+1} % (a_i + a_{i-1}) == 0
# Goal: explore possible values of a_n, especially a_3, a_4 ... a_10 to understand growth and divisibility.
# We'll try small initial values and print all candidates.

def gcd(a,b):
    while b:
        a,b = b,a%b
    return a

def lcm(a,b):
    return a//gcd(a,b) * b

def enumerate_sequences(n_max, a0_max=3, a1_max=3):
    # a_0 and a_1 in [1..a0_max] and [1..a1_max]
    # Recursively build sequences and print valid a_n values
    from collections import deque

    # States are tuples: (seq), where seq is a list of length at least 2
    queue = deque()
    for a0 in range(1, a0_max+1):
        for a1 in range(1, a1_max+1):
            queue.append([a0,a1])

    print("Enumerating sequences up to n =", n_max)
    while queue:
        seq = queue.popleft()
        idx = len(seq)-1
        if idx == n_max:
            # Print the terminal a_n value
            print(f"a_{idx} = {seq[-1]} with start (a0,a1)=({seq[0]},{seq[1]})")
            continue
        if idx+1 < 2:
            # Not enough terms to apply condition, append arbitrary positive number? No, start only with 2 terms and go forward.
            continue
        i = idx  # current index corresponds to a_i
        # i corresponds to a_i, we want to find a_{i+1} s.t
        # a_{i+1} % a_i == 0
        # a_{i+1} % (a_i + a_{i-1}) == 0
        a_i = seq[i]
        a_i_1 = seq[i-1]
        base = lcm(a_i, a_i + a_i_1)
        # a_{i+1} is a multiple of base, try small multiples
        # to avoid explosion, try multiples 1..5
        for m in range(1,6):
            next_val = base * m
            if next_val > 10**10:
                continue
            new_seq = seq + [next_val]
            queue.append(new_seq)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # We explore sequences up to n=5 to limit output
    enumerate_sequences(5)
