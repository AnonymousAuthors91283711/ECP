Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: 0
Since the problem involves a theorem statement with several hypotheses and both the ground truth answer and proposed answer are marked as `sorry` (which typically means the proof is incomplete or omitted in Lean), we cannot definitively determine the correctness of the proposed answer `0` without additional context or proof. The proposed answer might be correct under the given hypotheses, but without seeing the actual proof or reasoning, we cannot confirm its equivalence to the ground truth.
