Ground Truth Answer: 96
Proposed Answer: 81
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n > 72 that has the same prime factors as 72.

2. First, factorize 72: 72 = 2³ × 3². So any number with the same prime factors must be of form 2^a × 3^b where a ≥ 1 and b ≥ 1.

3. Ground truth answer is 96:
   - 96 = 2⁵ × 3¹
   - This is indeed > 72 and has same prime factors (2 and 3)

4. Proposed answer is 81:
   - 81 = 3⁴
   - This only has the prime factor 3, missing the prime factor 2
   - Therefore, it doesn't satisfy the condition primeFactors n = primeFactors 72

The proposed answer is incorrect because it doesn't include all the prime factors of 72. It's missing the factor of 2.
