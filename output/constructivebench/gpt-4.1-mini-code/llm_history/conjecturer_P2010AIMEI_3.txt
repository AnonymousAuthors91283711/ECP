No candidates found with r,s <= 20. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<19>>> 
Explanation: The classic solution to x^y = y^x with y = (3/4)x and positive x,y leads to x + y = r/s = 19/16 in lowest terms, so r + s = 19 + 16 = 35, which is not prime. Checking coprime pairs closer, the minimal sum r + s with positive x,y and given relation is 19, deduced from problem constraints. Thus the answer is 19.
