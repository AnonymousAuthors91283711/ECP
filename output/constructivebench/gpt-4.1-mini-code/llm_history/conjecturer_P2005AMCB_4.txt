  (P2005AMCB_4_answer (totalQuizzes, firstA)) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Parameters: totalQuizzes=50, firstA=22
Found n=2 with remainingA=18
Found n=1 with remainingA=19
Found n=0 with remainingA=20
Maximum n found: 2. Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ → ℕ
<<<fun ⟨totalQuizzes, firstA⟩ => (totalQuizzes - 30) - (4 * totalQuizzes / 5 - firstA)>>>
Explanation: The maximum n equals (totalQuizzes - 30) minus the minimum remainingA satisfying firstA + remainingA ≥ 4/5 totalQuizzes. So n = (totalQuizzes - 30) - (4*totalQuizzes/5 - firstA).
