The problem involves a predicate relating odd integers m > 1, divisibility conditions involving powers of m, and a special function `omnimath43_answer r` that depends only on r. We want to explore values of r and k in small ranges to enumerate possible k for which there exists such an m and n.

We will:
1. Try small values of r (0 to 3).
2. For each r, try k up to a certain upper bound.
3. For each pair (r,k), try small odd m > 1 (e.g., 3,5,7,...).
4. Check if k divides m^(2^r)-1.
5. Try n in a reasonable small range, to check if m divides n^((m^(2^r)-1)/k)+1.
6. Print all (r,k) pairs where such m,n exist.
7. We expect for each r a unique such k (the theorem states an iff).
8. Print candidate values of k per r and conjecture the answer.

We try to keep output short and print as soon as found.

# Enumerate candidates for the omnimath43 problem.
# For r in [0..3] and k in [1..30], try small odd m>1
# and n in [0..10], check conditions and print results.
