Explanation:  
The problem is that Lean does not recognize `sqrt` by itself without importing `Real.sqrt` or referring to it via the `Real` namespace. Also, `sqrt 2` is shorthand in informal math but in Lean you need either `Real.sqrt 2` or `real.sqrt 2` depending on imports. Since `real` (the module alias) is standard in mathlib for real operations, we can use `Real.sqrt 2` with capital R if we import `analysis.special_functions.sqrt` or just prefix with `Real.` if the real number namespace is already open.

The numerical values strongly suggest the limit is about 0.7245 which is approximately `1 / √2 ≈ 0.7071` but the enumerated answers converge to a value slightly above 0.72, not exactly `1/sqrt(2)`. So the proposed answer `1 / sqrt 2` might not be correct purely numerically.

However, since the problem states the proposed answer is `1 / sqrt 2` we just fix the Lean error for sqrt by explicitly writing `Real.sqrt 2`. Alternatively, sometimes `Real.sqrt` is not available by default, then importing `analysis.special_functions.sqrt` is needed. But here just the expression fix suffices.

Final fixed answer:
<<<1 / Real.sqrt 2>>>
