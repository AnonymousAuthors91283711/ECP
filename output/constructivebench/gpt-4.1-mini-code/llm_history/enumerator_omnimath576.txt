[write_program]
The problem involves summing over \( n \) the ratio of the number of idempotent functions from an \( n \)-element set to itself, divided by \( n! \). The program enumerates counts of idempotent functions for small \( n \), then computes the partial sums. This helps conjecture the infinite sum value.

```python
import math

# Count idempotent functions Fin n → Fin n
# A function f: [n]→[n] is idempotent if f(f(x))=f(x) ∀x
# Idempotent functions correspond to functions whose image are fixed points (f(x)=x)
# It's known number of idempotents = ∑_{k=0}^n (C(n,k)*k^(n-k))
# see https://mathoverflow.net/questions/112726/count-of-idempotent-self-maps

def idempotent_count(n):
    total = 0
    for k in range(n+1):
        c = math.comb(n, k)
        total += c * (k ** (n - k))
    return total

max_n = 12
partial_sum = 0.0

print("n: idempotent_count / n!   partial_sum")
for n in range(max_n + 1):
    c = idempotent_count(n)
    f = math.factorial(n)
    ratio = c / f if f > 0 else 0
    partial_sum += ratio
    print(f"{n}: {c}/{f} = {ratio:.6f}   sum = {partial_sum:.6f}")

print("\nConjectured value of infinite sum approximated by partial sums above.")
```
