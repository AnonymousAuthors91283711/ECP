The problem is to compute the average value of ((a+1)*(b+1)) mod 8 for a,b from 0 to 7. We want to enumerate all values, compute the sum, and print the average.

```python
# Enumerate all pairs (a,b) with a,b in 0..7
# Compute ((a+1)*(b+1)) % 8, accumulate sum, print each value
# Then print final average as a fraction

from fractions import Fraction

total = 0
count = 0
for a in range(8):
    for b in range(8):
        value = ((a+1)*(b+1)) % 8
        print(f"Value at a={a}, b={b}: {value}")
        total += value
        count += 1

avg = Fraction(total, count)
print(f"Sum = {total}")
print(f"Count = {count}")
print(f"Average = {avg}")
```
