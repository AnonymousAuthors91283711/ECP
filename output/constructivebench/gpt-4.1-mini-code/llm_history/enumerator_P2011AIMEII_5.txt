The problem involves geometric sums with parameters \(a\) and \(r\), where \(r \neq 1\), and given two sums over ranges 2011 and 4022 equal to 200 and 380 respectively. The task is to find the sum over the range 6033. We know geometric sums have a formula:

\[
\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a r^k = a \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1}
\]

Given the two sums and values, we can set up equations and solve for \(a\) and \(r\), then compute the third sum. The code below enumerates candidate \(r\) values (we try rational approximations), solves for \(a\), checks the given sums, and prints exact or close matches along with the sum for 6033 terms.

```python
# Enumerate solution candidates for a, r given sums, then compute the third sum.

def geom_sum(a, r, n):
    # Geometric sum formula
    if abs(r - 1) < 1e-12:
        return a * n
    return a * (r**n - 1)/(r - 1)

def close(x, y, tol=1e-9):
    return abs(x - y) < tol

    # sum_{k=0}^{4021} a r^k = 380
    # Find sum_{k=0}^{6032} a r^k
    
    # From sum formulas:
    # S1 = a (r^2011 -1)/(r-1) = 200
    # S2 = a (r^4022 -1)/(r-1) = 380
    # Let denom = r -1
    # Use S2/S1 = (r^4022 -1)/(r^2011 -1) = 380/200 = 1.9

    # We'll try rational r values >0 but not 1.

[refine_program]
The original program attempts to find values a and r satisfying the two sum conditions by brute forcing r in certain ranges and verifying the sums. However:

- It uses very large exponents (up to 4022), which causes overflow or underflow in floating point and leads to unreliable computations.
- The chosen ranges and step sizes do not yield candidates close enough.
- The program does not check the special case when r is close to 1 properly.
- The computations could be reworked using algebraic manipulation to find r exactly from the ratio condition and then compute a.
- The problem is a standard geometric series sum problem that can be solved algebraically rather than brute forcing with large powers.

Hence, I reject the original program as it does not produce output and does not meet the problem constraints effectively.

<<<False>>>
```python
# Corrected program that solves the problem algebraically and then prints the requested sum.
def main():
    # We have sums:
    # S_n = a (r^n - 1)/(r-1)
    # Given:
    # S_2011 = 200
    # S_4022 = 380

    # From these,
    # S_4022 / S_2011 = (r^4022 - 1)/(r^2011 - 1) = 380/200 = 1.9
    target_ratio = 1.9

    # Let x = r^2011
    # Then (x^2 -1)/(x -1) = x + 1 = 1.9 --> x + 1 = 1.9 --> x = 0.9

    # So r^2011 = 0.9

    # Thus r = (0.9)^(1/2011), a = ?

    # Compute r:
    r = 0.9 ** (1/2011)

    # Compute a from S_2011 = 200:
    # 200 = a * (r^2011 -1)/(r-1) = a * (0.9 -1)/(r-1) = a * (-0.1)/(r-1)
    # So, a = 200 * (r-1)/(-0.1) = 200 * (r-1)/(-0.1)

    a = 200 * (r - 1)/(-0.1)


[refine_program]
The provided "program" is essentially empty; it only restates the problem statement in a Lean theorem style and does not include any Python code attempting to solve or enumerate answers. This does not meet the requirements because:

- No Python code is given to enumerate or explore answers.
- No outputs or partial results are printed.
- No computations are performed or attempted.
- Hence, there is nothing to check or verify.

Therefore, I must reject the empty submission and provide a corrected Python enumerator program that tries to solve or enumerate the problem stated.

### Problem Restatement and Analysis

The problem is to find the sum:

\[
\sum_{k=0}^{6032} a r^k
\]

given:

\[
\sum_{k=0}^{2010} a r^k = 200 \quad\text{and}\quad \sum_{k=0}^{4021} a r^k = 380
\]

where \(r \neq 1\), \(a, r \in \mathbb{R}\). The problem asks for the sum up to \(k=6032\).

The geometric series formula gives:

\[
\sum_{k=0}^{n} a r^k = a \frac{r^{n+1} - 1}{r - 1}
\]

Set this equal to the given sums:

\[
a \frac{r^{2011} - 1}{r - 1} = 200
\]
\[
a \frac{r^{4022} - 1}{r - 1} = 380
\]

Divide the two equations:

\[
\frac{r^{4022} - 1}{r^{2011} - 1} = \frac{380}{200} = 1.9
\]

Set \(x = r^{2011}\), then the above becomes:

\[
\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} = 1.9 \iff x + 1 = 1.9 \implies x = 0.9
\]

Now knowing \(x=0.9 = r^{2011}\), and \(r \neq 1\),

\[
a = \frac{200 (r - 1)}{r^{2011} - 1} = \frac{200 (r - 1)}{0.9 -
