abbrev omnimath2447_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath2447 :
  ∃! (P : ℚ[X]), degree P ≤ 3 ∧
  (∀ x ∈ ({1, 2, 3, 4} : Finset ℕ), eval (↑x) P = 1 / (1 + x + x^2)) ∧
  eval 5 P = omnimath2447_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Polynomial coefficients (constant to x^3):
x^0: 67/91
x^1: -7/13
x^2: 41/273
x^3: -4/273
P(5) = -3/91. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
