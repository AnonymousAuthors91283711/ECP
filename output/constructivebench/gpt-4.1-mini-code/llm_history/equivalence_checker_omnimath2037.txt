Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (1 / 6)^n
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => (1 / (5 : ℚ)) ^ n
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a linear functional f on (Fin n → ℚ) with special values when inputs are 3 or 4.
2. The ground truth answer suggests that f applied to the constant 5 function is (1/6)^n.
3. The proposed answer suggests it's (1/5)^n.

The key insight is that the functional f is completely determined by its behavior on basis vectors (due to linearity) and the special condition. For constant functions, we can derive that f must satisfy f(constant c) = (1/(c+1))^n. For c=5, this gives (1/6)^n, not (1/5)^n.

The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't match the ground truth. The correct answer should involve 6 in the denominator, not 5.
