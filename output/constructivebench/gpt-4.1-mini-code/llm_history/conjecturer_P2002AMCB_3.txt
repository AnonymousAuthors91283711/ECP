theorem P2002AMCB_3 : 
  Nat.card {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ Nat.Prime (n^2 - 3*n + 2)} = P2002AMCB_3_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n=3, prime=2
Total count: 1. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The condition n^2 - 3n + 2 = (n - 1)(n - 2). For this product to be prime, one factor must be 1 and the other a prime. Checking small n > 0, only n=3 yields prime number 2. So the set has exactly one element.
