theorem omnimath3659 : 
  IsGreatest {k : ℕ | ∃ (S : Finset ℕ), (S : Set ℕ) ⊆ Icc 1 1000 ∧ S.card = k ∧ 
    ∀ (x y : ℕ), x ∈ S → y ∈ S → x ≠ y → x + y ∉ S} omnimath3659_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing n=10
Sum-free subset of size 6 exists in [1..10]
Max sum-free subset size ≤ 10 is at least 6
Testing n=20
Sum-free subset of size 10 exists in [1..20]
Max sum-free subset size ≤ 20 is at least 10
Testing n=30
Sum-free subset of size 7 exists in [1..30]
Max sum-free subset size ≤ 30 is at least 7
Sum-free subset size with odds in [1..1000]: 500
Therefore, largest sum-free set size in [1..1000] is at least 500. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<500>>>
