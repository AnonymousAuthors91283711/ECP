. Enumerated answers: Computed f(n) for n=1..30:
[1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 4, 3, 3, 1, 5, 1, 3, 3, 4, 1, 5, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 6, 2, 2, 3, 4, 1, 5]. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<12>>> 
Explanation: The minimal m for which there exist coefficients b_j satisfying the linear recurrence f(n) = Σ b_j * f(n - (j+1)) coincides with the number 12, corresponding to the smallest window size to express f as a linear combination of previous f-values. This matches the enumerated values and recurrence dependence length.
