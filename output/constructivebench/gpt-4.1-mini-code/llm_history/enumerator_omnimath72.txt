This problem involves finding the greatest number \( k \) of teams (sets) with vertex-color assignments such that teams are subsets of a set of colors, teams are bounded in size by \( t \), and there is an injection selecting exactly one vertex color from each team with all colors distinct.

I'll enumerate small sample cases with different \( n \) (number of colors) and \( t \) (team size limit). For each, I'll consider all subsets of colors for teams, find all families of teams satisfying the conditions, and attempt to find the largest subset \( S \) with a distinct-color choice function \( f \). To maximize efficiency, I'll limit \( n \) and \( t \) to small numbers (up to 4) and print findings incrementally.

```python
from itertools import combinations, chain
from collections import defaultdict

def powerset(s):
    "Return all subsets of set s."
    return chain.from_iterable(combinations(s, r) for r in range(len(s)+1))

def has_distinct_choice(teams):
    # Check if there exists an assignment picking one color from each team with all choices distinct.
    # Use backtracking to find such injection f: team -> color.
    assigned = set()
    def backtrack(i):
        if i == len(teams):
            return True
        for c in teams[i]:
            if c not in assigned:
                assigned.add(c)
                if backtrack(i+1):
                    return True
                assigned.remove(c)
        return False
    return backtrack(0)

def enumerate_answers():
    max_n = 4  # colors count
    max_t = 4  # max team size
    for n in range(1, max_n+1):
        colors = tuple(range(n))
        for t in range(1, min(max_t, n)+1):
            all_teams = [set(c) for c in combinations(colors, t)]
            best_k = 0
            # Enumerate subsets of teams, check constraints and find max k with distinct choice function
            # We do this in ascending size, print candidates when found
            print(f"n={n}, t={t}")
            for k in range(1, len(all_teams)+1):
                candidates_found = False
                for teams_subset in combinations(all_teams, k):
                    # Check team size constraint (already all t-sized)
                    # Teams are subset of colors by design
                    if has_distinct_choice(teams_subset):
                        print(f"k={k}, teams={teams_subset}")
                        candidates_found = True
                if candidates_found:
                    best_k = k
            print(f"omnimath72_answer({n}, {t}) >= {best_k}\n")
