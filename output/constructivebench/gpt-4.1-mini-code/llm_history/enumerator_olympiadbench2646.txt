[write_program]
The problem involves two arithmetic sequences \(a_i\) and \(b_i\) with common differences \(d_a\) and \(d_b\) respectively. The sequences must have no overlapping terms, and the sums \(a_{20} + b_{14} = 1000\) and \(b_{20} + a_{14} = s\) define \(s\). We want to enumerate plausible values of \(s\), given these conditions.

The program below tries small parameters \(d_a, d_b\) and initial terms \(a_0, b_0\) to satisfy the sum and non-overlapping conditions. It prints each \(s\) found and the parameters that produce it, allowing conjecture on the minimal value of \(s\).

```python
# Enumerate possible s = b_20 + a_14 given:
# a_i = a0 + i*d_a, b_i = b0 + i*d_b
# a_20 + b_14 = 1000
# a_i, b_j distinct for all i,j
# Search small parameters to build intuition.

def main():
    results = set()
    # Search small differences and starting points
    for d_a in range(1, 51):
        for d_b in range(1, 51):
            # a_20 = a0 + 20*d_a
            # b_14 = b0 + 14*d_b
            # a_20 + b_14 = 1000 => b0 = 1000 - a0 - 20*d_a - 14*d_b
            for a0 in range(0, 1001):
                b0 = 1000 - a0 - 20*d_a - 14*d_b
                if b0 < 0:
                    continue
                # Check non-overlapping
                # We'll check first 30 terms of each sequence to look for overlaps
                a_terms = {a0 + i*d_a for i in range(30)}
                b_terms = {b0 + j*d_b for j in range(30)}
                if a_terms.isdisjoint(b_terms):
                    a20 = a0 + 20*d_a
                    b20 = b0 + 20*d_b
                    a14 = a0 + 14*d_a
                    s = b20 + a14
                    if s not in results:
                        results.add(s)
                        print(f"d_a={d_a} d_b={d_b} a0={a0} b0={b0} s={s}")
    if results:
        print(f"Minimum s found: {min(results)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
