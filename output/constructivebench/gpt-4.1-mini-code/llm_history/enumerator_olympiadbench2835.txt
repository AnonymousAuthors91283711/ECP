This problem involves counting pairs of positive integers (a, b) such that a * b equals a large integer N = (√26)^20 * 210^12, and gcd(a, b) = 1.

Note:
- (√26)^20 = 26^10 exactly (no approximation needed).
- So N = 26^10 * 210^12.
- Since gcd(a,b) = 1, a and b are coprime factors whose product is N.
- Counting such pairs amounts to factorizing N into primes, and enumerating ways to assign prime powers to a and b without sharing prime factors (to maintain gcd=1).
- Each prime factor's total exponent partitions entirely onto either a or b.
- So the number of coprime pairs is 2^(number_of_distinct_prime_factors(N)).

We will write code that:
- Computes prime factorization of N.
- Counts the distinct primes.
- Prints each factorization and candidate pairs generated by choosing which primes go to a or b.
- Enumerates coprime pairs from prime subsets and prints a and b immediately.
- At the end, prints the total count of such pairs.

We take the small sample T=√26 exactly as in the problem.
