The problem is to find the number of 5-tuples of positive integers \((a,b,c,d,e)\) satisfying
- \(a,b,c,d,e > 0\)
- \(a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d \cdot e \leq a + b + c + d + e\)
- \(a + b + c + d + e \leq 10\)

We need to enumerate all such 5-tuples, print them as found, then print the total count.

Because the sum is at most 10, the values are bounded. We can enumerate all 5-tuples with sum between 5 and 10, and check the product condition.

```python
# Enumerate all positive 5-tuples (a,b,c,d,e) with sum <= 10
# and product <= sum. Print each and count total.

def main():
    count = 0
    MAX_SUM = 10
    # Since each is at least 1, sum ranges from 5 to 10
    for s in range(5, MAX_SUM + 1):
        # Generate 5 positive integers summing to s:
        # Use integer compositions (stars and bars)
        # For 5 parts, we choose 4 dividers in s-1 positions

        # To reduce complexity, do nested loops over a,b,c,d and compute e = s - (a+b+c+d)
        for a in range(1, s - 3):
            for b in range(1, s - a - 2):
                for c in range(1, s - a - b -1):
                    for d in range(1, s - a - b - c):
                        e = s - a - b - c - d
                        if e <= 0:
                            continue
                        product = a*b*c*d*e
                        if product <= s:
                            print(f"(a,b,c,d,e)=({a},{b},{c},{d},{e}), sum={s}, product={product}")
                            count += 1
    print("Total count:", count)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
