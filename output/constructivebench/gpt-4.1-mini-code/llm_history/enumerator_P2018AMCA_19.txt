The problem involves summing the reciprocals of positive integers whose prime factors are only 2, 3, or 5. These numbers are known as 5-smooth or regular numbers. The sum converges since the reciprocals form a product of geometric series.

We want to enumerate such numbers, sum their reciprocals efficiently, and find the rational sum in reduced form.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Enumerate 5-smooth numbers up to a limit and sum their reciprocals.
# 5-smooth numbers have prime factors only in {2,3,5}.
# The sum over all positive 5-smooth numbers converges.
# We approximate partial sums for increasing exponents.

limit_exp = 15  # limit exponents to avoid huge sums
primes = [2, 3, 5]

results = set()

print("Enumerating sums of reciprocals over 5-smooth numbers with exponents up to", limit_exp)

# We use the formula for infinite series:
# sum_{a,b,câ‰¥0} 1/(2^a * 3^b * 5^c) = (1/(1 - 1/2)) * (1/(1 - 1/3)) * (1/(1 - 1/5)) = 2 * 3/2 * 5/4 = 15/4

# We'll output partial sums as fractions, for partial exponents up to limit_exp:

from math import prod

def geometric_sum_inv(p, max_exp):
    # sum_{k=0}^max_exp (1/p)^k = (1 - (1/p)^{max_exp+1}) / (1 - 1/p)
    power = pow(p, max_exp+1)
    numerator = power - 1
    denominator = power * (p - 1)
    return Fraction(numerator, denominator)

# Enumerate partial sums and print them:
for a in range(limit_exp+1):
    for b in range(limit_exp+1):
        # partial sum over c is geometric: sum_{c=0}^{limit_exp} (1/5)^c
        sum_c = geometric_sum_inv(5, limit_exp)
        # sum for fixed a,b: (1/2)^a * (1/3)^b * sum_c for c =0..limit_exp
        term = Fraction(1, 2**a) * Fraction(1, 3**b) * sum_c
        # accumulate partial sums over a,b incrementally
        # Instead, we enumerate total sum over all triples (a,b,c):
        results.add(term)

# But the above just creates isolated terms, not the sum of all triples.
# Instead, compute total partial sum over all triples up to limit_exp:

sum_total = Fraction(0,1)
for a in range(limit_exp+1):
    sa = Fraction(1,2**a)
    for b in range(limit_exp+1):
        sb = Fraction(1,3**b)
        for c in range(limit_exp+1):
            sc = Fraction(1,5**c)
            sum_total += sa*sb*sc

print("Partial sum of reciprocals up to exponents =", limit_exp, "is", sum_total)
# Print as numerator / denominator form:
print("As fraction: {}/{}".format(sum_total.numerator, sum_total.denominator))

# The known infinite sum is 15/4, printing for comparison:
print("Known infinite sum (exact): 15/4")
```
