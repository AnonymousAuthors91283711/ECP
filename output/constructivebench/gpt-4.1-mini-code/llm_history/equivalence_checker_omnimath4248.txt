Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: { (a, b, c) : ℝ × ℝ × ℝ | a = b ∧ b = c ∧ (a = 1 ∨ a = -1) } ∪
{ (a, b, c) : ℝ × ℝ × ℝ | (a = 1 ∨ a = -1) ∧ b ≠ 0 ∧ c = 1 / b }
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer captures two important cases:
1. The symmetric case where a = b = c = ±1
2. The case where one variable is ±1 and the other two are reciprocals

However, it's missing some other possible solutions where all three variables are distinct (though these might be more complex to characterize). The answer is mostly correct but may not be complete, hence "Close".
