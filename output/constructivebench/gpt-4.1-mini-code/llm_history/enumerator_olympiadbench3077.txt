The problem seems to ask for the integer floor of 100000 * (1.002)^10. Let's enumerate powers (1.002)^n for n=0 to 10, multiply by 100000, and print the floor values to observe the pattern and conjecture the answer.

```python
# Enumerate floor(100000 * (1.002)^n) for n=0..10
# (1.002)^10 is close to e^(10*0.002)=e^0.02 ~1.0202

def main():
    base = 1.002
    for n in range(11):
        val = 100000 * (base ** n)
        floored = int(val // 1)  # floor
        print(f"n={n}: floor(100000 * (1.002)^{n}) = {floored}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
