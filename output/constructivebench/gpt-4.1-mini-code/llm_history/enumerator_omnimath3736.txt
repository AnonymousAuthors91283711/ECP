The problem is to find triples of positive integers (p,q,r) where p and q are prime, and the value (r² - 5*q²) / (p² - 1) equals 2. We want to enumerate such triples, printing each as found.

We'll test p and q over small primes, and r over a reasonable range to check the divisibility condition exactly.

```python
# Enumerate triples (p,q,r) with p,q primes >0 and r>0, satisfying (r² - 5*q²)/(p² -1)=2 exactly.
# Search for small primes p,q and r in a reasonable range
from sympy import primerange, isprime

def main():
    primes = list(primerange(2, 50))  # small primes for testing
    for p in primes:
        denom = p*p - 1
        if denom == 0:
            continue
        for q in primes:
            for r in range(1, 100):
                numerator = r*r - 5*q*q
                if numerator % denom == 0:
                    val = numerator // denom
                    if val == 2:
                        # Print immediately when found
                        print(f"(p,q,r) = ({p}, {q}, {r}) satisfies: (r² - 5*{q}²)/(p² -1) = 2")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
