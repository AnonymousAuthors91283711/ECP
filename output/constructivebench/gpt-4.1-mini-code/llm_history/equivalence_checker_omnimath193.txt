Ground Truth Answer: { (m, n) : ℕ × ℕ | m.Coprime n ∧ Odd m ∧ Odd n ∧ ∃ k, m + n = 2^k }
Proposed Answer: {(m, n) | Odd m ∧ Odd n ∧ Nat.gcd m n = 1 ∧ ∃ k, m + n = 2^k}
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. Both specify pairs of natural numbers (m, n) where:
1. m and n are coprime (Nat.gcd m n = 1 is equivalent to m.Coprime n)
2. Both m and n are odd (Odd m ∧ Odd n)
3. There exists a k such that m + n = 2^k

The only difference is the order of conditions and the use of gcd vs Coprime, but these are mathematically equivalent formulations.
