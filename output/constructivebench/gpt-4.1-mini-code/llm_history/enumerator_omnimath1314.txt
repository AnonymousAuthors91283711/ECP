The problem asks to find the sum of the infinite series ∑_{n=0}^∞ 1 / ((n+3)^2 + (n+1)). To assist in conjecturing the exact value, we'll enumerate partial sums for n=0 to some small upper bound and print these rational sums as fractions. We'll simplify fractions exactly, avoiding approximations, and print partial sums to observe behavior and possible closed-form.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def denominator(n):
    return (n + 3)**2 + (n + 1)  # Exact integer denominator

def partial_sums(max_n):
    total = Fraction(0, 1)
    for n in range(max_n + 1):
        term = Fraction(1, denominator(n))
        total += term
        print(f"n={n}, term=1/{denominator(n)}={term}, partial_sum={total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Enumerating partial sums of sum_{n=0}^∞ 1/((n+3)^2 + (n+1)):")
    partial_sums(20)  # Compute first 21 terms exactly as fractions
```
