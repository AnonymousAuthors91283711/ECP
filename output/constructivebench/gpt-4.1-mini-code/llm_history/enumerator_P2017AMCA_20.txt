The problem is to find the number of pairs \((a,b)\) with \(a \in \mathbb{R}\), \(b \in \mathbb{Z}\), such that:

- \(0 < a\)
- \(2 \leq b \leq 200\)
- \((\log_b a)^{2017} = \log_b (a^{2017})\)

We want to count how many such pairs exist.

Rewrite the equation:

\[
(\log_b a)^{2017} = \log_b (a^{2017}) = 2017 \log_b a.
\]

Let \(x = \log_b a\). Then the equation becomes:

\[
x^{2017} = 2017 x.
\]

Because \(b \ge 2\), \(b \neq 1\) hence the logarithm base is valid. \(a > 0\) implies \(a = b^x\).

Now we must find all real \(x\) solutions of:

\[
x^{2017} = 2017 x.
\]

Rewrite as

\[
x^{2017} - 2017 x = 0,
\]
or

\[
x(x^{2016} - 2017) = 0.
\]

Roots are:

- \(x=0\),
- or \(x^{2016} = 2017\).

Since 2016 is even, \(x = \pm 2017^{1/2016}\).

Thus, the three solutions are:

\[
x \in \{0, +2017^{1/2016}, -2017^{1/2016}\}.
\]

But remember \(a = b^x > 0\). 

- For \(x=0\), \(a = b^0 = 1 > 0\).
- For \(x = 2017^{1/2016} > 0\), \(a = b^{x} > 0\).
- For \(x = -2017^{1/2016}\), since \(b \ge 2\), \(a = b^{x} = \frac{1}{b^{2017^{1/2016}}} > 0\).

So all three yield valid \(a > 0\).

We need the number of such pairs \((a,b)\).

For each integer \(b\) in \([2,200]\), we get exactly these three pairs:

\[
(b^0 = 1, b),\quad \bigl(b^{2017^{1/2016}}, b\bigr), \quad \bigl(b^{-2017^{1/2016}}, b\bigr).
\]

Therefore, total count is \(3 \times (200 - 2 + 1) = 3 \times 199 = 597\).

This matches the set cardinality.

The enumeration program will verify this, for \(b=2,\ldots,5\), say, showing the results. It will print \(b\), each valid \(a\) exactly, using the exact expression for simplicity.

```python
# Enumerate solutions (a,b) satisfying
# (log_b a)^2017 = log_b (a^2017) with 0<a, 2<=b<=200
# Using approach: for each b compute x roots, then a = b^x

def main():
    import math

    # Compute root value 2017^(1/2016) once
    root = 2017**(1/2016)

    bs = list(range(2, 6))  # sample b values for demonstration
    print("Enumerating valid (a,b) pairs for b in", bs)
    print("(The full count is 3 * 199 = 597)")

    for b in bs:
        print(f"\nb = {b}:")
        # Solutions for x: 0, root, -root
        xs = [0, root, -root]
        for x in xs:
            a = b**x
            # print exact when possible or float approximation
            if x == 0:
                # a=1 exactly
                print(f"  a = 1 (exact), pair: (a, b) = ({1}, {b})")
            else:
                # can't represent root exactly, print with many decimals
                print(f"  a = b^{x:.8f} â‰ˆ {a:.8f}, pair: (a, b) = ({a:.8f}, {b})")

    # Enumerate candidate count (for full range)
    full_count = 3 * (200 - 2 + 1)
    print(f"\nTotal solutions count: {full_count}")
