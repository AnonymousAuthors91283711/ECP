The problem considers permutations of 25 elements (people), focusing on permutations where Charlie's image value is adjacent to either Chris's or Abby's image value. We want to find the probability of such permutations, i.e., the size of S (permutations where Charlie's image is adjacent to Chris's or Abby's image) divided by 25!.

We will enumerate permutations of a small T, say T=5, and count how many permutations satisfy the condition, then output the fraction. This approach can suggest the true formula or value for the original problem.

```python
from math import factorial
from itertools import permutations

T = 5
people = list(range(T))
charlie, chris, abby = 0, 1, 2

count = 0
total = factorial(T)

for perm in permutations(people):
    c_pos = perm.index(charlie)
    ch_pos = perm.index(chris)
    ab_pos = perm.index(abby)
    # Check if Charlie's image value is adjacent (Â±1) to Chris's or Abby's image value
    c_val = perm[c_pos]
    ch_val = perm[ch_pos]
    ab_val = perm[ab_pos]
    # Actually, perm is an ordering, not a function on elements, so perm[i] is the image of i
    # So perm[charlie] is Charlie's image value, etc.
    c_img = perm[charlie]
    ch_img = perm[chris]
    ab_img = perm[abby]
    if abs(c_img - ch_img) == 1 or abs(c_img - ab_img) == 1:
        count += 1
        print(f"Found permutation with adjacency condition: {perm}")

print(f"T={T}, count={count}, total={total}, fraction={count}/{total}={count/total:.6f}")
```
This enumerates permutations for T=5, counts and prints those that satisfy the condition. Feel free to change T but beware of factorial growth. The output fraction suggests the probability for the original problem.
