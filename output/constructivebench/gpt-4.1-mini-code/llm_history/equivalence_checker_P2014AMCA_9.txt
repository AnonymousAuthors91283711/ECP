Ground Truth Answer: fun a b => a + 4
Proposed Answer: fun a b => b + 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem states that b is defined as the average of 5 consecutive numbers starting from a:
   b = (a + (a+1) + (a+2) + (a+3) + (a+4))/5 = (5a + 10)/5 = a + 2

2. Then we need to find the average of 5 consecutive numbers starting from b:
   (b + (b+1) + (b+2) + (b+3) + (b+4))/5 = (5b + 10)/5 = b + 2

3. But since we know b = a + 2, then b + 2 = a + 4

4. The ground truth answer is a + 4, while the proposed answer is b + 2

5. Since b + 2 = a + 4, these are exactly equivalent expressions.
