Ground Truth Answer: 1441 / 2016
Proposed Answer: ((2015 : ℚ) * (1 - (1 / 5)) * (1 - (1 / 13)) * (1 - (1 / 31))) / 2016
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the probability that a randomly selected number from 1 to 2016 is coprime with 2015.

2. The ground truth answer is 1441/2016.

3. The proposed answer uses Euler's totient function formula:
   φ(2015)/2016 = 2015*(1-1/5)*(1-1/13)*(1-1/31)/2016

4. First, factorize 2015 = 5 × 13 × 31.

5. Calculate φ(2015) = 2015 × (1-1/5) × (1-1/13) × (1-1/31) = 2015 × (4/5) × (12/13) × (30/31)

6. Compute the numerator:
   2015 × (4/5) = 1612
   1612 × (12/13) = 1488
   1488 × (30/31) = 1440

7. So φ(2015) = 1440, but the ground truth is 1441.

8. The discrepancy comes from the fact that the problem uses range 1-2016 while φ(2015) covers 1-2015. We need to account for 2016 separately.

9. gcd(2016,2015) = 1, so 2016 should be included in the count, making it 1440 + 1 = 1441.

<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is almost correct but misses the inclusion of 2016 in the count. The correct numerator should be φ(2015)+1 = 1441 rather than just φ(2015) = 1440.
