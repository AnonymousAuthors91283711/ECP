The expression is \((10^{9^2 - 9})^{1/9}^{1/2}^{1/2}\). This simplifies as:
- \(9^2 = 81\), so exponent is \(81 - 9 = 72\)
- The nested exponents mean:

\[
(10^{72})^{1/9} = 10^{72/9} = 10^8
\]
\[
(10^8)^{1/2} = 10^{8/2} = 10^4
\]
\[
(10^4)^{1/2} = 10^{4/2} = 10^2 = 100
\]

So the answer should be 100. Let's enumerate by simulating for smaller bases and exponents to spot the pattern, printing intermediate results to verify the computation steps.

```python
# Enumerate values for simplified exponents to verify the pattern.
# Let's define a function to compute the nested powers and print steps.
def nested_power(base, exps):
    val = base
    for e in exps:
        val = val ** e
        print(f"After raising to the power {e}, value = {val}")
    print(f"Final result for base={base} with exps={exps}: {val}\n")

# Testing with the problem's values:
base = 10
exps = [1/(9), 1/2, 1/2]  # corresponding to the chain of exponents in the problem
power_val = 9**2 - 9  # 81 - 9 = 72

print(f"Base power: {base}^{power_val} = {base**power_val}")

# Instead of computing 10^72 directly (large), do power sequence stepwise:
val = base ** power_val
print(f"Start: {val}")
# Apply nested powers:
for e in exps:
    val = val ** e
    print(f"Value after raising to power {e} = {val}")

print(f"Computed final answer: {val}")

# For smaller sample values, try similar exponent structures
print("\nTesting smaller samples:")

samples = [ (2, 4**2 - 4), (3, 5**2 - 5), (5, 6**2 - 6) ]
for b, p in samples:
    print(f"Base={b}, Power={p}")
    val = b ** p
    print(f"Start: {val}")
    for e in exps:
        val = val ** e
        print(f"Value after raising to power {e} = {val}")
    print(f"Final: {val}\n")
```
