The problem involves characterizing all real numbers \(a, b\) such that \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = a + b\).

A natural conjecture is that the equality holds if and only if \(a, b \geq 0\) and at least one of them is zero, because by the triangle inequality, \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \leq |a| + |b|\), and the right side is \(a+b\) (not their absolute values). So the condition is quite restrictive.

The program below enumerates rational approximations (to avoid floating point issues) to find pairs \((a,b)\) in some range where \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = a + b\) holds exactly or very close (within a small epsilon). It prints such pairs to help conjecture the equality characterization.

```python
import math

epsilon = 1e-12

def is_equal(a, b):
    left = math.sqrt(a*a + b*b)
    right = a + b
    return abs(left - right) < epsilon

def rational_candidates():
    # Generate candidates a,b in [-5,5], step 0.5 for speed
    vals = [i*0.5 for i in range(-10, 11)]
    for a in vals:
        for b in vals:
            if is_equal(a, b):
                yield a, b

print("Enumerating (a,b) with sqrt(a^2 + b^2) = a + b approximately:")
for a, b in rational_candidates():
    print(f"a={a:.1f}, b={b:.1f}, sqrt={math.sqrt(a*a + b*b):.12f}, sum={a + b:.12f}")
```

This helps spot when the equality can hold; inspecting output can guide the formal characterization.
