The problem involves a polynomial defined as the product over i from 0 to 14 of \(1 + a_i X\), where \(a_i = -(i+1)\) if \(i\) is odd, and \(a_i = i+1\) if \(i\) is even. We want to find the absolute value of the coefficient of \(X^2\) in that polynomial.

The coefficient of \(X^2\) in a product of linear terms \( \prod (1 + a_i X) \) is the sum over all pairs \(i < j\) of \(a_i a_j\).

We'll enumerate the pairs, compute their products, and sum them. We'll print intermediate partial sums as we go to adhere to streaming output requirements.

```python
# Compute the absolute value of the coefficient of X^2 in P = product_{i=0}^{14} (1 + a_i X)
# where a_i = -(i+1) if i odd, else (i+1).

def main():
    a = []
    for i in range(15):
        val = -(i+1) if i % 2 == 1 else (i+1)
        a.append(val)
    total = 0
    n = len(a)
    print("a coefficients:", a)
    print("Enumerating pairwise products for coefficient of X^2:")
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            prod = a[i] * a[j]
            total += prod
            print(f"Pair ({i},{j}): a[{i}]*a[{j}] = {a[i]}*{a[j]} = {prod}, partial sum = {total}")
    print("Absolute value of coefficient of X^2 is", abs(total))

    main()
