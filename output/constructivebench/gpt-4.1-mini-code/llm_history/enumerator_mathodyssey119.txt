The problem is to find the minimal positive integer \( a \) such that there exist non-negative integers \( b, c \) with:
\[ a + 4b + 9c = 23^2 = 529, \quad a > 0, \quad b, c \geq 0. \]

We want to enumerate values \( a \), \( b \), \( c \) satisfying this equation, print each valid \( a \) found, and then output the minimum. We'll limit \( b, c \) to reasonable ranges to avoid excessive computation.

```python
# Enumerate triples (a,b,c) with a + 4b + 9c = 529, a>0, b,c>=0
# Print all found a's and finally print the minimal a

def main():
    N = 529
    min_a = None
    print(f"Searching solutions for a + 4b + 9c = {N} with a>0, b,c>=0")
    for c in range(N//9 + 1):
        rem_c = N - 9*c
        if rem_c < 0:
            break
        for b in range(rem_c//4 + 1):
            a = rem_c - 4*b
            if a > 0:
                print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}")
                if min_a is None or a < min_a:
                    min_a = a
    if min_a is not None:
        print(f"Minimal a found: {min_a}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
