The problem involves counting subsets of {1,...,18} whose sums are divisible by 3, then finding gcd of this count with total 2^18 subsets. Let's enumerate:

- Universe: U = {1,...,18}
- total subsets = 2^18 = 262144
- For each subset, sum mod 3 == 0 counts as "good"
- Print all counts found, gcd, and final reduced fraction for conjecture

Since 2^18 is manageable, we can brute force with modulo summation.

```python
# Enumerate subsets of {1,...,18} and count those with sum % 3 == 0,
# then compute gcd with total subsets 2^18.
from math import gcd

U = list(range(1, 19))  # elements 1 to 18
total = 2 ** len(U)

count_mod = [0, 0, 0]  # counts of subsets with sum mod 3 == 0, 1, 2
count_mod[0] = 1  # empty subset sum=0 mod 3

for x in U:
    new_count = [0, 0, 0]
    for r in range(3):
        new_count[r] += count_mod[r]  # subsets without x
        new_count[(r + x) % 3] += count_mod[r]  # subsets with x
    count_mod = new_count
    # Streaming print partial counts after each element
    print(f"After adding {x}: count_mod={count_mod}")

good = count_mod[0]
print(f"Total subsets: {total}")
print(f"Good subsets (sum mod 3 = 0): {good}")
print(f"gcd({good}, {total}) = {gcd(good, total)}")
print(f"Reduced fraction: {good // gcd(good, total)} / {total // gcd(good, total)}")
```
