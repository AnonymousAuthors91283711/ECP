The problem is about finding the infimum of the ranks of \( n \times n \) real matrices with zero diagonal and strictly positive off-diagonal entries. To analyze this, I'll enumerate ranks of such matrices for small sizes \( n \), by constructing example matrices and checking their ranks.

```python
import numpy as np

def rank_with_properties(n):
    # Construct matrices with zero diagonal and positive off-diagonals
    # Try simple matrices where all off-diagonal entries are 1 or general positive values
    # Enumerate ranks of these matrices and print the ranks found
    
    # One candidate: matrix with 0 diagonal and 1 off-diagonal entries
    m = np.ones((n, n)) - np.eye(n)
    r = np.linalg.matrix_rank(m)
    print(f"n={n}; rank={r}; matrix=all_ones_off_diag")
    
    # Try a matrix with varying off-diagonal values to check if rank can be reduced
    # We can try sparse positive entries in off-diagonal (while all > 0)
    # For minimal ranks, variations of rank 1 or 2 matrices
    
    # Construct matrix with all off-diagonals = a positive scalar alpha
    for alpha in [0.1, 1, 2]:
        m = np.full((n, n), alpha)
        np.fill_diagonal(m, 0)
        r = np.linalg.matrix_rank(m)
        print(f"n={n}; rank={r}; matrix=constant_off_diag alpha={alpha}")
    
    # Create a rank 1 matrix with zero diagonal by subtracting the diagonal part
    # Start from outer product u v^T with u = ones, v = ones, then set diagonal zero
    u = np.ones(n)
    v = np.ones(n)
    m = np.outer(u, v)
    np.fill_diagonal(m, 0)
    r = np.linalg.matrix_rank(m)
    print(f"n={n}; rank={r}; matrix=outer_ones_zero_diag")
    
    # Try rank 2 matrix constructed similarly
    # u = [1,2,...], v = [1/n, 1/n^2, ...]
    v = np.array([1/(i+1) for i in range(n)])
    m = np.outer(u, v)
    np.fill_diagonal(m, 0)
    r = np.linalg.matrix_rank(m)
    print(f"n={n}; rank={r}; matrix=rank2_like_zero_diag")
    
    return

def main():
    for n in range(2, 6):
        print(f"Testing n={n}")
        rank_with_properties(n)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This program tests several candidate matrices for \( n=2 \) to \( 5 \) and prints their ranks immediately. It analyzes if very low ranks (1 or 2) can be achieved under the constraints. This helps conjecture the minimal achievable rank for such matrices.
