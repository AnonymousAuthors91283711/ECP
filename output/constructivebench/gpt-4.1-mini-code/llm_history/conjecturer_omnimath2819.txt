noncomputable abbrev omnimath2819_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2819 (a b x : ℝ) (h : a + b = 12) :
  a * (x + 2) + b * (x + 2) = 60 ↔ x = omnimath2819_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating x values from a,b such that a+b=12 and a*(x+2)+b*(x+2)=60:
a=0.0, b=12.0 => x=3
Distinct x values found:
x = 3
Therefore, the solution x = 3. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<3>>>
