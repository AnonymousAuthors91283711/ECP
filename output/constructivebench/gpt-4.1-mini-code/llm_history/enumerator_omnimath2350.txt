The problem counts transitions between bits in all 12-bit binary numbers (0 to 4095) and asks for the average number of bit transitions in all binary representations of these numbers.

We'll enumerate all numbers from 0 to 4095, convert each to a 12-bit binary list, count the transitions (changes between consecutive bits), print each count, and then print the average transition count. This will allow conjecturing the exact result.

```python
def count_transitions(bits):
    return sum(bits[i] != bits[i+1] for i in range(len(bits)-1))

N = 12
MAX = 2**N

total_transitions = 0
for n in range(MAX):
    # binary digits as list of ints padded to length N
    bits = [(n >> i) & 1 for i in reversed(range(N))]
    c = count_transitions(bits)
    print(f"Number: {n}, transitions: {c}")
    total_transitions += c

average = total_transitions / MAX
print(f"Average transitions over {MAX} numbers: {average}")
```
