Ground Truth Answer: 6
Proposed Answer: 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n where:
   - n > 0
   - (n + 1)/(2n + 1) < 1/100

2. Ground truth answer is 6, which is correct because:
   - For n=5: (5+1)/(10+1) = 6/11 ≈ 0.545 > 0.01
   - For n=6: (6+1)/(12+1) = 7/13 ≈ 0.538 > 0.01 (Wait, this seems incorrect)
   - Actually, let's check higher values:
   - For n=49: (49+1)/(98+1) = 50/99 ≈ 0.505 > 0.01
   - For n=50: (50+1)/(100+1) = 51/101 ≈ 0.50495 > 0.01
   - For n=99: (99+1)/(198+1) = 100/199 ≈ 0.5025 > 0.01
   - For n=100: (100+1)/(200+1) = 101/201 ≈ 0.50248 > 0.01
   - It seems the inequality is never satisfied for any natural number n

3. The proposed answer is 1:
   - For n=1: (1+1)/(2+1) = 2/3 ≈ 0.666 > 0.01
   - This doesn't satisfy the inequality either

4. Both answers seem incorrect as the inequality (n+1)/(2n+1) < 1/100 is never satisfied for any natural number n. The expression approaches 0.5 from above as n increases, but never goes below 0.5.

However, the ground truth answer of 6 is incorrect as shown above, and the proposed answer of 1 is also incorrect. But since the problem asks for the least n satisfying the condition, and no such n exists, both answers are wrong in the same way.
