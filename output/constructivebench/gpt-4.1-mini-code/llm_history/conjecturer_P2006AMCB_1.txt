The sum is ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} (-1)^(k+1). When k=0, term = (-1)^1 = -1; when k=1, term = (-1)^2 = +1; the terms alternate between -1 and +1 starting with -1.

For even n, there are equal counts of -1 and +1 terms, summing to 0.
For odd n, there is one extra -1 term, so sum is -1.

The error "unknown identifier 'even'" arises because Lean does not have a built-in "even" predicate in the current scope. Instead, we use the built-in function `n % 2 = 0` to check evenness.

Therefore, the correct closed form in Lean is:

<<<fun n : ℕ => if n % 2 = 0 then 0 else -1>>>
