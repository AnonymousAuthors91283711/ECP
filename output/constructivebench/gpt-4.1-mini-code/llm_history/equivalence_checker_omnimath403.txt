Ground Truth Answer: {(0, 0)}
Proposed Answer: {(x * 10 * 11, x * 11 * 21) | x : ℤ} ∪ {(x * 10 * 11, -x * 11 * 21) | x : ℤ}
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem asks to find all integer pairs (m,n) that satisfy 231*m² = 130*n². 

First, simplify the equation:
231*m² = 130*n²
=> 231/130 = n²/m²
=> (3*7*11)/(2*5*13) = (n/m)²

The left side is not a perfect square (since the prime factors have odd exponents), so the only way this equation holds is if both m and n are zero. 

The ground truth answer correctly identifies this with {(0,0)}.

The proposed answer suggests solutions of the form:
1. (x*10*11, x*11*21)
2. (x*10*11, -x*11*21)

Let's test x=1 in the first case:
m = 110, n = 231
231*(110)² = 231*12100 = 2,795,100
130*(231)² = 130*53361 = 6,936,930
These are not equal, so the proposed solution is incorrect.

The only solution is indeed (0,0), as the ground truth states.
