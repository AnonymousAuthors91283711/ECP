noncomputable abbrev omnimath1099_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath1099 : 
  let p := (3/4) * (1/4)  -- Probability of catching train in one minute
  let q := 1 - p          -- Probability of not catching train in one minute
  q^5 = (13/16)^5 ∧       -- Probability of not catching train in 5 minutes
  1 - q^5 = omnimath1099_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: p (catch probability per minute) = 3/16
q (no catch probability per minute) = 13/16

Minutes = 1:
Probability no catch = 13/16 ≈ 0.812500
Probability catch at least once = 3/16 ≈ 0.187500

Minutes = 2:
Probability no catch = 169/256 ≈ 0.660156
Probability catch at least once = 87/256 ≈ 0.339844

Minutes = 3:
Probability no catch = 2197/4096 ≈ 0.536377
Probability catch at least once = 1899/4096 ≈ 0.463623

Minutes = 4:
Probability no catch = 28561/65536 ≈ 0.435806
Probability catch at least once = 36975/65536 ≈ 0.564194

Minutes = 5:
Probability no catch = 371293/1048576 ≈ 0.354093
Probability catch at least once = 677283/1048576 ≈ 0.645907
