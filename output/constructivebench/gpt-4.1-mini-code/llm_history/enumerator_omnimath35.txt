The problem is about representing every positive non-square natural number n as omnimath35_answer(x, y, z) for some positive integers x, y, z. The actual function omnimath35_answer is not given, but typically these problems revolve around expressing numbers in terms of parameters with certain algebraic forms.

We'll assume omnimath35_answer is some integer-valued function of three positive integers x, y, z. To assist in conjecturing, we can:
- Test small values of n, checking if they can be represented as omnimath35_answer(x,y,z) for small positive x,y,z.
- Since omnimath35_answer is unknown, we can suppose some candidate forms (like x*y + z, x^2+y^2+z^2, etc.) or leave it abstract for now and just check small triples, printing (x,y,z,n).

But since the problem is lean on details, a generic enumeration: for n=1..some limit, for x,y,z=1..some limit, print n and the tuple (x,y,z) if omnimath35_answer(x,y,z) = n.

Because we must produce a runnable Python program, we need to implement a sample omnimath35_answer and test above description.

Given that the problem is abstract, I will define omnimath35_answer as x^2 + y^2 + z^2 for demonstration (a classic sum of three squares representation).

We will:
- For n from 1 to 50
- For x,y,z from 1 to 10
- check if x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = n
- print the triple when found, prioritize exact matches
- mark if n is a perfect square to relate to the problem statement.

This will enumerate representations of numbers as sums of three squares, illustrating how such enumerations could help understand representation properties.

```python
# Enumerate representations of n as sum of squares of three positive integers (x,y,z)
# to explore the "omnimath35_answer" = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 assumption.
# For each 1 <= n <= 50, print all ways to represent n with x,y,z in 1..10
# Also indicate if n is a perfect square.
import math

MAX_N = 50
MAX_XYZ = 10

def is_square(n):
    r = int(math.isqrt(n))
    return r*r == n

print("n perfect_square representations (x,y,z):")
for n in range(1, MAX_N+1):
    square = is_square(n)
    found = False
    for x in range(1, MAX_XYZ+1):
        x2 = x*x
        if x2 > n:
            break
        for y in range(1, MAX_XYZ+1):
            y2 = y*y
            if x2 + y2 > n:
                break
            for z in range(1, MAX_XYZ+1):
                z2 = z*z
                s = x2 + y2 + z2
                if s == n:
                    found = True
                    print(f"{n} {'Yes' if square else 'No '} ({x},{y},{z})")
                elif s > n:
                    break
    if not found:
        print(f"{n} {'Yes' if square else 'No '} no representation")
```
