[write_program]
This problem concerns finding the largest size \( n \) of a finite set \( s \subset \mathbb{R}^2 \) such that every subset of \( s \) of size 3 contains two points exactly one unit apart. To assist in conjecturing the answer, I will write a Python program to enumerate finite sets \( s \) with small size and check the property. Since the problem involves real coordinates and distances, we will limit ourselves to simple lattice points with small integer coordinates to manage complexity.

The program will:
- Iterate over all subsets \( s \) of points within a small grid \(\{0,1,\dots,k\}^2\) for small \(k\).
- For each subset \( s \), check if every triple contains at least one pair at distance exactly 1.
- Print candidate sets and their sizes.
- Report the maximum size found that satisfies the property.

This enumeration approach may help conjecture the maximum \( n \) or at least provide lower bounds.

```python
import itertools
import math

def dist(p, q):
    return math.dist(p, q)

def has_unit_pair(triple):
    # Check if triple (3 points) contains two points with dist=1 (allow exact floating match)
    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(i+1, 3):
            if abs(dist(triple[i], triple[j]) - 1) < 1e-9:
                return True
    return False

def check_set(s):
    # For every triple in s, check if it contains a pair at distance 1
    for triple in itertools.combinations(s, 3):
        if not has_unit_pair(triple):
            return False
    return True

def main():
    # We limit to points (x,y) with 0 <= x,y <= 3 for runtime
    points = [(x,y) for x in range(4) for y in range(4)]
    max_card = 0
    max_sets = []
    for r in range(3, len(points)+1):
        # To keep runtime short, limit search at r up to 10
        if r > 10:
            break
        for s in itertools.combinations(points, r):
            if check_set(s):
                print(f"Found size {r} set: {s}")
                if r > max_card:
                    max_card = r
                    max_sets = [s]
                elif r == max_card:
                    max_sets.append(s)
    print(f"Maximum size found: {max_card}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
