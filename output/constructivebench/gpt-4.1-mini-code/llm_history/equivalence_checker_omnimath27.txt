Ground Truth Answer: {(2, 6)} ∪ {(2^k - 1, 2) | k : ℕ} ∪ {(1, n) | n : ℕ}
Proposed Answer: {(a, n) | n = 1 ∨ (∀ p : ℕ, p.Prime → p ∣ (a^n - 1) → ∃ m < n, m > 0 ∧ p ∣ (a^m - 1))}
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

The ground truth answer consists of three cases:
1. The pair (2,6)
2. All pairs where a = 2^k-1 (Mersenne numbers) and n=2
3. All pairs where a=1 and n is any natural number

The proposed answer defines the set as all pairs where either:
1. n=1, or
2. For all prime divisors p of a^n-1, there exists m with 0<m<n such that p divides a^m-1

Comparing these:
- The (2,6) case in ground truth is not covered by the proposed answer's general condition
- The Mersenne case (2^k-1,2) is covered by the proposed answer's second condition
- The (1,n) case is covered by n=1 or by the second condition (since 1^n-1=0 and all primes divide 0)
- The proposed answer includes more cases than the ground truth (like (3,3), which satisfy the condition but aren't in ground truth
