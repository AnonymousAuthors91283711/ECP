[write_program]
The problem gives two natural numbers \( r \) and \( b \) with conditions:

1. \( r = b + 6 \)
2. \( \frac{r}{b} = \frac{5}{3} \)

We want to find \( r + b \).

The program enumerates small values of \( b \) and checks whether the conditions hold exactly (using rational arithmetic). When found, it prints \( r, b \), and their sum.

```python
# Enumerate natural numbers b to find r = b+6 with r/b = 5/3 exactly
from fractions import Fraction

def main():
    target_ratio = Fraction(5,3)
    max_b = 20  # small search space since values should be small
    
    for b in range(1, max_b+1):
        r = b + 6
        if Fraction(r, b) == target_ratio:
            print(f"Found: r={r}, b={b}, r+b={r+b}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
