# The problem defines a function \( f:\mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{R} \) satisfying a functional equation on \( \mathbb{Q} \setminus \{0,1\} \):
# \[
# f(x) + f\big(1 - \tfrac{1}{x}\big) = \log|x|.
# \]
# 
# We want to understand and possibly conjecture \( f \) by enumerating values for rationals \( x \neq 0,1 \).
# 
# We test small rationals (positive and negative, excluding 0 and 1) to see if a pattern emerges by solving the equation and checking consistency.
# 
# Since the relation connects \( f(x) \) and \( f(1 - 1/x) \), we'll treat \( f(x) \) as unknown and try to find \( f \) values for orbits under the transformation \( x \mapsto 1 - \frac{1}{x} \).
# 
# The code below:
# - Enumerates rationals \( x = p/q \) with small \( |p|, q \).
# - Avoids \( x=0,1 \).
# - For each \( x \), computes \( y = 1 - \frac{1}{x} \), only considers \( y \) with small numerator and denominator.
# - Records equations \( f(x)+f(y) = \log|x| \).
# - Attempts to solve the system for a few orbits.
# 
# We print each tested rational and the corresponding equation and tentative solution (if directly solvable).
# This may reveal patterns or closed forms.
# 
# Note: actual symbolic solving of infinite orbits is complex, so this enumeration aims to guess formula behavior.
