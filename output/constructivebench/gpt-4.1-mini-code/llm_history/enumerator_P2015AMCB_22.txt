The problem is to count functions \( f: \{0,1,2,3,4,5\} \to \{0,1,2,3,4,5\} \) such that for each \( i \in \{0,\ldots,5\} \), \( f(i) \neq i \), \( f(i) \neq (i+1) \mod 6 \), and \( f(i) \neq (i-1) \mod 6 \). We want to enumerate the number of such functions.

This is a six-element domain and codomain, and for each \( i \), three values are forbidden: \( i \), \( (i+1) \mod 6 \), and \( (i-1) \mod 6 \). So for each position, the function can take one of the other three remaining values.

We will brute force enumerate all such functions \(f: \{0,\ldots,5\} \to \{0,\ldots,5\}\) respecting the constraints and count how many satisfy the constraints. As we find them, we print them.

```python
# Enumerate all functions f:{0..5}-> {0..5} with f(i)!=i, f(i)!=(i+1)%6, f(i)!=(i-1)%6.
# Print each valid function as a tuple.

def forbidden_values(i):
    return {i, (i+1)%6, (i-1)%6}

def main():
    # For each i, determine the allowed values (3 values).
    allowed = [list(set(range(6)) - forbidden_values(i)) for i in range(6)]
    
    # Use a backtracking approach to enumerate all valid functions.
    answers = 0
    f = [None]*6
    
    def backtrack(pos):
        nonlocal answers
        if pos == 6:
            answers += 1
            print(tuple(f))
            return
        for val in allowed[pos]:
            f[pos] = val
            backtrack(pos+1)
            f[pos] = None
    
    backtrack(0)
    print("Total count:", answers)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
