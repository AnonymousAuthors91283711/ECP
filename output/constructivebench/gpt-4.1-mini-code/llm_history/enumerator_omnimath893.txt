The problem involves summing binomial coefficients: \(\sum_{i=0}^{10} \binom{10}{i}\). We know the formula \(\sum_{i=0}^n \binom{n}{i} = 2^n\), so the sum is \(2^{10} = 1024\). To assist in conjecturing this, we'll enumerate the values of \(\binom{10}{i}\) and their sum.

```python
from math import comb

n = 10
print(f"Enumerating C({n}, i) for i=0 to {n}:")
total = 0
for i in range(n + 1):
    c = comb(n, i)
    print(f"C({n}, {i}) = {c}")
    total += c

print(f"Sum of C({n}, i) for i=0 to {n}: {total}")
```
