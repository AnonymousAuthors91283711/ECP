Ground Truth Answer: 30
Proposed Answer: 15
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the least non-negative real number t that satisfies the equation:
   5*(t/60) - 3*(t/60) = 1

2. Simplifying the equation:
   (5-3)*(t/60) = 1
   2*(t/60) = 1
   t/30 = 1
   t = 30

3. The ground truth answer is indeed 30, which matches our calculation.

4. The proposed answer is 15, which would give us:
   2*(15/60) = 2*(1/4) = 0.5 ≠ 1

The proposed answer of 15 does not satisfy the equation, while the correct answer is 30. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
