The problem is to find the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that there exist real numbers \( a \) and \( r \neq 0 \) defining a geometric sequence \( t(k) = a r^{k-1} \) satisfying:
- \( t(1) \cdot t(n) = 3 \),
- \( \prod_{k=1}^n t(k) = 59049 = 3^{10} \).

We will test values of \( n \) starting from 1 upwards, attempt to solve for \( a \) and \( r \), and print values whenever a consistent solution exists.

```python
from math import isclose

# Target product and first*last product
PRODUCT = 59049  # 3^10
FIRST_LAST = 3

# We'll test n from 1 up to 20
for n in range(1, 21):
    # Conditions:
    # t(1)*t(n) = a * a r^{n-1} = a^2 r^{n-1} = 3
    # product = a^n * r^{(0+1+...+(n-1))} = a^n r^{n(n-1)/2} = 59049
    
    # Let r^m = R
    # From first relation: a^2 * r^{n-1} =3 => a^2 = 3 / r^{n-1}
    # Then from product: a^n * r^{n(n-1)/2} = 59049
    
    # Substitute a^n = (a^2)^{n/2}:
    # (3 / r^{n-1})^{n/2} * r^{n(n-1)/2} = 59049
    # 3^{n/2} * r^{ - (n/2)(n-1) + n(n-1)/2} = 59049
    # Exponent of r: (- n(n-1)/2 ) + n(n-1)/2 = 0
    # So r disappears in product relation! Only a matters
    
    # Wait: above exponent cancels; check carefully
    # Actually:
    # a^2 r^{n-1} = 3 => a^2 = 3 / r^{n-1}
    # a^n = (a^2)^{n/2} = (3 / r^{n-1})^{n/2} = 3^{n/2} * r^{- (n/2)(n-1)}
    # product = a^n r^{n(n-1)/2} = 3^{n/2} * r^{-(n/2)(n-1) + n(n-1)/2} = 3^{n/2} * r^{n(n-1)/2(1 - 1)}= 3^{n/2}
    
    # So the product is 3^{n/2} which must equal 59049 = 3^{10}
    # So 3^{n/2} = 3^{10} => n/2 =10 => n=20
    
    # Check the first*last product condition at n=20:
    # a^2 r^{19} = 3
    # and product condition derived above is satisfied
    
    # For n=20, from first*last: a^2 r^{19} = 3
    # Product check is already consistent.
    
    # Try to find a and r numerically for n=20.
    
    if n == 20:
        # Let r = x, then
        # a^2 = 3 / r^{19}
        # product = a^{20} * r^{190} = 59049
        # a^{20} = (a^2)^{10} = [3 / r^{19}]^{10} = 3^{10} / r^{190}
        # product = (3^{10} / r^{190}) * r^{190} = 3^{10} = 59049 correct
        # So any r != 0 will work with a = sqrt(3 / r^{19})

        # Print solutions for some sample r values.
        print(f"n = {n}")
        sample_rs = [1, 3, 1/3, -1, -3]
        for r in sample_rs:
            if r == 0:
                continue
            a_sq = 3 / (r ** 19)
            if a_sq < 0:
                # a would be imaginary
                continue
            a = a_sq ** 0.5
            # verify conditions exactly
            t1 = a
            tn = a * r**(n-1)
            prod = 1
            for k in range(1, n+1):
                prod *= a * r**(k-1)
            if isclose(t1 * tn, 3, rel_tol=1e-9) and isclose(prod, 59049, rel_tol=1e-9):
                print(f"  a={a:.6g}, r={r:.6g}, t1*tn={t1*tn:.6g}, product={prod:.6g}")

# Final conclusion based on above:
print("Minimum n satisfying conditions is 20.")
