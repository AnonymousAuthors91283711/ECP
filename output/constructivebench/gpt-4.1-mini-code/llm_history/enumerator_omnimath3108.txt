This problem involves computing the distance between two numbers on the real number line. Given the points \(a = -5\) and \(b = 6\), the distance between them is \(|b - a|\). To support conjecturing, we enumerate distances for a few integer pairs \((a,b)\) including the given numbers, confirming the exact distance and comparing with the target pair.

```python
# Enumerate absolute distances for some integer pairs to conjecture dist(a, b) = |b - a| 
def dist(a, b):
    return abs(b - a)

sample_pairs = [(-5, 6), (-5, -6), (6, -5), (0, 0), (2, 5)]
print("Enumerating distances for sample pairs (a, b):")
for a, b in sample_pairs:
    d = dist(a, b)
    print(f"dist({a}, {b}) = {d}")

print("\nSpecific answer for a = -5, b = 6:")
a = -5
b = 6
distance = dist(a, b)
print(distance)
```
