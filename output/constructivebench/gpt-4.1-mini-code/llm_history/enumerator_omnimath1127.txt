The problem appears to involve counting certain pairs \(s\) in a 9x9 grid for which the number of rectangles containing \(s\) has even cardinality. A rectangle is determined by \((r.1, r.2) \in (Fin 9 \times Fin 9)^2\) satisfying \(r.1.1 \leq s.1 \leq r.2.1\) and \(r.1.2 \leq s.2 \leq r.2.2\).

The set inside the card means rectangles containing the point \(s\). For each \(s=(x,y)\), the number of rectangles containing \(s\) equals the number of choices \((a,b)\) with \(a \leq x \leq b\) and \(c \leq y \leq d\), i.e., number of rectangles with horizontal boundaries \(a \le x \le b\) and vertical boundaries \(c \le y \le d\).

Since \(a,b\) and \(c,d\) range from 0 to 8, the count is \((x+1)(9-x)(y+1)(9-y)\).

The problem asks: For how many points \((x,y) \in \{0,...,8\}^2\) is \((x+1)(9 - x)(y+1)(9 - y)\) even?

We want to enumerate all \((x,y)\), compute that product, check parity, and count those with even product.

The maximum of 81 points is manageable to print all points with even counts and their counts.

Then printing the final count to assist in infering omnimath1127_answer.

```python
# Enumerate points (x,y) in 0..8 x 0..8, compute num_rectangles = (x+1)*(9 - x)*(y+1)*(9 - y)
# Print each point with its count and parity. Finally print total number of points with even counts.

def main():
    n = 9
    even_points = 0
    for x in range(n):
        x1 = x + 1
        x2 = n - x
        for y in range(n):
            y1 = y + 1
            y2 = n - y
            count = x1 * x2 * y1 * y2
            parity = "even" if count % 2 == 0 else "odd"
            print(f"Point ({x},{y}): count = {count}, parity = {parity}")
            if count % 2 == 0:
                even_points += 1
    print(f"Total points with even count: {even_points}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
