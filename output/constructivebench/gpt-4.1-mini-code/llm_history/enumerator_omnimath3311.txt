The problem is to count the number of functions \(a : \{0,1,2,3,4\} \to \mathbb{Z}\) satisfying two conditions:

1. For each \(i\), \(a(i) \leq i\).
2. The function \(a\) is nondecreasing (if \(i\le j\), then \(a(i) \le a(j)\)).

We want the cardinality of the set of all such \(a\).

Key observations:
- Since \(a(i) \le i\), the possible values at \(i\) are integers \(\le i\).
- The function is nondecreasing, so \(a(0) \le a(1) \le \dots \le a(4)\).
- Also, for all \(i\), \(a(i) \le i\), so the values are restricted above by the index.
- Values \(a(i)\) can be negative or zero or positive, but bounded by \(i\).

This is equivalent to counting all monotone (nondecreasing) integer sequences \((a_0,a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4)\) with \(a_i \le i\).

Since \(a_0 \le 0\), \(a_1 \le 1\), etc., but the monotonicity means \(a_0 \le a_1 \le a_2 \le a_3 \le a_4\).

We have to count integer sequences with these constraints.

Approach:
Enumerate all sequences \(a\) where \(-M \le a_i \le i\), for some finite large enough \(M\). Since monotone nondecreasing and bounded above by \(i\), minimal value (lowest \(a_0\)) is \(-\infty\) theoretically, but since sequences have to be bounded by \(i\), and monotone, the minimal might be much lower.

However, given \(a_4 \le 4\), and monotone increasing, the minimum \(a_0 \le a_1 \le \cdots \le a_4 \le 4\).

Also, \(a_0 \le 0\), so the lower bound for \(a_0\) can be as low as needed, but with \(a_4 \le 4\), \(a_0 \le a_4\), so \(a_0\) can be as low as we want (unbounded below) unless we restrict somehow.

But since \(a_i \in \mathbb{Z}\), and we want to count such sequences, is the set finite?

If no restriction on lower bound of \(a_i\), the set is infinite because we could choose all \(a_i = -N \) for arbitrary large \(N\).

But the problem's statement specifies that the function is from Fin 5 (finite set) into \(\mathbb{Z}\) with the conditions, so unless the problem context is within Lean's typeclass finiteness, the actual set is infinite.

But the problem states `.ncard` meaning the finite cardinality of the set is equal to omnimath3311_answer.

So clearly the problem is that the functions are from Fin 5 to \(\mathbb{Z}\) with conditions \(a_i \le i\) and \(a_i \le a_j\) for \(i \le j\).

Hence \(a_i \le i\) means \(a_i\) is bounded above by \(i\), but not bounded below. If no lower bound then infinite.

Maybe the problem context requires \(a_i\) also to be in \(\le i\) but monotone increasing, so the minimal allowed values must satisfy \(a_0 \le 0\), \(a_1 \le 1\), etc. But monotone increasing means \(a_0 \le a_1 \le a_2 \le a_3 \le a_4\).

Combining, since \(a_4 \le 4\), all \(a_i \le 4\), and furthermore \(a_i \le i\), so actually \(a_i \le \min(4,i)\) which is just \(i\).

Since the sequence is monotone increasing, then every \(a_i \ge a_0\).

We can try an alternate reformulation:

All sequences \(a_0 \le a_1 \le \cdots \le a_4\) of integers with \(a_i \le i\).

Since monotone increasing, \(a_0 \le a_1 \le \cdots \le a_4 \le 4\). Also, for each \(i\), \(a_i \le i\). So \(a_i \le i\) is an upper bound putting a ceiling on \(a_i\).

Hence \(a_0 \le 0\), \(a_1 \le 1\), ..., \(a_4 \le 4\).

Since the sequence is monotone increasing, the lower value \(a_0\) is unbounded below, so infinite possible sequences unless we restrict to only integer values \(\ge -\infty\), but since no lower bound, it's infinite set.

Hence the problem must have an implicit assumption that these functions have codomain within \(Z\) and also presumably bounded below by \(-\infty\).

But the enumeration of the problem would be impossible without bounds.

Therefore, likely the problem assumes \(a_i \ge 0\) or something else implicit.

Given it is a Lean mathlib problem and the cardinality is finite, it is likely that \(a_i\) must be between \(-\infty\) and \(i\), but order monotone, so actually the only possible values for \(a_i\) are integers in \(\le i\), but since \(a_i\) can't decrease, minimal value of \(a_0\) bounded below by \(-\infty\), so infinite.

Hence best to test with finite range from minimal value \(-5\) up to maximum \(4\) and count sequences satisfying the monotonicity and upper bounds.

We expect sequences \(a = (a_0,\dots,a_4)\) where:

- \(a_0 \in [-5,0]\), \(a_1 \in [-5,1]\), ..., \(a_4 \in [-5,4]\)
- \(a_0 \le a_1 \le \cdots \le a_4\)
- \(a_i \le i\)

Enumerate all such sequences and count.

Let's write code to do that.

We pick minimal integer comparator = -5 for efficiency.

The code will enumerate all increasing 5-tuples with \(a_i \le i\), \(a_i \ge -5\), and monotone nondecreasing.

Print all such sequences as we find them, and then print the count.

To reduce verbosity, only print the sequences, then final count.

```python
# Python program to enumerate all integer sequences a: {0..4} -> Z
# such that a_i ≤ i and a_0 ≤ a_1 ≤ ... ≤ a_4
# We'll consider a_i ∈ [-5..i] to have finite enumeration

def main():
    min_val = -5
    count = 0
    for a0 in range(min_val, 1):   # a0 ≤ 0
        for a1 in range(max(a0, min_val), 2):  # a1 ≥ a0, a1 ≤ 1
            for a2 in range(max(a1, min_val), 3):  # a2 ≤ 2
                for a3 in range(max(a2, min_val), 4):  # a3 ≤ 3
                    for a4 in range(max(a3, min_val), 5):  # a4 ≤4
                        # Check a_i ≤ i is guaranteed by range caps
                        seq = (a0,a1,a2,a3,a4)
                        print(seq)
                        count += 1
    print("Total sequences counted:", count)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This prints sequences followed by total count so we can conjecture the formula for the number of such functions.

We expect the count to match omnimath3311_answer.

Final code satisfies problem requirements: print partial results immediately, no hardcoded final answer, efficient enumeration with pruning.  
The output is limited by the size of output tokens, so minimal printing per sequence and count only.

```python
# count nondecreasing integer sequences a0..a4 where a_i ≤ i, a_i ≥ -5 (to keep finite)
def main():
    min_val = -5
    count = 0
    for a0 in range(min_val, 1):   # a0 ≤ 0
        for a1 in range(max(a0, min_val), 2):  # a1 ≤1
            for a2 in range(max(a1, min_val), 3):  # a2 ≤2
                for a3 in range(max(a2, min_val), 4):  # a3 ≤3
                    for a4 in range(max(a3, min_val), 5):  # a4 ≤4
                        seq = (a0, a1, a2, a3, a4)
                        print(seq)
                        count += 1
    print("Total sequences counted:", count)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
