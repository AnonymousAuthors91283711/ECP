The problem is to find natural numbers \(c\) and \(s\) such that:
1. \(3c = 4s\)
2. \(c = s + 4\)

We want to find \(3c\) under these conditions.

From \(c = s + 4\), substitute into \(3c = 4s\):
\[3(s + 4) = 4s \implies 3s + 12 = 4s \implies s = 12\]
Then:
\[c = 12 + 4 = 16\]
And:
\[3c = 3 \times 16 = 48\]

To confirm this via the Python program, we'll enumerate small values of \(s\) and find corresponding \(c\) satisfying the conditions, then print the possible values of \(3c\).

```python
# Enumerate natural numbers c, s with c = s + 4 and 3c = 4s
# Print values of 3c as answers

for s in range(1, 50):  # limit chosen to small values sufficient for the problem
    c = s + 4
    if 3 * c == 4 * s:
        print(f"s = {s}, c = {c}, 3c = {3 * c}")
```

This directly identifies valid pairs and prints 3c values that solve the problem.
