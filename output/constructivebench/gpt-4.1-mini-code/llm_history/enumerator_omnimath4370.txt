The problem is to find a set \( s \) of 100 distinct natural numbers such that there exists an element \( m \in s \) with \( m^3 = \sum_{x \in s \setminus \{m\}} x^3 \).

This can be rewritten as
\[
m^3 = \sum_{x \in s} x^3 - m^3 \implies 2 m^3 = \sum_{x \in s} x^3.
\]

In other words, twice the cube of \( m \) equals the sum of cubes of all elements in \( s \).

We want to explore whether such sets exist. Since \( s \) has size 100, this is a huge search space. We'll experiment for smaller sizes first to find patterns, then print sample sets and values for chosen \( n \).

The program below:
- Tries sets with distinct small natural numbers.
- Checks the condition \( 2 m^3 = \) sum of cubes.
- Prints the found tuples (s, m, total sum).
- Starts with small subsets where enumeration is feasible.
- Prints all matches found.

```python
# Enumerate subsets to find if any with size n has some m with 2*m^3 = sum_cubes
# For performance, try small n and small ranges, print results

from itertools import combinations

def cube(x): return x**3

def check_set(s):
    s_cubes = [cube(x) for x in s]
    sum_cubes = sum(s_cubes)
    for m in s:
        if 2*cube(m) == sum_cubes:
            print(f"Set: {sorted(s)}, m: {m}, sum_cubes: {sum_cubes}")
            return True
    return False

# Test with smaller n due to combinatorial explosion
for n in [3,4,5,6]:
    print(f"Trying n={n}")
    max_num = 20  # limit range for speed
    found_any = False
    for s in combinations(range(1, max_num), n):
        if check_set(s):
            found_any = True
    if not found_any:
        print(f"No sets found for n={n}")
```

This enumeration might find interesting sets for small \( n \), giving insight into larger case behavior.
