This problem asks to find the greatest prime \( p \) such that there exists a finite set of primes whose average is 27 and this set includes \( p \). The key points are:
- \( p \) is prime,
- There is a finite set \( s \) of primes containing \( p \),
- The average of the primes in \( s \) is exactly 27.

We want to enumerate finite sets of primes with average 27 and print possible primes \( p \) in those sets. We try small sets because sets with few elements are easier to handle, and the sum must be \( 27 \times \text{cardinality} \).

We'll:
- Generate primes up to a certain limit,
- For each small cardinality \( n \) (from 1 to ~5 or 6),
- Compute total sum \( = 27 \times n \),
- Enumerate possible primes sets of size \( n \) summing to the total,
- Print each prime in such sets,
- Finally, print the maximum prime found.

```python
# Enumerate sets of primes of size n with sum 27*n and print primes in them,
# aiming to find the maximum prime in any such set.
from sympy import primerange
from itertools import combinations

def main():
    max_prime = 0
    max_sum = 27 * 6  # considering sets up to size 6 = max sum 162
    primes = list(primerange(2, max_sum + 1))
    print(f"Primes up to {max_sum}:", primes)

    # We'll check sets of size 1 to 6
    for n in range(1, 7):
        total = 27 * n
        # Filter primes <= total because sum must be total
        primes_filtered = [p for p in primes if p <= total]

        # To reduce search space, also filter primes; 
        # sum of n primes = total, so largest prime <= total
        # Use combinations with replacement to allow repeated primes if needed
        # but original problem says set, so no repeats (Finset is a set)
        # So combinations without replacement

        # Using combinations without replacement:
        from itertools import combinations

        # As combinations is expensive for large primes, let's limit to primes <= total
        # Generate all combinations of size n from primes_filtered that sum to total
        # We'll break early if sum exceeds total for speed.

        # Since combinations is expensive, we can use a recursive generator with pruning

        def find_sets(n, total, start=0, path=[]):
            if n == 0:
                if total == 0:
                    yield path
                return
            for i in range(start, len(primes_filtered)):
                p = primes_filtered[i]
                if p > total:
                    break
                yield from find_sets(n - 1, total - p, i + 1, path + [p])

        for comb in find_sets(n, total):
            for p in comb:
                print(f"Found prime in set of size {n} summing to {total}: {p}")
                if p > max_prime:
                    max_prime = p

    print(f"Maximum prime in any such set: {max_prime}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
