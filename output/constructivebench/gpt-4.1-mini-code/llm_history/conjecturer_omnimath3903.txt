. Enumerated answers: Checking n with (d(n))^3 = 4n, for n in 1..10000:
n=2, d(n)=2, d(n)^3=8, 4*n=8
n=128, d(n)=8, d(n)^3=512, 4*n=512
n=2000, d(n)=20, d(n)^3=8000, 4*n=8000
Smallest solution: 2
Largest solution: 2000. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
Explanation: The condition (d(n))^3 = 4n means the cube of the divisor count equals four times n. Let d(n) = k, then k^3 = 4n => n = k^3 / 4. For n to be integer, k^3 must be divisible by 4, so k is even. Also, divisor count function typically grows slowly and k can represent 2,8,20 as in examples. So the answer set is {k^3 / 4 | k ∈ ℕ, (k^3/4).divisors.card = k} and k even. We can characterize n as all n = k^3 /4, for k natural, k even, and divisor count of n is k.

In Lean set comprehension:

{n : ℕ | ∃ k : ℕ, k%2 = 0 ∧ n = k^3 / 4 ∧ (n.divisors).card = k ∧ n > 0 }

But k must be even and n > 0 integer. To avoid existential quantifier over divisor count, we keep existential over k, a more natural parameter for n.

<<<{n : ℕ | ∃ k : ℕ, k % 2 = 0 ∧ n = k^3 / 4 ∧ (n.divisors).card = k ∧ n > 0}>>>
