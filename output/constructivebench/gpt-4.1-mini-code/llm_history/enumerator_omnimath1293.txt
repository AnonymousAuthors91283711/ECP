The problem wants the last digit of the sum of i^i for i from 1 to 100. To investigate, I will:
- Enumerate (i, i^i % 10) for i in 1..100.
- Print i and the last digit immediately.
- Then print the sum modulo 10 (the last digit).
This provides candidates for the final last digit without hardcoding it.

```python
# Enumerate i^i mod 10 for i = 1..100 and sum them mod 10 to find the last digit of the sum

def last_digit_of_power(base, exponent):
    # Since last digit cycles repeat at most every 10, we optimize using pow with mod 10
    return pow(base % 10, exponent, 10)

total = 0
for i in range(1, 101):
    val = last_digit_of_power(i, i)
    print(f"i={i}, i^i mod 10={val}")
    total = (total + val) % 10

print(f"Sum of i^i for i=1..100 mod 10 = {total}")
```
