The problem defines a sequence \( S(n) \) for \( n \geq 3 \) by the recurrence \( S(n) = S(n-1) + S(n-2) \) and gives certain values: \( S(9)=110 \), \( S(7)=42 \), and asks to find \( S(4) \).

We can treat \( S(1) = a \) and \( S(2) = b \) as unknown initial values and generate the sequence up to \( n=9 \), then check for which \( a,b \in \mathbb{N}\) the given values \( S(7)=42\) and \( S(9)=110\) hold. Then output the corresponding \( S(4) \).

This python program enumerates small values of \( a,b \) (say up to 100 for efficiency) and prints all triples \( (a,b,S(4)) \) where the constraints are satisfied, printing each immediately. Given the values grow quickly, bounds of 100 should be sufficient.

```python
# Enumerate integer sequences defined by S(n)=S(n-1)+S(n-2) for n>=3
# with given S(7)=42 and S(9)=110. Find possible S(4).

def fib_like_sequence(a, b, n):
    S = [0]*(n+1)
    S[1] = a
    S[2] = b
    for i in range(3, n+1):
        S[i] = S[i-1] + S[i-2]
    return S

max_val = 100
for a in range(max_val+1):
    for b in range(max_val+1):
        S = fib_like_sequence(a, b, 9)
        if S[7] == 42 and S[9] == 110:
            print(f"Found initial values: S(1)={a}, S(2)={b}")
            print(f"S(4)={S[4]}")
```
This enumerates the parameter space and prints answers immediately when found. It helps to conjecture the exact value of \( S(4) \) consistent with the problem statement.
