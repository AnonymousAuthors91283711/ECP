The error arises from incorrect syntax of the universal quantifier and set membership in Lean. You cannot write `(∀ x y ∈ s, x ≠ y)` directly. Instead, you must write nested quantifiers with proper membership checking, like `(∀ x ∈ s, ∀ y ∈ s, x ≠ y → ...)` or equivalently `(∀ x ∈ s, ∀ y ∈ s, x ≠ y)`.

Moreover, the original problem requires that all elements are distinct; if the intention is "all elements are distinct," it means `∀ x ∈ s, ∀ y ∈ s, x ≠ y → x ≠ y` which is tautological. Actually, they want that the set contains no duplicates (which is automatic from the definition of Finset), or perhaps "all distinct" is just a way to say the set elements are distinct numbers (which is guaranteed by Finset), so the clause is likely meaning distinctness among elements of s.

If you want to say "all elements are distinct" meaning "no two elements are equal," that is automatic for a Finset, so this condition can be omitted.

Supposing that the problem demands to explicitly write distinctness, maybe to prevent something else, it's standard to write

`∀ x y ∈ s, x ≠ y → ...`.

But this is the same as

`∀ x ∈ s, ∀ y ∈ s, x ≠ y → ...`.

In your case, you only say `x ≠ y`, so just `∀ x ∈ s, ∀ y ∈ s, x ≠ y → false` means no two elements are equal, which is trivially true in Finset.

However, if you'd like to state that all elements are distinct simply, you can omit that condition since `s : Finset ℕ` by definition has distinct elements.

The corrected expression is:

```lean
∃ (s : Finset ℕ),
  s.card = 100 ∧
  ∃ m ∈ s, m^3 = (∑ x in s.erase m, x^3) ∧
  (∀ x ∈ s, ∀ y ∈ s, x ≠ y → x ≠ y)
```

But since `(∀ x ∈ s, ∀ y ∈ s, x ≠ y → x ≠ y)` is trivial, it could be omitted.

To fix the syntax error you encountered, just replace `(∀ x y ∈ s, x ≠ y)` with `(∀ x ∈ s, ∀ y ∈ s, x ≠ y → x ≠ y)` or just simply omit it.

Hence, the fixed version is:

<<<
∃ (s : Finset ℕ),
  s.card = 100 ∧
  ∃ m ∈ s, m^3 = (∑ x in s.erase m, x^3) ∧
  (∀ x ∈ s, ∀ y ∈ s, x ≠ y → x ≠ y)
