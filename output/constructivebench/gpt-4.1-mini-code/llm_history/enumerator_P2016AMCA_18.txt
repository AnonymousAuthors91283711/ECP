The problem involves divisor sums over specific intervals scaled by powers of n. To assist in conjecturing the unknown answer, we enumerate values of n starting from 1, compute \(\sigma_0\) (the number of divisors) in the intervals \([1, 110 n^3]\) and \([1, 81 n^4]\), check if the first equals 110, and if so, print the corresponding second value. This helps identify the pattern for the theorem's conclusion.

```python
import math

def sigma_0(k):
    # number of divisors of k
    count = 0
    root = int(math.isqrt(k))
    for i in range(1, root+1):
        if k % i == 0:
            count += 2 if i*i != k else 1
    return count

# sigma_0 over [1, M] means sum of sigma_0(k) for k=1 to M
def prefix_sigma_0(M):
    # sum of divisor counts from 1 to M
    total = 0
    for x in range(1, M+1):
        total += sigma_0(x)
    return total

max_n = 5  # check small n due to complexity
for n in range(1, max_n+1):
    s1 = prefix_sigma_0(110 * n**3)
    if s1 == 110:
        s2 = prefix_sigma_0(81 * n**4)
        print(f"n={n}, sigma_0(1 to {110 * n**3})={s1}, sigma_0(1 to {81 * n**4})={s2}")
```

[refine_program]
The provided program tries to solve a difficult problem by brute force: it sums the divisor counts up to certain bounds depending on n, then checks if the first sum equals 110 to determine valid n values, then prints the second sum for those n. However, with n up to 5, the program found no n satisfying the condition sigma_0(1 to 110*n^3) = 110, so it prints nothing.

Issues:
- The brute force is very slow and may require bigger n or a better approach.
- The problem likely requires some closed form or insight; brute force is inefficient.
- The enumerated output is empty, not fulfilling the requirement of printing answers.
- It would be better to check a few n values and print their sums anyway, or at least print which n were tested.

Judgment: The original program is rejected because it prints no answers and does not meet the streaming partial results requirement.
