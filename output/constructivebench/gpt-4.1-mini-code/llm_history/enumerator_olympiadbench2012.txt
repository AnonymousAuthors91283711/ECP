The problem is about finding the minimal and maximal size of a subset \( s \subseteq \{0..99\} \times \{0..99\} \) such that for a bijection \( f \) from \(\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}\) satisfying monotonicity conditions (monotonically increasing when incrementing x or y), all values \( f(p) \) with \( p \in s \) are odd numbers. We want to enumerate sizes of such sets \( s \) to conjecture minimal and maximal values.

We'll sample small grids (e.g., 5x5) and try to find subsets \( s \) with all \( f(p) \) odd for \( f \) bijective and monotone. To assist, since exact \( f \) unknown, simulate a plausible monotone bijection such as the Cantor pairing or lex order mapping. Then enumerate subsets in grid and check how many points can have odd \( f(p) \) values simultaneously.

The program below:
- Picks a sample size (e.g. 5)
- Defines a monotone bijection \( f \) to \(\mathbb{N}\)
- Enumerates subsets \( s \) whose \( f(p) \) values are odd
- Prints sizes of such subsets found
- Prints minimal and maximal sizes found up to a threshold

This will help conjecture the true minimal and maximal values for the original 100x100 problem.

```python
# Enumerate subset sizes with all f(p) odd for p in s for a monotone bijection f
# We use a small grid (5x5) for computational feasibility
# f: (x,y) -> x + y*grid_size (lex order) is monotone in x and y

from itertools import combinations

grid_size = 5
points = [(x, y) for x in range(grid_size) for y in range(grid_size)]

def f(p):
    # monotone bijection: lexicographic order number
    x, y = p
    return x + y * grid_size

odd_points = [p for p in points if f(p) % 2 == 1]

# We want subsets s of points with all f(p) odd
# any subset of odd_points qualifies, so maximal size is len(odd_points)
max_size = len(odd_points)
print(f"Grid size {grid_size}x{grid_size}, total points: {len(points)}")
print(f"Number of points with odd f(p): {max_size}")

# minimal size of such a subset (assuming nonempty needed)
# minimal size is 1 (single odd point)
min_size = 1

# show some example subset sizes
for size in range(1, max_size + 1):
    # Just print the size, as any combination of odd_points works
    print(f"Found subset of size {size} with all f(p) odd")

print(f"Minimal size: {min_size}")
print(f"Maximal size: {max_size}")
```
