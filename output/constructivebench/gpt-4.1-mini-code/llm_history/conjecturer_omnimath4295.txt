The error arises because the lambda expression `fun x => a * x^2 + b * x - 1 ∧ ...` is being parsed as returning `Prop` (due to the ∧ inside the body) rather than a function `ℝ → ℝ`. The conjunction should be outside the equality defining f, not inside the function body.

We must separate the function definition from the conditions on `a` and `b`. Also, to express the set of solutions as functions, we say `f = λ x, a * x^2 + b * x - 1` with `(a,b)` in some finite set of pairs `{(0,-1), (0,2), (1,0)}`.

So the correct Lean set is:

{ f | ∃ a b, f = fun x => a * x^2 + b * x - 1 ∧ ( (a = 0 ∧ (b = -1 ∨ b = 2)) ∨ (a = 1 ∧ b = 0) )}

But this above way captured conjunction inside the function body. Instead write:

{ f | ∃ a b, f = fun x => a * x^2 + b * x - 1 ∧ ((a = 0 ∧ (b = -1 ∨ b = 2)) ∨ (a = 1 ∧ b = 0)) }

But the ∧ operator here binds between propositions, so the entire `f = fun x => a * x^2 + b * x - 1` is a proposition, and `(a=0 ∧ (...)) ∨ (a=1 ∧ b=0)` is another proposition.

We just need to ensure proper parentheses to avoid parsing errors.

The original reported error seems to indicate it's parsing `f = fun x => a * x^2 + b * x - 1 ∧ (...)` as a function returning Prop (due to precedence).

So write:

{f | ∃ a b, f = (fun x => a * x^2 + b * x - 1) ∧ ( (a = 0 ∧ (b = -1 ∨ b = 2)) ∨ (a = 1 ∧ b = 0) )}

This disambiguates the fun body.

Also, in Lean `x^2` is usually `x ^ 2` or `x*x` but overall `x^2` is acceptable if mathlib is imported.

Hence the fixed expression is:

{ f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ a b : ℝ, f = (fun x => a * x ^ 2 + b * x - 1) ∧ ((a = 0 ∧ (b = -1 ∨ b = 2)) ∨ (a = 1 ∧ b = 0)) }

— enclosed as required:

<<<{f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ a b : ℝ, f = (fun x => a * x^2 + b * x - 1) ∧ ((a = 0 ∧ (b = -1 ∨ b = 2)) ∨ (a = 1 ∧ b = 0))}>>>
