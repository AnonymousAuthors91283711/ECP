The problem appears to characterize all positive integers n = a+b+c+d for which there exist positive integers a,b,c,d satisfying the equation:
\[ \frac{ab}{a+b} + \frac{cd}{c+d} = \frac{(a+b)(c+d)}{a+b+c+d}. \]

We want to enumerate possible values of n, then conjecture the set `IMO2023SLN7_answer`. To do this, we search for quadruples (a,b,c,d) with positive integers up to a limit, checking the equation precisely using fractions.

We will:
- Iterate over n in a sensible range.
- For each n, try all partitions a,b,c,d > 0 with a+b+c+d = n.
- Check if the equation holds exactly.
- If yes, print n and the quadruple showing the solution.

This helps to gather candidates for the set `IMO2023SLN7_answer`.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Check the equality:
# ab/(a+b) + cd/(c+d) == (a+b)(c+d)/(a+b+c+d)
# All variables positive integers.

MAX_N = 30  # limit for search to keep output reasonable

print("Enumerating possible values of n = a+b+c+d with positive a,b,c,d up to", MAX_N)

found_ns = set()

for n in range(4, MAX_N+1):
    found_for_n = False
    # Iterate a,b,c,d positive with sum n
    # To reduce loops, let x=a+b, y=c+d with x,y ≥ 2 and x+y=n
    for x in range(2, n-1):
        y = n - x
        if y < 2:
            continue
        # Now iterate a,b with sum x (a,b≥1)
        for a in range(1, x):
            b = x - a
            # iterate c,d with sum y (c,d≥1)
            for c in range(1, y):
                d = y - c
                lhs = Fraction(a*b, a+b) + Fraction(c*d, c+d)
                rhs = Fraction(x*y, n)
                if lhs == rhs:
                    print(f"n={n}, a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d} satisfies the equation")
                    found_for_n = True
                    found_ns.add(n)
    # Optional: limit results per n to avoid too much output
    # But here we print all

print("\nPossible values of n found:")
for val in sorted(found_ns):
    print(val)
