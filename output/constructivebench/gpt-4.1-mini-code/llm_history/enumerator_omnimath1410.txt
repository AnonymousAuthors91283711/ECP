The problem involves enumerating natural numbers \( n \) from 2 to 2021 and checking when the relation 
\[ 5 (x_n)^2 + 5 (x_{n+1})^2 = 26 x_n x_{n+1} \]
holds. Here \( x_n \) follows a recursive definition using 
\[ M(a,b) = \text{lcm}(a,b)/\text{gcd}(a,b) \]
with \( x_0=0, x_1=1 \), and 
\[ x_{n+2} = M(n+1, x_{n+1}). \]

We will:
- Compute \(x_n\) for \( n \in [0,2022] \) efficiently.
- Check the condition for \( n \in [2,2021] \).
- Print all \( n \) where the equation holds.

This enumeration will help conjecture the answer.

```python
import math

def M(a, b):
    return (a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)

MAX_N = 2022

# Precompute x with base cases
x = [0, 1] + [0]*(MAX_N-1)

for n in range(MAX_N-1):
    x[n+2] = M(n+1, x[n+1])

# Check condition for n in [2, 2021]
for n in range(2, 2022):
    lhs = 5*x[n]**2 + 5*x[n+1]**2
    rhs = 26 * x[n] * x[n+1]
    if lhs == rhs:
        print(f"Solution n={n} with x_n={x[n]}, x_n+1={x[n+1]}")
```
