The problem asks to find the smallest possible value of the maximum pairwise sum among consecutive variables \(a,b,c,d,e\) where each is a positive integer and their sum is 2010. We want to enumerate candidate values \(M\) by trying small test sums and verifying the minimum achievable maximum pair sum given the constraints.

We'll:
- Enumerate all positive integer 5-tuples with sum = 2010 (approximate by testing smaller sums for demonstration),
- Compute max of the pairs (a+b), (b+c), (c+d), (d+e),
- Print \((a,b,c,d,e)\) and candidate \(M\) each time we find a new lower max sum,
- Finally print the minimal max sum encountered for small sums (to ensure output brevity).

```python
def enumerate_min_max_pair_sum(total):
    # Enumerate positive integers a,b,c,d,e with sum = total
    # and calculate max of sums of consecutive pairs
    min_max_sum = total * 2  # start with large number
    for a in range(1, total-3):
        for b in range(1, total - a - 2):
            for c in range(1, total - a - b - 1):
                for d in range(1, total - a - b - c):
                    e = total - a - b - c - d
                    # all positive by construction
                    pairs = [a+b, b+c, c+d, d+e]
                    M = max(pairs)
                    if M < min_max_sum:
                        min_max_sum = M
                        print(f"Sum={total}: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}, e={e}, max_pair_sum={M}")
                        # When total=10, we can afford full enumeration; for large total skip
                        if total > 20:  # limit output length for large sums
                            return min_max_sum
    return min_max_sum

def main():
    # The target sum is 2010, but full enumeration is not feasible
    # Instead, try smaller sums to see the pattern
    for test_sum in [10, 20, 50, 100]:
        print(f"Testing total sum = {test_sum}")
        min_M = enumerate_min_max_pair_sum(test_sum)
        print(f"Minimal max pair sum for total={test_sum}: {min_M}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
