This problem involves non-increasing functions \(f:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}\) defined on the domain \(\{0, \ldots, 300\}\) with constraints on sums of \(f\), and another function \(g:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}\) related to sums of \(f\) evaluated on sums of 20-tuples of natural numbers. The objective is to maximize \(S = \sum_{k=0}^{6000} g(k)\).

We cannot prove results directly but can attempt enumerations for small parameter values to get an idea of the constraints and potential values of sums.

We will experiment with simpler analogous versions such as smaller ranges and smaller arities (e.g., 5 or 3 instead of 20), and try out sample non-increasing functions \(f\) to enumerate candidate sums for \(g\) and sums of \(g\).

We use Python to:

- Enumerate candidate non-increasing functions \(f\) on small ranges with sum constraints,
- For each \(f\), compute feasible \(g(k)\) values based on the inequality constraint,
- Calculate \(\sum g(k)\) on a smaller domain,
- Print \(f\), \(g\), and sums to unveil patterns.

```python
# Enumerate possible sums S = sum g(k) with simplified parameters
# due to complexity, we use smaller ranges and dimension=3 instead of 20.
# f : [0..n], non-increasing, sum f(k) ≤ M, f(n) ≥ 0
# g : [0..m], with g(sum(n_i)) ≤ sum f(n_i) for n_i in [0..n]^dim,
# here n_i sum ≤ m. We take dim=3 and moderate sizes.
