The problem involves counting permutations \( f \) of the set \(\{0, \ldots, 6\}\) with the property that for each \( i \) in \( \{0, \ldots, 5\} \), \((f(i) + 1)(f(i+1) + 1) \leq 20\), and also \((f(6) + 1)(f(0) + 1) \leq 20\). We work with values from 1 to 7 (due to +1 offset).

To enumerate, generate all permutations of \(\{0, \ldots, 6\}\), then check these inequalities around the cycle. We print each permutation that fits, showing the product pairs, and at end summarize the count.

Small search space (7! = 5040 permutations) allows full enumeration. This satisfies requirement 3 by fixing \(n=7\).

```python
from itertools import permutations

n = 7
count = 0

# Precompute the allowed pairs (a,b) with (a+1)*(b+1) <= 20 for digits 0..6
allowed_pairs = set()
for a in range(n):
    for b in range(n):
        if (a+1)*(b+1) <= 20:
            allowed_pairs.add((a, b))

print("Enumerating permutations f of {0,..,6} where for all i, (f(i)+1)*(f(i+1)+1)<=20 mod 7")

for p in permutations(range(n)):
    # Check the cyclic condition on consecutive indices
    valid = True
    for i in range(n):
        if (p[i], p[(i+1)%n]) not in allowed_pairs:
            valid = False
            break
    if valid:
        count += 1
        # Print permutation and product pairs (f(i)+1)*(f(i+1)+1)
        products = [(p[i]+1)*(p[(i+1)%n]+1) for i in range(n)]
        print(f"Perm: {p} Products: {products}")

print(f"Total count of such permutations: {count}")
```
