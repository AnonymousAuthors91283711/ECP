The problem asks to find all positive integers n less than 1000 such that n equals 6 times the sum of its digits. We'll enumerate numbers from 1 to 999, compute the digit sum, check the condition, and print all satisfying numbers immediately upon discovery. Finally, we'll print the total count.

```python
def digit_sum(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

print("Numbers n with 0 < n < 1000 and n = 6 * sum_of_digits(n):")
count = 0
for n in range(1, 1000):
    s = digit_sum(n)
    if n == 6 * s:
        print(n)
        count += 1
print("Total count:", count)
```
