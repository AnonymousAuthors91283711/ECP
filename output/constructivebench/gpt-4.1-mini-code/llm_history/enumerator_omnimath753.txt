This problem involves finding the set of real numbers \( x \) that satisfy the equation
\[
x = \sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^{n+1} x^n.
\]
We want to enumerate possible real solutions by evaluating partial sums and checking convergence behavior for various \( x \).

```python
# Enumerate candidate x in a range and check numerical convergence of the series
def partial_sum(x, terms=50):
    s = 0.0
    for n in range(terms):
        s += (-1)**(n+1) * x**n
    return s

print("Enumerating candidates for x satisfying x = Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^{n+1} x^n")

candidates = []
for x in [-2.0 + i*0.1 for i in range(41)]:  # from -2.0 to 2.0 step 0.1
    s = partial_sum(x)
    # Print immediately if close to equality, within 1e-3 tolerance
    if abs(x - s) < 1e-3:
        print(f"x = {x:.3f}, sum ≈ {s:.5f}")
        candidates.append((x, s))

if candidates:
    min_x = min(candidates, key=lambda t: t[0])
    max_x = max(candidates, key=lambda t: t[0])
    print(f"Minimum candidate: x = {min_x[0]:.3f}")
    print(f"Maximum candidate: x = {max_x[0]:.3f}")
else:
    print("No candidates found in tested range.")
```
