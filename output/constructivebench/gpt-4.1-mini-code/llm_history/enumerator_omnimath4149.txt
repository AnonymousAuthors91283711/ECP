The problem is about finding the minimal number \( n \) of guesses needed to distinguish every secret triple in \( T \) using the given response function. To explore this, we will enumerate strategies (sets of guesses) with increasing size \( n \), then check if these guesses separate all distinct pairs in \( T \).

Due to complexity, we sample only a few guesses, and output partial results as soon as found. We print candidate \( n \) and example strategies that work, then increase \( n \). This helps conjecture a minimal \( n \).

```python
# Enumerate and print sets of guesses distinguishing all pairs in T = {0..9}^3.
# For guess sets of size n, test if for every pair of distinct secrets the responses disagree on some guess.
# Due to combinational explosion, we limit guess sets to random samples for demonstration.

from itertools import product, combinations
import sys
import random

T = list(product(range(10), repeat=3))

def response(secret, guess):
    x,y,z = secret
    a,b,c = guess
    return abs(x+y - (a+b)) + abs(y+z - (b+c)) + abs(z+x - (c+a))

def distinguish(guesses):
    # Checks if guesses distinguish every pair of distinct secrets in T
    # For efficiency, stop early if any pair is not distinguished
    for i, s1 in enumerate(T):
        for j in range(i+1, len(T)):
            s2 = T[j]
            if all(response(s1,g) == response(s2,g) for g in guesses):
                return False
    return True

print("Enumerating guess sets starting from size 1...")
max_n = 4  # limit maximum guesses for output length reasons

for n in range(1, max_n+1):
    # Generate random subsets of size n from T (up to some attempts)
    attempts = 1000
    found = False
    for _ in range(attempts):
        guesses = random.sample(T, n)
        if distinguish(guesses):
            print(f"Found distinguishing strategy with n={n}: guesses={guesses}")
            found = True
            break
    if found:
        print(f"Minimum number of guesses found: {n}")
        break
else:
    print(f"No distinguishing strategy found with up to n={max_n}.")
```
