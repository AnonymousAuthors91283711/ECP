. Enumerated Answers: Trying small integer and rational values for x and y.... Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ × ℝ)
The main issue is that you cannot write set comprehension `{(x,y) | ...}` without specifying the variables' domain explicitly. In Lean, when defining subsets of ℝ × ℝ, you should use `Set ℝ × ℝ := { p : ℝ × ℝ | property on p }` and then destructure p into components inside the property.

Also, to correctly express `x ≠ 0` and powers on reals, ensure to use the notation with `p.1` and `p.2` representing the first and second components of `p : ℝ × ℝ`.

Additionally, powers like `x^2` should use `x^2` carefully: the `^` operator in Lean expects `Nat` in exponent and real base, but the base must be a real number. Also, to avoid confusion, use `Real.mul_self x` or `x * x` instead of `x^2` if unsure.

Finally, division like `1 / x` is defined on ℝ with `x ≠ 0`, but you need to make sure the denominator is nonzero before writing it.

Putting all this together:

```lean
{p : ℝ × ℝ | 
  p.1 ≠ 0 ∧ p.2 ≠ 0 ∧
  (1 / p.1 + 1 / (2 * p.2) = (p.1^2 + 3 * p.2^2) * (3 * p.1^2 + p.2^2)) ∧
  (1 / p.1 - 1 / (2 * p.2) = 2 * (p.2^4 - p.1^4))
}
```

This should compile correctly.

<<<{p : ℝ × ℝ | p.1 ≠ 0 ∧ p.2 ≠ 0 ∧ (1 / p.1 + 1 / (2 * p.2) = (p.1^2 + 3 * p.2^2) * (3 * p.1^2 + p.2^2)) ∧ (1 / p.1 - 1 / (2 * p.2) = 2 * (p.2^4 - p.1^4))}>>>
