The problem involves finding integers \( k \) between 1 and 50 such that there exist integers \( a > b \) with \( a - b = k \) and the gcd \(\gcd(a^3 - b^3, (a - b)^3)\) is square-free (no square divisor greater than 1).

Key observations:
- \( a^3 - b^3 = (a-b)(a^2 + ab + b^2) = k(a^2 + ab + b^2) \)
- \(\gcd(a^3 - b^3, k^3) = \gcd(k(a^2+ab+b^2), k^3) = k \cdot \gcd(a^2+ab+b^2, k^2)\)

The gcd will have a squared prime dividing it if any prime squared divides \(k \cdot \gcd(a^2+ab+b^2, k^2)\).

We want to find for each \(k\) whether there exist \(a,b\) with \(a-b=k\) such that \(\gcd(a^3 - b^3, k^3)\) is square-free.

We'll brute force over \(k\) in 1..50, and for each \(k\), try small \(b\), compute \(a=b+k\), gcd, and check for square factor in the gcd. If no such \(a,b\) yields a non-square-free gcd, \(k\) meets the condition.

Print all such \(k\) as candidates and their count.

```python
import math

def square_free(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for p in range(2, int(n**0.5)+1):
        if n % (p*p) == 0:
            return False
    return True

def gcd(a,b):
    while b:
        a,b = b,a%b
    return a

print("Checking k from 1 to 50 for P2024HMMTnov_guts_22 condition:")
valid_ks = []
for k in range(1,51):
    found_bad = False
    # Try several b values to find gcd with prime square factor
    for b in range(1, 21):
        a = b + k
        diff_cubed = k**3
        diff_cubed_gcd = gcd((a**3 - b**3), diff_cubed)
        # Check if gcd has a prime square factor > 1
        if not square_free(diff_cubed_gcd):
            found_bad = True
            break
    if not found_bad:
        print("k =", k)
        valid_ks.append(k)

print("Count of valid k =", len(valid_ks))
```
