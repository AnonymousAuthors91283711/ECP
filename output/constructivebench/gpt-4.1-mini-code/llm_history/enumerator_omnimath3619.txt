This problem involves a nonlinear recurrence and square values derived from its terms. To explore the conjecture, I'll enumerate `a` values in a small range, compute the sequence for `n` up to some limit, and check if \(2 \cdot recurrenceSequence(a, n) - 1\) is a perfect square for all \(n \geq 1\). This can help guess the set `omnimath3619_answer`.

```python
import math

def recurrence_sequence(a, n, memo={}):
    # memo dictionary keyed by (a, n) to avoid recomputation
    if (a, n) in memo:
        return memo[(a, n)]
    if n == 0:
        memo[(a, n)] = a
    elif n == 1:
        memo[(a, n)] = 2
    else:
        term_n1 = recurrence_sequence(a, n - 1, memo)
        term_n2 = recurrence_sequence(a, n - 2, memo)
        val = 2 * term_n1 * term_n2 - term_n1 - term_n2 + 1
        memo[(a, n)] = val
    return memo[(a, n)]

def is_perfect_square(x):
    if x < 0:
        return False
    r = int(math.isqrt(x))
    return r * r == x

# We'll test a in a small range, say -10 to 10, n from 1 to 6 to limit output size
print("a, sequence terms, condition holds for n=1..6:")

for a in range(-10, 11):
    condition_holds = True
    squares = []
    for n in range(1, 7):
        val = recurrence_sequence(a, n)
        check_val = 2 * val - 1
        if is_perfect_square(check_val):
            squares.append((n, val, check_val, int(math.isqrt(check_val))))
        else:
            condition_holds = False
            break
    if condition_holds:
        print(f"a = {a}")
        for (n, val, check_val, root) in squares:
            print(f"  n={n}: term={val}, 2*term-1={check_val}={root}^2")
```
This prints candidates `a` for which all tested `n` satisfy the perfect square condition, along with corresponding terms and roots, helping conjecture `omnimath3619_answer`.
