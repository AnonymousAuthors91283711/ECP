The problem seems to involve rational numbers \( M, p \) and natural number \( C \), with conditions relating \( M, p, C \) and an expression \(\frac{M - pC}{M}\). We want to find and conjecture the value of this expression under the given constraints.

The key equations and constraints are:
- \( M, p \in \mathbb{Q}, M, p > 0 \)
- \( C \in \mathbb{N}, C > 0 \)
- \( \frac{M}{5} = p \cdot \frac{C}{3} \)
- The value \(\frac{M - pC}{M}\)

We want to enumerate candidates for \(M, C\), find \(p\) from the equality, then compute the expression \((M - pC)/M\). We print each computed result exactly (as fractions), to guess the actual formula \(P2005AMCB_3_answer\).

Below is a program that enumerates small positive rational \(M\) and positive integers \(C\), computes \(p\) from the equation, outputs the value, and finally prints a conjectured simplified form (based on observations).

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Enumerate small positive rational M = m_n/m_d and positive integer C
# For simplicity, M enumerated as fraction with numerator, denominator in [1..5]

print("Enumerating values of (M, C), value of (M - p*C)/M:")

for m_num in range(1, 6):
    for m_den in range(1, 6):
        M = Fraction(m_num, m_den)
        if M <= 0:
            continue
        for C in range(1, 6):
            # Given M/5 = p*(C/3), solve for p
            # p = (M/5)/(C/3) = (M/5)*(3/C) = (3*M)/(5*C)
            p = Fraction(3 * M.numerator, 5 * C * M.denominator)
            # Ensure p > 0
            if p <= 0:
                continue
            # Compute (M - p*C) / M
            val = (M - p * C) / M
            # val simplified fraction
            # Print in fractional form
            print(f"M={M}, C={C}, p={p}, (M - p*C)/M = {val}")

# After enumerations, conjecture exact expression based on simplification:
# (M - p*C)/M = 1 - (p*C)/M
# But p = (3*M)/(5*C)
# So (p*C)/M = (3*M)/(5*C)*C / M = 3/5
# Hence (M - pC)/M = 1 - 3/5 = 2/5 exactly.

print("\nConjectured exact value of (M - p*C)/M = 2/5")
```
This code carefully enumerates and prints all candidates, confirming the value is always 2/5 exactly for positive M, C satisfying the equality, thus conjecturing the theorem.
