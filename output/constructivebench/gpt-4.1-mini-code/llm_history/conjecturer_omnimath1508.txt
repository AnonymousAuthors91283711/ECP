The infinite sum ∑ (fib(n+1) / 4^(n+2)) converges, and from the enumerated partial sums it clearly converges to approximately 0.0909090..., which is exactly 1/11. The initial proposed answer 1/12 ≈ 0.08333 is off.

We can rewrite the sum as ∑ fib(n+1)/4^(n+2) = (1/16) ∑ fib(n+1)/4^n, so the factor 1/16 pulls out.

Recall the generating function for Fibonacci numbers: ∑ fib(k) x^k = x / (1 - x - x^2), valid for |x| < 1.

Shifting index, ∑ fib(n+1) x^n = (x + x^2) / (1 - x - x^2).

Plug in x = 1/4:

∑ fib(n+1) (1/4)^n = (1/4 + 1/16) / (1 - 1/4 - 1/16) = (5/16) / (11/16) = 5/11.

Therefore:

∑ fib(n+1) / 4^(n+2) = (1/16) * (5/11) = 5 / 176.

Numerical check: 5 / 176 ≈ 0.0284091, which does not match the enumerated partial sums approx 0.09.

Wait this shows inconsistency.

Rethink algebra carefully:

The sum is ∑ fib(n+1) / 4^(n+2) = ∑ fib(n+1) * (1/4)^{n+2} = (1/16) ∑ fib(n+1) (1/4)^n.

So sum = (1/16) * S, where S = ∑ fib(n+1) (1/4)^n.

Using generating function for fib(m):

∑ fib(m) x^m = x / (1 - x - x^2)

So

S = ∑ fib(n+1) x^n with x = 1/4

Calculate S:

∑ fib(n+1) x^n = (x) / (1 - x - x^2) + constant shift? Actually, from generating function, shift index:

∑_{n=0}^∞ fib(n+1) x^n = x / (1 - x - x^2)

Yes! So S = 1/4 / (1 - 1/4 - 1/16) = (1/4) / (11/16) = (1/4)*(16/11) = 4/11.

Therefore sum = (1/16) * (4/11) = 1/44 = 0.02272727, not matching approximate 0.09.

But enumerated partial sums show about 0.09.

Given this discrepancy, perhaps fib(n+1)/(4^(n+2)) is differently interpreted. Maybe the problem is with the indexing or using fib(n+1) instead of fib(n).

Check with another approach:

Check numerators and denominators listed:

At n=0, term is fib(1)/4^2 = 1/16 = 0.0625

At n=1, term = fib(2)/4^3 = 1/64 ≈ 0.015625

Sum first two = 0.078125 matches.

Sum after 20 terms approximates 0.090909.

0.090909 = 1/11

Therefore sum converges to 1/11.

Check that:

sum = ∑ fib(n+1) / 4^{n+2} = sum_{n=0}^\infty fib(n+1) / 4^{n+2} = (1/16) ∑ fib(n+1) / 4^n

And ∑ fib(n+1) x^n = x / (1 - x - x^2)

So ∑ fib(n+1) (1/4)^n = (1/4) / (1 - 1/4 - 1/16) = (1/4) / (11/16) = 4/11

Therefore total sum = (1/16) * (4/11) = 1/44 ≈ 0.0227

Conflict.

Is the problem indexing fib(n+1) or fib(n+2)?

Check if need to consider fib(n+2):

From generating function: ∑ fib(n) x^n = x / (1 - x - x^2)

Then:

∑ fib(n+1) x^n = (x + x^2) / (1 - x - x^2)

Try that:

At x=1/4

= (1/4 + 1/16) / (1 - 1/4 - 1/16) = (5/16) / (11/16) = 5/11 ≈ 0.454545

Then multiplying by (1/16) for division outside,

Sum = (1/16)*(5/11) = 5/176 ≈ 0.0284 still not matching.

Try fib(n+2):

Sum ∑ fib(n+2) x^n = ?

Shift index again: fib(n+2) = fib(n+1) + fib(n)

So ∑ fib(n+2) x^n = ∑ fib(n+1) x^n + ∑ fib(n) x^n = (x + x^2) / (1 - x - x^2) + x / (1 - x - x^2) = (2x + x^2) / (1 - x - x^2)

At x=1/4:

numerator = 2*(1/4) + 1/16 = 1/2 + 1/16 = 9/16

denominator = 1 - 1/4 - 1/16 = 11/16

ratio = (9/16)/(11/16) = 9/11 ≈ 0.81818

Multiplying by 1/16:

sum = (1/16)*(9/11) = 9/176 ≈ 0.0511 still no good.

Back to the enumerated sums: since partial sums approach nearly 0.090909..., suggest limit is 1/11.

Try verifying that the sum equals 1/11 directly.

hint: since these approximate partial sums approach 0.090909..., the sum is 1/11.

Hence omnimath1508_answer = 1/11

We can write this as rational 1/11 in Lean:

(1 : ℚ) / 11

Therefore final fixed Lean expression is:

(1 : ℚ) / 11
