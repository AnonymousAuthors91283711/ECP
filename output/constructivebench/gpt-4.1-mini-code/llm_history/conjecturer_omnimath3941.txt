The main issue is that in Lean, when defining a set using set-builder notation, we need to use `Set` and write the membership predicate as a lambda function properly. Also, `{2, 3}` is a `Finset`, but membership for natural numbers in `Finset` isn't by default `Set` membership—it needs to be indicated with `∈` for `Finset`. When forming a subset of `ℕ × ℕ`, it's easier to phrase the set comprehensively using a predicate in `Set (ℕ × ℕ)` and use `Finset` membership with `Finset.mem` or the coercion to `Set`.

A clean fix is to use the predicates for `(a, b)` where `a` and `b` are either 2 or 3, expressed as a disjunction of equalities.

Because the enumerated answers are exactly all pairs `(a, b)` with `a, b ∈ {2, 3}`, the set is `{(a,b) | a = 2 ∨ a = 3 ∧ b = 2 ∨ b = 3}`, which simplifies to:
`{(a,b) | (a = 2 ∨ a = 3) ∧ (b = 2 ∨ b = 3)}`

We can write in Lean:

`{p : ℕ × ℕ | (p.fst = 2 ∨ p.fst = 3) ∧ (p.snd = 2 ∨ p.snd = 3)}`

This is a valid `Set (ℕ × ℕ)`.

Hence, the corrected answer is:

<<<{p : ℕ × ℕ | (p.fst = 2 ∨ p.fst = 3) ∧ (p.snd = 2 ∨ p.snd = 3)}>>>
