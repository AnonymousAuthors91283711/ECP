This problem involves finding an integer-coefficient polynomial \(P\) with roots precisely all real numbers \(x\) in the interval \((0,1)\), and its 2022nd coefficient equals some integer \(P2022AIMEII_13_answer\).

To explore such polynomials and the 2022nd coefficient, I will enumerate low-degree polynomials with roots in \((0,1)\) and integer coefficients, or study patterns, possibly starting with products of linear factors \((x - r)\) for rational \(r \in (0,1)\), then identify the coefficient of \(x^{2022}\) when extending to degree 2022.

Because enumerating all degree-2022 polynomials is impossible, I'll sample small degrees \(n\) (up to 6 or 7), build polynomials with roots in \((0,1)\) at rational steps, then print all coefficients and especially the coefficient of \(x^{n}\), representing the "highest order" term (or indexing from 0, the leading coefficient is always 1 in monic polynomials).

This helps to conjecture the form of the coefficient at a given power.

I will:

- For degrees \(n=1\) to 7,
- Choose roots at \(\frac{k}{n+1}\) for \(k=1\) to \(n\) (all in \((0,1)\)),
- Form the monic polynomial \(\prod_{k=1}^n (x - \frac{k}{n+1})\) with rational coefficients,
- Multiply by \((n+1)^n\) to clear denominators and get integer coefficients,
- Print the degree \(n\), polynomial coefficients, and the "middle" coefficient closest to degree 2022 if applicable.

This may reveal patterns about the coefficients of such polynomials, especially the coefficient of \(x^{2022}\) in the original problem.
