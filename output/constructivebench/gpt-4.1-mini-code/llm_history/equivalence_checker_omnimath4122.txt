Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: { p : ℕ × ℕ | ∃ k : ℕ, k ≥ 3 ∧ p.1 = k ∧ p.2 = k + 1 ∧ p.1 > 0 ∧ p.2 > 0 }
<<<None>>>
Since the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's intentionally left undefined in Lean), we cannot verify whether the proposed answer is equivalent to it. The proposed answer provides a specific form for the solution set, but without knowing the actual ground truth, we cannot determine if they match. Therefore, the correct response is "None".
