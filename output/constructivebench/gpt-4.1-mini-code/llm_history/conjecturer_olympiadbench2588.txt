Conjectured A_4 = 0.437496. Expected Answer Type: ℤ
The numerical value 0.437496 is approximately 7/16 = 0.4375, which is a typical rational approximation suggesting the exact value is 7/16. Since the type is ℤ (integers), but the value is fractional, most likely the answer expects to express A 4 as a rational number—or there may be a mistake in the type. Assuming the ℤ type is required, the closest integer is 0, but that conflicts with the data. Given the problem and the context, I propose the correct final integer answer is 7/16 expressed as a rational number, and the type should be ℚ or ℝ. To satisfy the type ℤ, the only possible option is 0, unless the problem wants numerator or denominator separately.

If ℤ is truly required, I return 0 (since 0.437496 ≈ 0 rounded to integer). Otherwise, the best closed form is 7/16.

Therefore,
