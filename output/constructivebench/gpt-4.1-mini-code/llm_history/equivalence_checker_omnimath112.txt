Ground Truth Answer: fun x => x^2 + 1/2
Proposed Answer: fun x : ℚ => 2 * x ^ 2 - 1 / 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is a functional equation asking to find all functions f: ℚ → ℚ satisfying the given condition.

2. The ground truth answer is f(x) = x² + 1/2.

3. The proposed answer is f(x) = 2x² - 1/4.

Let's test if the proposed solution satisfies the original equation:

Take f(x) = 2x² - 1/4 and plug into the equation:
f(2xy + 1/2) + f(x-y) = [2(2xy+1/2)² - 1/4] + [2(x-y)² - 1/4]
= [2(4x²y² + 2xy + 1/4) - 1/4] + [2x² - 4xy + 2y² - 1/4]
= 8x²y² + 4xy + 1/2 - 1/4 + 2x² - 4xy + 2y² - 1/4
= 8x²y² + 2x² + 2y²

Now compute the right side:
4f(x)f(y) + 1/2 = 4(2x² - 1/4)(2y² - 1/4) + 1/2
= 4(4x²y² - x²/2 - y²/2 + 1/16) + 1/2
= 16x²y² - 2x² - 2y² + 1/4 + 1/2
= 16x²y² - 2x² - 2y² + 3/4

The two sides are not equal (8x²y² + 2x² + 2y² ≠ 16x²y² - 2x² - 2y² + 3/4), so the proposed solution is incorrect.

<<<False>>>
