The problem is about counting the number of complex numbers \( z \) with positive imaginary part such that \( f(z) = a + bi \), where \( a, b \) are integers with \( |a|, |b| \leq 10 \), and \( f(z) = z^2 + iz + 1 \). We want to find the size of the set of such \( z \). 

I will enumerate all integer pairs \((a,b)\) with \(|a|,|b|\leq 10\), and for each, solve \(z^2 + i z + 1 = a + i b\), then filter solutions \(z\) with positive imaginary part. We print each valid solution immediately. This approach is brute force but manageable since there are only 441 possibilities for \((a,b)\). We'll use sympy's `solve` for exact solutions.

```python
# Enumerate complex z with positive imaginary part solving z^2 + i z + 1 = a + b i,
# for integers a,b with abs(a),abs(b) <=10. Print each solution immediately.

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, re, im, I, S
a, b = symbols('a b', integer=True)
z = symbols('z')
count = 0

print("Enumerating solutions of f(z) = z^2 + i*z + 1 = a + b i with |a|,|b| â‰¤ 10 and Im(z) > 0")

for A in range(-10,11):
    for B in range(-10,11):
        eq = Eq(z**2 + I*z + 1, A + I*B)
        sols = solve(eq, z)
        for sol in sols:
            # check if imaginary part positive (approximate for efficiency)
            im_val = im(sol).evalf()
            if im_val > 1e-12:
                count += 1
                print(f"a={A}, b={B}, z={sol}")

print(f"Total solutions with Im(z)>0: {count}")
```
