The problem suggests finding all functions f: ℕ → ℕ (nonzero domain) such that for all x ≠ 0, f preserves the number of divisors, and for all x, y ≠ 0 with neither dividing the other, the gcd condition is strict: gcd(f x, f y) > f(gcd(x,y)).

To explore conjectures about such functions, we attempt to enumerate small candidate functions for small inputs, checking the conditions. We must simulate values of f on small natural numbers and verify the two conditions for divisors counts and gcd inequalities.

We will try small functions on values 1 to N (say N=10), enumerating f(x) from 1 to some bound, and check if conditions hold. If they hold for all pairs, print the candidate function (as a list). Then print conjectured special functions or indicate the extremal function among candidates.

Since fully general f is huge, we try functions defined on small domains (1 to 6 or 1 to 8). We prioritize exact checks on divisor counts and gcd tests.

We print each candidate function immediately when found satisfying partial conditions for small samples.

```python
import math

# Count divisors of n
def divisors_count(n):
    cnt = 0
    i = 1
    while i*i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            cnt += 1 if i*i == n else 2
        i += 1
    return cnt

# Compute gcd
def gcd(a,b):
    while b:
        a,b = b,a%b
    return a

# Check conditions for function f on domain 1..N
def check_f(f, N):
    # Condition 1: divisors counts equality for x !=0
    for x in range(1, N+1):
        if divisors_count(x) != divisors_count(f[x]):
            return False
    # Condition 2: for all distinct x,y in domain with neither divides other,
    # gcd(f(x), f(y)) > f(gcd(x,y))
    for x in range(1, N+1):
        for y in range(1, N+1):
            if x != y:
                if not (x % y == 0 or y % x == 0):
                    gx_y = gcd(x,y)
                    left = gcd(f[x], f[y])
                    right = f[gx_y]
                    if left <= right:
                        return False
    return True

def main():
    N = 6  # small domain to keep output and runtime manageable
    max_val = 20  # max f(x) to try

    # We'll try functions f: [1..N] -> [1..max_val]
    # Prioritize: f(1) must have same divisor count as 1 (which is 1), so f(1) = 1 (divisors count=1)
    # Start with fixed f(1)=1 to reduce search space
    from itertools import product

    # We'll print f as tuple of values (f(1),..., f(N))
    # Fix f[1]=1, enumerate f[2..N]
    for values in product(range(1, max_val+1), repeat=N-1):
        f = [0]*(N+1)
        f[1] = 1
        for i in range(2, N+1):
            f[i] = values[i-2]

        if check_f(f, N):
            # Print f as list on domain 1..N
            print("f =", [f[i] for i in range(1, N+1)])
