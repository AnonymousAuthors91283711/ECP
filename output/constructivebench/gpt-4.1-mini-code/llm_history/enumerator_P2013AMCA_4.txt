The problem seems to ask for the simplified exact value of \(\frac{2^{2014} + 2^{2012}}{2^{2014} - 2^{2012}}\).

To assist in conjecturing the exact simplified expression, we'll test smaller analogous expressions for various exponents \(n\) and \(m\) that mimic the pattern \(\frac{2^n + 2^m}{2^n - 2^m}\), with \(n > m\). We'll print these simplified exact fractions and try to deduce the formula.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def simplify_fraction(n, m):
    # Compute numerator and denominator
    numerator = 2**n + 2**m
    denominator = 2**n - 2**m
    
    # Factor out 2^m
    # fraction = (2^{n-m} + 1) / (2^{n-m} - 1)
    # We'll use this simpler form for pattern observation
    a = 2**(n - m)
    frac = Fraction(a + 1, a - 1)
    
    return frac

print("Testing simplified fractions for (n, m) with n > m:")
for diff in range(1, 7):
    n = 10
    m = n - diff
    f = simplify_fraction(n, m)
    print(f"n={n}, m={m}, fraction = (2^{n} + 2^{m})/(2^{n} - 2^{m}) = {f} = {float(f)}")

# Testing the original problem specific case
n = 2014
m = 2012
result = simplify_fraction(n, m)
print(f"\nOriginal problem: (2^{n} + 2^{m})/(2^{n} - 2^{m}) = {result} â‰ˆ {float(result)}")
```
This program tests the pattern for multiple small values, printing exact fractions and decimal approximations, to help conjecture that the expression simplifies to a ratio of integers \(\frac{2^{(n-m)} + 1}{2^{(n-m)} - 1}\). Then it prints the value for the original \((2014, 2012)\) case.
