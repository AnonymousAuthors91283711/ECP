The main issue with the current proposed answer is that omnimath2374_answer is declared as a ℤ (an integer), but the provided answer is a function from ℕ → ℤ. We should give the closed-form answer for a specific input, namely for n = 2012, because the theorem omnimath2374 fixes x 2012 = omnimath2374_answer.

From the enumerated values x(1) to x(20), we see the following pattern, which matches the formula:

x(n) = (n + 3)*2^(n - 2) - n - 1 for n ≥ 1.

To get the answer for x 2012, we just instantiate this formula at n = 2012:

x(2012) = (2012 + 3) * 2^(2012 - 2) - 2012 - 1

= 2015 * 2^2010 - 2013

So omnimath2374_answer : ℤ should be exactly this value.

In Lean, this should be written as that integer (using * and subtraction on ℤ). Note that 2^(2010) will be a large number but Lean can handle that.

Hence, we write:

(2012 + 3) * (2 : ℤ)^(2012 - 2) - 2012 - 1

This fits the expected type ℤ.

<<<(2012 + 3) * (2 : ℤ)^(2012 - 2) - 2012 - 1>>>
