The problem states a system of equations with natural numbers \(a, b, c\):
\[
a + b = 12, \quad a + c = 17, \quad b + c = 19.
\]
We want to find the value of \(b\). Since \(a, b, c\) are natural numbers (nonnegative integers), we can enumerate possible triples \((a,b,c)\) satisfying the equations and print each candidate value for \(b\).

```python
# Enumerate natural numbers a,b,c with a+b=12, a+c=17, b+c=19
# Print each b found quickly, to conjecture the unique solution

for a in range(13):  # since a+b=12, a up to 12
    b = 12 - a
    c = 17 - a
    if b + c == 19 and b >= 0 and c >= 0:
        print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}")
        print(f"Candidate b: {b}")
```
This code will find exactly one triple \((a,b,c)\) and print the value of \(b\).
