The problem involves finding digits A, B, C (each less than 10) such that the sum of the squares of two two-digit numbers A B and A C equals 1313. We want to enumerate all such triples (A, B, C) and print their sums A+B+C. Then conjecture the correct sum.

```python
# Enumerate all digits A,B,C in 0..9 with A*10+B and A*10+C two-digit numbers,
# and check if (A*10 + B)^2 + (A*10 + C)^2 = 1313.
# Print possible sums A+B+C immediately when a solution is found.

def main():
    target = 1313
    for A in range(1,10):  # A can't be 0 for two-digit numbers
        for B in range(0,10):
            ab = 10*A + B
            ab_sq = ab*ab
            # For given A,B find C with (A*10 + C)^2 = target - ab_sq if possible.
            rem = target - ab_sq
            if rem < 0:
                continue
            # C must be digit 0..9 and (A*10 + C)^2 = rem
            # Instead of checking sqrt with float, directly try C
            for C in range(0,10):
                ac = 10*A + C
                if ac*ac == rem:
                    print(f"A={A}, B={B}, C={C}, sum={A+B+C}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
