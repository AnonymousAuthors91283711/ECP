[write_program]
This problem involves checking two statements about integers \( k \) in intervals and their divisibility by primes within certain ranges. We want to verify for given \( n \) whether all integers in \( [n, n+13] \) are divisible by some prime \( p \) in \([2,11]\), and separately whether all integers in \([n, n+20]\) are divisible by some prime \( p \) in \([2, 13]\).

The program will:
- Enumerate candidates \( n \) up to a certain limit.
- For each \( n \), check the divisibility condition over the range.
- Print when such \( n \) is found or disconfirm when none found for a threshold.
- This will help us conjecture the truth of both statements.

```python
# Enumerate n to check intervals [n, n+13] and [n, n+20] for prime divisibility conditions

# We will:
# For the first statement: show no n up to limit satisfies that all k in [n, n+13] divisible by some prime in [2..11].
# For the second statement: show some n exists such that for all k in [n, n+20], divisible by some prime in [2..13].

            for j in range(i*i, hi+1, i):
                sieve[j] = False
    return [p for p in range(lo, hi+1) if sieve[p]]
