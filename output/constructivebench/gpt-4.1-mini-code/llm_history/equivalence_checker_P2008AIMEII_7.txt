Ground Truth Answer: fun r s t => (r + s)^3 + (s + t)^3 + (t + r)^3
Proposed Answer: fun r s t => r * s + s * t + t * r + 8 * (r + s + t) + 200
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem: We have a cubic polynomial p(X) = X³ - 8X² - 200X + 2008 with roots r, s, t. We need to find an expression in terms of r, s, t that equals 753.

Ground Truth Answer: (r+s)³ + (s+t)³ + (t+r)³
Proposed Answer: r*s + s*t + t*r + 8*(r+s+t) + 200

Analysis:
1. From Vieta's formulas for p(X):
   r+s+t = 8
   rs + rt + st = -200
   rst = -2008

2. Ground Truth Answer:
   (r+s)³ = (8-t)³ = 512 - 384t + 48t² - t³
   Similarly for other terms. Summing gives:
   3*512 - 384*8 + 48*(r²+s²+t²) - (r³+s³+t³)
   This can be shown to equal 753 using Vieta's relations.

3. Proposed Answer:
   Using Vieta's:
   rs + rt + st + 8(r+s+t) + 200 = -200 + 8*8 + 200 = -200 + 64 + 200 = 64 ≠ 753

The proposed answer evaluates to 64, not 753, and is therefore incorrect. The expressions are not equivalent.
