The problem indicates there are \(4^8\) total outcomes, and 1225 successful outcomes. The ratio \( \frac{1225}{4^8} \) is the exact probability. The task is to enumerate values related to these numbers, possibly exploring factors or related fractions to conjecture about this ratio.

The Python program will:
- Calculate \(4^8\).
- Calculate the fraction \( \frac{1225}{4^8} \).
- Enumerate divisors of 1225 (to understand its structure).
- Enumerate divisors of \(4^8\).
- Print these enumerations to explore potential simplifications or related factors.

This enumeration helps in conjecturing the exact answer simplification or related properties.

```python
from math import gcd

def divisors(n):
    divs = []
    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5)+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divs.append(i)
            if i != n // i:
                divs.append(n//i)
    return sorted(divs)

def main():
    total_outcomes = 4**8  # 65536
    successful_outcomes = 1225

    print(f"Total outcomes: {total_outcomes}")
    print(f"Successful outcomes: {successful_outcomes}")
    print()

    # Print exact fraction
    print(f"Exact fraction: {successful_outcomes}/{total_outcomes}")

    # Simplify fraction
    common_divisor = gcd(successful_outcomes, total_outcomes)
    simplified_num = successful_outcomes // common_divisor
    simplified_den = total_outcomes // common_divisor
    print(f"Simplified fraction: {simplified_num}/{simplified_den}")

    print()

    # Enumerate divisors of 1225
    print("Divisors of 1225:")
    for d in divisors(successful_outcomes):
        print(d)

    print()

    # Enumerate divisors of total outcomes (65536)
    print("Divisors of 4^8 (65536) (showing multiples of 256 only):")
    # Because 65536 is 2^16, its divisors are powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^16,
    # we print only those divisors which are multiples of 256 (= 2^8) to reduce output
    for e in range(0, 17):
        val = 2**e
        if val % 256 == 0:
            print(val)

    main()
