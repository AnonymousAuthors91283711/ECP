[write_program]
The problem involves comparing two sums: one of even numbers 2(k+1) from k=0 to n-1, and one of odd numbers 2k+1 over the same range. The difference is sought as a function of n.

We will write a Python program that for sample values of n (say n=1 to 10) computes the difference explicitly, printing each value immediately. This helps identify the pattern or closed form.

```python
# Enumerate the difference of sums:
# sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 2*(k+1) - sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (2*k + 1)

def difference(n):
    sum_even = sum(2*(k+1) for k in range(n))
    sum_odd = sum(2*k + 1 for k in range(n))
    diff = sum_even - sum_odd
    print(f"n={n}, sum_even={sum_even}, sum_odd={sum_odd}, difference={diff}")

def main():
    print("Enumerating differences for n=1 to 10:")
    for n in range(1, 11):
        difference(n)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
