[write_program]
The problem is to find all integer functions \(f: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}\) such that for all integers \(x,y,z\) with \(x+y+z=0\), we have
\[
f(x) + f(y) + f(z) = xyz.
\]

To explore possible solutions, I will enumerate candidate functions \(f\) by testing polynomial forms like linear or quadratic polynomials on small integer inputs and checking the condition for triples \((x,y,z)\) with \(x+y+z=0\).

The program will:
- Try functions \(f(n) = a n^2 + b n + c\) for small integer coefficients.
- For each candidate, verify the equation for all triples \(x,y,z\in\{-2,-1,0,1,2\}\) with \(x+y+z=0\).
- Print candidates that satisfy the condition on all tested triples.

This enumeration should help conjecture the structure of all solutions.

```python
# Enumerate polynomial candidates f(n) = a*n^2 + b*n + c on Z to satisfy:
# For all x,y,z with x+y+z=0, f(x)+f(y)+f(z) = x*y*z
# Test on small integers x,y,z in [-2,2] and print valid candidates.

def test_function(a,b,c):
    # f(n) = a*n^2 + b*n + c
    for x in range(-2,3):
        for y in range(-2,3):
            z = -x - y
            if not (-2 <= z <= 2):
                continue
            lhs = (a*x**2 + b*x + c) + (a*y**2 + b*y + c) + (a*z**2 + b*z + c)
            rhs = x*y*z
            if lhs != rhs:
                return False
    return True

print("Testing polynomial functions f(n) = a*n^2 + b*n + c with a,b,c in [-5..5]")
for a in range(-5,6):
    for b in range(-5,6):
        for c in range(-5,6):
            if test_function(a,b,c):
                print(f"Valid f(n) = {a}*n^2 + {b}*n + {c}")

print("Testing completed.")
```
