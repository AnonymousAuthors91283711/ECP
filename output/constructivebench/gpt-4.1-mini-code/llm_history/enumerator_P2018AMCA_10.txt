The problem is about finding the number of elements in the set \( S = \{(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \mid x+y=1 \text{ and } x-y=1\} \). Since these are linear equations, we can solve for \((x,y)\) directly. The Python program below enumerates the solutions by checking values of \(x\) and \(y\) that satisfy both equations and prints the total count of solutions.

```python
# We want to find all real pairs (x, y) satisfying:
# x + y = 1
# x - y = 1
# Solve these equations to find (x, y) pairs exactly.

# Since these are linear, there's either 0, 1, or infinitely many solutions.
# Solve algebraically:
# From x+y=1 and x-y=1,
# Add: 2x = 2 => x =1
# Plug into x+y=1 => 1 + y =1 => y=0

# So exactly one solution: (1, 0)

# But for demonstration, we'll enumerate to verify.

# We'll check pairs (x,y) with x and y from a small set of rational candidates
# to see if they satisfy both equations.

from fractions import Fraction

def check_solution(x, y):
    return (x + y == 1) and (x - y == 1)

# Candidates: fractions with numerator and denominator in small range
nums = range(-5,6)
denoms = range(1,6)

solutions = set()

for nx in nums:
    for dx in denoms:
        x = Fraction(nx, dx)
        # compute y from first equation: y = 1 - x
        y = 1 - x
        if check_solution(x, y):
            solutions.add((x, y))
            print(f"Found solution: x={x}, y={y}")

print(f"Number of solutions found: {len(solutions)}")
```
