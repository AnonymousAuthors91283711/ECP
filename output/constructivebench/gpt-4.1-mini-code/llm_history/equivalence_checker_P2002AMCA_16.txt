Ground Truth Answer: 2/5
Proposed Answer: (105 : ℚ) / (5 * 4 * 10)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. Problem Analysis:
- Tina's set has 5 elements (1-5)
- Sergio's set has 10 elements (1-10)
- We're looking at ordered pairs from Tina's set where a ≠ b, and then combining with Sergio's numbers
- We want the probability that c > a + b

2. Calculations:
- tina_pairs.card = 5 * 4 = 20 (since a ≠ b)
- sergio_set.card = 10
- Total possible combinations = 20 * 10 = 200

3. Ground Truth:
- Probability = 2/5 = 80/200
- So favorable outcomes should be 80

4. Proposed Answer:
- (105 : ℚ) / (5 * 4 * 10) = 105/200
- This suggests 105 favorable outcomes

The proposed answer (105/200) doesn't match the ground truth (80/200). The numerator is incorrect.
