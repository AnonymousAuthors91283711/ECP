The problem involves finding the smallest natural number \( n \) such that when mapping all functions from \(\text{Fin }n \to \text{Fin }6\) to the product \(\prod_i ((d i).\text{val} + 1)\), the cardinality of the image set is 936.

I'll write a Python program that attempts to count the distinct products for increasing values of \( n \) until the cardinality is 936, printing intermediate values and eventual candidates.

```python
import math
from itertools import product

def distinct_products(n):
    # Each d: Fin n -> Fin 6 can be seen as an n-length tuple with entries from 0 to 5.
    # For each such tuple, compute product of (value+1).
    seen = set()
    for tup in product(range(6), repeat=n):
        prod_val = 1
        for x in tup:
            prod_val *= (x + 1)
        seen.add(prod_val)
    return len(seen)

print("Enumerating n and number of distinct products:")

# We'll check n from 1 to 10 to find when the count hits 936 or passes it.
candidates = []
for n in range(1, 11):
    count = distinct_products(n)
    print(f"n = {n}, distinct product count = {count}")
    if count == 936:
        candidates.append(n)

if candidates:
    print("Candidates n with distinct product count 936:", candidates)
    print("Minimum such n:", min(candidates))
else:
    print("No n with distinct product count 936 found for n in 1..10")
```

This program enumerates exact counts for each \( n \), prints the counts, and highlights those \( n \) for which the cardinality is exactly 936. This should assist in conjecturing the minimal such \( n \).
