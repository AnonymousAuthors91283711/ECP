The problem involves finding a permutation `l` of numbers 1 to 9 such that three overlapping segments each of length 4 have equal sums and equal sums of squares. The segments are:
- `l[0:4]`
- `l[3:7]`
- `l[6:9]` concatenated with `l[0:1]` (to always have length 4, as `l[6:9]` is of length 3 and we add one element from start).

We want to find all lists `l` of `[1..9]` satisfying those equalities.

The code enumerates permutations of `[1..9]` and checks the sum and sum of squares conditions of the segments defined. The program prints solutions immediately when found.

```python
from itertools import permutations

# The numbers 1 through 9
nums = list(range(1, 10))

def segment_sums(l):
    s1 = sum(l[0:4])
    s2 = sum(l[3:7])
    s3 = sum(l[6:9] + l[0:1])  # length 4 segment by concatenation
    return s1, s2, s3

def segment_squares_sums(l):
    sq1 = sum(x*x for x in l[0:4])
    sq2 = sum(x*x for x in l[3:7])
    sq3 = sum(x*x for x in l[6:9] + l[0:1])
    return sq1, sq2, sq3

# Enumerate all permutations of 1..9
for p in permutations(nums):
    s1, s2, s3 = segment_sums(p)
    if s1 == s2 == s3:
        sq1, sq2, sq3 = segment_squares_sums(p)
        if sq1 == sq2 == sq3:
            print(list(p))
```
