The problem is to find all complex roots of the polynomial 
\( z^5 - 5z^4 + 11z^3 - 13z^2 + 9z - 3 = 0 \).

We will enumerate roots by:
- Trying to find rational roots among divisors of the constant term (±1, ±3).
- Using numeric root finding for approximate roots.
We print exact rational roots as soon as found.
Then print numeric approximations for the rest.

```python
# Polynomial: z^5 -5 z^4 +11 z^3 -13 z^2 +9 z -3 = 0
# Try rational roots: divisors of ±3 -> ±1, ±3

from sympy import symbols, Poly, Rational, solveset, S
from sympy.polys.polyroots import roots
from sympy import N

z = symbols('z')
p = z**5 - 5*z**4 + 11*z**3 -13*z**2 + 9*z - 3

# 1) Check rational roots by Rational Root Theorem candidates
candidates = [1, -1, 3, -3]
print("Checking rational candidates:")
for r in candidates:
    val = p.subs(z, r)
    if val == 0:
        print(f"Exact root found: {r}")

# 2) Try to find all roots symbolically (roots() returns dict root:multiplicity)
print("\nExact roots from root finder:")
rts = roots(p, multiple=True)
for root in set(rts):
    # Print exact roots
    print(f"Exact root: {root}")

# 3) Numerical approximations for all roots:
print("\nNumerical approximations of roots:")
for root in rts:
    approx = N(root, 15)
    print(f"{approx}")

# This gives exact roots if they are radicals/symbolic, else approximations.
```
