abbrev omnimath298_answer : Set (ℕ × ℕ) := sorry
theorem omnimath298 (x y : ℕ) (hx : 0 < x) (hy : 0 < y) :
    x^y = y^(x - y) ↔ (x, y) ∈ omnimath298_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Solution found: x=8, y=2 because 8^2 = 64 = 2^6
Solution found: x=9, y=3 because 9^3 = 729 = 3^6
. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ)
<<<{(8, 2), (9, 3)}>>>
