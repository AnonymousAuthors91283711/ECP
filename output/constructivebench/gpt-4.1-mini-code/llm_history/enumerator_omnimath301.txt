The problem essentially asks: For sequences (strategy) of length N, with each element a pair (a,b) in ℕ×ℕ, we want to cover all pairs (x,y) with x ≤ 20 and y ≤ 23 uniquely by some element in the sequence that dominates (x,y) (i.e., a ≥ x and b ≥ y), and find the minimal length N for which such a strategy exists.

We will enumerate increasing values of N and try to construct or verify the existence of such a strategy. The coverage constraint means each (x,y) must be uniquely covered by exactly one (a,b) in the strategy.

To keep computations feasible, we test small N values and print strategies found. We generate all possible strategies of length N from pairs within the bounding box (0..20,0..23), then check coverage and uniqueness.

This brute force is very expensive, so we bound candidate pairs to reduce size and limit N. We focus only on covering all 21*24=504 points.

```python
# Enumerate strategies of length N covering all (x,y) with x≤20,y≤23 uniquely
# Print N and strategies found; stop after some N or first found.

from itertools import product, combinations_with_replacement

MAX_X, MAX_Y = 20, 23
POINTS = [(x,y) for x in range(MAX_X+1) for y in range(MAX_Y+1)]

def covers(a,b):
    # Returns set of points dominated by (a,b)
    return [(x,y) for x in range(a+1) for y in range(b+1)]

def dominates(a,b,x,y):
    return a >= x and b >= y

def point_coverage(strategy):
    # Map each point to list of indices of coverage
    coverage = {pt: [] for pt in POINTS}
    for i,(a,b) in enumerate(strategy):
        for pt in POINTS:
            if dominates(a,b,pt[0],pt[1]):
                coverage[pt].append(i)
    return coverage

def is_unique_cover(strategy):
    coverage = point_coverage(strategy)
    # Check each point is covered exactly once
    for cov in coverage.values():
        if len(cov)!=1:
            return False
    return True

def print_strategy(N,strat):
    print(f"Found strategy of length {N}: {strat}")

def main():
    # We try increasing N from 1 up to a small limit due to complexity.
    max_N = 5
    # Candidates pairs limited to bounding box corners to reduce size
    candidates = [(a,b) for a in range(0,MAX_X+1,5) for b in range(0,MAX_Y+1,5)]
    # Add exact max to cover points near corners too
    candidates.append((MAX_X,MAX_Y))
    candidates = list(set(candidates))
    print(f"Candidates pairs (total {len(candidates)}): {candidates}")
    for N in range(1,max_N+1):
        print(f"Trying N={N}")
        # Generate all combinations with replacement of candidate pairs
        # combinations_with_replacement to avoid permutations, reduce count
        combos = combinations_with_replacement(candidates,N)
        for strat in combos:
            if is_unique_cover(strat):
                print_strategy(N,strat)
                # For demonstration only print first found per N
                break
