  let probSameHeads := ∑ k in range 4, (prob k)^2
  let (m, n) := P2010AIMEI_4_answer
  probSameHeads = m / n ∧ m.Coprime n := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating prob(k) and (prob(k))^2 for k=0..3:
k=0, prob=3/28 = 0.107143, prob^2=9/784
k=1, prob=5/14 = 0.357143, prob^2=25/196
k=2, prob=11/28 = 0.392857, prob^2=121/784
k=3, prob=1/7 = 0.142857, prob^2=1/49
Sum of squares = 123/392 = 0.313776
Reduced fraction: m/n = 123/392. Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ
