  a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = olympiadbench3027_answer T := by sorry. Enumerated answers: By Viète's formulas, for any T:
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a+b+c)^2 - 2(ab+bc+ca) = 20^2 - 2*19 = 362

. Expected Answer Type: ℚ → ℚ
<<<fun T : ℚ => 362>>> 
-- Explanation: By Viète's formulas, a²+b²+c² = (a+b+c)² - 2(ab+bc+ca) = 20² - 2*19 = 362, independent of T.
