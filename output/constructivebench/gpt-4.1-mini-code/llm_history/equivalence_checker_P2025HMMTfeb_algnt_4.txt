noncomputable abbrev P2025HMMTfeb_algnt_4_answer : ℤ := sorry
theorem P2025HMMTfeb_algnt_4 :
  (∑ j in (Finset.Icc (-1000 : ℤ) 1000), ⌊(2025 : ℝ) / (j + 0.5)⌋) = P2025HMMTfeb_algnt_4_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: -984
Proposed Answer: 2025 * 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the sum of floor(2025/(j+0.5)) for j from -1000 to 1000.

2. The ground truth answer is -984.

3. The proposed answer is 2025*2 = 4050.

Analysis:
- The proposed answer (4050) is vastly different from the ground truth (-984).
- The sum involves both positive and negative terms due to the range from -1000 to 1000.
- The floor function behavior changes significantly when j is negative versus positive.
- There's no mathematical justification for the proposed answer being simply 2025*2.
- The actual sum should consider the symmetric properties and cancellation effects of the floor function over this range.

Conclusion: The answers are not equivalent.
