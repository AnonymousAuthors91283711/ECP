The problem involves iterating the function \( f(x) = x^3 - 3x \) starting from \( x = \frac{5}{2} \) eight times, then taking the floor of the result, converting that to an integer, finding its positive divisors, and finally counting how many divisors it has.

To assist, the program will:
- Iterate \( f \) 8 times starting at \( 2.5 \),
- Compute the floor of the result,
- Compute all positive divisors of the integer,
- Print the final integer and each divisor as found,
- Print the total count of divisors.

This will confirm the value of `Nat.card (Nat.divisors (...))` in the theorem.

```python
import math

def f(x):
    return x**3 - 3 * x

x = 2.5
print(f"Starting x = {x}")
for i in range(1,9):
    x = f(x)
    print(f"After iteration {i}: {x}")

floor_x = math.floor(x)
print(f"Floor after 8 iterations: {floor_x}")

# Find positive divisors of floor_x
n = floor_x
if n <= 0:
    print(f"Floor value {n} is not positive, no positive divisors.")
else:
    divisors = []
    for d in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n))+1):
        if n % d == 0:
            divisors.append(d)
            if d != n // d:
                divisors.append(n // d)
    divisors.sort()
    print(f"Divisors of {n}:")
    for d in divisors:
        print(d)
    print(f"Number of divisors: {len(divisors)}")
```
