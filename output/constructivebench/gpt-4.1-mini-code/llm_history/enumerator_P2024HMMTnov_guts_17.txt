The problem is counting the number of subsets \( s \subseteq \{0,1,2,3\} \times \{0,1,2,3\} \) such that for every \( (i,j) \in \{0,1,2,3,4\}^2 \), there exists \( (k,l) \in s \) with \( k = i \) or \( k = i-1 \) and \( l = j \) or \( l = j-1 \).

Essentially, each "unit square" in the \(5 \times 5\) grid must be covered by at least one of the "cells" in \(s\) fitting under its corners.

We want to enumerate all such subsets \(s\). The universal set has size \(4 \times 4 = 16\), so brute force over \(2^{16} = 65536\) subsets is feasible.

We'll print each valid subset found along with its size, then print the total count at end.

```python
# Enumerate subsets s of {(k,l) | k,l in [0..3]} such that 
# for all (i,j) in [0..4]^2, there exists (k,l) in s with 
# k = i or i-1 and l = j or j-1, i.e. (k, l) in {i-1, i} x {j-1, j}

from itertools import combinations

# Represent elements as indices 0..15 mapping to (k,l)
points = [(k,l) for k in range(4) for l in range(4)]

def covers(s):
    # For all (i,j) in 0..4
    # check exists (k,l) in s with k in {i,i-1}, l in {j,j-1}
    # with attention to boundaries: i-1 or j-1 might be -1, invalid
    for i in range(5):
        for j in range(5):
            found = False
            candidates_k = set()
            if 0 <= i <= 3:
                candidates_k.add(i)
            if 0 <= i-1 <= 3:
                candidates_k.add(i-1)
            candidates_l = set()
            if 0 <= j <= 3:
                candidates_l.add(j)
            if 0 <= j-1 <= 3:
                candidates_l.add(j-1)
            for (k,l) in s:
                if k in candidates_k and l in candidates_l:
                    found = True
                    break
            if not found:
                return False
    return True

# We'll brute force all subsets of points

count = 0
# To avoid huge output, print only sets of size up to threshold, e.g. 9
threshold = 9

print("Enumerating subsets s with the covering property:")
for size in range(1,17):
    for comb in combinations(points, size):
        s = set(comb)
        if covers(s):
            count += 1
            if size <= threshold:
                print(f"Size {size}: {sorted(s)}")
    # Stop printing after size threshold for brevity
    if size == threshold:
        print(f"Stopped printing sets larger than size {threshold} for brevity.")

print(f"Total valid subsets count: {count}")
```
