Ground Truth Answer: 6 * 5 * 4 * (6 * 5 * 4 / 6)
Proposed Answer: 120
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
We need to count the number of 3-element subsets of Fin 6 × Fin 6 where:
1. All elements have distinct first coordinates
2. All elements have distinct second coordinates

This is equivalent to counting the number of ways to place 3 non-attacking rooks on a 6×6 chessboard.

Ground Truth Answer Analysis:
6 * 5 * 4 * (6 * 5 * 4 / 6) can be simplified as:
- First part (6*5*4): Choose 3 distinct rows (6 choices for first, 5 for second, 4 for third)
- Second part (6*5*4/6): Choose 3 distinct columns, divided by 6 because the order of selection doesn't matter (we're counting combinations, not permutations)
- However, the division by 6 is incorrect here - it should be divided by 6 only if we're counting unordered column selections, but we need ordered column assignments to rows

Proposed Answer Analysis:
120 is the result of 6*5*4 (which would be correct for counting just the row selections or just the column selections), but we need to consider both rows and columns.

The correct answer should be (6*5*4) * (6*5*4) / 6 (if considering unordered column assignments) or (6*5*4) * (6*5*4) (if considering ordered assignments).
