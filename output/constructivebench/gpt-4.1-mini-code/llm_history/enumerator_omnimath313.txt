[write_program]
The problem asks to check if there exists a 3x3 real matrix \( A \) with trace zero such that \( A^2 + A^T = I \), where \( I \) is the identity matrix. To assist in this, the program enumerates matrices with small integer entries (to keep the search space manageable), computes the trace and checks the condition accordingly.

```python
# Enumerate 3x3 integer matrices with entries from -1 to 1 for feasibility
# Check matrices A with trace 0 satisfying A^2 + A^T = I
# Print each found matrix and at the end print a summary of whether any exists

import numpy as np

This enumerator searches over a very small integer range, ensuring output length is limited while giving insight into possible solution existence. Adjusting the search space or precision can help conjecture the problem's result.
