[write_program]
This problem asks to find the number of positive integers k for which there exist positive integers x, y satisfying the system:

1) 9x + 4y = 600  
2) kx - 4y = 24

We want to enumerate all such k > 0 and count how many distinct such k exist.

We can combine the two equations to eliminate y and express k in terms of x. Since x,y > 0 and k > 0 are integers, we want to try values of x that satisfy positivity and integrality for y,k.

I will write a Python program to enumerate possible x,y,k under these constraints and print all such k immediately, then print the count at the end.

```python
# Enumerate all positive integers k such that
# there exist positive integers x,y satisfying:
# 9x +4y = 600
# kx -4y = 24

def main():
    solutions = set()
    # From first eq: 4y = 600 -9x => y = (600 -9x)/4 must be positive integer
    # From second eq: kx = 24 +4y => k = (24 +4y)/x must be positive integer
    for x in range(1, 600//9 + 1):
        numerator_y = 600 - 9*x
        if numerator_y <= 0:
            continue
        if numerator_y % 4 != 0:
            continue
        y = numerator_y // 4
        if y <= 0:
            continue
        numerator_k = 24 + 4*y
        if numerator_k % x != 0:
            continue
        k = numerator_k // x
        if k > 0:
            print(f"k={k}, x={x}, y={y}")
            solutions.add(k)
    print(f"Total distinct k: {len(solutions)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
