The problem deals with characterizing all functions \(f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}\) satisfying Cauchy's functional equation \(f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)\) for all real numbers \(x,y\).

A well-known result is that all solutions are additive functions, and the standard continuous solutions are linear functions \(f(x)=cx\), but without continuity or other regularity conditions, pathological solutions exist.

To assist in conjecturing the set of solutions, I will write Python code to enumerate some simple candidate functions and test the functional equation on sampled points.

Because functional equations on \(\mathbb{R}\) cannot be exhaustively tested, the code will test candidate functions drawn from common function families like linear, zero function, and piecewise definitions over rationals.

The code will:
- test linear functions \(f(x) = cx\) for integer \(c\) in a range,
- test the zero function,
- test a few nonlinear candidates (like quadratic, absolute value).

It will output those satisfying the functional equation at sample points (with exact equality).

```python
import math

# Candidate functions to test
def zero(x): return 0
def linear(c):
    return lambda x: c * x
def quadratic(x): return x**2
def absolute(x): return abs(x)

# Sample points in rational form for testing (to catch violations)
sample_points = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]

# Check if f(x+y) == f(x) + f(y) exactly for all sample x,y
def check_cauchy(f):
    for x in sample_points:
        for y in sample_points:
            lhs = f(x + y)
            rhs = f(x) + f(y)
            if lhs != rhs:
                return False
    return True

print("Testing zero function:")
if check_cauchy(zero):
    print("f(x)=0 satisfies Cauchy functional eq.")

print("Testing linear functions f(x)=c*x for c=-3..3:")
for c in range(-3, 4):
    f = linear(c)
    if check_cauchy(f):
        print(f"f(x) = {c}*x satisfies Cauchy functional eq.")

print("Testing quadratic function f(x)=x^2:")
if check_cauchy(quadratic):
    print("f(x)=x^2 satisfies Cauchy functional eq.")
else:
    print("f(x)=x^2 does NOT satisfy Cauchy functional eq.")

print("Testing absolute value function f(x)=|x|:")
if check_cauchy(absolute):
    print("f(x)=|x| satisfies Cauchy functional eq.")
else:
    print("f(x)=|x| does NOT satisfy Cauchy functional eq.")
```
