The problem appears to be: For each natural number \( k \), does there exist a sequence \( d : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \) such that

\[
8 \times \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} 8 \times 10^i = \sum_{i=0}^k d_i 10^i \quad \text{and} \quad \sum_{i=0}^k d_i = 1000?
\]

The question is to find all \( k \) for which such a \( d \) exists and, presumably, find the \( k \) where this equivalence holds.

We want to test small values of \( k \), compute \( 8 \times \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} 8 \times 10^i \), then try to find digits \( d_i \) with sum 1000 that form the same number as a base-10 expansion.

We can do as follows:

- For each \( k \), compute the target number \( N = 8 \times \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} 8 \times 10^i \).
- Try to find a digit vector \( d \) of length \( k+1 \) so that:
    - \( N = \sum_{i=0}^k d_i 10^i \),
    - \( d_i \in \mathbb{N} \) (digits, presumably 0 to 9),
    - and \( \sum d_i = 1000 \).

- Since digits can't exceed 9 in decimal representation, if any \( d_i > 9 \), it's not a valid digit sequence. But since the condition only says \( d : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \), maybe \( d_i \) are not necessarily digits 0-9, i.e., this might be a base-10 representation allowing digits > 9. 
- But in standard decimal, digits are 0-9. The problem might be counting digits allowing values beyond 9 â€” effectively writing the number in a "digits" vector with digits possibly greater than 9.

Given that, then the problem reduces to: can the number \( N \) be broken into digits \( d_i \), each a non-negative integer (not restricted to less than 10), so that their sum is 1000?

Since \( d_i \) can be any natural number (without upper bound), the problem reduces to:

- Does there exist a vector \( (d_0, ..., d_k) \) with \( d_i \in \mathbb{N} \) such that the sum of digits times their place values equals \( N \), and the sum of the digits equals 1000?

The value \( N \) is:

\[
N = 8 \times \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} 8 \times 10^i = 8 \times 8 \times \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} 10^i = 64 \times \frac{10^k - 1}{9}
\]

So \( N = \frac{64}{9} (10^k - 1) \), which is an integer only if \( 9 \mid 64 \times (10^k - 1) \) but since 9 divides \( 10^k - 1 \), \( N \) is integer.

We want to check values of \( k \) for which there is a sequence \( d \) of length \( k+1 \) with \( \sum d_i = 1000 \) and \( \sum d_i 10^i = N \).

Given digits \( d_i \) allowed to be any natural number (digits can exceed 9), this reduces to expressing \( N \) in base 10 with digits possibly large, such that the digit sum equals 1000.

So we can proceed by:

- For increasing \( k \), find the unique base-10 expansion of \( N \), but with digits possibly greater than 9.
- Then compute the sum of these "digits".
- If the sum equals 1000, we print k and the digit sequence.

But the digits here are just \( d_i = \) coefficient of \( 10^i \) in \( N \), which literally is the base-10 representation but with digits possibly larger than 9, if you simply divide recursively by 10.

But if we do normal division by 10, digits must be 0-9, so that gives standard base-10 with digits <10. But if digits can be \( \geq 0 \), we can just choose digits \( d_0, ..., d_k \) satisfying:

\[
\sum_{i=0}^k d_i 10^i = N
\]

with \( d_i \in \mathbb{N} \), sum \( d_i = 1000 \). Since standard decimal digits sum to sum of digits, but here digits can be more than 9, the digit sum is the sum of the coefficients.

So it is a standard "digits" sum on a "digits" vector that could be any natural numbers (not restricted to 0-9).

Thus, we want to find \( d_i \geq 0 \) such that

\[
N = \sum_{i=0}^k d_i 10^i, \quad \sum d_i = 1000
\]

with \( d_i \in \mathbb{N} \), \( i=0,...,k \).

Is it always possible? No, because if \( N \) is fixed and digits unrestricted, the sum of digits can be any number between the minimal sum (if all digits zero except one equals N) and maximal sum (?). But since digits are unrestricted, the sum of digits can be arbitrarily adjusted except restricted by the value of \( N \).

Actually, given \( N \), number of digits = \( k+1 \),

The minimum sum of digits is if all digits zero except highest digit representing \( N \) (or first non-zero digit), sum equals \( N \) (if single digit \( N \)).

The maximum is if digits sum is huge with digits big, but the sum digit sum can't be arbitrarily large unless \( N \) is large.

In problem, \( \sum d_i = 1000 \).

Given that, is this always possible for any \( k \)? Maybe only for particular \( k \).

Hence, we can test for small \( k \):

- For each \( k \), compute \( N = 64 \times \frac{10^k - 1}{9} \)
- Try to solve for digits \( d_i \geq 0 \) satisfying sum of digits = 1000 and sum \( d_i 10^i = N \).

Because this is a linear Diophantine problem, we can try to solve it as:

Given \( N \), find \( d_0,...,d_k \geq 0 \) such that:

\[
\sum_{i=0}^k d_i 10^i = N, \quad \sum_{i=0}^k d_i = 1000
\]

This is a system of two equations with \( k+1 \) variables.

Rearranged, we can write:

\[
\sum_{i=0}^k d_i 10^i = N \implies \sum_{i=0}^k d_i (10^i - 1) = N - 1000
\]

Because subtract \( \sum d_i \) from both sides:

\[
\sum d_i 10^i - \sum d_i = N - 1000 \implies \sum d_i (10^i - 1) = N - 1000
\]

Now, \( d_i \geq 0 \), \( d_i \in \mathbb{N} \).

We can try brute force for small \( k \), e.g. \( k \leq 6 \).

For larger \( k \), this is difficult.

Hence, we proceed with an enumerator code:

- For \( k=1 \) to 6
- Compute \( N \)
- Try to solve \(\sum d_i (10^i -1) = N - 1000 \) with \( d_i \geq 0 \) and \( \sum d_i = 1000 \).

We use a backtracking approach or integer partition with constraints.

We must print, per problem requirements, parameters tested and partial solutions.

Let's do that.

```python
# Enumerator for the problem:
# For k in small range, find d_i >=0 with sum d_i=1000 satisfying
# sum d_i 10^i = 64*(10^k -1)/9
# Equivalent to sum d_i (10^i -1) = N-1000

def main():
    from math import prod
    
    max_k = 6  # small k limit for feasibility
    
    for k in range(1, max_k + 1):
        # Compute N
        N = 64 * (10**k - 1) // 9
        target = N - 1000
        bases = [10**i - 1 for i in range(k+1)]
        
        print(f"Testing k={k}, N={N}, target = {target}, bases={bases}")
        
        # We want d_i >=0, sum d_i=1000, sum d_i * bases[i] = target
        
        # Use recursive search with pruning:
        # To improve speed, fix d_k last digit from remaining sum digits
        # Given sum d_i =1000, for i=0..k-1, for each d_i, 
        # d_k = 1000 - sum d_i
        
        solutions = []
        
        def backtrack(i, sum_d, sum_val, digits):
            if i == k:
                d_k = 1000 - sum_d
                if d_k < 0:
                    return
                total = sum_val + d_k * bases[i]
                if total == target:
                    digits.append(d_k)
                    print(f"Found d for k={k}: {digits}")
                    digits.pop()
                    solutions.append(list(digits) + [d_k])
                return
            # d_i can be from 0 to 1000 - sum_d
            # Also prune if total sum_val exceeds target or can't reach target
            max_d = 1000 - sum_d
            for d in range(max_d +1):
                new_sum_val = sum_val + d * bases[i]
                # Prune: minimal possible sum if all remaining digits zero
                min_remain = 0
                # maximal possible sum if all remaining digits max
                max_remain = max_d * max(bases[i+1:] + [0])
                if new_sum_val + min_remain > target:
                    break
                if new_sum_val + max_remain < target:
                    continue
                digits.append(d)
                backtrack(i+1, sum_d + d, new_sum_val, digits)
                digits.pop()
        
        backtrack(0, 0, 0, [])
        
        if solutions:
            print(f"Solutions found for k={k}:")
            for sol in solutions:
                print(sol)
        else:
            print(f"No solution for k={k}")
        
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code tries all \( k=1..6 \), searching for \( d_i \geq 0 \), \( \sum d_i=1000 \), and the linear equation holds.

The output prints each found sequence immediately.

This should shed light on the answer \( P2014AMCA_{16\_answer} \).
