The problem counts numbers from 0 to 2024 whose remainder mod 5 is either 0 or 2.
We enumerate numbers n in [0..2024) with n % 5 == 0 or 2, print them as we find, and count the total.
The code prints all such numbers and the final count.

```python
# Enumerate numbers n in [0..2024) where n % 5 == 0 or 2, print all and count total

def main():
    count = 0
    print("Candidates n with n % 5 == 0 or 2, n in [0..2024):")
    for n in range(2025):
        r = n % 5
        if r == 0 or r == 2:
            print(n)
            count += 1
    print("Total count:", count)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
