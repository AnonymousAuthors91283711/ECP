<<<(2006 / 2 + 1) * (2006 + 1)>>>

Explanation: Since a + b + c = 2006 and (b + c) is even, b + c ranges over even numbers from 0 to 2006. For each fixed b+c = m (even), a = 2006 - m, and (b, c) are nonnegative with b + c = m; there are m+1 solutions. Thus total count: sum over even m ≤ 2006 of (m+1) = (number of even m) * (average of m+1) = 1004 * 2007 = (2006/2 + 1)*(2006 + 1).
