The problem involves finding a natural number \( n \) (denoted as `P2017AMCB_1_answer`) such that:
\[ 10 + 6n = 2 (30 + 2n) \]
and for all \( m < n \):
\[ 10 + 6m < 2 (30 + 2m) \]

We want to find all natural numbers \( n \) satisfying the equation exactly, then verify the inequality holds for all smaller values.

The Python program below:
- Enumerates integers \( n \) from 0 up to a small threshold.
- Prints \( n \) if it satisfies the equation exactly.
- Verifies the inequality for all \( m < n \).
- Prints the valid \( n \) and finally identifies the minimal such \( n \).

```python
# Enumerate natural numbers n to satisfy:
# 10 + 6n = 2 (30 + 2n)
# and for all m < n: 10 + 6m < 2 (30 + 2m)

def lhs(x): return 10 + 6*x
def rhs(x): return 2 * (30 + 2*x)

max_n = 100  # small threshold

candidates = []

for n in range(max_n):
    if lhs(n) == rhs(n):
        # verify inequality for all m < n
        if all(lhs(m) < rhs(m) for m in range(n)):
            print(f"Candidate n = {n} satisfies the equality and inequalities.")
            candidates.append(n)

if candidates:
    answer = min(candidates)
    print(f"The minimal n satisfying the conditions is {answer}.")
else:
    print("No n up to", max_n, "satisfies the conditions.")
```
