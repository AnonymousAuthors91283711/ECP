The problem is to find all pairs of positive integers \((n,m)\) such that \(n^2 + m^2 = 9364\). We will enumerate pairs with \(n, m > 0\), \(n \le m\) to avoid duplicates, and print each pair satisfying the equation.

```python
import math

target = 9364
max_n = int(math.isqrt(target))
print(f"Enumerating pairs (n,m) with n^2 + m^2 = {target}, n,m > 0:")

for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
    n_sq = n * n
    m_sq = target - n_sq
    if m_sq <= 0:
        continue
    m = int(math.isqrt(m_sq))
    if m * m == m_sq and m > 0 and n <= m:
        print(f"(n,m) = ({n},{m})")
```
