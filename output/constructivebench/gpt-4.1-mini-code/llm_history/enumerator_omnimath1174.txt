The problem models a process moving along positions with coins showing true (heads) or false (tails) or none, updating states according to rules. We want to find the smallest number n of steps such that after n steps, the tailsCount reaches 20.

We'll simulate the step process starting from the initial state, track tailsCount, and print all step counts when tailsCount first reaches values from 1 to 20, focusing especially on 20 as requested.

```python
# Simulate the coin flipping process until tailsCount reaches 20

class State:
    def __init__(self, pos=0, dir=1, coins=None, steps=0, tailsCount=0):
        self.pos = pos
        self.dir = dir
        self.coins = dict() if coins is None else coins.copy()
        self.steps = steps
        self.tailsCount = tailsCount

def step(s):
    c = s.coins.get(s.pos, None)
    new_coins = s.coins.copy()
    if c is True:
        # coin is true -> flip to false, reverse direction, tailsCount +1
        new_coins[s.pos] = False
        new_s = State(
            pos = s.pos + s.dir,
            dir = -s.dir,
            coins = new_coins,
            steps = s.steps + 1,
            tailsCount = s.tailsCount + 1
        )
    elif c is False:
        # coin is false -> remove coin, same direction, tailsCount -1
        new_coins.pop(s.pos)
        new_s = State(
            pos = s.pos + s.dir,
            dir = s.dir,
            coins = new_coins,
            steps = s.steps + 1,
            tailsCount = s.tailsCount - 1
        )
    else: # c is None
        # no coin -> place true, same direction, tailsCount unchanged
        new_coins[s.pos] = True
        new_s = State(
            pos = s.pos + s.dir,
            dir = s.dir,
            coins = new_coins,
            steps = s.steps + 1,
            tailsCount = s.tailsCount
        )
    return new_s

def main():
    s = State()
    found = dict()  # tailsCount -> step count when first reached
    # Since tailsCount can vary, run until tailsCount=20 or steps limit
    while s.steps < 10**6:
        if s.tailsCount > 0 and s.tailsCount not in found:
            found[s.tailsCount] = s.steps
            print(f"tailsCount={s.tailsCount} first at step={s.steps}")
            if s.tailsCount == 20:
                print(f"Minimum steps to reach tailsCount=20: {s.steps}")
                break
        s = step(s)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
