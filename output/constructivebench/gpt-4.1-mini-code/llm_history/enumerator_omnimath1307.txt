[write_program]
The given problem involves evaluating a large modular arithmetic expression with big numbers. To assist in conjecturing and possibly proving the answer, we can write a Python program that efficiently performs the modulo operation and prints the result immediately.

```python
# Enumerate the modulo of a large number by another large number.

def main():
    # Define numerator and denominator as given
    numerator = 10002000400080016003200640128025605121024204840968192
    denominator = 100020004000800160032

    # Compute and print the modulo directly
    residue = numerator % denominator
    print("Modulo result:", residue)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
