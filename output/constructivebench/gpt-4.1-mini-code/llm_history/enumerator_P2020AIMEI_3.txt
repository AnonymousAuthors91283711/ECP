The problem is to find the least natural number \(N\) such that:
- \(N = a \times 11^2 + b \times 11 + c\) where \(a,b,c < 11\),
- and \(N = 1 \times 8^3 + b \times 8^2 + c \times 8 + a\) where \(a,b,c < 8\).

We enumerate all digits \(a,b,c\) with their respective constraints and print all found solutions immediately.

```python
# Enumerate digits a,b,c with the given constraints to find N satisfying:
# N = a*11^2 + b*11 + c = 1*8^3 + b*8^2 + c*8 + a
# with a,b,c < 8 and < 11 as per conditions.
# Print all solutions as found for conjecturing the least such N.

def main():
    for a in range(8):  # a < 8 (digits must fit base 8)
        for b in range(8):
            for c in range(8):
                # Compute N in base 11
                N_base11 = a*11**2 + b*11 + c
                # Compute N in base 8 with leading digit 1
                N_base8 = 1*8**3 + b*8**2 + c*8 + a
                if N_base11 == N_base8:
                    print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c} => N={N_base11}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
