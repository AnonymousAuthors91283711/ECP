theorem omnimath3550
(P : ℤ → Polynomial ℤ)
(hP : P = fun m : ℤ => (Polynomial.X)^4 - (Polynomial.C (2*m + 4))*(Polynomial.X)^2 + Polynomial.C ((m - 2)^2))
: {m : ℤ | ∃ A B : Polynomial ℤ, A ≠ 0 ∧ B ≠ 0 ∧ P m = A * B} = omnimath3550_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating m in [-20,20] with factorizable P(m):
m=0: P(x) factors as (x^2 + 0 x + -2)(x^2 + 0 x + -2)
m=1: P(x) factors as (x^2 + -2 x + -1)(x^2 + 2 x + -1)
m=4: P(x) factors as (x^2 + -4 x + 2)(x^2 + 4 x + 2)
m=8: P(x) factors as (x^2 + 0 x + -2)(x^2 + 0 x + -18)
m=9: P(x) factors as (x^2 + -6 x + 7)(x^2 + 6 x + 7)
m=16: P(x) factors as (x^2 + -8 x + 14)(x^2 + 8 x + 14)
m=18: P(x) factors as (x^2 + 0 x + -8)(x^2 + 0 x + -32)
Values of m found: [0, 1, 4, 8, 9, 16, 18]
Minimum m = 0
Maximum m = 18. Expected Answer Type: Set ℤ
<<<{m : ℤ | ∃ k : ℤ, m = k^2 ∨ m = 2*k^2}>>>
