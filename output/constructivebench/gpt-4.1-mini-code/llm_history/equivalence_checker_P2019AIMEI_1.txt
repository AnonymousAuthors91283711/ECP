Ground Truth Answer: fun N => (digits 10 N).sum
Proposed Answer: fun N => Nat.digits 10 N |>.sum
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. Both expressions:
1. Take a natural number N as input
2. Convert it to its digits in base 10 (using `Nat.digits 10 N` or `digits 10 N` - these are the same function)
3. Sum those digits (using `.sum` or `|>.sum` - these are just different syntax for the same operation)
The pipe operator `|>` in the proposed answer is just a different way to write function application, and `Nat.digits` is the fully qualified name of the same `digits` function used in the ground truth.
