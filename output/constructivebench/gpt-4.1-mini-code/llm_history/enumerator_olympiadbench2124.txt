The problem asks for the largest natural number \( n \) for which there exists a configuration of \( n \) boxes (subsets of \(\mathbb{R}^2\)) indexed by \(\{0, \ldots, n-1\}\) where each box intersects exactly with its immediate neighbors modulo \( n \) (no others), and the intersection pattern holds if and only if \( n > 2 \).

We want to enumerate candidate values for \( n \), checking the property for small \( n \). To assist in conjecturing the maximal \( n \), we'll:

- Try \( n = 3 \) up to some small threshold (like 10).
- For each \( n \), attempt an explicit construction or at least produce a witness or counterexample that satisfies or violates the adjacency condition. 
- Here, we will try to mimic the problem constraints by building finite sets of 2D boxes and checking intersections of their boundaries.

Since exact verification of sets intersection is complex, we will represent boxes as intervals in 2D (rectangles), set adjacency, and check if the intersection pattern matches the problem condition.

```python
import itertools

# We'll model each box as a rectangle (defined by x and y intervals).
# To satisfy adjacency: box i intersects only boxes i-1 and i+1 mod n.
# For each candidate n, try to construct such boxes.
# Strategy: arrange boxes in a circle so that each box overlaps only neighbors.

def intervals_overlap(a, b):
    # a,b are (start,end) intervals on real line
    return max(a[0], b[0]) < min(a[1], b[1])

def boxes_intersect(box1, box2):
    # box1 and box2 = ((x0,x1),(y0,y1))
    return intervals_overlap(box1[0], box2[0]) and intervals_overlap(box1[1], box2[1])

def construct_boxes(n):
    # Construct n rectangles in a ring so box i intersects only neighbors.
    # For each box i, position them evenly on a circle with radius 1.
    # Each box is a small square around point p_i.
    from math import cos, sin, pi
    radius = 10
    size = 6 if n<=10 else 3  # size controlling box side length
    
    centers = [(radius*cos(2*pi*i/n), radius*sin(2*pi*i/n)) for i in range(n)]
    boxes = []
    for (cx,cy) in centers:
        boxes.append( ((cx-size, cx+size), (cy-size, cy+size)) )
    return boxes

def check_adjacency(n, boxes):
    # Verify condition:
    # Boxes i and j intersect iff j in {i-1 mod n, i+1 mod n} and n>2
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            intersect = boxes_intersect(boxes[i], boxes[j])
            neighbors = (j == (i+1)%n or j == (i-1)%n) and n>2
            if intersect != neighbors:
                return False
    return True

def main():
    # We check n from 3 up to 10 to find feasible n.
    # We print each n and verdict immediately.
    max_n = 10
    for n in range(3, max_n+1):
        boxes = construct_boxes(n)
        is_ok = check_adjacency(n, boxes)
        print(f"n={n}, configuration satisfies adjacency: {is_ok}")
        if is_ok:
            # print candidate solution details
            print(f"Candidate solution for n={n}: boxes at circle points with size ~6")
    # The problem claims largest n with property. Based on geometry,
    # likely maximal n is number that can be arranged with neighbor-only overlap.
    # From printing, user can conjecture max n.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This program attempts to enumerate and verify configurations for \( n=3 \) to \( 10 \), printing whether the adjacency condition holds immediately. It aids in discovering the maximal \( n \) satisfying the problem.
