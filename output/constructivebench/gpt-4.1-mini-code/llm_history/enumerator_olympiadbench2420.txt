The problem suggests finding real numbers \(a, h, k\) satisfying an identity for all real \(x\):
\[ a(x-2)(x+4) = 2(x - h)^2 + k. \]

We want to enumerate possible triples \((a,h,k)\) that satisfy the equation for many sampled \(x\) values, then derive the exact tuple.

We'll discretize \(a, h, k\) from simple rational approximations and verify the equality for several \(x\). When equality holds exactly for multiple \(x\), we print the candidate. This enumeration should hint at the true solution.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Check equality of two quadratic polynomials by testing exact coefficient comparison
# a*(x-2)*(x+4) = a*(x^2 + 2x -8)
# RHS: 2*(x - h)^2 + k = 2*(x^2 - 2hx + h^2) + k = 2x^2 -4hx + 2h^2 + k
# Equate coefficients: 
# a = 2 
# 2a = -4h  => h = -a/2 = -1 if a=2
# -8a = 2h^2 + k => k = -8a - 2h^2

# We'll enumerate candidate a from rationals near 2, h from rationals near -1, k from rationals near -18 to verify


def main():
    # Generate fractions around expected values using denominator 1 or 2 for simplicity
    candidates_a = [Fraction(n, d) for n in range(1, 5) for d in [1,2] if 1 <= n/d <=3]
    candidates_h = [Fraction(n, d) for n in range(-4, 3) for d in [1,2] if -2 <= n/d <=0]
    candidates_k = [Fraction(n, d) for n in range(-40, -10) for d in [1,2] if -20 <= n/d <= -10]

    # To verify identity holds for all x, check equality of coefficients:
    # a = 2 (coefficient of x^2)
    # 2a = -4h => h = -a/2
    # -8a = 2h^2 + k => k = -8a - 2h^2

    # We'll still check for candidates close by testing the polynomial at several x

    test_xs = [-1, 0, 1, 3]

    found = set()

    for a in candidates_a:
        # target h by formula
        h_expected = -a / 2
        # target k by formula
        k_expected = -8 * a - 2 * h_expected * h_expected
        # check whether h_expected and k_expected are close to candidates in h and k
        # But let's check the original polynomial equality directly:
        # We'll check for (a,h,k) = (a,h_expected,k_expected)

        # verify for all test_xs
        equal = True
        for x in test_xs:
            lhs = a * (x - 2) * (x + 4)
            rhs = 2 * (x - h_expected) ** 2 + k_expected
            if lhs != rhs:
                equal = False
                break
        if equal:
            triple = (float(a), float(h_expected), float(k_expected))
            if triple not in found:
                found.add(triple)
                print(f"a={a}, h={h_expected}, k={k_expected}")

    # Print minimal candidate according to problem statement (a,h,k)
    if found:
        min_trip = min(found)
        print("Extremal candidate tuple:", min_trip)
