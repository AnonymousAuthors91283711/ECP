The problem involves real numbers x, y with x, y > 0 satisfying the linear constraint x + y = 5(x - y), and we want to explore the expression P2015AMCA_4_answer(x, y) that should equal 3/2. Since the problem statement doesn't specify the formula of P2015AMCA_4_answer, we will investigate candidate expressions involving x and y, guided by the constraint, to find possible values this expression can take.

We will:
- Enumerate rational positive pairs (x, y) satisfying the linear constraint up to some small denominators.
- For such pairs, test candidate expressions such as x/y, (x + y)/x, (x - y)/y, etc.
- Print the values found immediately.
- At the end, print the fixed answer 3/2 as conjectured.

This might help conjecture the formula or verify the constant value.

```python
# Enumerate positive rational pairs (x, y) with small denominator satisfying x + y = 5(x - y)
# i.e. y = (4/6) x = 2/3 x from the rearrangement:
# x + y = 5(x - y) => x + y = 5x - 5y => x + y - 5x + 5y = 0 => -4x + 6y = 0 => 6y = 4x => y = 2x/3

# We'll try x = i/6 for i=1..10 and set y=2x/3, then print expressions.

from fractions import Fraction

print("Enumerating pairs (x,y) satisfying x + y = 5(x - y) with x,y > 0:")
for i in range(1, 11):
    x = Fraction(i, 6)  # x = i/6
    y = (2 * x) / 3     # from derived formula y = 2x/3
    # Check positivity (should hold by construction)
    if x > 0 and y > 0:
        # Calculate some candidate expressions:
        vals = {
            'x': x,
            'y': y,
            'x+y': x + y,
            'x - y': x - y,
            'x / y': x / y,
            '(x + y)/x': (x + y) / x,
            '(x - y)/y': (x - y) / y,
            '5*(x - y)/(x + y)': 5 * (x - y) / (x + y),
        }
        # Print values
        print(f"x={x} y={y}")
        for k, v in vals.items():
            print(f"  {k} = {v}")
        print()

print("Conjectured answer: 3/2")
```
