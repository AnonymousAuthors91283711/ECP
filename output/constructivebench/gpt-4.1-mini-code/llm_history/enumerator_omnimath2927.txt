The given expression is a decimal expansion: \(4 + \frac{3}{10} + \frac{9}{1000} = 4.309\). To assist in conjecturing or verifying the exact value or its properties, we'll enumerate the decimal expansion as a sum of fractions with powers of 10 as denominators.

```python
# Enumerate possible sums of fractions with denominators as powers of 10
# equal to the given decimal 4.309

target = 4 + 3/10 + 9/1000  # 4.309 exactly
print(f"Target decimal value: {target}")

# Since target is exact, print the representation as sum of fractions:
print("Exact sum components found:")
a0 = 4
a1 = 3/10
a2 = 9/1000
print(f"{a0} + {a1} + {a2} = {a0 + a1 + a2}")

# Also enumerate partial sums for understanding:
for i in range(4):
    if i == 0:
        val = a0
    elif i == 1:
        val = a0 + a1
    elif i == 2:
        val = a0 + a1 + a2
    else:
        val = target
    print(f"Partial sum after {i} terms: {val}")
```
