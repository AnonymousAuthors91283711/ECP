The problem asks to find all positive integers \( n \) such that there exist nontrivial invertible \( n \times n \) real matrices \( A, B \) satisfying the commutator-like equation  
\[ A B - B A = B^2 A . \]

This is a challenging algebraic problem involving matrix equations and invertibility constraints. Since a direct symbolic approach is difficult here, we will enumerate small dimensions \( n \) (starting from 1 to a small upper bound) and spend effort searching for any pair of invertible matrices \( A, B \) with entries from some small integer range that satisfy the equation up to some numerical tolerance.

We adopt the following approach:  
- Loop \( n \) from 1 to 4 (small dimensions since the problem is hard).  
- Enumerate invertible matrices \( A \) and \( B \) with small integers (e.g., entries in \{-1,0,1\}).  
- Check if the relation \( AB - BA = B^2 A \) holds numerically within a tolerance.  
- Immediately print \( n \) if such matrices are found.  
- We only enumerate some matrices, not all to limit output and runtime.  
- This helps conjecture likely answers.

```python
import numpy as np
from itertools import product

def is_invertible(M):
    return abs(np.linalg.det(M)) > 1e-6

def matrices(n, values):
    # Generate some matrices with entries in values (not all for speed)
    # For each row, pick entries from values, but limit total generated matrices
    # We'll generate random samples instead all product (since 3^(n^2) grows fast)
    # For small n, enumerate all, else random samples
    if n*n <= 4:
        for entries in product(values, repeat=n*n):
            yield np.array(entries, dtype=float).reshape((n,n))
    else:
        # Generate fixed number of random samples
        for _ in range(1000):
            M = np.random.choice(values, size=(n,n)).astype(float)
            yield M

def check_relation(A, B):
    # Check if AB - BA = B^2 A approximately
    lhs = A @ B - B @ A
    rhs = B @ B @ A
    return np.allclose(lhs, rhs, atol=1e-6)

        found = False
        count = 0
        for A in matrices(n, values):
            if not is_invertible(A):
                continue

                if check_relation(A,B):
                    print(f"Found n={n} with matrices A and B satisfying relation")
                    found = True
                    break
            if found:
                break
        if found:
            print(f"n={n} is a candidate dimension")
        else:
