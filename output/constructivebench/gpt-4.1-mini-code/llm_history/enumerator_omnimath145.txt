The problem involves identifying the greatest natural number \( n \) for which there exists a function \( \text{answers} : \text{Fin } 16 \to \text{Fin } n \to \text{Fin } 4 \) satisfying the condition that for any two distinct \( s_1, s_2 \in \text{Fin } 16 \), the number of positions \( p \in \text{Fin } n \) where \( \text{answers}(s_1, p) = \text{answers}(s_2, p) \) is at most 1.

This can be interpreted as: for 16 different sequences (indexed by \( s \in \text{Fin } 16 \)) of length \( n \) over an alphabet of size 4, any two distinct sequences share at most one position with the same letter.

Our goal is to enumerate possible \( n \) and attempt to construct or rule out such families of sequences, printing out constructions or signaling when the condition fails. We will try increasing values of \( n \), build candidate sequences, and check the intersection property.

To keep computation feasible, we'll focus on brute-forcing or heuristic checks for small \( n \). We'll print \( n \) when such an arrangement is found.

```python
# enumerator.py
from itertools import product, combinations

# We seek sequences seq_s for s in 16 sequences,
# each of length n, over alphabet {0,1,2,3}.
# The pairwise coincidence count at equal positions ≤ 1.

def check_property(seqs):
    # seqs: list of 16 sequences of length n
    # returns True if pairwise intersection ≤1 everywhere
    for i, j in combinations(range(16), 2):
        count = sum(1 for a, b in zip(seqs[i], seqs[j]) if a == b)
        if count > 1:
            return False
    return True

def print_seqs(seqs):
    for i, seq in enumerate(seqs):
        print(f"seq[{i}] = {seq}")

def main():
    import sys
    from math import comb

    alphabet = [0,1,2,3]
    # We try increasing n from 1 upwards.
    # For each n, try to find 16 sequences with the property.

    # To reduce complexity, we try random sampling of seqs,
    # because full search is huge.

    import random

    max_n = 15
    found_n = []

    for n in range(1, max_n+1):
        print(f"Trying n = {n}")
        tries = 10000  # number of random trials
        success = False
        # Generate 16 sequences per trial and check
        for _ in range(tries):
            seqs = [tuple(random.choices(alphabet, k=n)) for __ in range(16)]
            if check_property(seqs):
                print(f"Found sequences for n={n}:")
                print_seqs(seqs)
                found_n.append(n)
                success = True
                break
        if not success:
            print(f"No sequences found for n={n}")

    # Report maximal found n
    if found_n:
        m = max(found_n)
        print(f"Maximal n with successful sequences found: {m}")
    else:
        print("No sequences found for n up to", max_n)
