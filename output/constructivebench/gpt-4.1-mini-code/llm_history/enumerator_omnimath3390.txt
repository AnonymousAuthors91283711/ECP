The problem seems to involve finding a natural number \( d \) such that \( 10d + 8 = 528 \), and then defining \( \text{omnimath3390\_answer} = 2d \), with a uniqueness condition. I will enumerate all natural numbers \( d \) in a reasonable range to find such \( d \), print the candidates, and then print the final answer.

```python
# Enumerate d in a reasonable range to solve 10*d + 8 = 528, then calculate 2*d
for d in range(60):  # 10*60=600 > 528, range enough to find d
    if 10 * d + 8 == 528:
        answer = 2 * d
        print(f"d = {d}, 2*d = {answer}")

# From the equation, the unique d is (528 - 8)/10 = 52
print(f"Unique answer: 2 * 52 = {2*52}")
```
