We want to find an integer \(a\) such that:

1. \(a = \frac{3k + 3(k+1) + 3(k+2)}{3}\) for some integer \(k\),
2. \(a + 27 = \frac{4m + 4(m+1) + 4(m+2) + 4(m+3)}{4}\) for some integer \(m\),
3. If we define the list of seven integers \([3k, 3(k+1), 3(k+2), 4m, 4(m+1), 4(m+2), 4(m+3)]\), then \(\frac{\min + \max}{2} = 42\).

We will enumerate \(k\) and \(m\) over some small range, compute these values, and print all candidates for \(a\) with corresponding \(k,m\) satisfying all conditions.

```python
# Enumerate k, m in small range to find integer a meeting conditions
for k in range(-20, 21):
    # a is average of 3 consecutive multiples of 3: (3k+3(k+1)+3(k+2))/3 = 3(k+1)
    a = 3*(k+1)
    for m in range(-20, 21):
        # average of 4 consecutive multiples of 4 starting at 4m is (4m + 4(m+1) + 4(m+2) + 4(m+3))/4 = 4(m+1.5) = 4m + 6
        avg_4 = 4*m + 6
        if avg_4 == a + 27:
            seven_ints = [3*k, 3*(k+1), 3*(k+2), 4*m, 4*(m+1), 4*(m+2), 4*(m+3)]
            min_val = min(seven_ints)
            max_val = max(seven_ints)
            if (min_val + max_val) % 2 == 0:
                median_val = (min_val + max_val) // 2
                if median_val == 42:
                    print(f"k={k}, m={m}, a={a}, min={min_val}, max={max_val}, median={median_val}")
```
