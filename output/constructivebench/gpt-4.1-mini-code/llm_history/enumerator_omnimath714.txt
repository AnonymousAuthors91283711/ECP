The problem involves computing the ratio of the measure (volume) of a subset of the unit square (0,1)×(0,1) where the ratio a/(a+b) lies in (1/4, 3/4), relative to the measure of the whole square (which is 1 in this case). We want to enumerate the measure of the specified subset by discretizing the unit square into a grid, evaluating the condition, and approximating the measure via counting points that satisfy the criterion.

Below is a Python program enumerating all points on a fine grid (e.g., 100x100) in (0,1)×(0,1), checking the ratio condition, counting valid points, and printing partial results. Since the volume of the unit square is 1, the ratio is approximately the fraction of points that satisfy the condition. This enumerates sample approximations of the measure ratio, helping conjecture the answer.

```python
# Enumerate the measure ratio of {(a,b) in (0,1)^2 | a/(a+b) in (1/4,3/4)} relative to the unit square.
# We discretize with n points per axis, compute ratio condition, estimate measure fraction.

def main():
    n = 100  # Number of grid samples per axis
    print(f"Using grid size: {n}x{n}")

    count_valid = 0
    total = 0

    for i in range(1, n):
        a = i / n
        for j in range(1, n):
            b = j / n
            c = a / (a + b)
            if 0.25 < c < 0.75:
                count_valid += 1
            total += 1

            # Print intermediate ratio estimates every 1000 points checked
            if total % 1000 == 0:
                ratio = count_valid / total
                print(f"Points checked: {total}, Approximate ratio: {ratio:.5f}")

    ratio = count_valid / total if total > 0 else 0
    print(f"Final approximate measure ratio: {ratio:.5f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
