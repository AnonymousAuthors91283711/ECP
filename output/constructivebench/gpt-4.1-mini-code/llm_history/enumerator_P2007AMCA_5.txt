The problem implies solving for a real number x = P2007AMCA_5_answer so that

0.2 * x + 0.1 * (1 - 0.2) * x = 10500

which can be simplified to

0.2 * x + 0.1 * 0.8 * x = 10500

= (0.2 + 0.08) * x = 10500

= 0.28 * x = 10500

x = 10500 / 0.28 = 37500 exactly.

We will enumerate some candidate values around this to confirm the exact solution.

```python
# Enumerate candidate answers x for the equation:
# 0.2*x + 0.1*(1-0.2)*x = 10500

target = 10500
for numerator in range(1000, 40000, 2500):
    x = numerator
    lhs = 0.2 * x + 0.1 * 0.8 * x
    if abs(lhs - target) < 1e-9:
        print(f'Exact solution found: x = {x}')
    else:
        print(f'Testing x = {x}, LHS = {lhs}')
print('Exact solution by division:', target / 0.28)
```
