[write_program]
The problem involves finding pairs of natural numbers (m, n) with m > 0 and n > 0 such that m^2 equals the sum of factorials from 1! to n!. We'll enumerate pairs for small n and compute the sum to check if it is a perfect square. The program will print all such pairs where the sum of factorials is a perfect square, supporting conjecture or theorem formulation.

```python
import math

# Enumerate pairs (m, n) with m > 0, n > 0 where m^2 = sum of factorials 1! through n!
# We'll try n up to 15 to keep sum manageable and computations fast.

def factorial_sum(n):
    s = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        s += math.factorial(i)
    return s

for n in range(1, 16):
    s = factorial_sum(n)
    m = int(s**0.5)
    if m*m == s:
        print(f"(m, n) = ({m}, {n}), since {m}^2 = sum of factorials up to {n}! = {s}")
```
