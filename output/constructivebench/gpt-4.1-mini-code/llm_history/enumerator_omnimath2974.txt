[write_program]
The problem defines a sequence of points between P=3 and V=33 divided into `parts=6` intervals, then considers points Q, R, S, T, U as intermediate points. We want to find the value of (S - P) + (V - T).

The formula step = (V-P)/(parts+1) partitions the interval into 7 segments (because parts+1=7), so the points Q..U are spaced accordingly.

We can write a Python program to verify this formula and enumerate the values involved.

```python
# Enumerate and verify (S - P) + (V - T) for given P, V, parts, and derived step and points Q..U.

def main():
    P = 3
    V = 33
    parts = 6
    step = (V - P) / (parts + 1)  # step between points Q..U
    print(f"P = {P}, V = {V}, parts = {parts}")
    print(f"Step = (V - P) / (parts + 1) = {step}")

    Q = P + step
    R = Q + step
    S = R + step
    T = S + step
    U = T + step

    print(f"Q = {Q}")
    print(f"R = {R}")
    print(f"S = {S}")
    print(f"T = {T}")
    print(f"U = {U}")

    val = (S - P) + (V - T)
    print(f"(S - P) + (V - T) = {val}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
