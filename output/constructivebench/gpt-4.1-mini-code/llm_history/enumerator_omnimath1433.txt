The problem counts functions \( f: \{0,\ldots,9\} \to \{0,1,2\} \) such that \( f(a) \neq f(b) \) whenever \( a - b \) is odd. This means that for any two elements of the domain differing by an odd number, their images are distinct.

Observing the domain indices mod 2:
- Indices with even values: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
- Indices with odd values: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9

Any two elements from different parity classes differ by an odd number, so their images must be distinct sets.

Therefore, the images of even indices and odd indices must be disjoint subsets of \(\{0,1,2\}\).

We can assign 3-values to evens (\(f|_{even}\)) and odds (\(f|_{odd}\)) such that their image sets are disjoint.

Hence, we must count the number of pairs of functions \(f_e: \{0,\ldots,4\} \to A\) and \(f_o: \{0,\ldots,4\} \to B\) where \(A,B \subseteq \{0,1,2\}\), \(A \cap B = \emptyset\), and \(A, B \neq \emptyset\) because \(f_e\) and \(f_o\) map to their respective image sets.

We enumerate all pairs of disjoint subsets of \(\{0,1,2\}\), excluding empty ones on the domain side, then count the number of surjections for the functions from size 5 domains.

We will use Stirling numbers or count non-surjective functions by inclusion-exclusion to find the number of functions using all image values.

Let's print all candidates and finally the total count.

```python
from itertools import chain, combinations

def powerset(iterable):
    "powerset([0,1,2]) -> [[],[0],[1],[2],[0,1],[0,2],[1,2],[0,1,2]]"
    s = list(iterable)
    return list(chain.from_iterable(combinations(s, r) for r in range(len(s)+1)))

def count_surjective_functions(n, k):
    # Number of surjective functions from n elements to k elements = 
    # sum_{i=0}^k (-1)^i * C(k,i) * (k - i)^n
    if k == 0:
        return 0
    total = 0
    from math import comb
    for i in range(k+1):
        total += ((-1)**i) * comb(k, i) * (k - i)**n
    return total

domain_size = 5  # even or odd positions count
codomain = [0,1,2]

subsets = powerset(codomain)

# exclude empty image sets since f_e and f_o must use their target sets (otherwise function cannot be surjective)
nonempty_subsets = [set(s) for s in subsets if len(s) > 0]

results = []

print("Enumerating all disjoint pairs of nonempty subsets of {0,1,2} and counting surjective functions:")

for A in nonempty_subsets:
    for B in nonempty_subsets:
        if A.isdisjoint(B):
            kA = len(A)
            kB = len(B)
            fA = count_surjective_functions(domain_size, kA)
            fB = count_surjective_functions(domain_size, kB)
            count = fA * fB
            # Print the pair of images and count
            print(f"A={sorted(A)} size={kA}, B={sorted(B)} size={kB}, count={count}")
            results.append(count)

total = sum(results)
print(f"Total number of such functions: {total}")
```
