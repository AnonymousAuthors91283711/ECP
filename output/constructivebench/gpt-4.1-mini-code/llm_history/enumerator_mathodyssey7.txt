[write_program]
The problem involves finding natural numbers n for which there exists k in the interval [n, n+100] such that k² divides the product of integers from n to n+100. The program will enumerate n and k in a reasonable range to identify such n.

```python
from math import prod, isqrt

def divides(a, b):
    return b % a == 0

MAX_N = 50  # Search over n=1..50 to show some candidates (small samples)

print("Enumerating n with a k in [n,n+100] where k² divides product of [n..n+100]")

for n in range(1, MAX_N+1):
    interval = list(range(n, n+101))
    P = prod(interval)
    found = False
    for k in interval:
        k2 = k*k
        if divides(k2, P):
            print(f"n={n}: k={k} with k^2 divides product")
            found = True
            break  # Only print first found k per n to limit output

print("Enumeration complete.")
```
