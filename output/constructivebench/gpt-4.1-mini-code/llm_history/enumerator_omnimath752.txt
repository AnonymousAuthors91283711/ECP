We want to find the count of integers \( a \) in the interval [1, 200] such that \( a^a \) is a perfect square. To assist reasoning, we enumerate all such \( a \) by checking if \( a^a \) is a perfect square. 

Because \( a^a = (a^{a/2})^2 \), this is only possible if \( a^{a/2} \) is an integer, meaning \( a \) is a perfect square or \( a \) is even (depending on parity). More precisely, \( a^a = (a^{\frac{a}{2}})^2 \), so \( a^{a} \) is a perfect square if and only if \( a \) is a perfect square or \( a \) is even (since square powers of any integer are perfect squares). But this should be checked precisely.

We use integer factorization to verify if \( a^a \) is a perfect square by verifying that all exponents in its prime factorization are even.

```python
# Enumerate integers a in [1, 200]; check if a^a is a perfect square.
# a^a's prime factorization exponents are a * (exponents of a).
# For a^a to be a perfect square, all exponents in prime factorization must be even.
# So all prime exponents of a multiplied by 'a' must be even.
# Thus, for each prime exponent e in prime factorization of a,
# a * e must be even => at least one of a or e is even.

from math import isqrt

def prime_factors(n):
    factors = {}
    x = n
    for p in range(2, isqrt(n) + 1):
        while x % p == 0:
            factors[p] = factors.get(p, 0) + 1
            x //= p
    if x > 1:
        factors[x] = factors.get(x, 0) + 1
    return factors

count = 0
print("a's with a^a being a perfect square in [1..200]:")
for a in range(1, 201):
    factors = prime_factors(a)
    # Check if for all prime exponents e, a*e is even
    if all((a * e) % 2 == 0 for e in factors.values()):
        print(a)
        count += 1
print(f"Total count: {count}")
```
