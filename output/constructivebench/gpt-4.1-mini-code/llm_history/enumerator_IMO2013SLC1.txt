This problem is about finding, for each positive integer \( n \), the smallest \( k \) such that any finite collection of numbers in \([0,1]\) summing to \( n \) can be partitioned into \( k \) subsets each with sum at most 1.

We want to write a Python program that, for small \( n \), enumerates values of \( k \) and tests the property for various sample sequences \( a_i \) with sums = \( n \), verifying the minimal \( k \).

For enumeration:
- \( n \) will range over small values, say 1 to 4.
- For each \( n \), try increasing \( k \ge n \) up to some threshold.
- For sequences \( a_i \) in [0,1], sum to \( n \), we check if it can be partitioned into \( k \) subsets with sums ≤ 1.
- To keep things manageable, we use finite sets of \( a_i \), for example \( d = 2n \), and discretize the \( a_i \) values to multiples of 0.1.
- We'll generate sequences summing to exactly \( n \) with these discretized values, then check if there exists some partition into \( k \) subsets respecting sums ≤ 1.

This is similar to the bin packing problem, so we can write a backtracking partition check.

We print each \( (n,k) \) tested and sequences that fail, pinpointing minimal \( k \) per \( n \).

```python
from itertools import combinations, product
from math import isclose

def can_partition(a, k):
    # Partition a into k subsets with sums ≤1 using backtracking
    bins = [0]*k
    a_sorted = sorted(a, reverse=True)
    def backtrack(i):
        if i==len(a_sorted):
            return True
        x=a_sorted[i]
        for j in range(k):
            if bins[j]+x <=1:
                bins[j]+=x
                if backtrack(i+1):
                    return True
                bins[j]-=x
            if bins[j]==0:
                break
        return False
    return backtrack(0)

def gen_sequences(n, d, step=0.1):
    # Generate sequences a of length d in [0,1], multiples of step, sum exactly n
    # Use integer sums: scale by 1/step
    total = int(n/step)
    max_val = int(1/step)
    def helper(pos, rem):
        if pos==d:
            if rem==0:
                yield []
            return
        for v in range(min(max_val, rem)+1):
            for tail in helper(pos+1, rem-v):
                yield [v*step]+tail
    yield from helper(0,total)

def main():
    for n in range(1,5):
        print(f"n={n}")
        d = 2*n  # number of elements
        found = False
        for k in range(n, n+3):  # test k from n to n+2
            failed = False
            # test sample sequences with fewer (to limit output)
            count = 0
            for a in gen_sequences(n,d):
                count+=1
                if count>300:  # limit to 300 samples
                    break
                if not can_partition(a,k):
                    print(f" n={n} k={k} fails for a={a}")
                    failed = True
                    break
            if not failed:
                print(f" Minimal k finding: for n={n}, k={k} works")
                found = True
                break
        if not found:
            print(f" No k ≤ {n+2} found for n={n}")

if __name__=="__main__":
    main()
```
This code enumerates sequences and prints failures and minimal working k values for n from 1 to 4. It helps conjecture the minimal \( k \).
