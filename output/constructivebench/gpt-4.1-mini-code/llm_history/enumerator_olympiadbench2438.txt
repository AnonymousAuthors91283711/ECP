The problem gives a functional equation \( f(2x + 3) = 2f(x) + 3 \) for all real \( x \) and an initial condition \( f(0) = 6 \), and asks for \( f(9) \).

We can enumerate values \( f(x) \) for certain \( x \) by using the functional equation repeatedly, to detect a pattern and conjecture the explicit form or value \( f(9) \).

```python
# Enumerate values of f for x of the form (2^n * a + b) guided by the functional equation:
# f(2x + 3) = 2 f(x) + 3, with f(0) = 6.

def f(x, memo={}):
    # Restrict x to integers for enumeration (or rational with denominator power of 2 if needed).
    # We'll only evaluate for x that can be reached by reverse solving 2x+3 = y.
    if x in memo:
        return memo[x]
    if x == 0:
        memo[0] = 6
        print("f(0) = 6")
        return 6
    # Try to find preimage: from y = 2x + 3 => x = (y-3)/2
    # We want to compute f(x), but we only know f at arguments transforming via the functional equation.
    # Instead, build from f(0) outward: compute f for values y = 2*x + 3 with x from known domain.
    # Let's enumeratively solve for integers k starting from 0 upwards, compute f(k).
    # We'll try to compute f(k) for k=0..20 by iteratively applying formula.
    # f(2x+3) = 2f(x)+3, so for x = (k-3)/2 if (k-3) is even and positive or zero:
    # f(k) = 2 f((k-3)/2) + 3
    if (x - 3) % 2 != 0 or (x - 3) < 0:
        # Not reachable by the functional equation from the integers upwards starting at zero
        return None
    px = (x - 3) // 2
    fv = 2 * f(px) + 3
    memo[x] = fv
    print(f"f({x}) = 2 * f({px}) + 3 = {fv}")
    return fv

print("Enumerating f(n) for n in 0..20:")
for n in range(21):
    val = f(n)

print("\nNow computing f(9):")
f9 = f(9)
print(f"Final answer f(9) = {f9}")
```
