Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: fun n a b c => ∃ (x y z : ℤ), |x| ≤ 2*n ∧ |y| ≤ 2*n ∧ |z| ≤ 2*n ∧ (x ≠ 0 ∨ y ≠ 0 ∨ z ≠ 0) ∧ a*x + b*y + c*z = 0
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. Both express the same condition: there exist integers x, y, z with absolute values bounded by 2n, not all zero (expressed as ¬(x = 0 ∧ y = 0 ∧ z = 0) in the ground truth and equivalently as (x ≠ 0 ∨ y ≠ 0 ∨ z ≠ 0) in the proposed answer), such that the linear combination a*x + b*y + c*z equals zero. The two forms of expressing "not all zero" are logically equivalent by De Morgan's laws.
