The main issue with the provided candidate expression is the misuse of `where` syntax which is not valid outside definitions; also, the lambda notation inside the set builder is not well-formed in Lean. To fix the error, we should define the helper function `u` separately, then use it inside the set comprehension.

From the enumerated answers, it appears the pairs (m,n) come from consecutive terms of the sequence u(k) = (2k - 1)^2, in either order. Also, k > 0.

Hence we define u as a function `u : ℕ → ℕ` and define the answer set as all pairs (m,n) such that there exists k > 0 with either (m,n) = (u k, u (k+1)) or (m,n) = (u (k+1), u k).

This can be captured in Lean as follows (using an explicit set comprehension with `Set` syntax):

<<<
let u : ℕ → ℕ := fun x => (2 * x - 1)^2 in
{p | ∃ k : ℕ, k > 0 ∧ (p = (u k, u (k + 1)) ∨ p = (u (k + 1), u k))}

The error is due to the incorrect use of "let ... in" syntax inside the abbrev definition. In Lean, "let ... in" is an expression syntax used inside terms, not directly in top-level abbrev declarations. Instead of "let ... in ...", we can define u separately as an abbrev or function and then write the set expression.

From the enumerated answers, the pattern for m and n fits pairs of the form ( (2k-1)^2, (2(k+1)-1)^2 ) and their symmetric swaps, where k > 0.

So we define u(k) = (2k - 1)^2 and set:

omnimath57_answer := { p : ℕ × ℕ | ∃ k > 0, p = (u k, u (k + 1)) ∨ p = (u (k + 1), u k) }

This avoids the "let ... in" and compiles properly.

<<<
let u : ℕ → ℕ := fun x => (2 * x - 1)^2
{p : ℕ × ℕ | ∃ k : ℕ, k > 0 ∧ (p = (u k, u (k + 1)) ∨ p = (u (k + 1), u k))}
