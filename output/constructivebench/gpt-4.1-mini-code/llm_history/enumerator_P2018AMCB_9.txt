The problem likely asks to evaluate or find a property about the sum of integers from 1 to 100. The sum of the first n natural numbers is well-known: n(n+1)/2. Let's enumerate partial sums up to 100, printing each to see the pattern and identify the sum at 100.

```python
# Enumerate sums from 1 to n for n=1 to 100 and print
def sum_n(n):
    return n * (n + 1) // 2  # exact formula

for i in range(1, 101):
    s = sum_n(i)
    print(f"Sum 1 to {i} = {s}")
```
