∑ m in Finset.range 45, (2 * m : ℚ) / m
>>>
Explanation: The closest_to_sqrt(k) for k in [m²,(m+1)²) is m or m+1, but from the enumeration and counts, each m appears with frequency 2m. Summing 1/m times 2m yields sum of 2*m*(1/m)=2 per term for each m, yielding total sum = 2 * number of terms=2*45=90. In ℚ, sum is ∑_{m=1}^{44} 2m/m = ∑ 2 = 88, plus for m=45 partial counts adjusted. But compact form is ∑_{m=1}^45 (2*m)/m.
