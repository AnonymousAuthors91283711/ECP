Ground Truth Answer: fun n => n^2 / 4 + n / 2
Proposed Answer: fun n => 2 * n
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the minimal number of points to mark on an n×n grid (where n is even and positive) such that every unmarked point is adjacent (horizontally or vertically) to at least one marked point.

2. The ground truth answer n²/4 + n/2 makes sense because:
   - For even n, this gives (n/2)(n/2 + 1)
   - This matches known results for domination problems on grids
   - For n=2, it gives 2 (correct)
   - For n=4, it gives 6 (correct)

3. The proposed answer 2*n is clearly different:
   - For n=2: both give 4 (accidentally matches)
   - For n=4: gives 8 vs correct 6
   - For n=6: gives 12 vs correct 12 (matches again)
   - For n=8: gives 16 vs correct 20 (diverges)

The proposed answer is incorrect in general, though it accidentally matches at some points. The growth rate is linear (O(n)) while the correct answer is quadratic (O(n²)).
