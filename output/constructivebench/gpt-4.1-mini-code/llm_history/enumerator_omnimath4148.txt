The problem involves a sequence \( a_n \) defined on natural numbers, with initial conditions and a recursive mean condition involving a variable length \( k \). We want to explore possible values of \( a_{2018} - a_{2017} \) based on these constraints.

To assist in conjecturing the answer, we will:
- Generate some sequences \( a_n \) satisfying the initial conditions and the mean property (for small \( n \) due to complexity),
- Enumerate possible differences \( a_n - a_{n-1} \),
- Print found values immediately for partial insight.

We'll use small \( n \), try possible \( k \) values, and construct \( a_n \) accordingly.

```python
# Enumerate possible values of a_n - a_{n-1} for small n satisfying given conditions
# Initial: a0=0, a1=1
# For n >= 2, a_n = mean of previous k terms for some k in [1,n] (variable k)
# We focus on possible values of a_n - a_{n-1}

from fractions import Fraction

def enumerate_sequence(n_max=7):
    # Store sequences as dict: n -> list of possible sequences (tuples of Fractions)
    sequences = {1: [ (Fraction(0), Fraction(1)) ]}  # a0=0, a1=1

    for n in range(2, n_max+1):
        new_seqs = []
        for seq in sequences[n-1]:
            for k in range(1, n+1):
                if k > n-1:
                    continue
                start = n - k
                # mean of a_{start} .. a_{n-1}
                mean_sum = sum(seq[start:n])  # seq indexed from 0
                mean = mean_sum / k
                new_seq = seq + (mean,)
                new_seqs.append(new_seq)
        sequences[n] = new_seqs

    # Print differences a_n - a_{n-1} for n=2..n_max, gather unique
    diffs = set()
    print(f"Enumerated sequences up to n={n_max}:")
    for n in range(2, n_max+1):
        print(f"n={n}:")
        for seq in sequences[n]:
            diff = seq[n] - seq[n-1]
            # Print exact fraction
            print(f"  a_{n} - a_{n-1} = {diff}")
            diffs.add(diff)

    print("\nUnique differences found:")
    for d in sorted(diffs):
        print(f"  {d}")
