Ground Truth Answer: 28
Proposed Answer: 40
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer step by step:

1. Total games = 60
2. Games per pair = 60/3 = 20 (since there are 3 pairs: Alvin-Bingyi, Bingyi-Cheska, Cheska-Alvin)
3. Calculations:
   - Alvin wins against Bingyi: 20% of 20 = 4 → Bingyi loses 16
   - Bingyi wins against Cheska: 60% of 20 = 12 → Cheska loses 8
   - Cheska wins against Alvin: 40% of 20 = 8 → Alvin loses 12
4. Total Bingyi wins:
   - From Alvin-Bingyi: 16 (since Alvin won 4)
   - From Bingyi-Cheska: 12 (direct wins)
   - From Cheska-Alvin: 12 (since Cheska won 8, meaning Alvin lost 12, but these don't count as Bingyi's wins)
   
The correct calculation should only include Bingyi's direct wins (16 from AB and 12 from BC) = 28. The proposed answer incorrectly includes Alvin's losses to Cheska as Bingyi's wins.
