noncomputable abbrev omnimath329_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath329 (x : ℝ) (hx : 0 < x) :
    x^2 + 9 * x + 2 * sqrt (x^2 * (9 * x)) = 121 ↔ x = omnimath329_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating x > 0 for lhs(x) = 121

Approximate root found by bisection: x = 4.579835, lhs = 121.000009. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<(81 : ℝ) / 9>>>
