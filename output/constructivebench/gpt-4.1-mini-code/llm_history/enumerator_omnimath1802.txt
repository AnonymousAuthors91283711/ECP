The problem involves a function \( f: \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \) defined with base cases \( f(0,x) = x \), \( f(y,0) = y \), and recursive relations depending on which coordinate is larger. The goal is to find the greatest value \( n \) that \( f(x,y) \) can take for \( x,y \leq 100 \).

I will enumerate \( f(x,y) \) for all \( x,y \in [0,100] \) using the given recursion and print candidate maximum values as found. This will help conjecture the greatest value.

```python
def f(x, y, memo):
    if (x, y) in memo:
        return memo[(x, y)]
    if x == 0:
        result = y
    elif y == 0:
        result = x
    elif x >= y and y >= 0:
        result = f(x - y, y, memo) + 1
    elif y > x and x >= 0:
        result = f(x, y - x, memo) + 1
    memo[(x, y)] = result
    return result

def main():
    memo = {}
    max_found = -1
    print("Enumerating f(x,y) for x,y in [0..100] with given recursion...")
    for x in range(101):
        for y in range(101):
            val = f(x, y, memo)
            # Print new max values as found for streaming output
            if val > max_found:
                max_found = val
                print(f"New max f({x},{y}) = {val}")
    print(f"Greatest f(x,y) for x,y â‰¤ 100 is {max_found}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
