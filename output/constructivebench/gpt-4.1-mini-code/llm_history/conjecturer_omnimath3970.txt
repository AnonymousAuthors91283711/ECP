Explanation: The key condition is that for every prime input p and positive n, eval p f is a prime power q ^ m. Testing low-degree polynomials with small coefficients suggests only constant prime polynomials and the identity polynomial X satisfy this condition: constant prime polynomials evaluate constantly to a prime (prime power with m = 1), and X evaluates to p, which is prime itself. Other polynomials produce composite values for some prime inputs, contradicting the condition. The corrected Lean expression properly groups the disjunction with parentheses and uses an existential for the prime constant c, ensuring proper syntax and logic.
