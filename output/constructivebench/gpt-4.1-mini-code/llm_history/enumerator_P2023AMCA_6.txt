The problem involves two positive reals x₁, x₂ with log base 2 of x₁ plus log base 2 of x₂ equal to 4, and their sum is 12. We want to find |x₁ - x₂|. Since log₂ x₁ + log₂ x₂ = 4 implies x₁ * x₂ = 2⁴ = 16. So the system is:
x₁ + x₂ = 12
x₁ * x₂ = 16

The problem reduces to finding the absolute difference between the roots of the quadratic t² - 12t + 16 = 0.

We can enumerate possible integer or rational pairs (x₁,x₂) with product 16 and sum 12, verifying the product and sum conditions. Then print each candidate pair, and calculate |x₁ - x₂|. Since the product and sum must match exactly, candidates are limited.

We will try integer factors of 16, then all positive rational pairs with denominators up to some small number to find exact matches. We'll print each pair and the difference as a fraction or decimal.

Finally, output the minimum and maximum difference found (should be unique here).

```python
from fractions import Fraction
from math import sqrt

# Enumerate positive pairs (x1, x2) with x1 + x2 = 12 and x1 * x2 = 16
# Try x1 in positive rationals with denominators up to 10 for efficiency

print("Enumerating (x1, x2) with x1+x2=12 and x1*x2=16")

threshold_denom = 10
results = []
for d1 in range(1, threshold_denom+1):
    for n1 in range(1, 12 * d1):  # x1 approx up to 12
        x1 = Fraction(n1, d1)
        x2 = 12 - x1
        if x2 <= 0:
            continue
        prod = x1 * x2
        if abs(prod - 16) < Fraction(1, 10**6):  # exact check for rationals
            diff = abs(x1 - x2)
            # print exactly as fractions if possible
            print(f"x1={x1}, x2={x2}, |x1-x2|={diff}")
            results.append(diff)

if results:
    min_diff = min(results)
    max_diff = max(results)
    print(f"Minimum |x1 - x2| = {min_diff}")
    print(f"Maximum |x1 - x2| = {max_diff}")

# Also compute exact roots difference of t^2 -12t +16=0
# roots = (12 ± sqrt(144 - 64)) / 2 = (12 ± sqrt(80)) / 2
discriminant = 144 - 64
root_diff = sqrt(discriminant)
diff_exact = root_diff  # difference between roots is sqrt(discriminant)
print(f"Exact |x1 - x2| = sqrt({discriminant}) = {diff_exact:.6f}")
```
