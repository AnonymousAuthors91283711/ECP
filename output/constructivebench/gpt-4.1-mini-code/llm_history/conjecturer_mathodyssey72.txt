theorem mathodyssey72 :
  Fintype.card {f : Fin 10 → Fin 10 | 
    f ∘ f = id ∧ 
    ∀ i : Fin 10, Int.natAbs ((f i).val - i.val : ℤ) = 2} = mathodyssey72_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Total involutions found: 0. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Explanation: The problem asks for the number of involutions on Fin 10 where each element is mapped exactly two steps away, i.e., |f(i) - i| = 2. Because applying f twice must be the identity, f must be a bijection consisting of 2-cycles of elements at distance 2. On Fin 10 = {0,...,9}, elements paired at distance 2 are (0,2), (1,3), (2,4), ..., (7,9). But these pairs overlap, so a perfect matching of the set with pairs at distance 2 that simultaneously form an involution is impossible, yielding zero such functions.
