[write_program]
The problem concerns a quartic polynomial with complex coefficients depending on a parameter \( c \), and characterizes the values of \( c \) so that the polynomial has 4 distinct complex roots. We want to find the condition on \(|c|\) for that to happen, and its value.

We'll write a python program to enumerate values of \( c \) and check when the polynomial
\[
f_c(x) = x^4 + (2 - 3i) x^3 + (5 - 6i) x^2 + (2 - 3i) x + c
\]
has 4 distinct roots, and look for patterns relating \(|c|\) to the property.

We test many values of \( c \) on a grid in the complex plane, compute roots of \( f_c \), check that they are distinct, and print \(|c|\) when roots are distinct.

We only sprinkle points to keep output short and enumerated results manageable.

```python
# enumerator.py
import cmath
import numpy as np

# Polynomial coefficients depend on c:
# f_c(x) = x^4 + (2 - 3i)*x^3 + (5 - 6i)*x^2 + (2 - 3i)*x + c

def poly_roots(c):
    coeffs = [1, complex(2, -3), complex(5, -6), complex(2, -3), c]
    return np.roots(coeffs)

def distinct_roots(roots, tol=1e-5):
    # Check pairwise distances > tol
    for i in range(len(roots)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(roots)):
            if abs(roots[i] - roots[j]) < tol:
                return False
    return True

def main():
    # We'll test points on a circle grid of radius r and within square for simplicity
    # We try some complex values c on a grid for sampling
    
    # Sample radii to test
    radii = np.linspace(0, 6, 13)  # 0,0.5,...6
    angles = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 12, endpoint=False)

    tested_c = set()
    # Enumerate c values = r * e^{i*theta}
    for r in radii:
        for theta in angles:
            c = r * cmath.exp(1j * theta)
            # avoid repeated c=0
            if c in tested_c:
                continue
            tested_c.add(c)
            roots = poly_roots(c)
            if distinct_roots(roots):
                # Print radius |c| and c itself for clarity
                print(f"Distinct roots for |c|={abs(c):.3f}, c={c:.3f}")
    # In observation we expect a specific radius for |c|
