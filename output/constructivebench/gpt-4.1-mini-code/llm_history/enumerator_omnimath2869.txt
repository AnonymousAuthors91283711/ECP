The problem gives two equations involving digits \(x\) and \(y\) (both positive integers less than 10 generally), and we want to find \(x + y\).

Equations:
1. \(10x + y = 75\)
2. \(10y + x = 57\)

Given this, the program will enumerate possible digit values \(x, y\) from 1 to 9, check the equations, and print matching pairs and their sums.

```python
# Enumerate digits x,y with 1 <= x,y <= 9
# Check if 10*x + y == 75 and 10*y + x == 57
# Print x,y and sum x + y when found

def main():
    for x in range(1, 10):
        for y in range(1, 10):
            if 10 * x + y == 75 and 10 * y + x == 57:
                print(f"Found solution: x={x}, y={y}, x+y={x + y}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
