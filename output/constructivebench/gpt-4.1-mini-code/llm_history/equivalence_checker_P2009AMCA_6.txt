theorem P2009AMCA_6 (m n : ℕ) : 
  12^(m * n) = P2009AMCA_6_answer m n := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun m n => (2^m)^(2*n) * (3^n)^m
Proposed Answer: fun m n => (2^(2 * m * n)) * (3^(m * n))
Let's analyze the two answers:

Ground Truth: (2^m)^(2*n) * (3^n)^m
= 2^(m*2*n) * 3^(n*m)
= 2^(2*m*n) * 3^(m*n)

Proposed Answer: 2^(2 * m * n) * 3^(m * n)

We can see that after simplifying the exponents in the ground truth answer, it becomes identical to the proposed answer. Both expressions represent 12^(m*n) when expanded, since 12 = 2^2 * 3.
