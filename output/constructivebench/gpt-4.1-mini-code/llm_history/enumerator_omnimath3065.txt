The problem equates \(2 \times 3 \times 4\) with \(6 \times \text{omnimath3065\_answer}\). We want to find the natural number omnimath3065_answer such that the equality holds.

This reduces to enumerating possible answers for omnimath3065_answer and checking if \(2 \times 3 \times 4 = 6 \times \text{answer}\).

```python
# Enumerate possible natural numbers for omnimath3065_answer satisfying 2*3*4 = 6*answer
target = 2 * 3 * 4  # 24

for candidate in range(1, 10):
    if 6 * candidate == target:
        print(f"omnimath3065_answer = {candidate}")

# Explicit output of the answer:
print("Answer: ", target // 6)
```
