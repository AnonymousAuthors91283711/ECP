[write_program]
The problem defines a function \( f \) on pairs of integers with boundary conditions and a recurrence. We need \( f(6,12) \). Given the recurrence and zero boundary conditions, we can compute values for small nonnegative \( x, y \) by dynamic programming.

Weâ€™ll implement a Python program to evaluate \( f(x,y) \) for \( 0 \leq x \leq 6 \), \( 0 \leq y \leq 12 \), printing each computed value. Finally, we output \( f(6,12) \).

```python
# Compute f(x,y) with:
# f(x,0)=0, f(0,y)=0
# f(x,y)=f(x-1,y)+f(x,y-1)+x+y for x,y>0

def main():
    max_x, max_y = 6, 12
    f = [[0]*(max_y+1) for _ in range(max_x+1)]
    # f(x,0)=0 and f(0,y)=0 already set
    
    for x in range(1, max_x+1):
        for y in range(1, max_y+1):
            f[x][y] = f[x-1][y] + f[x][y-1] + x + y
            print(f"f({x},{y}) = {f[x][y]}")
    
    print(f"Answer: f(6,12) = {f[6][12]}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
