The problem is about finding the smallest distance between 1 and any number in the given set:
\[
\left\{ \frac{11}{10}, \frac{111}{100}, 1.101, \frac{1111}{1000}, 1.011 \right\}
\]

We want to enumerate the absolute differences \(|x - 1|\) for each \(x\) in the set, output them immediately, and identify the minimum distance.

```python
# Enumerate the absolute differences from 1 for each number in the given set,
# print all distances immediately, then print the minimal distance found.

def main():
    # Define the set with exact fractions and decimals as floats.
    numbers = [
        11/10,       # 1.1
        111/100,     # 1.11
        1.101,       # decimal
        1111/1000,   # 1.111
        1.011        # decimal
    ]
    distances = []
    for x in numbers:
        d = abs(x - 1)
        print(f"Distance from 1 to {x} is {d}")
        distances.append(d)

    min_dist = min(distances)
    print(f"Minimum distance: {min_dist}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
