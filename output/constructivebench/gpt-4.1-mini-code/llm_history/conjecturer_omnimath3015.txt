theorem omnimath3015 : 
  let S := ∑ k in (Finset.range 10000).filter (fun k => k % 2 = 0 ∧ k^2 % (10^(String.length (toString k))) = k), k;
  (digits 10 S).sum = omnimath3015_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Checking even numbers k < 10000 for k^2 ending with k
Found k=0, k^2=0 ends with 0
Found k=6, k^2=36 ends with 6
Found k=76, k^2=5776 ends with 76
Found k=376, k^2=141376 ends with 376
Found k=9376, k^2=87909376 ends with 9376
Sum of all matching k: 9834
Digit sum of total: 24
. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
