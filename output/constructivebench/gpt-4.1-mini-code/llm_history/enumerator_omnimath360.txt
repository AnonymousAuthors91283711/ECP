The problem appears to involve combinatorial set systems and injective mappings related to cardinals and finite types, in which we want to find the minimal size \( k \) of a collection \( C \) of 2-element subsets of an \( n \)-element set \( A \) that satisfies a certain separation property related to injections to smaller sets.

To explore and conjecture the function `omnimath360_answer n`, the program will:
- For small \( n \geq 2 \), enumerate all collections \( C \) of 2-subsets of an \( n \)-set.
- For each candidate collection \( C \), test for all integers \( m < n \) whether there exists an injection \( f: A \to Fin(m) \) violating the injectivity condition on every set in \( C \).
- The collections \( C \) failing this condition for all \( m < n \) form the candidates, and we seek the minimal size \( k \).

Due to the complexity, the program will:
- Use small sample values \( n = 2,3,4 \).
- Print each candidate \( k \) when found.
- Finally, for each \( n \), print the minimum \( k \) found.

We'll represent \( A = \{0,\dots,n-1\} \), enumerate 2-subsets, and test candidate collections incrementally by size.

```python
# Enumerate minimal sizes k of sets of 2-subsets C of A=[0..n-1] satisfying:
# For all m < n, no f: A->Fin(m) with no injective restriction on any pair in C.
# That is, for all smaller codomains, we cannot find f making all pairs non-injective.

This program tries small \( n = 2,3,4 \). It prints each candidate minimum \( k \) found with a valid collection \( C \), then the minimal \( k \) for that \( n \). This should help conjecture the function `omnimath360_answer n`.
