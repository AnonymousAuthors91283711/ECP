[write_program]
The problem involves counting tuples of digits (u, w, x, y, z, v) in finite sets with given inequalities and a specific arithmetic condition related to doubling a 4-digit number and matching certain digits. We must enumerate all u in 0..9, and (w,x,y,z,v) digits also in 0..9 with distinctness constraints, checking if doubling the 4-digit number n (formed by wxyz) matches the specified digit condition.

We will:
- Enumerate u in 0..9
- For w,x,y,z,v in 0..9 with all required distinctness
- w â‰  0 (to ensure n is a 4-digit number)
- Double n = 1000*w + 100*x + 10*y + z to get a 5-digit sum
- Check if sum's last 4 digits (skipping the highest digit) equals [w, u, y, v] exactly
- Print each u that meets the condition and count how many such u produce solutions
- Output the count at the end (which corresponds to Fintype.card ...), along with the u values found

The program prints each u that works; this can be analyzed or counted as the final answer.

```python
# Enumerate u, w,x,y,z,v in 0..9 with constraints:
# w != 0, distinctness constraints, and doubling number condition
# Print each u for which there exist w,x,y,z,v satisfying the condition

def digits_of(n, length):
    # Return list of digits of n with length (leading zeros if needed)
    s = str(n).rjust(length, '0')
    return [int(c) for c in s]

count = 0
found_us = set()
for u in range(10):
    for w in range(1,10):
        if w == u:
            continue
        for x in range(10):
            if x in (w,u):
                continue
            for y in range(10):
                if y in (w,x,u):
                    continue
                for z in range(10):
                    if z in (w,x,y,u):
                        continue
                    for v in range(10):
                        # distinctness conditions
                        if v in (w,x,y,z,u):
                            continue
                        if len({w,x,y,z,v,u}) < 6:
                            continue
                        n = 1000*w + 100*x + 10*y + z
                        sum_ = n + n
                        d = digits_of(sum_,5)
                        # digits.drop 1 == [w,u,y,v]
                        # this means d[1:] == [w,u,y,v]
                        if d[1:] == [w,u,y,v]:
                            print(f"u={u}, w={w}, x={x}, y={y}, z={z}, v={v}, sum={sum_}")
                            if u not in found_us:
                                found_us.add(u)
                                count += 1
print(f"Count of valid u: {count}")
