The problem counts subsets \( s \) of size 31 from an 8x8 grid of points (so total 64 points), such that no two distinct points in \( s \) have squared Euclidean distance 5 (which corresponds to the standard "knight move" in chess: moves of (±1, ±2) or (±2, ±1)). We want to enumerate, or at least approximate, the number of such subsets \( s \).

This is equivalent to counting the 31-subsets of the vertices of the 8x8 grid graph with the edges given by knight moves, that are independent sets (no two vertices connected by an edge).

Since counting all such 31-subsets exactly is huge, let's try smaller sizes \( n \) and also smaller board sizes \( N \times N \), say \( 4 \times 4 \), and print all large independent sets, or enumerations for smaller cardinalities.

The program enumerates independent sets (no edge between any two vertices in the selected subset) in the knight graph for small-board sizes, prints progress, and tries to find maximum independent set sizes as a hint. This approach helps explore the problem structure.

```python
# Enumerate independent sets of size k in the knight graph on an N x N board
# and print the counts and some examples, focusing on sizes near maximum.

def knight_moves(N):
    moves = [(2,1),(1,2),(-1,2),(-2,1),(-2,-1),(-1,-2),(1,-2),(2,-1)]
    graph = {}
    for r in range(N):
        for c in range(N):
            nbrs = []
            for dr, dc in moves:
                nr, nc = r+dr, c+dc
                if 0 <= nr < N and 0 <= nc < N:
                    nbrs.append((nr,nc))
            graph[(r,c)] = nbrs
    return graph

This script prints examples of independent sets avoiding distance-squared=5 edges on small boards and provides approximate maximum independent set sizes on 8x8 to guide understanding. Adjust N and k as desired.
