[write_program]
The provided code snippet is from Lean's mathlib and defines a property `omnimath4414_answer` on natural numbers with a theorem statement. Since the problem is not explicitly stated here, I will interpret the task as exploring some number-theoretic or combinatorial property on natural numbers \( n > 0 \).

To assist in conjecturing, I will write a Python program that:
- Enumerates natural numbers \( n \) from 1 up to 20.
- Checks a sample property or pattern involving \( n \).
- Prints each candidate \( n \) and some computed values to spot patterns.

Without a precise property, I'll consider exploring common elementary properties (like prime checking, divisors count, or sum properties) as placeholders for the user to modify.

```python
# Enumerate natural numbers from 1 to 20 and analyze sample properties:
# - count of divisors
# - sum of divisors
# - check if n is prime (for example)

def is_prime(x):
    if x < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(x**0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def divisors(n):
    return [d for d in range(1, n + 1) if n % d == 0]

print("n,m(divisors),sum(divisors),prime")
for n in range(1, 21):
    divs = divisors(n)
    print(f"{n},{len(divs)},{sum(divs)},{is_prime(n)}")
```

This program immediately prints for each \( n \) some exact arithmetic values, which can aid conjectures. Modify the checked property as needed.
