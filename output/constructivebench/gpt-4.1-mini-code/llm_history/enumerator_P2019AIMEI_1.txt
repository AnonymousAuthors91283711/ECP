The problem seems to refer to a function `P2019AIMEI_1_answer` which, given a natural number `N`, returns the sum of the digits of `N` in base 10. The theorem states that this function equals the sum of the digits. Your example shows that for `N = 123456789`, the answer is 45, which is the sum of digits from 1 to 9.

To assist with understanding and testing this sum-of-digits function, I will write a Python program that enumerates some natural numbers, prints their digit sums immediately, and verify the behavior. This can help conjecture or verify properties if needed.

```python
# Python program to enumerate natural numbers and print sum of their digits
# for sample values to assist in conjecturing and proving the digit sum property.

def digit_sum(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

def main():
    print("Enumerating sum of digits for N from 1 to 20:")
    for N in range(1, 21):
        s = digit_sum(N)
        print(f"N={N}, sum_of_digits={s}")

    print("\nSample interesting values:")
    samples = [123456789, 1010101, 999999, 1000000, 0]
    for N in samples:
        s = digit_sum(N)
        print(f"N={N}, sum_of_digits={s}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
