The problem involves a function \( f(n) = \log_{2002}(n^2) \), and asks to evaluate the sum \( f(11) + f(13) + f(14) \). Since \(\log_b(a^2) = 2 \log_b(a)\), the sum can be rewritten in terms of \(\log_{2002}(11), \log_{2002}(13), \log_{2002}(14)\).

To explore this, I'll write a program that computes these logarithms using natural logs and enumerate their exact values as symbolic fractions of \(\ln(a)/\ln(2002)\), then output their sums, approximate values, and possibly simplified forms to assist in conjecturing the answer.

```python
import math

# Base of the logarithm
base = 2002

# Numbers to evaluate
nums = [11, 13, 14]

# Compute exact logs as fractions of natural logs, and sum
ln_base = math.log(base)

print(f"Evaluating sum of f(n) = log_{base}(n^2) for n in {nums}")

# Compute each term f(n) = 2 * log_base(n) = 2 * ln(n) / ln(base)
terms = []
for n in nums:
    ln_n = math.log(n)
    val_frac = f"2 * ln({n})/ln({base})"
    approx = 2 * ln_n / ln_base
    print(f"f({n}) = {val_frac} ≈ {approx:.6f}")
    terms.append(approx)

total = sum(terms)
print(f"Sum f(11)+f(13)+f(14) ≈ {total:.6f}")
```
