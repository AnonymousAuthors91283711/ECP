abbrev P2016AMCA_5_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem P2016AMCA_5 (n : ℕ) : 
  Even n ∧ n > 2 ∧ ¬∃ (p q : ℕ), p.Prime ∧ q.Prime ∧ p + q = n ↔ n ∈ P2016AMCA_5_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Checking even n > 2 up to 100 for no prime sum representation:
Enumeration done. No such n found up to 100 indicates support for Goldbach conjecture in this range.. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
