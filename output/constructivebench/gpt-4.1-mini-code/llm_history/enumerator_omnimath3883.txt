The problem provides a functional equation over positive rationals and asks to characterize all functions \( f : \mathbb{Q}^+ \to \mathbb{Q}^+ \) satisfying
\[
f\bigl(x^2 (f(y))^2 \bigr) = (f(x))^2 f(y).
\]
We want to enumerate possible rational-valued functions \( f \) with samples to guess the form of \( f \).

A natural approach is to test candidate functions \( f(x) = a x^b \) for rational \( a,b \) and verify the equation for sample values, streaming solutions found.

```python
# Enumerate candidate functions f(x) = a * x^b (a,b in Q+),
# check the functional equation at sample points,
# print candidates that satisfy it approximately over test points

from fractions import Fraction
import math

def qpow(x, r):  # x and r are Fraction; x^r computed if denominator divides log2 nicely
    # Since only rationals, limit ourselves to integer exponents for safety
    if r.denominator != 1:
        return None  # skip non-integer exponents
    return x ** r.numerator

# Rational candidates for a and b
# limit denominators and absolute values for tractability
as_ = [Fraction(n, d) for n in range(1,4) for d in range(1,4)]
bs_ = [Fraction(n, d) for n in range(-3,4) for d in range(1,4)]

# Samples x,y positive rationals
samples = [(Fraction(x,1), Fraction(y,1)) for x in range(1,4) for y in range(1,4)]

def f(x,a,b):
    # x^{b} with b int only
    powx = qpow(x,b)
    if powx is None or powx <= 0:
        return None
    return a * powx

print("Testing candidates f(x) = a*x^b for a,b in small rationals")

for a in as_:
    for b in bs_:
        # Check equation at sample points
        ok = True
        for x,y in samples:
            fy = f(y,a,b)
            if fy is None or fy <= 0:
                ok = False
                break
            lhs_arg = x**2 * (fy**2)
            lhs = f(lhs_arg,a,b)
            if lhs is None:
                ok = False
                break
            rhs = (f(x,a,b)**2)*fy
            if rhs is None:
                ok = False
                break
            # Compare lhs and rhs exactly as fractions
            if lhs != rhs:
                ok = False
                break
        if ok:
            print(f"Candidate function: f(x) = {a} * x^{b}")
```
This program enumerates simple power functions and tests if they satisfy the functional equation exactly on small positive rationals, printing candidates immediately. This helps conjecture the true form of \( f \).
