Ground Truth Answer: 5 + 2 * sqrt 3
Proposed Answer: (3/1 + 2) + (3/2 + 1)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers carefully.

The problem defines a set S of real numbers x where x = 3/a + b, with constraints 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 2. We need to find sup(S) + inf(S).

1. For the supremum (maximum):
- To maximize x = 3/a + b, we should minimize a and maximize b
- The minimal a is 1, maximal b is 2
- So sup(S) = 3/1 + 2 = 5

2. For the infimum (minimum):
- To minimize x = 3/a + b, we should maximize a and minimize b
- But since a ≤ b, the minimal b is equal to a
- So we need to minimize 3/a + a where 1 ≤ a ≤ 2
- The derivative of 3/a + a is -3/a² + 1, which equals 0 at a = √3
- Evaluating at critical points and boundaries:
  - a=1: 3/1 + 1 = 4
  - a=√3: 3/√3 + √3 = √3 + √3 = 2√3 ≈ 3.464
  - a=2: 3/2 + 2 = 3.5
- The minimum occurs at a=√3, giving inf(S) = 2√3

Thus, sup(S) + inf(S) = 5 + 2√3, which matches the ground truth.

The proposed answer suggests (3/1 + 2) + (3/2 + 1) = 5 + 2.5 = 7.5, which is incorrect because:
1. It correctly calculates sup(S) as 5
2. But incorrectly calculates inf(S) by taking a=2 and b=1 (which violates a ≤ b)
3. Also misses the actual minimum at a=b=√3
