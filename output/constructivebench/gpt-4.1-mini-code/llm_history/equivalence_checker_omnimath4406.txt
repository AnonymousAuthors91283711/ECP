theorem omnimath4406 (x : ℝ) :
    (∃ m : ℤ, x = omnimath4406_answer m) ↔
    sin x ^ 3 * (1 + cos x / sin x) + cos x ^ 3 * (1 + sin x / cos x) = cos (2 * x) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun m => m * π - π / 4
Proposed Answer: fun m : ℤ => m * Real.pi / 4
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for a function omnimath4406_answer : ℤ → ℝ such that for any real x, x equals omnimath4406_answer m for some integer m if and only if the given trigonometric equation holds.

2. The ground truth answer suggests that the solutions are at points mπ - π/4 for any integer m.

3. The proposed answer suggests solutions at mπ/4.

Let's test some values:
- For m=1: ground truth gives 3π/4, proposed gives π/4
- For m=0: ground truth gives -π/4, proposed gives 0

The trigonometric equation simplifies to an identity that holds when sin(x) + cos(x) = ±√2, which occurs precisely at x = mπ - π/4 (the ground truth). The proposed answer only catches some of these solutions (when m is odd) but misses others.
