The problem appears to involve computing the expected value \( E = \sum_{k=0}^\infty k \cdot p(k) \), where
\[
p(k) = \left(\prod_{i=0}^{k-1} \frac{n-i}{n}\right) \frac{k}{n}
\]
with \( n = 2014 \).

Let's write a Python program to enumerate \( k \) and compute the partial probabilities and expectations up to a reasonable cutoff, printing the partial sums as we go. We will also try smaller values of \( n \) to get insights into the behavior and help conjecture the formula.

```python
# Enumerate and compute the expected value based on the formula given
def factorial_product(n, k):
    # Compute product of (n - i)/n for i in 0..k-1
    prod = 1.0
    for i in range(k):
        prod *= (n - i) / n
    return prod

def expected_value(n, max_k=100):
    # Compute E = sum over k of k * p(k)
    # p(k) = factorial_product(n,k) * (k/n)
    # We'll print partial contributions and the running total
    E = 0.0
    print(f"For n = {n}:")
    for k in range(1, max_k + 1):
        p_k = factorial_product(n, k) * (k / n)
        contribution = k * p_k
        E += contribution
        print(f"k={k}, p(k)={p_k:.10e}, contribution={contribution:.10e}, partial E={E:.10e}")
        # If contribution is very small, break early to save computation
        if contribution < 1e-14:
            break
    print(f"Approximate expected value E â‰ˆ {E}")
    print(f"Rounded 100*E = {round(100*E)}")
    print()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Test with smaller values of n for insight
    for test_n in [5, 10, 20, 50]:
        expected_value(test_n, max_k=50)

    # Now the problem case
    expected_value(2014, max_k=100)
```
