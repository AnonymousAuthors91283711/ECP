The problem asks to find the number of positive integer pairs (p.1, p.2) satisfying the linear equation involving Fibonacci numbers F(p.1) and F(p.2):

5 * F(p.1) - 3 * F(p.2) = 1,

where F is the standard Fibonacci sequence defined by F(1) = 1, F(2) = 1, and F(n+1) = F(n) + F(n-1).

Our goal is to enumerate such pairs for some small ranges and conjecture about the solution count.

```python
# Enumerate positive integer pairs (x,y) with 1 <= x,y <= N and test the equation
# 5*F(x) - 3*F(y) = 1.
# Print each pair immediately when found.

def fib_upto(n):
    # Return list of Fibonacci numbers F(1) to F(n)
    F = [0, 1, 1]  # indexed from 1 for convenience
    for i in range(3, n+1):
        F.append(F[i-1] + F[i-2])
    return F[1:]  # skip 0th element

def main():
    N = 20  # upper bound, can adjust if needed
    F = fib_upto(N)

    print(f"Enumerating pairs (x,y) with 1 <= x,y <= {N} satisfying 5*F(x) - 3*F(y) = 1:")
    count = 0
    for x in range(1, N+1):
        Fx = F[x-1]
        for y in range(1, N+1):
            Fy = F[y-1]
            if 5*Fx - 3*Fy == 1:
                print(f"(x={x}, y={y}) with F(x)={Fx}, F(y)={Fy}")
                count += 1

    print(f"Total solutions found for 1 <= x,y <= {N}: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
