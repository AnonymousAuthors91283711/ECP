The problem involves counting numbers \( n \) between 1 and 50 such that applying the function \( \tau \) twice yields an odd number. Here, \( \tau(n) \) counts the positive divisors of \( n \). The objective is to enumerate the set \(\{n \in [1,50] : \tau(\tau(n)) \text{ is odd}\}\).

We will:

- Define a function to count divisors.
- Iterate over \( n = 1 \) to 50.
- Compute \(\tau(n)\), then \(\tau(\tau(n))\).
- Check if \(\tau(\tau(n))\) is odd.
- Print each \( n \) that satisfies this condition.
- Finally, print the total count.

```python
def count_divisors(x):
    # Count positive divisors of x efficiently
    count = 0
    i = 1
    while i * i <= x:
        if x % i == 0:
            count += 1 if i * i == x else 2
        i += 1
    return count

print("Numbers n in [1..50] with Odd(τ(τ(n))):")
result = []
for n in range(1, 51):
    t1 = count_divisors(n)
    t2 = count_divisors(t1)
    if t2 % 2 == 1:
        print(n)
        result.append(n)

print(f"Count: {len(result)}")
```
