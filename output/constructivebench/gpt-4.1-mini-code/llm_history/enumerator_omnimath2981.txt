The problem is about finding a unique natural number m > 0 such that 2.1 * m = 52.8, with 2.1 and 52.8 interpreted as rationals.

We want to enumerate candidates m in natural numbers where (2.1 * m) = 52.8 exactly (with rational arithmetic). Since 2.1 = 21/10 and 52.8 = 528/10, this is equivalent to (21/10) * m = 528/10, so 21m = 528, m = 528/21.

We can check if m = 528/21 is an integer; if yes print it. Otherwise enumerate natural numbers up to a threshold.

We print parameters 2.1 and 52.8 as rationals, then enumerate m.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def main():
    # given rationals
    a = Fraction(21,10)  # 2.1
    b = Fraction(528,10) # 52.8

    print(f"Given a = {a} and b = {b}")

    # m satisfies a * m = b, so m = b / a
    m = b / a

    # check if m is a natural number > 0
    if m.denominator == 1 and m.numerator > 0:
        print(f"m = {m} is a natural number solution")
    else:
        print(f"No exact natural number m found by division, enumerating candidates")

        # enumerate natural numbers up to 100 to find any integer solutions where a*m == b
        threshold = 100
        for candidate in range(1, threshold+1):
            if a * candidate == b:
                print(f"m = {candidate} satisfies a * m = b")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
