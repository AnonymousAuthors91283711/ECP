The problem can be interpreted as follows: Given a sequence (seq) of natural numbers such that for each n > 0, the average of the first n terms is exactly n, i.e., 
(sum_{k=0}^{n-1} seq(k)) / n = n,
we want to find seq(2008).

From the condition,
sum_{k=0}^{n-1} seq(k) = n^2.

Observing the sequence of partial sums, we have:
S_n = n², and S_{n-1} = (n-1)²,
so seq(n-1) = S_n - S_{n-1} = n² - (n-1)² = 2n - 1.

Therefore, seq(k) = 2(k+1) - 1 = 2k + 1.

We can verify this for small n to confirm the pattern.

The program below enumerates values for n=1 to 10 to demonstrate the sequence terms and finally prints seq(2008).

```python
# Enumerate seq(n) for n=1..10 and then for n=2008 according to the formula derived
def seq(n):
    return 2 * n + 1

print("Enumerating seq(n) for n=0 to 9:")
for n in range(10):
    print(f"seq({n}) = {seq(n)}")

print(f"seq(2008) = {seq(2008)}")
```
