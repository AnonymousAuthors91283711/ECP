The problem seems to involve finding a natural number \( n \) such that the product of \( \sin(a_k) \) from \( k=1 \) to \( n \) equals \( \frac{1}{100} \), under some constraints on \( a_n \). We approximate \( a_1 = \pi/6 \approx 0.5236 \), and the recurrence involves \(\tan(a_{n+1}) \cdot \cos(a_n) = 1\).

We can numerically generate \( a_n \) from \( a_1 \) using the relation:

\[
\tan(a_{n+1}) = \frac{1}{\cos(a_n)}
\Rightarrow a_{n+1} = \arctan\left(\frac{1}{\cos(a_n)}\right)
\]

Then compute the product of sines of the \( a_n \)'s until it is close to \( 1/100 = 0.01 \).

The program will generate \( a_n \) and compute partial products, printing intermediate values and finally outputting the smallest \( n \) for which the product is close to \( 0.01\).

```python
import math

def main():
    # Initial conditions
    a = [math.pi / 6]  # a_1
    product = math.sin(a[0])
    print(f"n=1, a_1={a[0]:.6f}, sin(a_1)={math.sin(a[0]):.6f}, product={product:.9f}")

    target = 1 / 100
    n = 1
    
    while product > target and n < 100:
        # Compute a_{n+1} using tan(a_{n+1}) = 1 / cos(a_n)
        cos_an = math.cos(a[-1])
        tan_an1 = 1 / cos_an
        an1 = math.atan(tan_an1)
        a.append(an1)

        product *= math.sin(an1)
        n += 1

        print(f"n={n}, a_{n}={an1:.6f}, sin(a_{n})={math.sin(an1):.6f}, product={product:.9f}")

    print(f"Answer candidate: n = {n}, product = {product:.9f}, target = {target}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
