Ground Truth Answer: fun n => {1 / (n.factorial : ℝ), -1 / (n.factorial : ℝ)}
Proposed Answer: fun n => ∅
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the roots of a polynomial p(1/x) = x², where p has specific properties (monic, degree 2n, and takes certain values at 1/k for integers k).

2. The ground truth answer suggests that the additional roots (beyond the obvious integer solutions) are ±1/n!.

3. The proposed answer claims there are no additional roots (empty set).

4. The ground truth answer seems plausible because:
   - The polynomial is degree 2n and we're given n conditions (for k=±1,...,±n)
   - We'd expect 2n roots total
   - The integer solutions give us 2n-2 roots (all integers except 0)
   - So we'd need 2 more roots, which could indeed be ±1/n!

5. The proposed empty set answer would imply we have exactly the integer roots, but this would leave us with only 2n-2 roots for a degree 2n polynomial.

Conclusion: The proposed answer is incorrect as it misses the non-integer roots that must exist to complete the solution set.
