The problem involves the 15-digit number consisting of all ones (digits = [1,1,...,1]) and placing plus signs in between some digits to form a sum of numbers. We want to count how many such sums are divisible by 30.

To assist in conjecturing the answer, I will write a Python program that:
- takes the 15 digits all as 1s
- enumerates all ways to insert plus signs between digits (there are 2^14 ways)
- computes the sum formed by those partitions
- checks divisibility by 30
- prints each sum divisible by 30 with the corresponding pattern (for transparency)
- at the end, prints the total count of such sums.

This enumeration will help conjecture the count (cardinality) of such sums divisible by 30.

```python
# Enumerate ways to insert pluses between 15 ones, count sums divisible by 30

def evaluate_with_pluses(digits, pluses):
    # digits: list of ints (all 1s)
    # pluses: list of bools length len(digits)-1 indicating whether to split after the digit
    total = 0
    current_num = 0
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        current_num = current_num * 10 + digits[i]
        if i == len(digits) - 1 or pluses[i]:
            total += current_num
            current_num = 0
    return total

def pluses_to_str(pluses):
    return ''.join('+' if x else '.' for x in pluses)

def main():
    digits = [1]*15
    n = len(digits)
    count = 0
    limit_print = 10  # limit prints to avoid too much output
    for mask in range(1 << (n-1)):
        pluses = [(mask & (1 << i)) != 0 for i in range(n-1)]
        val = evaluate_with_pluses(digits, pluses)
        if val % 30 == 0:
            count += 1
            if count <= limit_print:
                print(f"Sum divisible by 30: {val}, pattern: {pluses_to_str(pluses)}")
    print(f"Total count of sums divisible by 30: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
