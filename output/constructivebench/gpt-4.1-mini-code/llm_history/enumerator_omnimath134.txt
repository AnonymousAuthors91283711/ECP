The problem involves finding integer coefficients \(a\) such that the polynomial 
\[ X^n + a X^{n-1} + p q \]
factors nontrivially over \(\mathbb{Z}[X]\), with \(p\) prime, \(q\) squarefree, and not divisible by \(p\), for \(n \geq 3\).

Since the original theorem is abstract, we'll experiment with small primes \(p\), small squarefree integers \(q\) (coprime to \(p\)), and values \(n=3,4,5\). For each triple, we try to factor the polynomial \(X^n + a X^{n-1} + p q\) and collect all integer \(a\) making it reducible. This enumerates possible answers; from this data, conjectures about the form of \(\text{omnimath134_answer}(p,q,n)\) can emerge.

We use sympy's polynomial factorization over integers. To keep output short and informative:
- Print parameters used.
- Print every \(a\) found with a factorization.
- Stop after collecting answers up to abs(a) â‰¤ 10 (arbitrarily small bound for feasibility).
- For larger \(n\) values the search is heavier, so we limit \(a\)'s range and sample \(n=3,4\).
