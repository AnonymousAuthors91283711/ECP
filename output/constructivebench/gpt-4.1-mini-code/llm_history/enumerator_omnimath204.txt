The problem involves a polynomial \( P \) of degree \( 3n \) with specific values at arithmetic sequences. The goal is to find the integer \( n \) for which \( P(3n+1) = 730 \) under given constraints.

We will:
- Enumerate \( n \) starting from 1.
- For each \( n \), try to construct the polynomial \( P \) of degree \( 3n \) fitting the values:
  - \( P(3k) = 2 \) for \( k = 0, \dots, n \)
  - \( P(3k+1) = 1 \) for \( k = 0, \dots, n-1 \)
  - \( P(3k+2) = 0 \) for \( k = 0, \dots, n-1 \)
- Evaluate \( P(3n+1) \), print it, and check if equals 730.
- Stop at a reasonable upper bound to avoid excessive computation.

We will use SymPy for polynomial interpolation and solving.

```python
from sympy import symbols, interpolate, Eq, solve, S

x = symbols('x')

# We try small n from 1 to 6 (degree up to 18 is computationally feasible)
for n in range(1, 7):
    points = []
    # Add points for P(3k) = 2, k=0..n
    for k in range(n + 1):
        points.append((3 * k, 2))
    # Add points for P(3k+1) = 1, k=0..n-1
    for k in range(n):
        points.append((3 * k + 1, 1))
    # Add points for P(3k+2) = 0, k=0..n-1
    for k in range(n):
        points.append((3 * k + 2, 0))
    # Interpolate the polynomial of degree at most 3n
    P = interpolate(points, x)
    val = P.subs(x, 3 * n + 1)
    # val can be rational, keep as is
    print(f"n={n}, P(3n+1)={val}")
    if val == 730:
        print(f"=> Found n={n} with P(3n+1)=730")
        break
```
