The problem asks to find the greatest natural number \( n \) such that:
- \( n \) has exactly four digits,
- the digits of \( n \) are exactly the multiset \(\{2,0,1,9\}\),
- \( n \) is divisible by 7.

We will enumerate all 4-digit permutations of the digits 2,0,1,9, check divisibility by 7, and track the greatest such number.

```python
from itertools import permutations

digits = [2, 0, 1, 9]

def digits_to_num(digs):
    return digs[0]*1000 + digs[1]*100 + digs[2]*10 + digs[3]

max_n = -1
# We consider all permutations of digits and filter those with leading digit not zero (4-digit number)
for perm in permutations(digits):
    if perm[0] == 0:
        continue
    n = digits_to_num(perm)
    if n % 7 == 0:
        print(n)
        if n > max_n:
            max_n = n

if max_n >= 0:
    print("Greatest number divisible by 7:", max_n)
else:
    print("No such number found.")
```
