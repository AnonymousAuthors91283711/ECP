Ground Truth Answer: fun (a, b) => a + b
Proposed Answer: fun p : ℕ × ℕ => p.1 + p.2
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer and the ground truth answer are equivalent. Both define a function that takes a pair of natural numbers and returns their sum. The proposed answer uses pattern matching with `p.1` and `p.2` to access the components of the pair, while the ground truth answer uses direct tuple destructuring with `(a, b)`. However, they compute exactly the same result for any input pair. The notation differences are purely syntactic and don't affect the semantics.
