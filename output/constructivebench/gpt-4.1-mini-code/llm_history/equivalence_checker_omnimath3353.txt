Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: 2 * (Complex.cosh (Real.log 2009)) ^ 2 - Complex.sinh (Real.log (2009 ^ 2))
Let me analyze the problem and the proposed answer.

The problem involves complex trigonometric and hyperbolic functions. The key identities to consider are:

1. Complex cosine: cos(ix) = cosh(x)
2. Complex sine: sin(ix) = i*sinh(x)
3. Double angle formula for cosh: 2cosh²x = cosh(2x) + 1
4. sinh(2x) = 2sinh(x)cosh(x)

Let's break down the original expression:
1. The first term: 2 * cos(log(2009)*i)² = 2 * cosh(log(2009))²
2. The second term: i * sin(log(4036081)*i) = i * (i*sinh(log(4036081))) = -sinh(log(4036081))

Note that 4036081 = 2009², so log(4036081) = 2log(2009)

Thus the expression becomes:
2cosh²(log(2009)) - sinh(2log(2009))

Using the double angle formula for cosh:
= [cosh(2log(2009)) + 1] - sinh(2log(2009))
= 1 + cosh(2log(2009)) - sinh(2log(2009))

The proposed answer is:
2cosh²(log(2009)) - sinh(2log(2009))

This matches exactly with our transformation of the original expression.
