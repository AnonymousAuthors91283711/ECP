The problem involves a geometric series with terms depending on a and r, and given sums S4 and S8 composed of powers of r. We want to find the possible values of a (and implicitly r) that satisfy the sum conditions:
- S4 = a(1 + r + r^2 + r^3) = 6 + 6√2
- S8 = a(1 + r + r^2 + r^3 + r^4 + r^5 + r^6 + r^7) = 30 + 30√2

We suspect (a, r) are real numbers satisfying these sums. To explore this numerically, we enumerate possible pairs (a, r) for small rational values and check sums approximately to guess solutions.

We print all (a, r) pairs that closely satisfy the sums (within a small tolerance) and then conjecture the relationship or exact values for a, possibly involving √2.

```python
from math import sqrt, isclose

# Target sums
S4_target = 6 + 6 * sqrt(2)
S8_target = 30 + 30 * sqrt(2)

# Define geometric partial sums
def partial_sum(a, r, n):
    if abs(r - 1) < 1e-12:
        return a * n
    return a * (1 - r**n) / (1 - r)

# We try small rational pairs for a and r (denominators up to 10)
# Only positive r close to 1 will be searched for efficiency

tolerance = 1e-6
candidates = []

# Enumerate candidate 'a' and 'r' in [0.1, 10] with step 0.1
for numerator_a in range(1, 101):
    a = numerator_a / 10
    for numerator_r in range(1, 101):
        r = numerator_r / 100  # r in (0.01, 1]
        S4 = partial_sum(a, r, 4)
        S8 = partial_sum(a, r, 8)
        if isclose(S4, S4_target, rel_tol=tolerance) and isclose(S8, S8_target, rel_tol=tolerance):
            print(f"a={a:.3f}, r={r:.3f} S4={S4:.6f}, S8={S8:.6f}")
            candidates.append((a, r))

# If we found candidates, print the one with minimal a
if candidates:
    min_a = min(a for a, r in candidates)
    print(f"\nMinimum a found satisfying conditions: {min_a:.6f}")
else:
    print("No candidates found within the searched range.")
```
