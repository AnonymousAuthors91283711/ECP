The problem considers finite nonempty subsets A of natural numbers with the property that for all a in A, either 2a in A or a is divisible by 3 and a/3 in A. We want to characterize such sets.

To assist understanding, I enumerate small finite subsets A of ℕ up to some size and check the property, printing those that satisfy it. This might give a sense of the structure.

```python
# Enumerate candidate sets A of small size from {1,...,n_max} and print those satisfying:
# ∀ a ∈ A, either 2a ∈ A or (a divisible by 3 and a/3 ∈ A).

def satisfies_property(A):
    A_set = set(A)
    for a in A_set:
        if (2*a not in A_set) and (a % 3 != 0 or (a // 3) not in A_set):
            return False
    return True

def main():
    n_max = 10  # max number elements and max element value
    # To limit output, only consider subsets of size 1 to 4
    from itertools import combinations
    for k in range(1,5):
        print(f"Checking subsets of size {k} from [1..{n_max}]")
        for A in combinations(range(1,n_max+1), k):
            if satisfies_property(A):
                print("Set:", A)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
