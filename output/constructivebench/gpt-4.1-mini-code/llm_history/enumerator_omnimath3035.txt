The problem involves the Diophantine-like equation \( 2x - 3z = 5y \), where \(x, y \in \mathbb{Z}\) and \(z \in \mathbb{Q}\), and asks to find \(z\) as a function of \(x, y\). We want to enumerate pairs \((x, y)\) and print the corresponding \(z\).

From the equation, rearranged:

\[
3z = 2x - 5y \implies z = \frac{2x - 5y}{3}
\]

This gives the exact expression for \(z\). We can verify this for integer pairs by enumerating over small ranges.

The program will enumerate \(x, y \in [-5, 5]\) and print the pair and the exact fraction \(z\ = (2x - 5y)/3\).

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def omnimath3035_answer(x, y):
    # Returns z = (2x - 5y) / 3 as a rational number
    return Fraction(2 * x - 5 * y, 3)

def main():
    print("Enumerating (x, y) in [-5,5], z = (2x - 5y)/3:")
    for x in range(-5, 6):
        for y in range(-5, 6):
            z = omnimath3035_answer(x, y)
            print(f"x={x}, y={y} -> z={z}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
