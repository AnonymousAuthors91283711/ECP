The problem seems to be counting the number of four-digit numbers divisible by 11, whose digit sum is also divisible by 11. This Python program enumerates all numbers from 1000 to 9999, checks divisibility by 11 and the digit sum divisibility by 11, and prints each number satisfying both conditions. Finally, it prints the total count.

```python
def digit_sum(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

count = 0
for n in range(1000, 10000):
    if n % 11 == 0:
        s = digit_sum(n)
        if s % 11 == 0:
            print(n)  # Print each qualifying number immediately
            count += 1
print("Count:", count)  # Print the total count at the end
```
