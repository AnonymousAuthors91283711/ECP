The problem essentially asks: given integers \(a, f, g\) with their average \(\frac{a+f+g}{3} = 22\), and with \(a=23\), \(f=24\), find \(g\). I enumerate possible \(g\) values consistent with the average equation and provided values, and print the results.

```python
# Enumerate possible g given (a+f+g)/3 = 22, with a=23 and f=24
a = 23
f = 24
avg = 22
# Since average equation: (a+f+g)/3 = avg => g = 3*avg - a - f
g = 3*avg - a - f
print(f"a={a}, f={f}, avg={avg}")
print(f"g = 3*{avg} - {a} - {f} = {g}")
```
