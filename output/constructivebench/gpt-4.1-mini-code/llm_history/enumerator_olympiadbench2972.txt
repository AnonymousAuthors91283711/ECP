The problem involves real positive numbers a, b, c, d and a base b > 0, b ≠ 1, with conditions on logarithms:

log_b(a) c = T  
log_b(b) d = T, and T ≠ 0

We want to evaluate:

\[ \frac{\log_{\sqrt{a b}} (c d)^3}{\log_a c + \log_b d} \]

Given the symmetry and constraints, let's enumerate some small positive values for a, b, c, d, and base b (positive and not equal to 1), keeping T constant and printing the values found to conjecture the closed form.

We'll:
- Choose T = 1, 2 (e.g., try T=1).
- Use a and c such that log_b(a) c = T. Since log_b c / log_b a = T → c = a^T.
- Similarly, d = b^T.
- Then compute the expression and print the result.

This will help us see if the expression simplifies to something dependent on T only or other parameters.

```python
import math

def log_base(base, x):
    # Logarithm of x with given base
    return math.log(x) / math.log(base)

def eval_expression(T, a, b):
    # Given T, a, b compute c = a^T, d = b^T
    c = a**T
    d = b**T

    # Compute numerator: log_{sqrt(a*b)}((c*d)^3)
    base_num = math.sqrt(a * b)
    val_num = (c * d)**3
    numerator = log_base(base_num, val_num)

    # Compute denominator: log_a c + log_b d
    denom = log_base(a, c) + log_base(b, d)

    # Final value
    result = numerator / denom if denom != 0 else None
    return result

def main():
    Ts = [1, 2]  # sample T values
    # sample a,b values >0 and not equal 1 for log bases
    samples = [
        (2, 3),
        (3, 2),
        (4, 5),
        (5, 4)
    ]
    for T in Ts:
        print(f"T = {T}")
        for a,b in samples:
            val = eval_expression(T, a, b)
            if val is not None:
                print(f"a={a}, b={b} => value = {val:.6f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
