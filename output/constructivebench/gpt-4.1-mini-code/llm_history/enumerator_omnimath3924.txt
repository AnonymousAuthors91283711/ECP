The problem involves sequences \( a: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R} \) that are expansive on the interval \([0,C]\) with the condition \(|a_i - a_j| \geq \frac{1}{j}\) for all \(i < j\). The goal is to characterize the set of all such \(C\) for which such sequences exist.

To help conjecture the answer, we enumerate for small values of \(C\) and try to find explicit sequences \(a\) inside \([0,C]\) meeting the expansiveness condition for increasing \(n\). We print any found \(C\) and sequences or partial sequences matching the conditions, hoping to detect any minimal or maximal \(C\).

We focus on small \(C\) and increasing \(n\); if sequences fail to exist beyond some \(n\), it may indicate minimal thresholds for \(C\).

```python
# Enumerate candidates for C and sequences a: N -> [0,C] fulfilling |a_i - a_j| >= 1/j for i<j
# Print found C and partial sequences for small n
# This helps conjecture the set omnimath3924_answer

def is_expansive(seq):
    # Check expansiveness: |a_i - a_j| >= 1/j for i<j
    n = len(seq)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1,n):
            if abs(seq[i]-seq[j]) < 1/(j+1):
                return False
    return True

def search_sequences(C, max_len):
    # Try to build sequences in [0,C] of length max_len satisfying expansiveness
    # Using backtracking with increments of 0.1 for speed & brevity
    step = 0.1
    vals = [round(step*k,3) for k in range(int(C/step)+1)]
    seq = []
    results = []
    
    def backtrack(pos):
        if pos == max_len:
            if is_expansive(seq):
                # Print the found sequence immediately
                print(f"C={C:.2f}, seq={seq}")
                results.append(seq[:])
            return
        for v in vals:
            seq.append(v)
            if is_expansive(seq):
                backtrack(pos+1)
            seq.pop()

    # Reasonable steps: C = 0.5,1.0,1.5,2.0,2.5,3.0
