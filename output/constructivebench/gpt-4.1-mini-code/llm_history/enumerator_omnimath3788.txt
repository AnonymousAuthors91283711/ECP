[write_program]
This problem characterizes all functions \( f: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z} \) satisfying the functional equation
\[
f(4x + 3y) = f(3x + y) + f(x + 2y)
\]
for all integers \( x, y \). The goal is to conjecture the general form of such functions, parameterized by an integer \( a \).

To explore, I will:
- Enumerate integer functions \( f \) defined by choosing values \( f(0), f(1), f(2), f(3) \) and then propagate values \( f(n) \) for \( n \) from -10 to 10 using the relation.
- Verify which initial seeds produce consistent values.
- Print consistent candidates for \( f \) on a sample domain.
- Attempt to identify a pattern or linear form that might fit the relation.

```python
# enumerator.py
def check_relation(f):
    # Check the relation f(4x+3y) = f(3x+y)+f(x+2y) for x,y in small range
    for x in range(-3,4):
        for y in range(-3,4):
            lhs = f.get(4*x+3*y)
            rhs = f.get(3*x+y, None)
            rhs2 = f.get(x+2*y, None)
            if lhs is None or rhs is None or rhs2 is None:
                continue
            if lhs != rhs + rhs2:
                return False
    return True

def propagate_f(f, domain):
    # Using the relation to infer unknown values if possible
    # We'll try to fill f for all n in domain if a consistent solution exists
    changed = True
    while changed:
        changed = False
        for x in range(-3,4):
            for y in range(-3,4):
                k = 4*x+3*y
                a = 3*x+y
                b = x+2*y
                if k in domain and domain[k] is None:
                    if (a in domain and domain[a] is not None) and (b in domain and domain[b] is not None):
                        domain[k] = domain[a] + domain[b]
                        changed = True

def main():
    # We test initial seeds on small domain -5..5
    # Let's try f(0) = 0 fixed (without loss of generality), and sweep f(1), f(2), f(3) in [-2,2]
    domain = {i: None for i in range(-12,13)}
    domain[0] = 0

    for f1 in range(-2,3):
        for f2 in range(-2,3):
            for f3 in range(-2,3):
                # reset domain
                for k in domain:
                    domain[k] = None
                domain[0] = 0
                domain[1] = f1
                domain[2] = f2
                domain[3] = f3

                propagate_f(domain, domain)

                # verify relation
                if check_relation(domain):
                    # print some values to guess form
                    values = [domain.get(i, None) for i in range(-5,6)]
                    print(f"Seed f(1)={f1}, f(2)={f2}, f(3)={f3}: values at -5..5 = {values}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This program enumerates initial values \( f(1), f(2), f(3) \) in a small range, sets \( f(0) = 0 \), then attempts to propagate the relation to infer other values in \([-12,12]\).

If the relation holds everywhere (at least tested in \([-3,3]^2\)), it prints the resulting sequence on \([-5,5]\).

By observing output candidates, one can conjecture the exact form of solutions \( f = \texttt{omnimath3788_answer}\,a \).
