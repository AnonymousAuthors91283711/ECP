Ground Truth Answer: (1.68, 0.45)
Proposed Answer: (1.6820562122898177, 0.44745897697122117)
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is extremely close to the ground truth answer, with only minor numerical differences that appear to be due to rounding or computational precision. The first component differs by about 0.002, and the second by about 0.0025, which is negligible for most practical purposes. The proposed answer would satisfy the given equations to a high degree of accuracy.
