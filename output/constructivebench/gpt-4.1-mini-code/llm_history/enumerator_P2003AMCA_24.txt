The problem involves expressions with logarithms to different bases, specifically \( \log_a\left(\frac{a}{b}\right) + \log_b\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) \) with \( a \geq b > 1 \). We want to explore this expression numerically for various pairs \((a,b)\), print the exact or floating values found, and help understand how the maximum behaves.

Below is a Python program that enumerates sample values of \(a\) and \(b\), evaluates the expression, and prints results immediately. It tries some rational values and small integers within reasonable bounds to assist conjecturing the greatest value of the expression.

```python
import math

def log_base(base, x):
    # Handle the domain explicitly, base > 1, x > 0 guaranteed from problem statement
    return math.log(x) / math.log(base)

print("# Enumerating values of log_a(a/b) + log_b(b/a) for a >= b > 1")
print("# Format: a, b, expr_value")

# Sample discrete values of b > 1 (from 1.1 to 3 by steps of 0.1)
b_values = [1 + 0.1*i for i in range(1, 21)]  # 1.1 to 3.0
# For each b, sample a >= b up to b+2 by steps of 0.2 to keep outputs short
for b in b_values:
    for k in range(0, 11):  # up to b+2
        a = b + 0.2 * k
        # Compute expression = log_a(a/b) + log_b(b/a)
        expr = log_base(a, a/b) + log_base(b, b/a)
        # Format detailed output
        print(f"a={a:.3f}, b={b:.3f}, value={expr:.6f}")

# Attempt to identify and print the maximum found value
# We'll parse results already computed and keep track of max inline for efficiency
# Here we just illustrate max value calculation for given range.

max_value = None
max_pair = None
for b in b_values:
    for k in range(0, 11):
        a = b + 0.2 * k
        expr = log_base(a, a/b) + log_base(b, b/a)
        if max_value is None or expr > max_value:
            max_value = expr
            max_pair = (a, b)
print(f"\nMaximum found value approx: {max_value:.6f} at a={max_pair[0]:.3f}, b={max_pair[1]:.3f}")
```

This program checks floating values around \(b\) and calculates the expression to help conjecture the maximum. The exact value patterns or proofs can develop from here.
