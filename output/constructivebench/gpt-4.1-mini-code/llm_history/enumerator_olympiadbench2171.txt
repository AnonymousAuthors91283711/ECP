The given functional equation is \( f(x f(x) + y) = f(y) + x^2 \) for \( f: \mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{Q} \).

We want to find all functions satisfying this. To explore, try simple forms such as constant, identity, linear functions and test rational values. The key is to find \( f(x) \) values that accommodate the equation for all \( x,y \in \mathbb{Q} \).

Below is code enumerating candidates for \( f \), assuming \( f \) is linear \( f(x) = a x + b \) with rational \( a,b \), and testing a few small rational samples for validation.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Enumerate candidates for f(x)=a*x+b with a,b in a small range
candidates = []
print("Testing linear functions f(x) = a*x + b")

# Generate small rationals for a,b
rationals = [Fraction(n, d) for n in range(-3,4) for d in range(1,4)]
def test_function(a, b):
    # Test the functional equation for several (x,y) pairs
    test_points = [Fraction(x) for x in range(-3,4)]
    for x in test_points:
        for y in test_points:
            lhs = a*(x*(a*x+b) + y) + b  # f(x*f(x)+y) = a*(x*(a*x+b)+y)+b
            rhs = a*y + b + x*x
            if lhs != rhs:
                return False
    return True

for a in rationals:
    for b in rationals:
        if test_function(a,b):
            print(f"Possible function: f(x) = ({a})*x + ({b})")

# Also test constant functions f(x)=c
print("Testing constant functions f(x)=c")
constants = rationals
for c in constants:
    # For f constant c, f(x f(x) + y) = c, f(y)=c so lhs = c, rhs= c + x^2 only if x^2=0 -> x=0 only
    # So no constant except maybe for trivial?
    if all(Fraction(x)*Fraction(x) == 0 for x in range(-3,4)):
        print(f"Constant function f(x) = {c} possible")
# Finally, print conclusion among candidates
print("Enumerated possible candidates above - verify if matches problem conditions")
```
