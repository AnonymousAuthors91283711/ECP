The problem asks to solve the equation \(3 - 5 + 7 = 6 - x\) for \(x\), and to determine the integer value of \(x\) that satisfies this equation. We will enumerate integer values of \(x\) in a reasonable range and check which satisfy the equation precisely.

```python
# Enumerate integer candidates for x to solve 3 - 5 + 7 = 6 - x
# Simplify left side: 3 - 5 + 7 = 5
# So we want 5 = 6 - x => x = 6 - 5 = 1
# This program confirms that

def main():
    lhs = 3 - 5 + 7  # sum left side: 5
    print(f"Left side value: {lhs}")
    
    # Let's test x values from -10 to 10
    for x in range(-10, 11):
        rhs = 6 - x
        if lhs == rhs:
            print(f"x = {x} satisfies 3 - 5 + 7 = 6 - x")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
