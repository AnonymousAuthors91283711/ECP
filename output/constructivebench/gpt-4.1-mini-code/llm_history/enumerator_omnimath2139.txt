The problem is to find the minimum value of the expression:
\[
z = (xy)^2 + (x+7)^2 + (2y+7)^2
\]
over real numbers \(x, y\).

We will enumerate values for \(x, y\) in a reasonable range and print candidate values of \(z\) to conjecture the minimum.

```python
# Enumerate candidates for (x,y) in a grid around -10 to 10 with step 0.5
# Print z-values sorted and track minimum found.

import math

def main():
    step = 0.5
    xs = [i * step for i in range(-20, 21)]
    ys = [i * step for i in range(-20, 21)]
    seen = set()
    min_val = None
    min_point = None
    
    for x in xs:
        for y in ys:
            xy = x * y
            z = (xy)**2 + (x + 7)**2 + (2*y + 7)**2
            # Round z to avoid duplicates with floats
            z_rounded = round(z, 6)
            if z_rounded not in seen:
                seen.add(z_rounded)
                print(f"x={x}, y={y}, z={z_rounded}")
                if (min_val is None) or (z < min_val):
                    min_val = z
                    min_point = (x,y)

    print(f"\nMinimum found: z={min_val}, at x={min_point[0]}, y={min_point[1]}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
