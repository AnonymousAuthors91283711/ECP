This problem asks to find a natural number \( n \) such that \( n^4 = 5508^3 + 5625^3 + 5742^3 \). We want to enumerate and check whether the sum of these cubes is a perfect fourth power and if so, find that \( n \).

To check this:
- Calculate the sum of cubes precisely.
- Enumerate natural numbers \( n \) around the approximate fourth root of the sum.
- Print the sum first and then test nearby \( n \).

```python
def is_perfect_fourth_power(x):
    # Check if x is a perfect fourth power by integer root extraction
    n = int(round(x ** 0.25))
    return n if n**4 == x else None

def main():
    # Given cubes
    a, b, c = 5508, 5625, 5742
    val = a**3 + b**3 + c**3
    print(f"Sum: {val}")

    # Approximate the 4th root to start checking nearby integers
    approx = int(round(val ** 0.25))
    print(f"Approximate 4th root: {approx}")

    # Check a small range around the approximation
    for n in range(approx - 5, approx + 6):
        if n > 0:
            power = n**4
            if power == val:
                print(f"Found n: {n}")
                print(f"Check: {n}^4 = {power}")
            else:
                # For partial insight, print values if close (difference <= 1_000)
                diff = abs(power - val)
                if diff <= 1000:
                    print(f"Close: {n}^4={power}, diff={diff}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
