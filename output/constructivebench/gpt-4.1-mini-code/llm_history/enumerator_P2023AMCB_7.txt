The problem concerns counting natural numbers \( n \) such that \( n > 0 \) and a certain inequality involving logarithms base 10 of \( n \) holds, with an additional restriction \( \log_{10}(n) \neq 3 \). We want to find (or conjecture) the number of such \( n \).

Since \( \log_{10}(n) \) is involved, let's set \( x = \log_{10}(n) \). Then \( n = 10^x \), and the restriction \( x \neq 3 \) corresponds to \( n \neq 10^3 = 1000 \).

The inequality is:

\[
0 \leq \frac{2x - x^2}{x - 3}, \; x \neq 3
\]

We want to find all natural numbers \( n \) such that this holds.

Approach:

1. Analyze the inequality for real \( x > 0 \), \( x \neq 3 \).
2. Find intervals in \( x \) where this inequality holds.
3. For each such interval, find all integers \( n = 10^x \) corresponding (so \( x = \log_{10}(n) \Rightarrow n = 10^x \)).
4. Enumerate these \( n \) over a reasonable range (say from 1 up to 1,000,000 to keep it manageable) and check the inequality.
5. Don't consider \( n = 1000 \) as per restriction.
6. Count how many such \( n \) exist.
7. Print each such n immediately when found.

Implementation notes:

- The function involves fractional expressions and logs, but since \( x = \log_{10}(n) \), we can get \( x \) from \( n \).
- We'll only iterate over \( n \) up to 10^6.
- For natural numbers \( n \), \( x = \log_{10}(n) = \log_{10}(n) \).
- We'll check \( 0 \leq \frac{2x - x^2}{x - 3} \) with \( x \neq 3 \).

Let's proceed to implement.

```python
# Count natural numbers n>0 (up to 10^6) satisfying:
# 0 <= (2*log10(n) - (log10(n))^2)/(log10(n) - 3) and log10(n)!=3 (i.e., n != 1000)
# Print each qualifying n immediately and count total.

import math

def f(x):
    denom = x - 3
    # avoid division by zero
    if abs(denom) < 1e-14:
        return None
    return (2*x - x**2)/denom

def main():
    limit = 10**6
    count = 0
    for n in range(1, limit+1):
        if n == 1000:
            continue
        x = math.log10(n)
        val = f(x)
        if val is None:
            continue
        if val >= 0:
            print(n)
            count += 1
    print("Count:", count)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
