Ground Truth Answer: fun (x, y, _) => x / y
Proposed Answer: fun p : ℝ × ℝ × ℝ => (p.1 + 4) / 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us a system of two equations relating x, y, z and asks us to find a function that equals 1/2 under these constraints.

2. The ground truth answer is a function that takes x and y (ignoring z) and returns x/y.

3. The proposed answer is a function that takes the triple and returns (x+4)/2 (where x is p.1).

The key observation is that under the given constraints, both functions should evaluate to 1/2. However, the proposed answer is not equivalent to the ground truth answer because:

- The ground truth answer is x/y for all inputs
- The proposed answer is (x+4)/2 for all inputs
- These are only equal under the specific constraints given in the problem, but not in general

Therefore, the answers are not equivalent functions, even though they both satisfy the equation when the constraints hold.
