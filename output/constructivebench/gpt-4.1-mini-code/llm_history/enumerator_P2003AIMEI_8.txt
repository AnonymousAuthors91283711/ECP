The problem asks to find four increasing natural numbers \(a < b < c < d\) satisfying the conditions:
\[
2b = a + c, \quad c^2 = b d, \quad d - a = 30,
\]
and to find the sum \(a+b+c+d\).

We will enumerate integer quadruples \((a,b,c,d)\) with \(d = a+30\), check the conditions, and print all solutions with their sums.

```python
# Enumerate increasing quadruples (a,b,c,d) with d=a+30 satisfying:
# 2b = a+c, c^2 = b*d, d - a = 30
# Print each quadruple and the sum a+b+c+d immediately

def main():
    for a in range(1, 100):          # a positive integer, limit search range
        d = a + 30
        for b in range(a+1, d):      # must satisfy a < b < d
            # From 2b = a + c => c = 2b - a
            c = 2*b - a
            if c <= b or c >= d:     # maintain ordering a < b < c < d
                continue
            # Check c^2 == b*d
            if c*c == b*d:
                s = a + b + c + d
                print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}, sum={s}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
