The problem appears to characterize all triples \((x, y, z) \in \mathbb{C}^3\) satisfying the system
\[
x + y + z = 3, \quad x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 3.
\]
We want to enumerate such triples and understand their structure. Since these are symmetric polynomial conditions, one natural approach is to consider the elementary symmetric sums (say, \(s_1 = x+y+z\), \(s_2 = xy+yz+zx\), \(s_3 = xyz\)) and relate the given conditions to these to identify possible roots.

I will write a Python program to enumerate triples \((x,y,z)\) with small integer values (including some complex values) that satisfy the given relations, printing exact solutions to help conjecture the full solution set.

```python
# Enumerate triples (x,y,z) in a small grid to satisfy:
# x + y + z = 3 and x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 3 over complex numbers.
# We try integer and simple complex values (real and imaginary parts in range).

def cube(x):
    return x**3

def sum_cubes(xs):
    return sum(cube(x) for x in xs)

def approx_equal(a,b,eps=1e-9):
    return abs(a-b) < eps

def print_triple(x,y,z):
    # print with exact integers or small fractions/imag
    print(f"({x}, {y}, {z})")

def is_integer_or_simple_complex(x):
    # check if x is of form a+bi where a,b in [-3..3] integers
    if isinstance(x, complex):
        a,b = x.real,x.imag
    else:
        a,b = x,0
    return (abs(a-int(a))<1e-9 and abs(b-int(b))<1e-9 and -3 <= int(a) <=3 and -3 <= int(b) <=3)

# We'll enumerate over x,y,z in {-3,..,3} + {-3i .. 3i} with integer imag parts
# to keep output brief, only print when sums match exactly.

range_vals = range(-3,4)

print("Enumerated triples (x,y,z) with integer real and imaginary parts in [-3,3]:")
for xr in range_vals:
    for xi in range_vals:
        x = complex(xr, xi)
        for yr in range_vals:
            for yi in range_vals:
                y = complex(yr, yi)
                z = 3 - x - y  # from x+y+z=3
                # check cube sum:
                s = cube(x) + cube(y) + cube(z)
                if abs(s - 3) < 1e-9:
                    # print triples with small ints/imag only
                    if (is_integer_or_simple_complex(z)):
                        print(f"x={x}, y={y}, z={z}, sum_cubes={s}")

# Also check a few special cases noted from theory:
# If x=y=z=1 => sum=3, sum_cubes=3
print("\nSpecial case: x=y=z=1")
print("(1,1,1)")

# If two are equal and z determined by sum=3, check cubic sum for nice values
print("\nChecking triples with x=y")
for r in range_vals:
    for i in range_vals:
        x = complex(r,i)
        y = x
        z = 3 - 2*x
        s = cube(x)+cube(y)+cube(z)
        if abs(s -3)<1e-9 and is_integer_or_simple_complex(z):
            print(f"x=y={x}, z={z}, sum_cubes={s}")
```
This program tries integer and simple complex values with integer real and imaginary parts from \(-3\) to \(3\). Solutions found are printed immediately.

This can help conjecture the possible triples. The known symmetric triple \((1,1,1)\) satisfies the conditions for sure.

By looking at such enumerations one may guess the full solution set involves roots of a cubic polynomial with symmetric constraints.
