The problem is to count the number of functions \( f: \{0,\ldots,9\} \to \{0,\ldots,9\} \) such that for all \(i,j\) with \(i+j+2=11\), we have \(f(i) + f(j) = 11\). Since \(i,j \in \text{Fin } 10 = \{0,\ldots,9\}\), the condition becomes \(i+j=9\). The key constraint: for all pairs of indices summing to 9, the function values sum to 11.

The pairs are \((0,9), (1,8), (2,7), (3,6), (4,5)\). The function values at these pairs sum to 11. So the values \(f(0), f(9)\) satisfy \(f(0)+f(9)=11\), similarly for others.

Therefore, \(f\) is determined by the 5 values \(f(0), f(1), \ldots, f(4)\), and the other values are \(f(9) = 11 - f(0)\), etc.

Each \(f(k)\) and \(f(9-k)\) must lie in \(\{0,\ldots,9\}\), so \(0 \le f(k) \le 9\) and \(0 \le 11 - f(k) \le 9\) which implies \(2 \le f(k) \le 9\).

So for each of the 5 "left" inputs, \(f(k)\) can be from 2 to 9. That's 8 choices each, total \(8^5\).

This reasoning leads to an answer \(8^5 = 32768\) functions.

The program should enumerate these functions' values for \(k=0,\ldots,4\) in \([2..9]\) and for each print the corresponding function and count.

We will print the parameters (the pairs), then enumerate the possible \(f\) values for \(k=0..4\) in 2..9, print the partial assignments, and finally print the count.

We keep output compact, enumerating partial answers as just tuples.

```python
# Enumerate functions f: {0..9} -> {0..9} so that for all i+j=9, f(i)+f(j)=11.
# This implies f(j) = 11 - f(i), so the function is determined by f(0..4).
# Constraints: for each k, f(k) in [2..9], so that f(9-k)=11 - f(k) in [0..9].
# Number of such functions: 8^5 = 32768.

pairs = [(0,9),(1,8),(2,7),(3,6),(4,5)]
print("Pairs (i,j) with i+j=9:", pairs)
print("f(k) in [2..9] for k=0..4")

count = 0
from itertools import product

vals = range(2,10)
for fvals in product(vals, repeat=5):
    # f(9-k) = 11 - f(k)
    # no need to check as we picked the valid range
    f_dict = {k: v for k,v in enumerate(fvals)}
    f_dict.update({9 - k: 11 - v for k,v in f_dict.items() if k < 5})
    # print function values compactly:
    # format as f(0)=v0,...f(9)=v9
    f_full = [f_dict[i] for i in range(10)]
    print(f"f: {f_full}")
    count += 1
    if count >= 10:
        print("... more omitted ...")
        break

print("Total number of such functions:", 8**5)
```
