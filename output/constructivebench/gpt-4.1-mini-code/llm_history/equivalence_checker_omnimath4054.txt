Ground Truth Answer: {n | Even n ∧ 2 ≤ n}
Proposed Answer: {n | n = 1 ∨ n = 2 ∨ n % 2 = 0}
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer:

1. Ground truth: All even numbers ≥ 2
2. Proposed answer: n=1 or n=2 or any even number (n%2=0)

The differences are:
- The proposed answer includes n=1, which isn't in the ground truth
- The proposed answer doesn't explicitly require n ≥ 2 for even numbers (though n%2=0 would include 0, but the problem is about natural numbers)

The main discrepancy is the inclusion of n=1 in the proposed answer, which shouldn't be there according to the ground truth. The rest is essentially equivalent since n=2 is already covered by "Even n ∧ 2 ≤ n".
