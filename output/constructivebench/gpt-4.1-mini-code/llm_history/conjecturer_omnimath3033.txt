  omnimath3033_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n = 1 yields day5 = 1
n = 2 yields day5 = 1
n = 3 yields day5 = 1
n = 4 yields day5 = 1
n = 5 yields day5 = 1
n = 6 yields day5 = 1
n = 7 yields day5 = 1
n = 8 yields day5 = 1
n = 9 yields day5 = 1
n = 10 yields day5 = 1
n = 11 yields day5 = 1
n = 12 yields day5 = 1
n = 13 yields day5 = 1
n = 14 yields day5 = 1
n = 15 yields day5 = 1
n = 16 yields day5 = 1
n = 17 yields day5 = 1
n = 18 yields day5 = 1
n = 19 yields day5 = 1
n = 20 yields day5 = 1
n = 21 yields day5 = 1
Minimal n with day5=1 is 1. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
