[write_program]
This problem asks for the greatest natural number \( k \) such that there exists a function \( f: \{0,\dots,7\}^2 \to \{0,\dots,k-1\} \) assigning colors to an 8x8 grid, with each cell having at least 2 neighbors of the same color. We enumerate colorings for increasing \( k \), checking this condition.

The program tries small \( k \) values and generates colorings (pruned by symmetry and partial neighbor checks) to find valid assignments.

```python
# Enumerate colorings of 8x8 grid with colors in range(k), such that each cell has â‰¥2 neighbors of same color
# Due to combinatorial explosion, we only check k=1..4, showing found valid k.
# We print each k for which a coloring is found.

from itertools import product

N=8
# neighbor offsets
neighbors = [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)]

            c = grid[i][j]
            count = 0
            for di,dj in neighbors:
                ni,nj = i+di,j+dj
                if 0<=ni<N and 0<=nj<N and grid[ni][nj]==c:
                    count+=1
            if count<2:
                return False
    return True

    # due to huge space (k^(64)), try simple heuristic:

    # For k=1, print it immediately.
    if k==1:

        return True
