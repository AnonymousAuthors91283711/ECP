The problem is to find the smallest natural number \(n\) such that for any function \(f : \text{Fin } 100 \to \mathbb{R}_{>0}\), there exists an injective function \(s : \text{Fin } n \to \mathbb{R}\) whose range consists only of numbers that are either values of \(f\) or sums of subsets of the 100 positive values of \(f\), and such that the range of \(f\) is contained in the range of \(s\).

This involves covering all \(f(i)\) values and various subset sums by \(n\) distinct real numbers. We want to conjecture the minimal such \(n\).

A direct formula or proof is complicated, so I will enumerate possible values of \(n\) and check for simple examples \(f\) if all required sums and \(f(i)\) can be injectively covered by \(n\) numbers. The full sum set has \(2^{100}\) elements, so direct enumeration is impossible.

But since \(f\) is arbitrary positive values, let's consider small cases and \(f(i)=1\)'s or small sets of integers and check the minimal \(n\) that allows an injective \(s\) covering the singletons and subset sums.

We will try small \(n\) (like 100 (covering singletons), 101, ... 128, ... up to 100+100) and see if the subsets sums can be covered by \(n\) distinct sums or singletons. Print the \(n\) and current test results to conjecture.

```python
# Enumerate possible n covering all f(i) values and sums of subsets for small sample f
# Since the problem is for 100 elements, we test smaller sized sets due to complexity, extrapolating.

from itertools import combinations
import sys

def test_cover(n, elements):
    # elements: list of positive real numbers (here integers for simplicity)
    # We want to see if it's possible for a set s of size n, with values in elements or sums of subsets,
    # so that s includes all elements and s is injective
    # Since n is the size of s, and s must cover all elements and sums of subsets at least for the given elements.
    #
    # For testing, we simulate:
    # - the set M = {f(i)} âˆª {sum of any subset of elements}
    # The test: is |M| <= n?
    # Because s's range must injectively list all these numbers.
    # If n < |M|, it's impossible.
    # For f with k elements, |M|=2^k subsets sums including empty = 2^k, missing empty sum?
    # The problem states sums over t in Finset, so possibly empty subset is excluded.
    # So |M|=2^k -1, plus the single f(i) in elements which are included already.
    # So |M|=2^k -1
    #
    # So we check if n >= 2^k -1 to cover all sums including singletons.
    #
    # We print the sets and n for small k <= 10.

    k = len(elements)
    from math import comb

    # Number of sums to cover = 2^k - 1 (all nonempty subsets sums)
    needed = 2**k - 1
    print(f"k={k}, elements={elements}")
    print(f"Number of sums to cover (excluding empty): {needed}")
    print(f"Testing n={n}: ", end="")
    if n >= needed:
        print("POSSIBLE to cover all sums with injective s")
    else:
        print("IMPOSSIBLE to cover all sums with injective s")

def main():
    # Sample sizes to test due to complexity (since full 100 is huge)
    # For n from k to 2^k -1 for small k, we print whether coverage is possible.
    # Also test with uniform elements

    # Test with k=3 to 8, increasing n from k up to 2^k -1
    for k in range(3, 9):
        elements = [1] * k  # all equal for simplest f
        max_needed = 2**k -1

        for n in range(k, max_needed+1):
            test_cover(n, elements)
            # Limit output length, break after first confirm possibility
