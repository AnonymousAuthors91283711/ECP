The problem involves integer variables \( m, n \in \mathbb{Z} \) related by the equation \( m + 1 = \frac{n - 2}{3} \). We want to understand the expression \( 3m - n \) in terms of these parameters. Given the linear relationship, it's natural to express \( n \) in terms of \( m \), then compute \( 3m - n \) exactly.

We enumerate integer values of \( m \) and derive \( n \) to verify the relationship and compute the expression \( 3m - n \). We print all values found and check if there's a pattern or unique output. Since \( n - 2 \) must be divisible by 3, we only consider such \( n \).

```python
# Enumerate integer pairs (m,n) satisfying m + 1 = (n - 2)/3, n in [-10..10], m derived.
# For each, print the values and also compute 3*m - n.
# This helps conjecture the constant value of 3*m - n (the answer).

print("Enumerating (m,n) with m+1=(n-2)/3 and computing 3*m - n:")

for n in range(-10, 11):
    # Check if (n-2) divisible by 3 so m integer
    if (n - 2) % 3 == 0:
        m = (n - 2)//3 - 1
        val = 3*m - n
        print(f"m={m}, n={n} => 3*m - n = {val}")

# From output, identify the constant or conjecture the simplified value:
# Then print the final conjecture:
print("\nConjectured omnimath3070_answer:", -5)
```
