The problem asks for the greatest sum \( s \) of a strictly increasing list \( l \) of primes \( p < 50 \) each satisfying \( p + 1 = a^k \) for some integers \( a, k \geq 2 \).

To explore, enumerate all primes under 50, test if \( p+1 \) is a perfect power with exponent at least 2, collect such primes, then find all strictly increasing subsets and their sums.

```python
import math
from itertools import combinations

def is_perfect_power(n):
    # Check if n = a^k for some a≥1, k≥2
    for k in range(2, int(math.log2(n)) + 2):
        a = round(n ** (1/k))
        # check nearby integers due to rounding
        for base in [a-1, a, a+1]:
            if base > 1 and base**k == n:
                return True
    return False

primes = [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47]

# Filter primes p where p+1 is perfect power with k>=2
filtered_primes = []
for p in primes:
    if is_perfect_power(p+1):
        print(f"Prime {p} has p+1={p+1} as perfect power")
        filtered_primes.append(p)

max_sum = 0
max_combo = []

# Enumerate increasing subsets (all subsets of filtered_primes)
for r in range(1, len(filtered_primes)+1):
    for combo in combinations(filtered_primes, r):
        s = sum(combo)
        print(f"Sum {s} from {combo}")
        if s > max_sum:
            max_sum = s
            max_combo = combo

print(f"Maximum sum found: {max_sum} from primes {max_combo}")
```

This enumerates all subsets of primes under 50 matching the perfect power condition for \( p+1 \), prints each candidate sum immediately, and finally prints the maximum sum found and the subset.
