The problem is to find real numbers \( x > 0 \) such that

\[
\log_2(x) \cdot \log_3(x) = 2(\log_2(x) + \log_3(x)).
\]

Since the equation is symmetric and involves logarithms with different bases, one can try some values for \( x \) and numerically or symbolically verify the equation. Let's enumerate \( x \) values of the form \( x = 2^a 3^b \) with small integers \( a, b \), since logs simplify nicely, to check when the relation holds exactly or nearly.

```python
import math

# Since log2(x) = a, log3(x) = b implies x = 2^a * 3^b,
# we try integer combinations for a, b in a small range.

print("Checking x = 2^a * 3^b for integers a,b in [-5..5], x>0")
solutions = []
for a in range(-5, 6):
    for b in range(-5, 6):
        # Compute x
        x = (2 ** a) * (3 ** b)
        if x <= 0:
            continue
        # Compute logs
        log2x = a  # since log2(2^a * 3^b) = a + b*log2(3), but we have to be precise
        # Wait, actually: log2(x) = a + b * log2(3)
        # log3(x) = a * log3(2) + b
        log2_3 = math.log2(3)
        log3_2 = math.log(2) / math.log(3)

        log2x = a + b * log2_3
        log3x = a * log3_2 + b

        lhs = log2x * log3x
        rhs = 2 * (log2x + log3x)

        # Check if lhs == rhs approximately (since float)
        # Using a tolerance
        if abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-10:
            print(f"x = 2^{a} * 3^{b} = {x:.6f} satisfies the equation.")
            solutions.append(x)

# Also test some integer values directly:
for x in [1,2,3,4,6,9,12,18,27,36,54,81]:
    log2x = math.log2(x)
    log3x = math.log(x) / math.log(3)
    lhs = log2x * log3x
    rhs = 2 * (log2x + log3x)
    if abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-10:
        print(f"x = {x} satisfies the equation.")

# Print all found solutions explicitly
if solutions:
    min_sol = min(solutions)
    max_sol = max(solutions)
    print(f"Enumerated candidate solutions: {sorted(solutions)}")
    print(f"Minimum solution found: {min_sol}")
    print(f"Maximum solution found: {max_sol}")
else:
    print("No solutions found in the tested range.")
```
