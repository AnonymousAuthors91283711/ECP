The problem involves finding the maximum size \(m\) of a family of 2-subsets of \(2n\) elements with the property that any \((k+1)\)-subset of indices contains two whose 2-subsets intersect. This is a combinatorial extremal problem. We'll enumerate candidates for small values \(k,n\) and increasing \(m\), test the condition, and print verified values of \(m\).

```python
import itertools

# Check if family f of subsets of [2n], each size 2, satisfies:
# For every (k+1)-subset of indices from [m], there exist i,j distinct with f[i], f[j] intersecting.
def check_family(m, k, n, family):
    # family: list of sets of size 2
    # indices: 0..m-1
    for subset in itertools.combinations(range(m), k+1):
        # Check if all pairs disjoint in this subset?
        # We want to find i,j with intersecting f[i], f[j], so disjointness fails
        # If no such pair found, condition fails
        found = False
        for i, j in itertools.combinations(subset, 2):
            if family[i].intersection(family[j]):
                found = True
                break
        if not found:
            return False # condition fails
    return True

    # Enumerate families of size m - large so limit enumeration by heuristic
    # To limit computations, enumerate over combinations of two_subsets of size m (indices of f)
    for family_indices in itertools.combinations(range(len(two_subsets)), m):
