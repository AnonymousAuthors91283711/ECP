Ground Truth Answer: fun n => n * (n + 1) / 2
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => n + (n + 1) * n / 2
Let me analyze the two answers:

1. Ground Truth: n*(n+1)/2
2. Proposed: n + (n+1)*n/2

Let's simplify the proposed answer:
n + (n+1)*n/2 = n + (n² + n)/2 = (2n + n² + n)/2 = (n² + 3n)/2

Compare with ground truth:
n*(n+1)/2 = (n² + n)/2

These are clearly different expressions. For example:
- When n=1:
  Ground truth: 1*2/2 = 1
  Proposed: (1 + 3)/2 = 2
- When n=2:
  Ground truth: 2*3/2 = 3
  Proposed: (4 + 6)/2 = 5

The answers give different results and are not equivalent.
