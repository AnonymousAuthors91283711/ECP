[write_program]
The problem asks about the greatest value of a set derived from angles \(\theta_1, \theta_2\) on the circle and a complicated "smallest_piece" formula involving arc lengths defined by these angles. We want to enumerate possible values of the expression for sample angles \(\theta_1, \theta_2\) and analyze the output.

Below is a Python program that:
- Samples angles \(\theta_1, \theta_2\) discretely in \([0,2\pi)\),
- Computes the pieces as in the problem,
- Computes `smallest_piece / (2 * pi)`,
- Prints each value when found,
- Tracks candidates to conjecture the greatest value.

```python
import math

def mod2pi(x):
    return x % (2*math.pi)

def smallest_piece(theta1, theta2):
    # Compute Δθ as abs difference mod 2pi
    dtheta = abs(theta1 - theta2)
    dtheta = min(dtheta, 2*math.pi - dtheta)  # arc length min
    
    piece1 = dtheta
    piece2 = math.pi - max(dtheta, 2*math.pi - dtheta)
    piece3 = 2*math.pi - piece1 - piece2
    sp = min(piece1, piece2, piece3)
    return sp

def main():
    n = 100  # number of discrete samples for theta1, theta2
    seen = set()
    candidates = []
    print("Enumerating values of smallest_piece/(2π) for θ1, θ2 in [0,2π):")
    for i in range(n):
        theta1 = 2*math.pi * i / n
        for j in range(n):
            theta2 = 2*math.pi * j / n
            if abs(theta1 - theta2) < 1e-12:
                continue  # θ1 ≠ θ2
            sp = smallest_piece(theta1, theta2)
            val = sp / (2*math.pi)
            # Round to avoid too many near duplicates
            val_r = round(val, 6)
            if val_r not in seen:
                seen.add(val_r)
                candidates.append(val_r)
                print(val_r)
    max_val = max(candidates)
    print("\nGreatest candidate value found:")
    print(max_val)

    main()
