The problem is to find integers x,y such that 2*x² + 8*y = 26, and then examine the value x - y. We want to find possible values of x - y for integer solutions (x,y). The program will enumerate integer x in a reasonable range and compute corresponding y. If y is integer, it will print x,y and x-y values.

Since 2*x² ≤ 26, x² ≤ 13, so |x| ≤ 3 (since 4²=16>13). So we can restrict x to -3..3 and find integer y.

```python
# Enumerate integer solutions (x,y) to 2*x^2 + 8*y = 26, print x,y and x-y
for x in range(-3,4):
    left = 2*x*x
    rest = 26 - left
    # check if rest divisible by 8
    if rest % 8 == 0:
        y = rest // 8
        diff = x - y
        print(f"x={x}, y={y}, x - y={diff}")
```
