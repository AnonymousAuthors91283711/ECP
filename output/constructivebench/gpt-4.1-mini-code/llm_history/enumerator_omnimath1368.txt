The problem involves sets of natural numbers containing 0 and closed under adding 8 and 9, and asks for the size (cardinality) of such a set (likely the minimal or maximal such set under constraints). To help conjecture the cardinality, we can enumerate numbers reachable from 0 by adding combinations of 8 and 9 up to a certain bound, and print all reachable numbers.

```python
# Enumerate numbers reachable from 0 by adding 8 or 9, up to 100.
# Print each reachable number immediately.
# This will help observe the structure of the set and conjecture its size.

def main():
    from collections import deque
    max_val = 100
    reachable = set()
    q = deque([0])
    reachable.add(0)
    while q:
        x = q.popleft()
        print(x)  # Print each number as soon as we find it
        for nxt in (x+8, x+9):
            if nxt <= max_val and nxt not in reachable:
                reachable.add(nxt)
                q.append(nxt)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
