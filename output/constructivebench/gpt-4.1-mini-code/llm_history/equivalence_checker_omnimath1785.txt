Ground Truth Answer: fun r g b => (r^2 + g^2 + b^2) / (r + g + b)^2
Proposed Answer: fun r g b => (5 : ℚ) / (12 : ℚ) * (r / 97 : ℚ) + (5 : ℚ) / (12 : ℚ) * (g / 97 : ℚ) + (5 : ℚ) / (12 : ℚ) * (b / 97 : ℚ)
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

1. Ground truth: (r² + g² + b²)/(r + g + b)²
2. Proposed: (5/12)*(r/97) + (5/12)*(g/97) + (5/12)*(b/97) = (5/12*97)*(r + g + b)

Given the problem constraints:
- r + g + b = 97
- (r(r-1) + g(g-1) + b(b-1))*12 = 97*96*5

Let's simplify the second condition:
r² - r + g² - g + b² - b = (97*96*5)/12
r² + g² + b² - (r + g + b) = 97*8*5
r² + g² + b² - 97 = 97*40
r² + g² + b² = 97*41

Now let's evaluate both answers:
1. Ground truth: (97*41)/97² = 41/97
2. Proposed: (5/12*97)*97 = 5/12

These are clearly different (41/97 ≈ 0.4227 vs 5/12 ≈ 0.4167). The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth.
