The errors occur because q1Yes, q2Yes, q3Yes are defined inside the theorem and thus are not accessible outside it, where you try to define P2022AMCA_9_answer. To fix this, define P2022AMCA_9_answer as a function that takes these parameters as inputs, or hardcode the values. Since the problem gives fixed values, we can define P2022AMCA_9_answer as a constant ℕ with the expression evaluated using those given numbers:

From the system of equations:

t + l + a = 31  
t + a = 22  
a + l = 15  
t + l = 9  

Adding (t + a) and (a + l) and (t + l) gives: (t+a)+(a+l)+(t+l) = 22+15+9 = 46  
This equals 2(t + l + a) + a = 2*31 + a = 62 + a, so 46 = 62 + a → a = -16 which is impossible. Wait, that suggests an inconsistency, so let's just trust the formula already given:

t = (q1Yes + q3Yes - q2Yes) / 2

Plugging in q1Yes=22, q3Yes=9, q2Yes=15:

t = (22 + 9 - 15)/2 = (16)/2 = 8  

This matches one solution enumerated and is the intuitive solution to the intersection problem.

So final answer is 8.

Expressed in Lean as a number 8.
