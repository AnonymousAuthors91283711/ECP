theorem omnimath3977 (m n : ℕ) :
  m^2 + 2 * 3^n = m * (2^(n+1) - 1) ↔ (m, n) ∈ omnimath3977_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating (m,n) pairs satisfying m^2 + 2*3^n = m*(2^{n+1}-1):
(m,n) = (9,3)
(m,n) = (6,3)
(m,n) = (54,5)
(m,n) = (9,5). Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ)
<<<{(6, 3), (9, 3), (9, 5), (54, 5)}>>>
