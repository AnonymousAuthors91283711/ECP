Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {n : ℕ | n ≥ 2 ∧ (∑ d in Nat.divisors n, d) = n * (Nat.primeFactors n).sup id}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is close but not exactly equivalent. The original problem divides the sum of divisors by the largest prime factor and compares it to n, while the proposed answer multiplies n by the largest prime factor and compares it to the sum of divisors. These are algebraically equivalent when the largest prime factor is non-zero (which it always is for n ≥ 2), but the proposed answer doesn't explicitly state the n ≥ 2 condition. The mathematical content is essentially the same, but the presentation differs slightly.
