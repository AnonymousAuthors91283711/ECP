theorem P2014AMCB_4 (m b : ℚ) (hm : m > 0) (hb : b > 0) :
  (4 * m + 3 * b) * 2 = 2 * m + 16 * b ↔ m = P2014AMCB_4_answer * b := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating candidate values for m/b satisfying (4m + 3b)*2 = 2m + 16b:
m/b = 5/3 satisfies the equation.
m/b = 5/3 satisfies the equation.
m/b = 5/3 satisfies the equation.
Answer: m/b = 5/2. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
<<<5 / 2>>>
