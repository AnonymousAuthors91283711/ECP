The problem involves evaluating a double product over the complex numbers of the form:

\[
\prod_{a=0}^{2014} \prod_{b=0}^{2014} \left(1 + \exp\left(\frac{2\pi i ab}{2015}\right)\right)
\]

and then taking the real part of the logarithm of this product, normalized by \(\log 2\). The goal is to understand or conjecture the value of

\[
\frac{\log \left|\prod_{a,b} \left(1 + e^{2\pi i ab / 2015}\right)\right|}{\log 2}.
\]

Instead of working with the complicated full range \(2015\), I will test smaller values \(N\) and look at the product

\[
P(N) = \prod_{a=0}^{N-1} \prod_{b=0}^{N-1} \left(1 + e^{2\pi i ab / N}\right).
\]

I will compute the magnitude of this product, take its \(\log_2\), and print these values for several small \(N\) to identify possible patterns. The outputs will be exact whenever possible, but due to complex exponentials I'll print floating approximations of the logarithms.

```python
import math
import cmath

def compute_log2_product(N):
    # Compute the product of 1 + exp(2πi * a * b / N) for 0 ≤ a,b < N
    total_log = 0.0  # will hold sum of logs of abs terms
    for a in range(N):
        for b in range(N):
            angle = 2 * math.pi * a * b / N
            val = 1 + cmath.exp(1j * angle)
            # Use abs because the log of product equals sum of logs of magnitudes if we take real part
            total_log += math.log(abs(val))
    # Normalize by log(2) to compute log base 2
    return total_log / math.log(2)

print("N  log2(|product|)")
for N in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]:
    val = compute_log2_product(N)
    print(f"{N:2d} {val:.6f}")
```

This small program will print the values for several \(N\). We can observe patterns and conjecture the relationship to \(N\). This helps to formulate or guess the exact answer for \(N=2015\).
