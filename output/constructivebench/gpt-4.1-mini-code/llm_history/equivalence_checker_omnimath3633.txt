Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (2 * n + 1) * (n + 1)
Proposed Answer: fun n => n * (2 * n + 1)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum number of True entries (1s) in a (2n+1)×(2n+1) Boolean matrix Q where for any 2×2 submatrix, the sum of its entries is ≤ 2.

2. The ground truth answer is (2n+1)(n+1), which can be expanded to 2n² + 3n + 1.

3. The proposed answer is n*(2n+1), which expands to 2n² + n.

For n=0:
- Ground truth: (0+1)(0+1) = 1
- Proposed: 0*(0+1) = 0
The proposed answer is incorrect for n=0.

For n=1:
- Ground truth: (2+1)(1+1) = 3*2 = 6
- Proposed: 1*(2+1) = 3
Incorrect again.

For n=2:
- Ground truth: (4+1)(2+1) = 5*3 = 15
- Proposed: 2*(4+1) = 10
Still incorrect.

The proposed answer consistently underestimates the correct value and has a different quadratic form. The answers are not equivalent.
