The problem involves two positive real numbers x and y meeting certain multiplication constraints, and asks for the value of (x+1)(y+1). We will enumerate rational candidates for x and y that satisfy the equations approximately, then compute (x+1)(y+1). We'll sample x and y based on the constraints and print candidates satisfying all constraints closely.

```python
# Enumerate positive rationals approximating given constraints,
# print (x+1)*(y+1) for candidates satisfying equations roughly.

def close(a, b, tol=1e-6):
    return abs(a - b) < tol

# Given x*y = 1/9, so y = 1/(9x)
# We also require x*(y+1) = 7/9 and y*(x+1) = 5/18.
# Substitute y = 1/(9x) into other equations:
# Check which x > 0 satisfy both equations closely.

def main():
    from fractions import Fraction
    from math import isclose

    target_xy = Fraction(1, 9)
    target_x_yplus1 = Fraction(7, 9)
    target_y_xplus1 = Fraction(5, 18)

    # Check x in (0, 2] with small enough step for rationals
    # We'll generate fractions with denominators up to 50 for manageability.
    denominators = range(1, 51)
    numerators = range(1, 101)

    printed = set()

    for d in denominators:
        for n in numerators:
            x = Fraction(n, d)
            if x <= 0:
                continue
            y = target_xy / x  # y = 1/(9x)
            if y <= 0:
                continue
            # Compute x*(y+1)
            val1 = x * (y + 1)
            if not close(val1, target_x_yplus1, tol=1e-6):
                continue
            # Compute y*(x+1)
            val2 = y * (x + 1)
            if not close(val2, target_y_xplus1, tol=1e-6):
                continue

            ans = (x + 1) * (y + 1)
            if ans not in printed:
                printed.add(ans)
                print(f"x = {x}, y = {y}, (x+1)(y+1) = {ans} â‰ˆ {float(ans):.6f}")
