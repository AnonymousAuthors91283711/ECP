Ground Truth Answer: {1, 2, 3, 5}
Proposed Answer: {1, 3, 4, 5}
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

The problem asks for a set of 4 natural numbers {a,b,c,d} where:
1. All three combinations (a*b + c*d), (a*c + b*d), and (a*d + b*c) must be prime numbers
2. The set must have exactly 4 elements (cardinality = 4)

Testing the ground truth {1,2,3,5}:
- 1*2 + 3*5 = 17 (prime)
- 1*3 + 2*5 = 13 (prime)
- 1*5 + 2*3 = 11 (prime)

Testing the proposed {1,3,4,5}:
- 1*3 + 4*5 = 23 (prime)
- 1*4 + 3*5 = 19 (prime)
- 1*5 + 3*4 = 17 (prime)

Both sets satisfy all the given conditions. While the ground truth uses {1,2,3,5}, the proposed {1,3,4,5} also works perfectly and meets all requirements.

<<<True>>>
