The problem asks for a unique natural number \(N\) between 400 and 600, such that \(N\) is odd, divisible by 5 and 11, and the sum of its decimal digits equals some answer value. We want to enumerate all numbers \(N\) that satisfy the divisibility and range constraints, filters for odd, then compute the digit sum and output the finding. This helps conjecture the unique \(N\) and the digit sum.

```python
# Enumerate candidate numbers N with:
# 400 < N < 600, odd, divisible by 5 and 11 (i.e., divisible by 55),
# then print N and sum of digits

def digit_sum(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

print("Candidates N and their digit sums:")
candidates = []
for N in range(401, 600):
    # Divisible by 5 and 11 means divisible by 55
    if N % 55 != 0:
        continue
    if N % 2 == 0:  # Not odd
        continue
    s = digit_sum(N)
    print(f"N={N}, digit_sum={s}")
    candidates.append((N, s))

# After enumeration, identify unique candidate if any with unique sum
if len(candidates) == 1:
    N, s = candidates[0]
    print(f"Unique candidate found: N={N} with digit sum {s}")
else:
    # Check if digit sums are unique and only one N matches a digit sum
    sums = {}
    for N, s in candidates:
        sums.setdefault(s, []).append(N)
    unique_sums = [s for s in sums if len(sums[s]) == 1]
    if len(unique_sums) == 1:
        s = unique_sums[0]
        N = sums[s][0]
        print(f"Unique digit sum candidate: N={N} with digit sum {s}")
    else:
        print("No unique digit sum candidate found.")
```
