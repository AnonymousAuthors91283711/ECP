[write_program]
The problem seems to be about evaluating and simplifying an expression involving a real number \( x \) with the condition \( x = 3 \), and then expressing the simplified result as the answer. To explore this, the program will enumerate different values of \( x \), print the computed value of \(- (5x - 6x)\) for those \( x \), and highlight the case when \( x=3 \).

```python
# Enumerate values of x, compute and print -(5*x - 6*x)
# Special interest in x=3
def main():
    print("Enumerating -(5*x - 6*x) for x in range -5 to 5:")
    for x in range(-5, 6):
        value = -(5*x - 6*x)  # Simplifies to -( -x ) = x
        print(f"x = {x}, value = {value}")
    # Highlight the case x=3
    x = 3
    value = -(5*x - 6*x)
    print(f"Special case x=3, value = {value}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
