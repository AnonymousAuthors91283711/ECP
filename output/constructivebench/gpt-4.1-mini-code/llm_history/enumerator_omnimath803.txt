The problem involves real numbers \( x, y \) such that \(-1 < x < y < 1\), and two defined values \( G = \frac{x}{1-y} \) and \( G' = \frac{y}{1-x} \), with the condition \( G = G' \). The goal is to determine \( x + y \) under these constraints.

To explore this, I'll write a Python program that enumerates possible pairs \((x,y)\) in the range \(-1 < x < y < 1\), calculates \(G\) and \(G'\), checks if they are equal (within a tolerance for floating-point equality), and prints corresponding sums \(x + y\).

```python
# Enumerate x, y in (-1,1) with x<y, check G=G', print sums x+y

def floats(start, end, step):
    # generate float values from start to end exclusive
    x = start
    while x < end:
        yield x
        x += step

eps = 1e-9  # tolerance for equality
step = 0.1  # step size for enumeration - balance coverage and brevity

print("Enumerating pairs (x,y) with -1 < x < y < 1 and G=G' condition:")

for x in floats(-0.9, 0.9, step):
    for y in floats(x + 0.01, 0.9, step):
        denom1 = 1 - y
        denom2 = 1 - x
        if abs(denom1) < 1e-12 or abs(denom2) < 1e-12:
            continue
        G = x / denom1
        Gp = y / denom2
        if abs(G - Gp) < eps:
            s = x + y
            # Print exact sums if possible, else float
            print(f"x={x:.2f}, y={y:.2f}, sum={s:.5f}, G=G'={G:.5f}")
```
This prints candidate sums satisfying the equality, facilitating recognizing the pattern or closed form of \(x+y\).
