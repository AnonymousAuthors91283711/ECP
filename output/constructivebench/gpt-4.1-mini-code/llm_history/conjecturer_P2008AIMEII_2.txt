The Lean error can be fixed by marking the answer as noncomputable because it involves real number division. Also, in Lean, the let statements in the theorem body need to be separated properly by semicolons or placed on separate lines. The correct answer is the speed v = 1 / 7.5, which matches the enumerated solution, so we simply mark the constant as noncomputable and format the theorem correctly.

The main issues in your Lean code are syntax-related and noncomputability related to division in reals.

1. Division over real numbers requires the declaration to be noncomputable because it relies on classical logic and is not computable in the constructive sense.
2. The let statements in Lean's term syntax must be separated with either commas or line breaks. You cannot just put spaces between them.
3. `1 / 7.5` is a real number division and requires the definition of `P2008AIMEII_2_answer` to be marked `noncomputable`.

Thus:

- Mark `P2008AIMEII_2_answer` as `noncomputable`.
- Use `let` statements properly separated by commas or line breaks.
- Assign the answer as `1 / 7.5` but write it as `1/7.5` or `1/(7.5 : ℝ)` with proper coercions.
- Alternatively, write `1 / (15/2)` or `2/15` which is exactly `1/7.5`.

Since `1/7.5 = 2/15`, prefer exact rational form `2/15` to avoid floating-point literals.

Hence, the fixed answer expression is `2/15`.

The error comes from trying to write `noncomputable def` directly inside the abbrev assignment, which expects a term, not a definition. Instead, provide directly the term expression for the value. Also, the let bindings inside the theorem statement need to be separated properly with semicolons or newlines. 

From the enumerated value v = 1/7.5 = 2/15, the answer is `2 / 15` in ℝ. So write

`abbrev P2008AIMEII_2_answer : ℝ := 2 / 15`

with no `noncomputable def`. 

Finally, the let block should use semicolons or newlines, and better parentheses:

```
let r_time := 50 / v + 5 * (50 - 1);
let j_time := 50 / (0.75 * v) + 5 * (50 / 2 - 1);
r_time = j_time ∧ j_time = P2008AIMEII_2_answer
```

Putting all this together:

<<<2 / 15>>>
