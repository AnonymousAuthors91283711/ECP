We have the system of equations involving real numbers \(x, y, z\) and a parameter \(T\):

\[
T = \frac{1}{40}, \quad x + y = 5, \quad x^2 - y^2 = \frac{1}{T}, \quad x - z = -7
\]

We want to find \(x + z\).

Note that:

\[
x^2 - y^2 = (x - y)(x + y) = \frac{1}{T} = 40
\]

Given \(x + y = 5\), this implies:

\[
(x - y) \cdot 5 = 40 \implies x - y = 8
\]

From the system:

\[
x + y = 5, \quad x - y = 8 \implies x = \frac{5 + 8}{2} = 6.5, \quad y = \frac{5 - 8}{2} = -1.5
\]

Also:

\[
x - z = -7 \implies z = x + 7 = 6.5 + 7 = 13.5
\]

Finally,

\[
x + z = 6.5 + 13.5 = 20
\]

The answer is \(20\).

To verify, I will write a Python program that enumerates and confirms these relations with the given \(T\) and finds \(x + z\).

```python
# Enumerate possible answers for the system:
# T = 1/40, x + y = 5, x^2 - y^2 = 1/T = 40, x - z = -7
# Find x + z.

def approximate_eq(a, b, eps=1e-9):
    return abs(a - b) < eps

def solve_for_example():
    T = 1/40
    target = 1/T  # 40
    sum_xy = 5
    diff_xz = -7

    # From x^2 - y^2 = (x - y)*(x + y) = 40
    # Since x + y = 5, (x - y)*5 = 40 => x - y = 8
    x_minus_y = 8

    # Compute x and y
    x = (sum_xy + x_minus_y)/2
    y = (sum_xy - x_minus_y)/2

    # Compute z from x - z = -7
    z = x - diff_xz  # since x - z = -7 => z = x + 7

    x_plus_z = x + z

    print(f"T = {T}")
    print(f"x + y = {sum_xy}")
    print(f"x - y = {x_minus_y}")
    print(f"x = {x}")
    print(f"y = {y}")
    print(f"x^2 - y^2 = {x**2 - y**2}")
    print(f"x - z = {x - z}")
    print(f"x + z = {x_plus_z}")

    # Confirm all equations
    if approximate_eq(x + y, sum_xy) and approximate_eq(x**2 - y**2, target) and approximate_eq(x - z, diff_xz):
        print(f"Found consistent solution: x + z = {x_plus_z}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_for_example()
```
This meets the requirement by printing immediately the intermediate values and the final answer \(x+z=20\).
