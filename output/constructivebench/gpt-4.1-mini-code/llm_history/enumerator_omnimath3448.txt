The problem involves evaluating the expression \((\sqrt{100} + \sqrt{9})(\sqrt{100} - \sqrt{9})\). By the difference of squares formula, this simplifies to \(100 - 9 = 91\). I will write a Python program that calculates this expression for sample pairs of perfect squares and prints the results immediately.

```python
import math

# Enumerate sample pairs of perfect squares and compute (sqrt(a) + sqrt(b)) * (sqrt(a) - sqrt(b))
# We know that this simplifies to a - b, so this program confirms the pattern for small values.
sample_pairs = [(100, 9), (25, 16), (81, 36), (49, 4), (64, 1)]
for a, b in sample_pairs:
    val = (math.sqrt(a) + math.sqrt(b)) * (math.sqrt(a) - math.sqrt(b))
    print(f"For a={a}, b={b}, (√a+√b)(√a−√b) = {val}")

# Specifically for the problem's values:
a, b = 100, 9
answer = (math.sqrt(a) + math.sqrt(b)) * (math.sqrt(a) - math.sqrt(b))
print(f"Answer for (√100 + √9)(√100 - √9): {answer}")
```
