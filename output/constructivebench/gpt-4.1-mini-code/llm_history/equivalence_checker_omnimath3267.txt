Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: (1014, 6)
<<<None>>>
Since the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's not provided), we cannot verify whether the proposed answer (1014, 6) is equivalent to it. The problem involves complex mathematical relationships between polynomial evaluations and Fibonacci-like sequences, and without knowing the correct answer, we cannot determine equivalence. The "None" response indicates we're unsure about their equivalence due to missing information.
