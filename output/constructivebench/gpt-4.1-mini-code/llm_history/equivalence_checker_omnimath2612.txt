Ground Truth Answer: 3240
Proposed Answer: 120 * 3 ^ 3
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer.

The problem is asking for the number of pairs of subsets (S, T) of a 10-element set where the union S ∪ T has exactly 3 elements.

The ground truth answer is 3240.

The proposed answer is 120 * 3^3 = 120 * 27 = 3240.

Let's verify the proposed answer:
1. 120 is the number of ways to choose 3 distinct elements from 10 (10 choose 3 = 120)
2. For each of these 3 elements in the union, it can be:
   - Only in S
   - Only in T
   - In both S and T
   Hence 3 options per element, and 3^3 for 3 elements
3. This gives exactly 120 * 27 = 3240

The proposed answer correctly breaks down the counting and arrives at the same final number as the ground truth.
