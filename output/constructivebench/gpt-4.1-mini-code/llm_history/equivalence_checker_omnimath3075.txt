Ground Truth Answer: 55/441
Proposed Answer: 1/6
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is calculating the probability that when two dice are rolled (one for Robbie, one for Francine), Robbie's result plus 8 is greater than Francine's result plus 10 (i.e., r - f > 2).

2. The total number of possible outcomes is indeed 6 * 6 = 36 (not 441 as in the ground truth answer denominator).

3. Let's count the favorable outcomes where r - f > 2:
   - If r=4: f can be 1 (1 case)
   - If r=5: f can be 1,2 (2 cases)
   - If r=6: f can be 1,2,3 (3 cases)
   Total favorable cases = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6

4. Probability = favorable/total = 6/36 = 1/6

The ground truth answer of 55/441 appears incorrect as:
- The denominator should be 36, not 441
- The numerator count of 55 is much too high for this scenario

The proposed answer of 1/6 is correct.
