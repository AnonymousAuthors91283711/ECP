The problem involves two distinct quadratic functions \( f(x) = x^2 + a x + b \) and \( g(x) = x^2 + c x + d \), with several constraints. The goal is to find possible values for \( a + c \).

Given the complexity, let's enumerate possible values of \(a, b, c, d\) for small integers, check the constraints, and print values of \(a + c\) that satisfy all.

```python
# Enumerate integer parameters a,b,c,d in a small range
# f(x) = x^2 + a*x + b, g(x) = x^2 + c*x + d
# Constraints:
# f != g
# g(-a/2) = 0
# f(-c/2) = 0
# inf range f = inf range g (minima equal)
# f(2012) = g(2012) = -2012

def f(x,a,b): return x*x + a*x + b
def g(x,c,d): return x*x + c*x + d

# minimum of f(x) = at x = -a/2
# minimum value f_min = f(-a/2) = (-a/2)^2 + a*(-a/2) + b = b - a^2/4
# Similar for g_min = d - c^2/4
# sInf(range f) = min value of f, same for g => b - a^2/4 = d - c^2/4

for a in range(-10,11):
  for b in range(-20,21):
    for c in range(-10,11):
      for d in range(-20,21):
        # f != g
        if a == c and b == d:
          continue
        # g(-a/2) =0
        x1 = -a/2
        if abs(g(x1,c,d))>1e-12:
          continue
        # f(-c/2) =0
        x2 = -c/2
        if abs(f(x2,a,b))>1e-12:
          continue
        # minima equal
        fmin = b - (a*a)/4
        gmin = d - (c*c)/4
        if abs(fmin - gmin) > 1e-12:
          continue
        # f(2012) = g(2012) = -2012
        val_f = f(2012,a,b)
        val_g = g(2012,c,d)
        if abs(val_f + 2012) > 1e-6 or abs(val_g + 2012) > 1e-6:
          continue
        # all conditions met, print answer a+c
        print(f'a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}, a+c={a+c}')
```

The original program appears logically sound in its conditions: it correctly encodes the constraints from the problem and enumerates plausible small integer coefficients. The ranges for a, b, c, d seem sufficiently large to catch integer solutions if they exist. The formulas for the minimum values, the function values at -a/2 and -c/2, the minimum-value equality, and the function values at 2012 are all implemented correctly.

However, the program outputs nothing, suggesting there are no integer solutions in the given range. The problem's conditions might admit real or rational solutions that are not integers or require more thorough search or relaxed numeric tolerances.

Overall, the logic is correct, but we should:
- Widen the search space slightly (to catch possibly off-by-one values).
- Possibly allow float coefficients or rationals, but that would be complex.
- Also, relaxing the floating tolerance on g(-a/2), f(-c/2) and min equality may help.
- Print some diagnostic info to verify sample points.

Since the problem states the program must stream answers immediately and print exact or approximate values, and the original program prints nothing (no outputs found), it fails to produce any output in the allowed range. Without any positive result, it does not fulfill the requirement to enumerate answers.

Therefore, I must reject it. I will produce a corrected program that searches a wider range, uses less strict floating-point tolerance, and prints out candidate values as soon as they are found. Also, I will add printing of the problem parameters used for clarity. Finally, I will restrict output to a manageable token length by stopping after a small number of solutions or pruning.

<<<False>>>

```python
# Enumerate integer parameters a,b,c,d in wider range with relaxed tolerances
# f(x) = x^2 + a*x + b, g(x) = x^2 + c*x + d
# Constraints from problem:
# f != g
# g(-a/2) = 0 and f(-c/2) = 0
# minima equal: b - a^2/4 = d - c^2/4
# f(2012) = g(2012) = -2012

def f(x,a,b): return x*x + a*x + b
def g(x,c,d): return x*x + c*x + d

The provided input is a math problem statement from a formal proof assistant environment (Lean), but there is no Python program attempting to enumerate answers or explore the problem space. Without any program given, there is nothing to accept or reject in terms of correctness or efficiency.

The problem itself is quite abstract â€” it defines two quadratic functions f and g with parameters a,b,c,d, gives several conditions (including vertex conditions, minimal values equal, intersection at a certain point), and defines an answer as a + c.

Since no program is provided, it must be rejected as not meeting the requirement of enumerating answers or providing any outputs.

Therefore:

1. Explanation: The problem statement is given but no program is provided to solve or enumerate answers. The requirement is to provide a Python program that enumerates answers or candidate values according to the instructions. Since the program is absent, it is rejected.

2. Judgment: <<<False>>>

3. Since rejected, I will provide a corrected Python program that tries to explore the problem numerically, assuming small integer ranges for a, b, c, d, verify conditions approximately, and print candidate values of a+c with the problem's conditions.

Note: The problem is somewhat complicated; it involves quadratic functions f(x) = x^2 + a x + b, g(x) = x^2 + c x + d, conditions on vertices and values, and the unknown sum a+c.

I will implement a program that:

- uses small integer ranges for a and c first,

- computes b and d from the vertex conditions:

  Given vertex of f is at x = -a/2; vertex value f(-a/2) = (-a/2)^2 + a*(-a/2) + b = -a^2/4 + b

  Since g(-a/2) = 0, and g(x) = x^2 + c*x + d, then:

  g(-a/2) = (-a/2)^2 + c*(-a/2) + d = ?

  Also vertex of g at x = -c/2, f(-c/2) = 0.

- Use these relations to solve for b,d per each a,c tried.

- Check the conditions that minimal values sInf (range f) = sInf(range g) means vertex values are equal.

- Also check f(2012) = -2012 and g(2012) = -201
