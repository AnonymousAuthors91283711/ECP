The problem asks to find the sum of all 5-digit palindromes, i.e., numbers between 10000 and 99999 whose digits reversed equal the original number. We want to enumerate all 5-digit palindromes and sum them up.

A 5-digit palindrome is of the form ABCBA, where A â‰  0, and A, B, C are digits from 0 to 9. We can generate these numbers by iterating over A, B, C, and construct ABCBA.

The program will:
- Iterate over all valid digits A, B, C.
- Construct the palindrome number.
- Print each palindrome found (stream immediately).
- Sum all palindromes and print the final sum.

```python
# Enumerate all 5-digit palindromes of form ABCBA and sum them
def main():
    total_sum = 0
    for a in range(1, 10):  # A != 0
        for b in range(0, 10):
            for c in range(0, 10):
                palindrome = 10000*a + 1000*b + 100*c + 10*b + a
                print(palindrome)
                total_sum += palindrome
    print("Sum of all 5-digit palindromes:", total_sum)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
