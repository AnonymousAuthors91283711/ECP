The problem is to characterize the set of all sums of prime factors of composite numbers \( n > 1 \). We want to enumerate such sums for small composite \( n \) to conjecture the answer.

```python
from sympy import primefactors, isprime

print("Enumerating sums of prime factors for composite n > 1:")

# We'll check composite n up to 100 and print sums of prime factors
sums_found = set()
for n in range(2, 101):
    if not isprime(n):
        primes = primefactors(n)
        s = sum(primes)
        if s not in sums_found:
            sums_found.add(s)
            print(f"n={n}, prime factors={primes}, sum={s}")

print("\nSmallest and largest sums found:")
print(min(sums_found), max(sums_found))
```
