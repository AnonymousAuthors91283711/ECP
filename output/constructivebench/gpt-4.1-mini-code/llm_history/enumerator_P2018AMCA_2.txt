The problem is to find the greatest value \(v\) defined as \(v = 14a + 11b + 2c\) for nonnegative integers \(a,b,c \leq 20\), subject to the constraint \(5a + 4b + c \leq 18\).

We will enumerate all possible triples \((a,b,c)\) with \(a,b,c \leq 20\) and \(5a+4b+c \leq 18\), compute \(v\), and print all values found as candidates. At the end, we print the maximum \(v\).

To optimize:
- Since \(c \leq 20\) but \(5a +4b + c \leq 18\), \(c\) is at most 18, so limit search accordingly.
- Similarly limit \(a,b\) to feasible ranges to keep it fast.

```python
# Enumerate all triples (a,b,c) with 0 <= a,b,c <= 20, 5a+4b+c <=18
# compute v=14a+11b+2c, print each v found.
# At the end, print the maximum v.

max_val = None
print("Enumerating values of v=14a+11b+2c with 5a+4b+c <= 18, a,b,c <=20")
for a in range(20+1):
    max_c_for_a = 18 - 5*a
    if max_c_for_a < 0:
        continue
    for b in range(20+1):
        max_c_for_ab = max_c_for_a - 4*b
        if max_c_for_ab < 0:
            continue
        c_max = min(20, max_c_for_ab)
        for c in range(c_max+1):
            v = 14*a + 11*b + 2*c
            print(v)
            if (max_val is None) or (v > max_val):
                max_val = v
print("Maximum v =", max_val)
```
