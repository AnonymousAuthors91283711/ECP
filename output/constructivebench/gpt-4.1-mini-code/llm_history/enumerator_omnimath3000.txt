[write_program]
The problem is about counting how many numbers from the set S = {19, 21, 23, 25, 27} can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.

We will write a Python program to:
- Define the set S
- Check for each n in S if it can be expressed as p + q where p and q are primes
- Print out each n that satisfies the condition immediately
- Finally print the total count (which corresponds to the cardinality asked)

We will use a simple prime checking function and enumerate pairs efficiently.

```python
# Check if a number is prime
def is_prime(x):
    if x < 2:
        return False
    if x == 2:
        return True
    if x % 2 == 0:
        return False
    r = int(x**0.5) + 1
    for i in range(3, r, 2):
        if x % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

S = {19, 21, 23, 25, 27}

count = 0
print(f"Set S = {sorted(S)}")
for n in sorted(S):
    found = False
    # Since p and q are primes and p + q = n, p <= n//2 to avoid double counts
    for p in range(2, n//2 + 1):
        if is_prime(p):
            q = n - p
            if is_prime(q):
                print(f"{n} = {p} + {q} (both primes)")
                found = True
                break
    if found:
        count += 1

print(f"Count of numbers in S expressible as sum of two primes: {count}")
```
