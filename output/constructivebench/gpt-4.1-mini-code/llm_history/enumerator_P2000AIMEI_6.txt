The problem asks for counting integer pairs \((x,y)\) with \(0 < x < y < 10^6\) such that \(\frac{x+y}{2} = 2 + \sqrt{xy}\).

Rearranging:
\[
\frac{x+y}{2} - 2 = \sqrt{xy} \implies \left(\frac{x+y}{2}-2\right)^2 = xy.
\]

Set \(a = \frac{x+y}{2}\), then
\[
(a - 2)^2 = xy.
\]

Since \(a = \frac{x+y}{2}\), write the quadratic in terms of \(x\):
\[
(a-2)^2 = x(2a - x).
\]

Rewrite:
\[
(a - 2)^2 = 2 a x - x^2.
\]

This is a quadratic equation in \(x\):
\[
x^2 - 2 a x + (a - 2)^2 = 0.
\]

Its solutions are \(x = a \pm \sqrt{a^2 - (a - 2)^2} = a \pm \sqrt{4 a - 4} = a \pm 2\sqrt{a - 1}.\)

For integer \(x,y\), \(x,y\) are roots, so roots must be integers. That means \(\sqrt{a-1}\) must be rational (integer, since \(a\) integer or half-integer). Let's try \(a-1 = k^2\) for integer \(k\). Then roots are

\[
x = a \pm 2k, \quad y = a \mp 2k.
\]

Because \(x,y\) are integers, and \(a = \frac{x+y}{2}\), \(x,y = a \pm 2k\).

We want \(0 < x < y < 10^6\).

Using these formulas, enumerate possible \(a,k\) with integer constraints and verify inequalities.

We'll enumerate small \(k\) and \(a\) and print pairs.

```python
# Enumerate integer pairs (x,y) with 0 < x < y < 10^6 satisfying (x+y)/2 = 2 + sqrt(xy).
# Using derived parametrization:
# Let a = (x+y)/2, then (a - 2)^2 = x y
# Solutions: x = a - 2k, y = a + 2k with a-1 = k^2, so a = k^2 +1, k>=1
# Conditions: 0 < x < y < 10^6

LIMIT = 10**6

def main():
    for k in range(1, 1000):  # k up to 999 to keep within range
        a = k*k + 1
        x = a - 2*k
        y = a + 2*k
        if x <= 0:
            continue
        if y >= LIMIT:
            break
        # Check the equation to confirm
        lhs = (x + y)/2
        rhs = 2 + (x*y)**0.5
        # Because x,y constructed, this must hold, but check float approx to confirm
        if abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-9:
            print(f"x={x}, y={y}, a={a}, k={k}")
    print("Enumerated all pairs with k up to 999")
