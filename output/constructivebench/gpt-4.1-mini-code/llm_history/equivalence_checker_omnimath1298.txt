Ground Truth Answer: fun (n, m) => if Even n ∨ Even m then choose (n + m) n else 0
Proposed Answer: fun p : ℕ × ℕ => Nat.choose (p.1 + p.2) p.1 - Nat.choose (p.1 + p.2) (p.1 - 1)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about counting certain binary paths (functions from Fin(n+m) to Bool) with constraints on the counts of false/true values and parity conditions.

2. The ground truth answer states:
   - If either n or m is even, the count is choose(n+m, n)
   - Otherwise, the count is 0

3. The proposed answer gives a formula: choose(a+b,a) - choose(a+b,a-1) where (a,b) = p

Key observations:
- The proposed answer is actually the formula for the Catalan-like numbers (difference of binomial coefficients)
- The ground truth is simpler and depends on parity
- These are not equivalent in general. For example:
  - When n=2, m=2: 
    - Ground truth: choose(4,2) = 6 (since at least one is even)
    - Proposed: choose(4,2)-choose(4,1) = 6-4 = 2
  - When n=3, m=3:
    - Ground truth: 0 (both odd)
    - Proposed: choose(6,3)-choose(6,2) = 20-15 = 5

The answers give different results and are based on different approaches. The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth's parity condition.
