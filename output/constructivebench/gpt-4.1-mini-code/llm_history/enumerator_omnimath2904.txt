The problem is to find the least natural number \( n \) greater than 20 such that:
- \( 13 + \frac{n - 20}{4} = \frac{n}{2} \)
- \( (n - 20) \mod 4 = 0 \)

Since \( (n-20) \) must be divisible by 4, let \( k = \frac{n - 20}{4} \). Then \( n = 20 + 4k \) with \( k \geq 1 \). Substitute into the equation:
\[
13 + k = \frac{20 + 4k}{2} = 10 + 2k
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
13 + k = 10 + 2k \implies 3 = k
\]
So \( k = 3 \), and thus \( n = 20 + 4 \times 3 = 32 \).

The program below checks values \( n > 20 \) with \( (n-20) \mod 4 = 0 \), tests the equation, and prints all that satisfy it until the least is found. Then the minimum is identified explicitly.

```python
# Enumerate n > 20 with (n-20) divisible by 4 and check equation 13 + (n-20)/4 = n/2 

def main():
    candidates = []
    for k in range(1, 10):  # small range for efficiency
        n = 20 + 4 * k
        left = 13 + k  # since (n-20)/4 = k
        right = n / 2
        if left == right:
            print(f"Found candidate n = {n}")
            candidates.append(n)
    if candidates:
        print("Minimum n =", min(candidates))
    else:
        print("No candidates found")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
