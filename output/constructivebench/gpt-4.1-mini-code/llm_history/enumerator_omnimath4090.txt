[write_program]
The problem involves exploring subsets of size 6 from a set of 100 elements, with conditions relating "appropriate," "perspective," and "universal" subsets. We want to find subsets meeting these conditions and eventually conjecture the truth value of `appropriate candidates`.

Due to complexity, we pick smaller sample sizes (e.g., universe of size 10, subsets of size 3 or 4) to enumerate candidates and check conditions about "appropriate" and "perspective" sets, modeled via some example predicates.

The program below:
- Uses a universe of size 10.
- Enumerates subsets of size 4 (candidate sets).
- Defines example "appropriate" and "perspective" predicates for illustration.
- Prints sets fulfilling conditions.
- Tries to verify conditions like h3 and h4 in the smaller context.
- Prints findings immediately to help conjecture.

```python
# Enumerate subsets of size k from n elements
from itertools import combinations

n = 10  # smaller universe for feasibility
k = 4   # candidate subset size for this example

U = set(range(n))

# Example "appropriate" predicate: subset sum is even (just for illustration)
def appropriate(subset):
    return sum(subset) % 2 == 0

# Example "perspective" predicate per h3: perspective(lineup) <=> 
# ∃ candidate ∉ lineup s.t lineup ∪ {candidate} is appropriate
def perspective(lineup):
    for c in U - lineup:
        if appropriate(lineup | {c}):
            return True
    return False

# universal(candidate) iff for all lineup ⊆ candidates\{candidate} with perspective(lineup), 
# lineup ∪ {candidate} is appropriate
def universal(candidate, candidates):
    other = candidates - {candidate}
    for r in range(len(other)+1):
        for lineup in combinations(other, r):
            lineup_set = set(lineup)
            if perspective(lineup_set):
                if not appropriate(lineup_set | {candidate}):
                    return False
    return True

print(f"Universe: {U}, candidate subset size: {k}\n")

# Enumerate all candidate subsets of size k whose 'appropriate' is True
candidates_list = []
for cand in combinations(U, k):
    cand_set = set(cand)
    if appropriate(cand_set):
        candidates_list.append(cand_set)
        print(f"Appropriate candidate set: {sorted(cand_set)}")

# Now filter candidate sets with exactly 6 elements if possible
# We used k=4 but let's try k=6 for demonstration
print("\nLooking for candidate subsets of size 6 with appropriate property:")
k6_candidates = []
for cand6 in combinations(U, 6):
    cand6_set = set(cand6)
    if appropriate(cand6_set):
        k6_candidates.append(cand6_set)
        print(f"Candidate size 6 appropriate set: {sorted(cand6_set)}")

if not k6_candidates:
    print("No appropriate subsets of size 6 found under example 'appropriate'.")

else:
    # Check universal property for elements in first candidate set
    cands = k6_candidates[0]
    print(f"\nCheck universal property for elements in candidate: {sorted(cands)}")
    for candidate in cands:
        res = universal(candidate, cands)
        print(f"universal({candidate}) = {res}")
```
This exploratory enumeration helps understand subsets with these predicates and conditions, supporting conjecturing the problem's truth.
