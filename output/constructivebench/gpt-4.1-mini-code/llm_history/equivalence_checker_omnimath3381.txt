Ground Truth Answer: [2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 3]
Proposed Answer: [3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2]
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

The problem defines a recursive formula that builds a number by folding a list of digits with the operation: n * (-4) + d, starting from 0. The result should equal -2013.

Let's compute both answers:

Ground Truth [2,0,0,2,0,3]:
0 * -4 + 3 = 3
3 * -4 + 0 = -12
-12 * -4 + 0 = 48
48 * -4 + 2 = -190
-190 * -4 + 0 = 760
760 * -4 + 2 = -3038 ≠ -2013

Proposed [3,0,2,0,0,2]:
0 * -4 + 2 = 2
2 * -4 + 0 = -8
-8 * -4 + 0 = 32
32 * -4 + 2 = -126
-126 * -4 + 0 = 504
504 * -4 + 3 = -2013

The proposed answer correctly evaluates to -2013, while the ground truth does not. The lists are reverses of each other, but the folding operation is sensitive to order (foldr processes from right to left).
