The problem appears to involve exploring functions \( f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) that have the property \( f(x) = f(y) \) for all real numbers \( x, y \), and some condition involving a graph string equals a specific unknown answer `omnimath3507_answer`.

Since the theorem references that such a function \( f \) exists if and only if the graph is the given answer, we want to enumerate possible candidates for the graph or characterize such functions.

Given the condition \( \forall x, y, f(x) = f(y) \), \( f \) must be a constant function. So the graph of \( f \) is a horizontal line at some \( c \in \mathbb{R} \).

To explore possible graphs or candidate constants, we can pick several constants, print their corresponding "graph" representation (as a string), and conjecture the answer.

We will:
- Select several constants \( c \) from a small set (e.g., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2).
- Print the parameter \( c \).
- Print the hypothetical corresponding graph string "y = c".
- This might help conjecture the exact answer string.

```python
# Enumerate constant functions f:R->R with f(x)=c and print their graphs as strings

def enumerate_constant_functions():
    constants = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]
    for c in constants:
        graph = f"y = {c}"
        print(f"Constant c = {c}, graph = '{graph}'")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    enumerate_constant_functions()
```
