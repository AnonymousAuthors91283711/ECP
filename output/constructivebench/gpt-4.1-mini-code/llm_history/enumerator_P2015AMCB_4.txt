This problem involves six participants with positions represented by integers mod 12 (i.e., in the range 0 to 11). The constraints create linear relationships between their positions. We want to find positions (L, M, R, A, N, Rh) in Fin 12 that satisfy:

- N + 6 = M (mod 12)
- A = R + 1 (mod 12)
- L = M + 2 (mod 12)
- R = Rh + 2 (mod 12)
- Rh = N + 1 (mod 12)
- A = 5 (fixed)

We want to enumerate all possible tuples (L, M, R, A, N, Rh) satisfying these, print them, and identify possible M. Since A=5 is fixed, we can use that to find other values. The program will iterate over possible N values and compute the rest accordingly. Positions are modulo 12 due to Fin 12.

```python
# Enumerate possible participant positions (0 to 11) for N
# and deduce other positions from given constraints.
# Print all satisfying tuples and possible M values.

def mod12(x):
    return x % 12

def main():
    A = 5  # Given fixed position of Arabi
    print("A =", A)
    print("Enumerating all tuples (L, M, R, A, N, Rh) in Fin12 satisfying given constraints:\n")
    possible_M = set()
    for N in range(12):
        M = mod12(N + 6)
        Rh = mod12(N + 1)
        R = mod12(Rh + 2)
        A_computed = mod12(R + 1)
        if A_computed != A:
            continue
        L = mod12(M + 2)
        # Print the tuple
        print(f"L={L}, M={M}, R={R}, A={A}, N={N}, Rh={Rh}")
        possible_M.add(M)
    print("\nPossible values of M:", sorted(possible_M))
    if possible_M:
        print("Selected answer M =", min(possible_M))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
