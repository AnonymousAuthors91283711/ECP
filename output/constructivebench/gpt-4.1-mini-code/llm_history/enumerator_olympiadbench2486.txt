The problem involves finding all real numbers x satisfying a set of inequalities and an equation involving logarithms with variable bases and arguments. To explore possible solutions, we can enumerate values of x in a reasonable range (guided by the domain constraints) and check the equation numerically, printing values that satisfy the equation closely. We'll print candidate solutions as we find them and approximate the logs using Python's math.log with a change of base formula.

```python
import math

# Check domain constraints and the equation for x
def check_x(x):
    # Expressions inside logs and their constraints
    a = 5*x + 9
    b = x + 3
    c = x**2 + 6*x + 9     # (x+3)^2, always â‰¥ 0
    d = 5*x**2 + 24*x + 27

    # Conditions from problem
    if not (a > 0 and a != 1):
        return False
    if not (b > 0 and b != 1):
        return False
    if not (c > 0):
        return False
    if not (d > 0):
        return False

    try:
        # compute logs with change of base
        log1 = math.log(c)/math.log(a)
        log2 = math.log(d)/math.log(b)
    except:
        return False

    total = log1 + log2

    # Check if equation holds approximately (4)
    if abs(total - 4) < 1e-6:
        return True
    return False

print("Enumerating candidate x values (step 0.01) in domain")

x = -2.9
while x <= 10:
    if check_x(x):
        print(f"Found candidate x = {x:.6f}")
    x += 0.01
```
