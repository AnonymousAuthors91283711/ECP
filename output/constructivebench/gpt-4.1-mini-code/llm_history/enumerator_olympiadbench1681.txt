The problem involves characterizing functions \( f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \) satisfying a certain divisibility condition with respect to prime numbers and surjectivity. We want to enumerate example functions and check the given condition for small inputs and primes to conjecture the form of \( f \).

This Python script:
- Picks small primes and checks small \( m,n \) pairs.
- Verifies divisibility condition.
- Prints possible \( f \) values and whether it satisfies the condition for these primes.
- Enumerates simple candidate functions such as linear \( f(n) = c n \) for \( c \) in a small range.

This helps conjecture the actual answer which should be some explicit form `olympiadbench1681_answer`. We output each candidate immediately and summarize the results.

```python
from sympy import primerange, isprime
from math import gcd

# Check divisibility conditions for candidate functions f on small inputs and primes
def divides(a, b):
    return b % a == 0

# Candidate functions: f(n) = c*n for integer c in [1..5]
# Check surjectivity on range [0..N], N=10
N = 10
primes = list(primerange(2, 20))

def test_function(c):
    f = lambda n: c * n
    # surjectivity on range: can f produce every number in [0..N*c]? We check [0..N*c]
    codomain = set(f(x) for x in range(N+1))
    surjective = all(y in codomain for y in range(min(codomain), max(codomain)+1))

    # Check divisibility condition for all primes and m,n in [0..N]
    valid = True
    for p in primes:
        for m in range(N+1):
            for n in range(N+1):
                lhs = divides(p, f(m+n))
                rhs = divides(p, f(m) + f(n))
                if lhs != rhs:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if not valid:
                break
        if not valid:
            break
    print(f"Test f(n) = {c}*n: Surjective={surjective}, Condition holds={valid}")

# Enumerate some candidates
for c in range(1, 6):
    test_function(c)
```
