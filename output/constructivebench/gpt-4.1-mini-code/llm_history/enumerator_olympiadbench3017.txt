The problem involves applying an operation iteratively on a sequence, where each step potentially transforms pairs `(a, b)` to `(a+1, b-1)` if `a + 1 < b - 1`. The goal is to find the least number of iterations needed to achieve an arithmetic progression.

I will write a Python program to simulate this morph operation on the initial sequence `[1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,9,9,10,10]`. The program will iterate the morph_operation repeatedly, printing each resulting sequence until it finds one that is an arithmetic progression.

```python
# Enumerate iterations of morph_sequence on the initial list
def is_arithmetic_progression(seq):
    if len(seq) <= 1:
        return True
    d = seq[1] - seq[0]
    return all(seq[i+1] - seq[i] == d for i in range(len(seq)-1))

def morph_condition(a, b):
    return a + 1 < b - 1

def morph_operation(seq):
    if len(seq) < 2:
        return seq[:]
    new_seq = seq[:]
    # Apply morph_operation to first pair only per step according to problem? 
    # Problem definition implies operation on the first pair in the sequence.
    a, b = seq[0], seq[1]
    if morph_condition(a, b):
        new_seq[0] = a + 1
        new_seq[1] = b - 1
    return new_seq

initial_seq = [1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,9,9,10,10]

seq = initial_seq[:]
print(f"Initial sequence: {seq}")
for n in range(0, 101): # limit to 100 iterations
    if is_arithmetic_progression(seq):
        print(f"Arithmetic progression at iteration {n}: {seq}")
        break
    seq = morph_operation(seq)
    print(f"Iteration {n+1}: {seq}")
else:
    print("No arithmetic progression found within 100 iterations")
```

This will print the sequence at each iteration until an arithmetic progression is found or limit is reached, aiding conjecture and understanding of the minimal iteration number.
