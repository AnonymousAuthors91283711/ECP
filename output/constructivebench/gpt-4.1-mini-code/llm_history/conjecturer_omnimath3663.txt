. Enumerated answers: Testing linear polynomial candidates f(x) = a*x + b:

Testing quadratic polynomial candidates f(x) = a*x**2 + b*x + c:
No quadratic polynomial f satisfies the functional equation exactly because LHS is degree 4 and RHS degree 3.

Example checks for f(x) = x (identity):
f(f(x)) = f(x) = x
(x -1)*f(x) + 2 = (x -1)*x + 2 = x**2 - x + 2
Not equal, so identity function is not a solution.

Testing constant functions f(x) = c:
f(f(x)) = c
(x - 1)*c + 2
For equality: c = (x -1)*c + 2 for all x, impossible unless c and x constant.
No constant function solutions.

Partial conclusion:
No linear or constant polynomial solutions. Quadratic polynomials fail degree check.
Further investigation might require non-polynomial or piecewise functions.. Expected Answer Type: Prop
