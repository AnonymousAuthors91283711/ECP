The problem involves a finite simple graph \(G\) on 100 vertices with the property that for every vertex \(u\), there exists a vertex \(v\) adjacent to \(u\) such that their neighbor sets are disjoint. The question is to find or bound the maximum number of edges \( |E(G)| \) under this condition.

To assist in conjecturing or bounding the answer, we can try smaller graphs with vertex sets \( \{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\} \) for small \( n \), enumerate all simple graphs, test the condition, and record the numbers of edges satisfying the property.

Since the full enumeration of all graphs on 100 vertices is impossible, we pick small \( n \), like \( n=4 \) or \( n=5 \), and try all graphs or many graphs with random sampling to find maximal edge counts under the condition. The program streams found candidates immediately.

```python
# Program to enumerate graphs on small n vertices satisfying:
# For every vertex u, there exists adjacent v such that neighbor sets of u and v are disjoint.
# We print the number of edges for each satisfying graph and track maximum.

    return {v for v in adj_list[u]}

    n = len(adj_list)

    for u in range(n):
        # For u, check if there is v adjacent to u with neighbors[u] disjoint from neighbors[v]
        found = False
        for v in adj_list[u]:
            if neighbors_sets[u].isdisjoint(neighbors_sets[v]):
                found = True
                break
        if not found:
            return False
    return True
