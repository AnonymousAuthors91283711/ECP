[write_program]
The given problem defines a property P on functions f: ℝ → ℝ involving a functional equation. We are asked to characterize all such functions satisfying the given equation:

f(x²) + f(2y²) = (f(x + y) + f(y)) * (f(x - y) + f(y)) for all real x,y.

To assist in finding or conjecturing the answer, I'll write a program that tests some candidate functions on many values of (x,y) and prints those which satisfy the equation within a small numerical tolerance. Since the problem likely demands exact solutions, candidates will be functions built from simple polynomials and constants. I'll enumerate:

- Constant functions f(t) = c for c in {-2,-1,0,1,2}.
- Linear functions f(t) = a t + b for small integers a,b in -2..2.
- Quadratic: f(t) = a t² + b t + c for small integer a,b,c.

For each candidate, I'll check the functional equation for a few (x,y) values in {-2,-1,0,1,2}, except for zero denominators or invalid calculations. If all tested pairs satisfy the equation with high precision, print the function as a candidate.

This helps identify potential exact solutions to the functional equation.

```python
import math

def approx_equal(a, b, tol=1e-9):
    return abs(a - b) < tol

def test_function(f, xs, ys):
    # Test equation on all pairs (x,y) in xs, ys
    for x in xs:
        for y in ys:
            lhs = f(x**2) + f(2 * y**2)
            rhs = (f(x + y) + f(y)) * (f(x - y) + f(y))
            if not approx_equal(lhs, rhs):
                return False
    return True

def main():
    xs = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]
    ys = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]

    # Enumerate constant functions f(t) = c
    for c in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
        f = lambda t, c=c: c
        if test_function(f, xs, ys):
            print(f"Constant function: f(t) = {c}")

    # Enumerate linear functions f(t) = a*t + b
    for a in range(-2, 3):
        for b in range(-2, 3):
            f = lambda t, a=a, b=b: a*t + b
            if test_function(f, xs, ys):
                print(f"Linear function: f(t) = {a}*t + {b}")

    # Enumerate quadratic functions f(t) = a*t^2 + b*t + c
    for a in range(-1, 2):
        for b in range(-2, 3):
            for c in range(-2, 3):
                f = lambda t, a=a, b=b, c=c: a*(t**2) + b*t + c
                if test_function(f, xs, ys):
                    print(f"Quadratic function: f(t) = {a}*t^2 + {b}*t + {c}")
