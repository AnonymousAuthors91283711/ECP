The problem involves identifying positive integers \(n \leq 240\) that can be represented as a sum of distinct factorials (with distinct factorial values, so no duplicates). We want to enumerate such \(n\), confirming which values are representable, printing them, and eventually finding the count (\(\text{encard}\)).

We will:
- Precompute factorials up to some max factorial close to 240.
- Generate all sums of distinct factorial subsets.
- Print each valid sum \(n\) immediately.
- Count all such \(n\).

```python
from math import factorial

# Precompute factorials <= 240 (1!, 2!, ..., max!)
factorials = []
i = 0
while True:
    f = factorial(i)
    if f > 240:
        break
    factorials.append(f)
    i += 1

# Use a set to track sums of distinct factorial subsets (no repeats)
possible_sums = set()

# Use bitmask enumeration over factorials
n_fact = len(factorials)
for mask in range(1, 1 << n_fact):
    s = 0
    # sum factorials indicated by mask bits
    for j in range(n_fact):
        if mask & (1 << j):
            s += factorials[j]
            if s > 240:
                break
    else:
        if 0 < s <= 240 and s not in possible_sums:
            possible_sums.add(s)
            print(s)  # print each found n immediately

# Print the count of all such n
print("Count:", len(possible_sums))
```
