The given problem sets \( b = \frac{a + (a+1) + (a+2) + (a+3) + (a+4)}{5} = a+2 \), since the sum of 5 consecutive numbers starting at \(a\) is \(5a + 10\), so their average is \(a+2\).

The expression to find is the average of 5 consecutive numbers starting from \(b\), which is:
\[
\frac{b + (b+1) + (b+2) + (b+3) + (b+4)}{5} = b+2.
\]

Since \(b = a+2\), the result is \(a + 4\).

Enumerated results show that if \(a=0\), result is 4; if \(a=1\), result is 5; confirming the pattern result = a + 4.

Thus the closed form answer is:

<<<fun a b => b + 2>>>
