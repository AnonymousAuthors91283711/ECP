The problem asks for the smallest size \( n \) of a finite set \( s \subseteq \mathbb{N} \) of positive integers such that every pair \( (p,q) \) with \( p+q \leq 2016 \) can be represented as sums of subsets \( t, u \subseteq s \) with sums \( p \) and \( q \), respectively.

To explore this, let's experiment with small values of \( \max(p+q) \) (e.g., 5, 10, 15, 20) and attempt to find minimal sets \( s \) that cover every sum up to that maximum. We consider \( s \) with distinct positive integers and check the subset sums to cover all numbers from 0 up to the sum limit, also ensuring the pairwise representation condition is met.

Here's a Python enumerator to test candidate sets \( s \) for sum limits up to 20, trying small sizes and printing sets that satisfy the conditions. We use powers of 2 and other small combinations to see which sizes can fully represent sums. The code checks all pairs \( (p,q) \) with \( p+q \leq max\_sum \) and verifies subset sums representation.

```python
from itertools import combinations, chain

# Generate subset sums of a set s
def subset_sums(s):
    sums = {0}
    for x in s:
        sums |= {x + y for y in sums}
    return sums

# Generate all subsets represented by their sums
def all_subset_sums(s):
    sums = set()
    s_list = list(s)
    for r in range(len(s_list)+1):
        for combo in combinations(s_list, r):
            sums.add(sum(combo))
    return sums

# Check if for all pairs p,q with p+q <= max_sum,
# there exist subsets t,u of s with sums p and q resp.
def check_set(s, max_sum):
    sums = all_subset_sums(s)
    # We map sums to sets of subsets sums for faster lookup, but sets too big, so keep sums only
    for total in range(max_sum+1):
        for p in range(total+1):
            q = total - p
            if p not in sums or q not in sums:
                return False
    return True

def main():
    max_sum_values = [5, 10, 15, 20]  # sample max sum values to test
    print("Testing sum limits and minimal set sizes for coverage")
    for max_sum in max_sum_values:
        print(f"\nMax sum: {max_sum}")
        found = False
        # Try set sizes from 1 up to length 10 (arbitrary cutoff for time)
        for size in range(1, 11):
            # Generate candidate sets with elements between 1 and max_sum
            # Using combinations with repeats is complicated, try distinct sets
            # To reduce search space, values up to max_sum (small sets)
            # Generate all combinations of size 'size' in range 1..max_sum
            candidates = combinations(range(1, max_sum+1), size)
            for s in candidates:
                if check_set(set(s), max_sum):
                    print(f"Size {size} set found: {s}")
                    found = True
            if found:
                print(f"Minimal size for max_sum {max_sum} is at most {size}")
                break
        if not found:
            print(f"No set found up to size 10 for max_sum {max_sum}")

    main()
