The problem looks for the count (cardinality) of natural numbers \( n \) such that:
- \( n \geq 10^9 \),
- \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{11} \),
- and the digits of \( n \) from the 1st to the 9th digit (from right, zero-based) are non-increasing moving left (i.e., digits form a non-increasing sequence).

Since \( n \geq 10^9 \), the number has at least 10 digits.

We want to enumerate such 10-digit numbers \( n \) divisible by 11 and whose digits satisfy the non-increasing condition on the leftmost 9 digits.

Strategy:
- Generate all 10-digit numbers with digits non-increasing from left to right.
- Check divisibility by 11.
- Count those with \( n \geq 10^9 \) (all 10-digit numbers satisfy this).
- Print each qualifying number immediately.

We will generate in decreasing order from the most significant digit to the least, ensuring \( d_i \geq d_{i+1} \) for \( i=0..8 \).

To keep computations feasible, we generate digit sequences rather than numbers, then construct \( n \) from digits.

We check divisibility by 11 using the alternating sum of digits rule:
\[
(n_0 - n_1 + n_2 - n_3 + \cdots) \equiv 0 \pmod{11}
\]
where \( n_0 \) is the most significant digit.

We print each number as soon as found.

```python
# Enumerate 10-digit numbers n with digits non-increasing left to right,
# n divisible by 11, and n >= 10^9. Print each such n.

def digits_to_num(digs):
    return sum(d * 10**(9 - i) for i, d in enumerate(digs))

def divisible_by_11(digs):
    # alternating sum from leftmost digit
    total = 0
    for i, d in enumerate(digs):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            total += d
        else:
            total -= d
    return total % 11 == 0

def search(pos, prefix, last_digit):
    if pos == 10:
        # finished digits
        n = digits_to_num(prefix)
        print(n)
        return
    # digits must be non-increasing: d[pos] <= d[pos-1]
    for d in range(last_digit, -1, -1):
        prefix.append(d)
        if pos == 9:
            # check divisibility by 11 and n>=10^9
            if prefix[0] != 0 and divisible_by_11(prefix):
                n = digits_to_num(prefix)
                print(n)
        else:
            search(pos+1, prefix, d)
        prefix.pop()

def main():
    # The most significant digit can't be 0 for a 10-digit number
    for first_digit in range(9, 0, -1):
        search(1, [first_digit], first_digit)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
