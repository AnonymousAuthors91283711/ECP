Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {x | x = 1 ∨ x = -1 ∨ x = 3 ∨ x = 2 + sqrt 2 ∨ x = 2 - sqrt 2}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer lists several roots that are indeed solutions to f(f(f(x))) = 3, but it's incomplete. The composition f(f(f(x))) is an 8th-degree polynomial, which should have up to 8 real roots (though some may be repeated). The proposed answer correctly identifies some roots (1, -1, 3, 2±√2) but misses others that would come from solving the full nested composition. Therefore, while the proposed answer contains correct elements, it's not the complete solution set.
