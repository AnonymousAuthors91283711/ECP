    sqrt (a^2 + b^2) = a + b ↔ P2021AMCA_2_answer a b := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun a b => a * b = 0 ∧ a + b ≥ 0
Proposed Answer: fun a b => (a ≥ 0 ∧ b = 0) ∨ (a = 0 ∧ b ≥ 0)
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

Ground truth: a*b = 0 ∧ a + b ≥ 0
- This means at least one of a or b is zero, and their sum is non-negative

Proposed answer: (a ≥ 0 ∧ b = 0) ∨ (a = 0 ∧ b ≥ 0)
- This is more restrictive than the ground truth, as it requires:
  - Either a is non-negative and b is exactly zero
  - Or a is exactly zero and b is non-negative

The proposed answer misses cases where:
1. One variable is negative and the other is positive (but their sum is ≥ 0)
   Example: a = -1, b = 2 (satisfies ground truth but not proposed answer)
2. Both variables are zero (satisfies both)
3. One variable is zero and the other is positive (satisfies both)

The proposed answer is a subset of the ground truth, but not equivalent to it. It's "Close" because it captures some correct cases but misses others.
