The problem involves finding a prime number \( p \) such that \(16p + 1 = n^3\) for some natural number \(n\). To assist in conjecturing the answer, we'll enumerate values of \(n\) in a reasonable range, compute \(16p + 1 = n^3\), check if \(16p + 1\) minus 1 is divisible by 16 giving \(p\), and test if \(p\) is prime. Whenever such \(p\) is found, print \(n, p\). Finally, print all found primes up to the threshold to help conjecture the prime.

```python
from sympy import isprime

# Enumerate n values to see when 16*p + 1 = n^3
print("Enumerating (n, p) with 16*p + 1 = n^3 and p prime:\n")
for n in range(2, 10000):
    val = n**3
    if (val -1) %16 != 0:
        continue
    p = (val -1)//16
    if p > 1 and isprime(p):
        print(f"n={n}, p={p} (prime)")

# No explicit maximum/minimum requested, so just enumerate and print candidates.
```
