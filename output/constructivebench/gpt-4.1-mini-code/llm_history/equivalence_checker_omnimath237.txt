open Int

abbrev omnimath237_answer : Set (Int × Int × Int) := sorry
theorem omnimath237 (a b c : Int) :
    a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = a^2 * b^2 ↔ (a, b, c) ∈ omnimath237_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(0, 0, 0)}
Proposed Answer: {(a,b,c) | (a = 0 ∧ b = 0 ∧ c = 0) ∨ (a = 1 ∧ b = 0 ∧ c = 0) ∨ (a = 0 ∧ b = 1 ∧ c = 0)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The equation is a² + b² + c² = a²b²
2. Ground truth claims only (0,0,0) satisfies this
3. Proposed answer adds two more solutions: (1,0,0) and (0,1,0)

Testing the proposed solutions:
- For (0,0,0): 0 + 0 + 0 = 0*0 → 0=0 ✓
- For (1,0,0): 1 + 0 + 0 = 1*0 → 1=0 ✗
- For (0,1,0): 0 + 1 + 0 = 0*1 → 1=0 ✗

Only (0,0,0) actually satisfies the equation. The other two proposed solutions don't work. Therefore, the proposed answer is incorrect.
