abbrev omnimath3053_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3053 (g : ℝ) (h : g > 0) : 
    g^2 - 6^2 = 45 ↔ g = omnimath3053_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Checking integers g > 0 (1 to 20)...
g = 9

Checking rational g = n/d with n,d <= 20 and g > 0...
g = 9 (exact)
g = 9 (exact)
g = 9 (exact)
g = 9 (exact)
g = 9 (exact)
g = 9 (exact)
g = 9 (exact)
g = 9 (exact)
g = 9 (exact)
g = 9 (exact)
g = 9 (exact)
g = 9 (exact)
g = 9 (exact)
g = 9 (exact)
g = 9 (exact)
g = 9 (exact)
g = 9 (exact)
g = 9 (exact)
g = 9 (exact)
g = 9 (exact)

Extremal positive solution satisfying g^2 - 36 = 45 is g = 9. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<9>>>
