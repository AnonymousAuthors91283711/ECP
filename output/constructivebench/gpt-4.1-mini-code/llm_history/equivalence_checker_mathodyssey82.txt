Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: -1
Since the problem involves finding the value of \( f(1) \) given certain conditions on the function \( f \), and the proposed answer is \(-1\), we need to verify if this is consistent with the given conditions.

1. The function \( f \) is strictly increasing (from \( hfmon \)).
2. For \( x > 0 \), \( f(f(x) + \frac{2}{x}) = -1 \).

To find \( f(1) \), let's assume \( x = 1 \):
\[ f(f(1) + 2) = -1. \]

If \( f(1) = -1 \), then:
\[ f(-1 + 2) = f(1) = -1. \]
This is consistent with the assumption \( f(1) = -1 \). 

However, we need to ensure uniqueness. Since \( f \) is strictly increasing, there is only one possible value for \( f(1) \) that satisfies the given functional equation. The proposed answer \(-1\) is indeed consistent and uniquely determined by the conditions.
