The problem involves evaluating the expression \(4x^2 - 3x^2\) given \(x=2\), and conjecturing its value by enumeration.

```python
# Enumerate values of x and evaluate 4*x^2 - 3*x^2
# Given x=2, print the evaluated result immediately
# Also try some other small integer values to observe the pattern

def evaluate_expression(x):
    return 4*x**2 - 3*x**2

sample_values = [2, 1, 3, -1, -2]

for x in sample_values:
    val = evaluate_expression(x)
    print(f"x = {x}, 4*x^2 - 3*x^2 = {val}")
```
