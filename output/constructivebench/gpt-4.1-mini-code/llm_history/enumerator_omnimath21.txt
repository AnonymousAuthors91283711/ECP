The problem is to find all quadruples \((x,y,z,w)\) of natural numbers such that:
\[2^x \cdot 3^y - 5^z \cdot 7^w = 1.\]

We'll enumerate small values for \(x, y, z, w\), print every solution found, and try to conjecture the full answer.

```python
# Enumerate quadruples (x,y,z,w) with small ranges to find all solutions to 2^x*3^y - 5^z*7^w = 1
# We print each solution immediately.

def main():
    max_exp = 20  # limit exponents to keep computations reasonable
    print("Searching solutions for 2^x * 3^y - 5^z * 7^w = 1 with exponents <= 20")
    for x in range(max_exp + 1):
        pow2 = 2**x
        for y in range(max_exp + 1):
            lhs = pow2 * (3**y)
            for z in range(max_exp + 1):
                pow5 = 5**z
                for w in range(max_exp + 1):
                    rhs = pow5 * (7**w)
                    if lhs - rhs == 1:
                        print(f"Solution found: (x,y,z,w) = ({x},{y},{z},{w})")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
