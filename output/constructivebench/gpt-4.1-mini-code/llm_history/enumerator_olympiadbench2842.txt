The problem involves rational parameters \( T, K \) with the relationship \( K = T - 2 \) and \( K \neq 0 \). The goal seems to be to find a formula for the number of required workers based on \( K \).

We have:
- rate = \( \frac{9}{K} \) widgets per worker per hour,
- requiredWorkers = \(\frac{\frac{720}{K}}{4 \times rate} = \frac{720/K}{4 \times (9/K)} = \frac{720/K}{36/K} = \frac{720}{36} = 20\).

Thus, for any valid \( K \neq 0 \), the required workers is 20, independent of \( K \). To confirm, I'll enumerate some small rational values for \( K = T-2 \neq 0 \) and print the computed required workers.

```python
# Enumerate small rational values for K = T - 2, K != 0, and compute requiredWorkers
from fractions import Fraction

def required_workers(K):
    # rate = 9 / K
    rate = Fraction(9, 1) / K
    # requiredWorkers = (720 / K) / (4 * rate)
    workers = (Fraction(720, 1) / K) / (4 * rate)
    return workers

print("Enumerating requiredWorkers for K = T - 2 (K != 0):")
sample_values = [Fraction(n, d) for n in range(-5, 6) for d in range(1, 4)]
for K in sample_values:
    if K != 0:
        rw = required_workers(K)
        print(f"K = {K}, requiredWorkers = {rw}")
        
# From the enumeration, print the extremal answer (should be unique)
print("Extremal answer: requiredWorkers = 20")
```
