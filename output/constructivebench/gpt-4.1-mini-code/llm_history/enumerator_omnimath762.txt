The problem defines a sequence \( a(n) \) with given base cases and a recurrence involving polynomial coefficients, and asks to study the series

\[
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{10^n a(n)}{n!}.
\]

The goal is to enumerate the sums of the partial sums for a reasonable range \( n = 0 \dots 15 \) to conjecture the limit. We'll compute \( a(n) \) exactly using integers, then compute partial sums of the series using floats for easy observation. Each partial sum will be printed immediately.

```python
# Enumerate a(n) and partial sums of sum_{n} (10^n * a(n))/n! to suggest the limit.
from math import factorial

def a(n, memo={0:1, 1:1, 2:3, 3:36}):
    # Recurrence:
    # a(n+4) = a(n+3) + 2*(n+3)*a(n+2) + 9*(n+3)*(n+2)*a(n+1) + 8*(n+3)*(n+2)*(n+1)*a(n)
    if n in memo:
        return memo[n]
    val = a(n-1) + 2*(n-1)*a(n-2) + 9*(n-1)*(n-2)*a(n-3) + 8*(n-1)*(n-2)*(n-3)*a(n-4)
    memo[n] = val
    return val

limit = 15
partial_sum = 0.0
print("n, a(n), partial_sum")
for n in range(limit+1):
    an = a(n)
    term = (10**n) * an / factorial(n)
    partial_sum += term
    print(f"{n}, {an}, {partial_sum:.10f}")
```
This will help conjecture the value of the series sum based on partial sums.
