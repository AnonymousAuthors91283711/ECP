The problem appears to be about counting the number of triangles formed by points on the sides of a triangle, excluding collinear triples on each side. The given values are vertices=3, abPoints=3, bcPoints=4, caPoints=5. We want to enumerate all triples of points from the total points and exclude collinear ones on each side.

The code will:
- Enumerate all combinations of 3 points from the total set.
- For points on each side (including vertices), count the collinear triples.
- Print intermediate results.
- Print the final answer: total triples minus all collinear triples.

```python
from math import comb

# Number of vertices and points on sides
vertices = 3
ab_points = 3
bc_points = 4
ca_points = 5

total_points = vertices + ab_points + bc_points + ca_points

# Total number of triples
total_triples = comb(total_points, 3)
print(f"Total number of triples from {total_points} points: {total_triples}")

# Number of points collinear on each side (vertices + side points)
ab = vertices + ab_points  # 3 + 3 = 6
bc = vertices + bc_points  # 3 + 4 = 7
ca = vertices + ca_points  # 3 + 5 = 8

# Number of collinear triples on each side = combinations of 3 points from those points
colinear_ab = comb(ab, 3)
print(f"Collinear triples on AB side ({ab} points): {colinear_ab}")

colinear_bc = comb(bc, 3)
print(f"Collinear triples on BC side ({bc} points): {colinear_bc}")

colinear_ca = comb(ca, 3)
print(f"Collinear triples on CA side ({ca} points): {colinear_ca}")

# Subtract collinear triples from total triples
answer = total_triples - (colinear_ab + colinear_bc + colinear_ca)
print(f"Number of triangles (non-colinear triples): {answer}")
```
