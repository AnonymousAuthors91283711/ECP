The problem involves characterizing integer functions \( f: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z} \) satisfying the functional equation:
\[
f(x - f(y)) = f(f(x)) - f(y) - 1 \quad \forall x,y \in \mathbb{Z}.
\]
We want to explore the possible functions \( f \) that satisfy this. To get insights, let's test simple classes of functions such as linear functions \( f(n) = a n + b \) for small integer coefficients \( a, b \) and check which satisfy the equation. This enumeration approach will hopefully produce candidate functions and aid in conjecturing the true solution set.

```python
# Enumerate candidate functions f: Z -> Z of the form f(n) = a*n + b
# for small integer a,b and check the functional equation:
# f(x - f(y)) = f(f(x)) - f(y) - 1 for all x,y in a small range
# Print each candidate immediately when all checks pass on sample range

def test_function(a, b):
    # Test domain sample range
    sample = range(-5,6)
    for x in sample:
        for y in sample:
            left = a * (x - (a * y + b)) + b
            right = a * (a * x + b) + b - (a * y + b) - 1
            if left != right:
                return False
    return True

print("Testing linear functions f(n) = a*n + b for a,b in [-3..3]:")

for a in range(-3,4):
    for b in range(-3,4):
        if test_function(a,b):
            print(f"Possible solution: f(n) = {a}*n + {b}")

# The output should help conjecture the exact form of f and then prove rigorously.
# Here, streaming results immediately as found.
```
