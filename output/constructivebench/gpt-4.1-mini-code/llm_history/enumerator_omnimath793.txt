[write_program]
The problem involves evaluating the function \(\phi_k(n, k)\), which counts integers \(x\) from \(0\) to \(\frac{n}{k}\) inclusive that are coprime to \(n\), for \(n = 2002^2 - 1\) and \(k = 2001\).

To explore the problem, I'll write a Python program to:
- Compute \(n = 2002^2 - 1\).
- Evaluate \(\phi_k(n, k)\) for the given parameters.
- Print intermediate information such as the range and some sample coprime counts.
  
The code will directly check coprimality to count valid \(x\).

```python
import math

def is_coprime(a, b):
    return math.gcd(a, b) == 1

def phi_k(n, k):
    limit = n // k
    count = 0
    for x in range(limit + 1):
        if is_coprime(x, n):
            count += 1
            print(f"x={x} coprime with n={n}")
    return count

def main():
    n = 2002**2 - 1
    k = 2001
    print(f"Computing phi_k(n, k) for n={n} and k={k}")
    result = phi_k(n, k)
    print(f"phi_k({n}, {k}) = {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This prints every coprime \(x\) found and finally prints the count \(\phi_k(n,k)\). It will help conjecture the value.
