[write_program]
The problem involves counting set families with nested inclusion and size conditions, a challenging combinatorial enumeration. I'll write a Python program to enumerate small cases (for n=1,2,3) and print out counts of such families, which can help conjecture `omnimath336_answer(n)`. The main insight is the sets S(i,j) ⊆ Fin(2n) with specific cardinalities and monotonicity constraints.

```python
from itertools import combinations

def powerset_of_fixed_size(base_set, size):
    # Generate all subsets of base_set with exact size
    return list(combinations(base_set, size))

def check_monotonicity(S, n):
    # Check S(i,j) ⊆ S(k,l) for i<=k, j<=l
    for i in range(n+1):
        for j in range(n+1):
            for k in range(i, n+1):
                for l in range(j, n+1):
                    # S[i][j], S[k][l] are sets, condition: S[i][j] ⊆ S[k][l]
                    if not set(S[i][j]).issubset(S[k][l]):
                        return False
    return True

def print_progress(n, count):
    print(f"n={n}, count of valid families: {count}")

def enumerate_S(n):
    base_set = range(2*n)  # Fin(2*n)
    # For each (i,j) in (0..n)x(0..n), generate all subsets of size i+j from base_set
    subsets = {}
    for i in range(n+1):
        for j in range(n+1):
            size = i + j
            subsets[(i,j)] = list(combinations(base_set, size))

    count = 0
    # We'll enumerate families S with property:
    # S(i,j) in subsets[(i,j)] and monotone inclusion:
    # To avoid full enumeration, work by increasing i,j in lex order,
    # ensuring monotonicity by choosing S(i,j) superset of all S(k,l) with k<=i,l<=j
    # We approximate by lex order, but due to large search space, only small n (1 or 2)
    if n > 2:
        print(f"Skipping n={n}, too large for full enumeration.")
        return None

    # Recursive generation with pruning:
    family = dict()  # keys=(i,j), values=subset chosen

    def search(i, j):
        nonlocal count
        if i == n+1:
            # Completed last row; valid family found
            count += 1
            if count <= 10:  # limit output for brevity
                print(f"Valid family #{count} at n={n} found")
            return
        if j > n:
            search(i+1, 0)
            return
        size = i + j
        prev_supersets = []
        # For monotonicity, S(i,j) must be superset of all S(k,l) with k<=i, l<=j except (i,j)
        for k in range(i+1):
            for l in range(j+1):
                if (k,l) == (i,j): continue
                if (k,l) in family:
                    prev_supersets.append(set(family[(k,l)]))
        if prev_supersets:
            lower_bound = set.union(*prev_supersets)
        else:
            lower_bound = set()

        # From subsets[(i,j)], choose those that contain lower_bound:
        candidates = []
        for candidate in subsets[(i,j)]:
            cset = set(candidate)
            if lower_bound.issubset(cset):
                candidates.append(candidate)

        for candidate in candidates:
            family[(i,j)] = candidate
            search(i, j+1)
            del family[(i,j)]

    search(0,0)
    print_progress(n, count)
    return count

def main():
    for n in range(1,4):
        enumerate_S(n)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code attempts direct enumeration for n=1,2,3, printing counts of valid families with the given properties. The combinatorial explosion prevents larger n. Observing outputs may help infer `omnimath336_answer(n)`.
