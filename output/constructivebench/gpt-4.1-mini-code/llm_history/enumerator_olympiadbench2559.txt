The problem defines sequences \( t_n = 555 - 7n \) and \( S_n = \sum_{i=1}^n t_i \), and asks to find the least \( n \) such that \( S_n < 0 \).

To assist in conjecturing the answer, I'll write a Python program that enumerates \( S_n \) for \( n \) starting from 1, printing each \( n, S_n \) until \( S_n < 0 \) is found. The program prints exact integer sums, and then outputs the smallest \( n \) for which the sum goes negative.

```python
# Enumerate sums S_n for t_n = 555 - 7n and find least n with S_n < 0

def t(n):
    return 555 - 7*n

def main():
    S = 0
    n = 1
    while True:
        S += t(n)
        print(f"n={n}, S_n={S}")
        if S < 0:
            print(f"Least n with S_n < 0 is {n}")
            break
        n += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
