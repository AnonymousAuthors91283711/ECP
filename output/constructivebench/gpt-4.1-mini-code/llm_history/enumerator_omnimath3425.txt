We want to enumerate the value of the product \(\prod_{k=2}^9 \left(1 + \frac{1}{k}\right)\) exactly as a rational number. The product is 

\[
\left(1+\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(1+\frac{1}{3}\right)\cdots \left(1+\frac{1}{9}\right) = \prod_{k=2}^9 \frac{k+1}{k}.
\]

This telescopes nicely, so we can compute both numerator and denominator systematically and output the fraction precisely.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def main():
    product = Fraction(1,1)
    print("Computing product of (1 + 1/k) for k=2 to 9:")
    for k in range(2, 10):
        term = Fraction(k+1, k)
        product *= term
        print(f"Term for k={k}: {term} => Partial product: {product}")
    print(f"\nExact product as fraction: {product}")
    print(f"As float approximation: {float(product)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
