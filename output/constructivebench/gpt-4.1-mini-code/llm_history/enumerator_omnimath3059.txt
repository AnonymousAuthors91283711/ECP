[write_program]
The problem involves evaluating the sum of multiples of 5 from 5*1 to 5*9, i.e., 5 + 10 + ... + 45. The program will enumerate and sum these values, printing each term and the running total to help conjecture the sum, then print the final total.

```python
# Enumerate and sum the sequence 5*i for i=1 to 9
total = 0
for i in range(1, 10):
    val = 5 * i
    total += val
    print(f"i={i}, 5*i={val}, running total={total}")
print(f"Final sum (omnimath3059_answer) = {total}")
```
