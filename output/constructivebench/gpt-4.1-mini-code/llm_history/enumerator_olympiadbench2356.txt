The problem is to find positive integers w, d, a, b satisfying a system of 7 linear equations with integer coefficients. We enumerate over reasonable ranges for w, d, a, b to find all solutions and print them as soon as found.

```python
# Enumerate positive integers w,d,a,b that satisfy the system of 7 linear equations.
# Output each solution immediately when found.

def main():
    # Given equations:
    # 201 = w*6 + d*4 + a*30 + b*63
    # 200 = w*6 + d*3 + a*35 + b*60
    # 192 = w*6 + d*4 + a*30 + b*54
    # 191 = w*6 + d*4 + a*28 + b*55
    # 178 = w*5 + d*7 + a*18 + b*59
    # 176 = w*4 + d*7 + a*32 + b*59
    # 176 = w*4 + d*7 + a*36 + b*55

    # Since coefficients and constants are moderate sized,
    # w,d,a,b positive and larger than 0,
    # and coefficients are mostly small,
    # we try w,d,a,b from 1 up to a reasonable bound, say 20.

    for w in range(1, 21):
        for d in range(1, 21):
            for a in range(1, 21):
                for b in range(1, 21):
                    eq1 = w*6 + d*4 + a*30 + b*63
                    if eq1 != 201:
                        continue
                    eq2 = w*6 + d*3 + a*35 + b*60
                    if eq2 != 200:
                        continue
                    eq3 = w*6 + d*4 + a*30 + b*54
                    if eq3 != 192:
                        continue
                    eq4 = w*6 + d*4 + a*28 + b*55
                    if eq4 != 191:
                        continue
                    eq5 = w*5 + d*7 + a*18 + b*59
                    if eq5 != 178:
                        continue
                    eq6 = w*4 + d*7 + a*32 + b*59
                    if eq6 != 176:
                        continue
                    eq7 = w*4 + d*7 + a*36 + b*55
                    if eq7 != 176:
                        continue
