[write_program]
The problem setup involves:
- A set \(L_1 \subset \mathbb{R}\) with cardinality 10.
- \(L_2 = \{ q \cdot a \cdot b \mid a,b \in L_1 \}\).
- \(L_3 = \{ a^2 + b^2 - c^2 - d^2 \mid a,b,c,d \in L_1 \}\).
- The question is characterizing all real \(q\) such that \(L_2 \subseteq L_3\).

To explore this, we will:
- Enumerate some small finite sets \(L_1\) with 10 distinct reals,
- Choose various \(q\) from a small sample (e.g., integers or rationals),
- Check if for all \(a,b \in L_1\), \( q a b \in L_3 \),
- Print \(q\) values that satisfy this condition for each \(L_1\),
- Aim to observe a pattern.
