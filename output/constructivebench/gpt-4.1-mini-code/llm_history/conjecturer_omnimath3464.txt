5	128	False. Expected Answer Type: ℤ → ℤ
The enumerated values suggest a complicated pattern with mostly odd outputs except for n = -1 and n = 5 where the output is even. We want a function ℤ → ℤ that always produces odd integers. 

Notice the output is always odd except at specific points, and for large |n| the values resemble powers of 2 multiplied by some integer. Since the problem requires the output to be always odd, and since odd integers can be generated by expressions like 2k + 1, the simplest closed-form expression that always produces odd values is:

<<<fun n : ℤ => 2 * n + 1>>>
