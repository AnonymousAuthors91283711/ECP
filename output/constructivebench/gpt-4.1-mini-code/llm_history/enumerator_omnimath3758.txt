[write_program]
The problem asks to find all real-valued functions \( f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) satisfying:
\[ f(x+1) = f(x) + 1 \]
and
\[ f(x^2) = (f(x))^2 \, \text{for all } x \in \mathbb{R}. \]

To conjecture possible forms of such functions, this Python program will search for candidates that satisfy these functional equations at some rational or integer points. It will print values and forms for selected values to spot patterns.

```python
# Enumerate candidates for f satisfying:
# f(x+1) = f(x) + 1 and f(x^2) = (f(x))^2
# We consider simple candidate types: affine functions, piecewise, polynomials

# We try f(x) = x + c and check conditions at integers and some points,
# and also functions of the form f(x) = x or f(x)=x+integer

def check_conditions(f, samples):
    for x in samples:
        lhs1 = f(x + 1)
        rhs1 = f(x) + 1
        if abs(lhs1 - rhs1) > 1e-12:
            return False
        lhs2 = f(x * x)
        rhs2 = (f(x)) ** 2
        if abs(lhs2 - rhs2) > 1e-12:
            return False
    return True

def main():
    samples = [0, 1, -1, 2, -2, 0.5, -0.5]

    # Try f(x) = x + c for c in some integers
    for c in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
        f = lambda x, c=c: x + c
        if check_conditions(f, samples):
            print(f"Candidate: f(x) = x + {c}")

    # Try f(x) = x (identity function)
    f = lambda x: x
    if check_conditions(f, samples):
        print("Candidate: f(x) = x")

    # Try f(x) = 0 for all x
    f = lambda x: 0
    if check_conditions(f, samples):
        print("Candidate: f(x) = 0")

    # Try constant c (not working because f(x+1) != f(x)+1)
    # So no constant except possibly linear

    # Try f(x) = -x + c for some c
    for c in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
        f = lambda x, c=c: -x + c
        if check_conditions(f, samples):
            print(f"Candidate: f(x) = -x + {c}")

    # Try more general polynomial candidates (quadratic)
    # but as x^2 is involved, quadratic might not hold, still let's try
    for a in [-1, 0, 1]:
        for b in [-1, 0, 1]:
            for c in [-1, 0, 1]:
                f = lambda x, a=a, b=b, c=c: a*x**2 + b*x + c
                if check_conditions(f, samples):
                    print(f"Candidate: f(x) = {a}x^2 + {b}x + {c}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
