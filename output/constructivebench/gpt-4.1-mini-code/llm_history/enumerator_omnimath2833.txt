The problem involves real numbers \( x \), \( y \) satisfying the equation \((x - y)/(x + y) = 5\), with denominators not zero, and defines some real-valued function omnimath2833_answer. The theorem states that under those conditions omnimath2833_answer x y = 0.

We don't have the exact function omnimath2833_answer; it's marked as sorry, so the goal (based on the instructions) is to enumerate possible \( (x, y) \) pairs that satisfy the constraints and evaluate potential expressions that might give 0 to assist in forming a conjecture.

Let's do the following in the Python program:
- Pick some small rational values for \( x, y \) satisfying \((x - y)/(x + y) = 5\).
- Check denominator conditions \( x+y \neq 0 \), \( 3x-2y \neq 0 \).
- Evaluate potential expressions that might vanish, perhaps the candidate expression might be the difference \((x - y)/(x + y) - 5\) which is zero by the condition. But since it's given, maybe it's more complex.
- Alternatively, search for some expressions that might simplify to zero under those constraints.

Since the problem is open-ended and we only have the ratio condition, it's natural to parametrize \( y = t \), then \( x \) defined by the equation:
\[
\frac{x - y}{x + y} = 5 \implies x - y = 5(x + y) \implies x - y = 5x + 5y \implies -4x = 6y \implies x = -\frac{3}{2} y
\]

So for any \( y \neq 0 \), \( x = -1.5 y \), so \( (x,y) = (-1.5 y , y) \).

Check denominators:
- \(x + y = -1.5 y + y = -0.5 y \neq 0 \implies y \neq 0\)
- \(3 x - 2 y = 3*(-1.5 y) - 2 y = -4.5 y - 2 y = -6.5 y \neq 0 \implies y \neq 0\)

So as long as \( y \neq 0 \), conditions hold.

We can try substituting values and then check further expressions.

Since omnimath2833_answer is unknown, the best we can do is enumerate candidates for \( x,y \) and print them for insight.

We can also demonstrate the relationship in output.

Now let's write the Python code.

```python
# Enumerate x,y with (x - y)/(x + y)=5 and denominators nonzero
# From the relation x=-1.5 y

def omnimath2833_answer(x, y):
    # Placeholder since unknown, print x,y for inspection
    return None

def main():
    print("Enumerating (x,y) with (x-y)/(x+y) = 5 and denominators nonzero")
    for y in [-3, -1, 1, 2, 4]:
        x = -1.5 * y
        denom1 = x + y
        denom2 = 3*x - 2*y
        frac = (x - y) / (x + y)
        print(f"x={x}, y={y}, (x-y)/(x+y)={frac}, denom1={denom1}, denom2={denom2}")
        assert denom1 != 0 and denom2 != 0
    print("All (x,y) samples satisfy the constraints.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This prints the enumerations and checks denominator conditions. The user can conjecture the expression or check numerical behavior.
