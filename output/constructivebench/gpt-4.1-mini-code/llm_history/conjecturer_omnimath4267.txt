theorem omnimath4267 :
  {p : ℤ × ℤ | 7 * p.1 + 14 * p.2 = 5 * p.1 ^ 2 + 5 * p.1 * p.2 + 5 * p.2 ^ 2} = omnimath4267_answer :=

. Enumerated answers: Enumerating (x,y) with x,y in [-10..10] for equation:
7x +14y = 5x^2 + 5xy + 5y^2
Solution found: (x,y)=(-1,3)
Solution found: (x,y)=(0,0)
Solution found: (x,y)=(1,2)
. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℤ × ℤ)
<<<{(-1, 3), (0, 0), (1, 2)}>>>
Explanation: Given the quadratic Diophantine equation, the only integer solutions found within a reasonable range are these three pairs, matching the enumerated set exactly.
