The problem seems to ask for the exact value of the expression:

2011 * 20122012 * 201320132013 - 2013 * 20112011 * 201220122012

It looks like a difference of products of large integers formed by concatenations of smaller integers.

To assist in conjecturing about the value, let's try to programmatically compute the expression for smaller similar numbers, formed by concatenations of smaller numbers, and print the results. This might reveal patterns or simplifications, helping to find the actual value.

We can do the following:

- Define a function that forms an integer by concatenating a base number multiple times.
- Compute the expression for smaller example numbers.
- Print each computed value immediately.

Then, we can run the program without arguments, and it will print partial results for smaller parameters, helping to conjecture the actual answer.

```python
# Python 3 program to explore the value of the expression:
# A * B * C - D * E * F, where A,B,C,D,E,F are constructed by concatenation
# similar to: 2011 * 20122012 * 201320132013 - 2013 * 20112011 * 201220122012

def concat_num(base: int, times: int) -> int:
    """Concatenate the base number 'times' times to form an integer."""
    s = str(base)
    return int(s * times)

def try_params(a, b, c, d, e, f):
    A = concat_num(a[0], a[1])
    B = concat_num(b[0], b[1])
    C = concat_num(c[0], c[1])
    D = concat_num(d[0], d[1])
    E = concat_num(e[0], e[1])
    F = concat_num(f[0], f[1])
    val = A * B * C - D * E * F
    print(f"For parameters A={a}, B={b}, C={c}, D={d}, E={e}, F={f} => Value = {val}")

# Using smaller parameters modeled on the original problem
# The original uses:
# 2011 (once)
# 2012 repeated twice (20122012)
# 2013 repeated three times (201320132013)
# and similar patterns for the other triple

# Try small parameters to detect pattern
samples = [
    # mimic original pattern but smaller numbers and repetition counts
    ((11,1),(12,2),(13,3),(13,1),(11,2),(12,2)),
    ((2,1),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(7,1)),
    ((1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(1,1),(1,2),(1,2)),
    ((201,1),(2012,2),(2013,3),(2013,1),(2011,2),(2012,2)),
]

for params in samples:
    try_params(*params)
```
