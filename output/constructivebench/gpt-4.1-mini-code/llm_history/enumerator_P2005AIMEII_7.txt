Let's numerically approximate the expression inside the function and compute \((x+1)^{48}\) for a sample of values to identify the exact value or a pattern. We will test values with varying powers of 5 and check the product structure numerically, then print the final result as a rational or decimal approximation.

```python
import math

# Calculate the expression inside the function for the given nested root product:
# x = 4 / ((sqrt5 + 1)(5^(1/4)+1)(5^(1/8)+1)(5^(1/16)+1))

sqrt5 = math.sqrt(5)
root1 = sqrt5 + 1
root2 = 5**(1/4) + 1
root3 = 5**(1/8) + 1
root4 = 5**(1/16) + 1

denominator = root1 * root2 * root3 * root4
x = 4 / denominator
print(f"x = {x:.15f}")

value = (x + 1)**48
print(f"(x+1)^48 = {value:.15f}")

# Try nearby approximations for x to check if value is a simple integer or rational:
# Since the problem implies a clean exact value, let's print integer near values for (x+1)^48:
for i in range(12, 20):
    candidate = i
    computed_x = candidate**(1/48) - 1
    print(f"Candidate (x+1)^48 = {candidate}, (x+1) = {computed_x:.15f}")

# Print x with higher precision for guidance
print(f"High precision x = {x:.50f}")

# Try to infer an integer or simplified value close to the computed value:
threshold = 1e-10
for n in range(1, 200):
    v = (x+1)**48
    if abs(v - n) < threshold:
        print(f"Close integer found: (x+1)^48 â‰ˆ {n}")
```
