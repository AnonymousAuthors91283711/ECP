The problem seems to deal with integer triples (r, g, b) summing to 97 and satisfying a rational equation related to combinations of pairs, suggesting something about probabilities or expected values. We want to enumerate all integer triples (r, g, b) with r+g+b=97 that satisfy:

(r*(r-1) + g*(g-1) + b*(b-1)) * 12 = (97*96)*5

After finding such triples, compute omnimath1785_answer(r,g,b) = r/97 (guessing from the theorem's conclusion = 41/97) or possibly print r, g, b, and check occurrences of r=41. We'll enumerate all (r,g) and compute b=97-r-g, check the equation, and print the triples. This might help conjecture r=41 is special.

```python
# Enumerate r,g,b with r+g+b=97, r,g,b>=0
# Check (r*(r-1) + g*(g-1) + b*(b-1)) * 12 == 97*96*5
# Print triples satisfying condition, print r/97 as fraction

from fractions import Fraction

N = 97
target = (N * (N - 1) * 5) // 12  # Since equation is multiplied by 12, rearranged: (r*(r-1)+g*(g-1)+b*(b-1)) = (97*96*5)/12

def comb2(x):
    return x * (x -1)

seen = 0
for r in range(N+1):
    for g in range(N - r + 1):
        b = N - r - g
        val = comb2(r) + comb2(g) + comb2(b)
        # Check the original (r*(r-1) + g*(g-1) + b*(b-1)) *12 == (97*96)*5
        if val * 12 == (N * (N -1) *5):
            # Print triple and ratio r/97
            frac = Fraction(r, N)
            print(f"r={r}, g={g}, b={b}, r/97={frac}")
            seen += 1
            if seen >= 10:
                # Stop early if too many solutions
                break
    if seen >= 10:
        break
# Print remark about all found
print(f"Total valid solutions found (up to 10 shown): {seen}")
```
