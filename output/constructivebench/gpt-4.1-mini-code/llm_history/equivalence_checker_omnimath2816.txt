Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: 3
Let me analyze this problem and the proposed answer.

The problem gives us an equation (x/100)*60 = 12 and asks us to find the value of (15/100)*x.

Let's solve it step by step:

1. From the given equation: (x/100)*60 = 12
   We can simplify this to: x*60/100 = 12
   Which becomes: 0.6x = 12

2. Solving for x: x = 12/0.6 = 20

3. Now we need to find (15/100)*x = 0.15*20 = 3

The proposed answer is exactly 3, which matches our calculation. The ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" which typically means it's undefined, but based on the mathematical proof, the proposed answer is correct.

<<<True>>>
