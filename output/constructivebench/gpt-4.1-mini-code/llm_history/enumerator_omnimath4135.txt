The problem involves finding all natural numbers \( n \) such that every natural number \( k \) with exactly \( n-1 \) digits 1 and exactly 1 digit 7 in its decimal representation is prime.

To assist in conjecturing the true answer, we will enumerate small values of \( n \) (say from 1 to 6) and generate all numbers \( k \) that have \( n-1 \) digits 1 and exactly one digit 7 in their decimal expansion. For each \( n \), we will check if all such numbers are prime. If any composite number is found for a given \( n \), then \( n \) should be excluded from the answer set.

The program prints each \( n \) and the related numbers tested, along with any composite examples found. This approach helps hypothesize the set \( \text{omnimath4135_answer} \).

```python
import sympy

# Generate all numbers with (n-1) times '1' and one '7' digits permutations
def generate_numbers(n):
    from itertools import permutations
    digits = ['1']*(n-1) + ['7']
    # Use set to avoid duplicates with repeated digits
    numbers = set()
    for p in permutations(digits):
        # leading zero impossible since all digits are '1' or '7'
        num = int(''.join(p))
        numbers.add(num)
    return numbers

# Check for each n whether all such numbers are prime
def main():
    max_n = 6  # small n to keep output short
    print("Enumerating n from 1 to", max_n)
    for n in range(1, max_n+1):
        numbers = generate_numbers(n)
        # We check all numbers and record any composite found
        composite_found = False
        for num in sorted(numbers):
            if not sympy.isprime(num):
                composite_found = True
                print(f"n={n}, composite example found: {num}")
                break
        if not composite_found:
            print(f"n={n} passes: all numbers prime")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
