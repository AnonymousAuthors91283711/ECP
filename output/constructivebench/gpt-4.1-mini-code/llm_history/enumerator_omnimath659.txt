The problem involves a large number \( n = 20 \times 13! \). We are asked to find the last nonzero digit of \( n \) in base 10.

Key Observations:
- \( n = 20 \times 13! \)
- \( 13! \) is a large number; the factorial will produce trailing zeros.
- Multiplying by 20 (which is \(2^2 \times 5\)) introduces more trailing zeros.
- The task is to find the last nonzero digit of \( n \). We can do this by:
  1. Calculating \( n \).
  2. Removing trailing zeros (divide repeatedly by 10).
  3. Print the digit just before zeros start (i.e., last nonzero digit).

Because 13! is relatively small for Python to compute exactly, and 20 is small too, this is straightforward.

The code will:
- Compute \( n = 20 \times 13! \).
- Remove trailing zeros.
- Print last non-zero digit.

Note: To assist possible generalizations, we will also print for a few sample factorials multiplied by 20.

```python
import math

def last_nonzero_digit(num):
    # Remove trailing zeros
    while num % 10 == 0:
        num //= 10
    return num % 10

# Given n = 20 * 13!
factorial_13 = math.factorial(13)
n = 20 * factorial_13

print(f"n = 20 * 13! = {n}")
digit = last_nonzero_digit(n)
print(f"Last nonzero digit of n: {digit}")

# Additional exploration: check last nonzero digit for 20 * k! for k in range 10 to 15
for k in range(10, 16):
    fk = math.factorial(k)
    val = 20 * fk
    lz = last_nonzero_digit(val)
    print(f"k={k}, 20*{k}! last nonzero digit: {lz}")
```

This prints the last nonzero digit of the given \( n \) and for some nearby factorials to see trends.
