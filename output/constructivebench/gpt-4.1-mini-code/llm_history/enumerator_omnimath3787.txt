The problem involves finding all tuples \((a, b, c, k)\) of natural numbers with \(a, b, c\) primes and \(k>0\) satisfying 
\[a^2 + b^2 + 16c^2 = 9k^2 + 1.\]

We will enumerate small primes \(a,b,c\) and positive integers \(k\) up to a small bound (e.g., 50) and check the equation. Each found quadruple will be immediately printed.

```python
# Enumerate (a,b,c,k) with primes a,b,c and k>0 satisfying:
# a^2 + b^2 + 16*c^2 = 9*k^2 + 1
# Using small primes and k up to max_k for exploration

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2: return False
    if n in (2,3): return True
    if n%2 == 0: return False
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5)+1, 2):
        if n%i == 0: return False
    return True

primes = [p for p in range(2, 50) if is_prime(p)]
max_k = 50

print("Enumerating solutions (a,b,c,k) with primes a,b,c < 50 and 1 <= k <= 50:")
for a in primes:
    a2 = a*a
    for b in primes:
        b2 = b*b
        for c in primes:
            c2 = c*c * 16
            lhs = a2 + b2 + c2
            # Check rhs: 9*k^2 + 1 = lhs  => (lhs -1) divisible by 9 
            if (lhs-1) % 9 != 0:
                continue
            val = (lhs-1)//9
            # val should be a perfect square == k^2
            k = int(val**0.5)
            if k>0 and k*k == val and k <= max_k:
                print(f"Found: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, k={k} --> {a}^2+{b}^2+16*{c}^2 = 9*{k}^2+1 = {lhs}")

# This will quickly reveal patterns and candidate quadruples.
```
