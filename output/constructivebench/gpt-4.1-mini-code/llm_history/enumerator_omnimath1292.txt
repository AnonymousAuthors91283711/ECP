The problem involves counting certain subsets of a 5×5 grid with a property reminiscent of combinatorial lines or covering rows/columns. We want to enumerate all subsets S of 5×5 such that for every point in S, either the entire row or the entire column containing that point is in S. I'll write a Python program to enumerate and count such subsets for smaller grids (e.g., 1x1 up to 4x4) since 5x5 is too large for brute force. The code will print all valid subsets found and summarize counts, helping to conjecture or validate formulas.

```python
import itertools

def is_valid_arrangement(grid, subset):
    n = len(grid)
    # subset is a set of (r, c)
    for (r, c) in subset:
        row = {(r, x) for x in range(n)}
        col = {(x, c) for x in range(n)}
        if not (row <= subset or col <= subset):
            return False
    return True

def print_subset(n, subset):
    # Represent the subset as a grid of 0/1
    grid = [['.'] * n for _ in range(n)]
    for (r, c) in subset:
        grid[r][c] = 'X'
    for row in grid:
        print(''.join(row))
    print()

def enumerate_and_count(n, max_results=1000):
    points = [(r, c) for r in range(n) for c in range(n)]
    total = 0
    printed = 0
    print(f"Enumerating valid arrangements for grid size {n}x{n}")
    # We'll check all subsets - size 2^(n^2), too large for n>3, so do n=2 and 3
    # We'll generate subsets in increasing order of size for better coverage
    for size in range(n*n + 1):
        for subset_tuple in itertools.combinations(points, size):
            subset = set(subset_tuple)
            if is_valid_arrangement(points, subset):
                print(f"Valid subset of size {size}:")
                print_subset(n, subset)
                total += 1
                printed += 1
                if printed >= max_results:
                    print("(Max print limit reached)")
                    return total
    return total

if __name__ == "__main__":
    for n in [1, 2, 3]:
        count = enumerate_and_count(n, max_results=50)
        print(f"Total valid arrangements for {n}x{n}: {count}\n{'-'*30}")
```
This script enumerates and prints all valid arrangements for grid sizes 1×1, 2×2, and 3×3, printing up to 50 valid subsets per size. This will help observe and conjecture the count pattern before generalizing to 5×5.
