This functional equation looks complex. Let's interpret and enumerate potential solutions for \(f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}\) satisfying:
\[ f(0) + 1 = f(1) \]
and for all real \(x,y\):
\[ f(xy - x) + f(x + f(y)) = y f(x) + 3. \]

We try a few candidate functions, especially linear ones \(f(x) = ax + b\), and test the given identities for some values \(x,y\).

```python
# Enumerates candidates f and tests the condition for some sample real values x,y
def test_f(a, b):
    def f(x): return a * x + b
    # Check f(0)+1 = f(1)
    if f(0) + 1 != f(1):
        return
    # Check main relation for sample points:
    sample_xy = [(0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,3), (3,2), (1,-1)]
    for x,y in sample_xy:
        lhs = f(x*y - x) + f(x + f(y))
        rhs = y * f(x) + 3
        if abs(lhs - rhs) > 1e-9:  # allow numerical tolerance
            return
    # If passed all tests, output the candidate
    print(f"Candidate: f(x) = {a}*x + {b}")

print("Testing linear functions f(x) = a*x + b with small integer coefficients")
for a in range(-5,6):
    for b in range(-5,6):
        test_f(a,b)
        
print("End of enumeration")
```
