The problem counts the number of positive integer pairs \((x,y)\) satisfying \(x + 2y = 100\). For positive \(y\), \(x = 100 - 2y > 0\), so \(2y < 100\) and \(y < 50\). Since \(y\) is positive, \(1 \leq y \leq 49\). For each such \(y\), exactly one \(x\) is determined positively. So the count is 49.

Let's write a Python program enumerating these solutions and printing each pair, then the count.

```python
# Enumerate positive integer pairs (x,y) with x + 2y = 100
def main():
    print("Enumerating (x,y) with x + 2y = 100, x>0,y>0:")
    count = 0
    for y in range(1, 50):  # y from 1 to 49 inclusive
        x = 100 - 2 * y
        if x > 0:
            print(f"x={x}, y={y}")
            count += 1
    print(f"Total count: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
