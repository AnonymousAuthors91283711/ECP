[write_program]
This task is somewhat abstract since the problem statement is not given, and the code snippet appears related to Lean theorem prover syntax but lacks the problem context. To follow your instructions, I will provide a Python enumerator template that tries to print interesting properties or values for small natural numbers, which could aid formulating or proving a theorem.

If you provide a clear math problem, I can tailor this better. For now, I will enumerate factorial and primes for n from 1 to 20, printing exact values immediately.

```python
from math import factorial
from sympy import isprime

def main():
    print("Enumerating factorials and primality for n=1 to 20:")
    for n in range(1, 21):
        fact = factorial(n)
        prime = isprime(n)
        print(f"n={n}, factorial={fact}, is_prime={prime}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
