abbrev omnimath939_answer : ℕ → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath939 (n : ℕ) (hn : 2 ≤ n) :
  ∏ k in Finset.range (n - 1), logb (n - k) (1 / (k + 2 : ℝ)) = omnimath939_answer n := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (-1) ^ (n - 1)
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => (-1 : ℝ) ^ n
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about evaluating a product of logarithms with a specific base and argument pattern.

2. The ground truth answer is (-1)^(n-1)
3. The proposed answer is (-1)^n

The difference between these two is the exponent:
- Ground truth: n-1
- Proposed: n

This means the proposed answer is off by a factor of -1 compared to the ground truth. For any given n ≥ 2, the two answers will have opposite signs.

For example:
- When n=2: ground truth gives (-1)^1 = -1, proposed gives (-1)^2 = 1
- When n=3: ground truth gives (-1)^2 = 1, proposed gives (-1)^3 = -1

The answers are consistently different by a factor of -1, so they are not equivalent.
