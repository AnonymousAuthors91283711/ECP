The problem concerns finding a polynomial \( P \) with natural number coefficients (each positive) up to degree \( n-1 \) (where \( n \geq 2 \)), such that for all positive integers \( k \), the parity of the sum of the decimal digits of \( k \) matches that of \( P(k) \).

To explore this, we can try small degrees \( n \) and enumerate polynomials with small positive coefficients. For each polynomial, we check \( k = 1 \) to some upper bound (e.g., 20) to see if the parity condition holds. Since the problem demands partial streaming output and does not require proving the property exhaustively, we'll enumerate possible \( n \), polynomials \( P \), and print those that satisfy the parity condition up to the checked \( k \).

This program prints candidate polynomials and the parameters used. It uses exact arithmetic and prints as soon as a candidate matching the parity on the range is found.

```python
def digit_sum_parity(x: int) -> int:
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(x)) % 2

def polynomial_eval(coeffs, x):
    return sum(c * (x ** i) for i, c in enumerate(coeffs))

def main():
    max_degree = 4  # n-1 max index
    max_coeff = 3   # small positive coefficients
    max_k = 20      # check first 20 positive integers

    print("Enumerating polynomials P with degree <=", max_degree, 
          "with coeffs in [1..", max_coeff, "]")
    for n in range(2, max_degree + 2):  # n >= 2
        print(f"n = {n}")
        # We consider polynomials of degree n-1 with positive coeffs
        from itertools import product
        for coeffs in product(range(1, max_coeff+1), repeat=n):
            good = True
            for k in range(1, max_k+1):
                parity_k = digit_sum_parity(k)
                p_val = polynomial_eval(coeffs, k)
                parity_p = digit_sum_parity(p_val)
                if parity_k != parity_p:
                    good = False
                    break
            if good:
                print(f"  P coeffs = {coeffs} satisfy parity condition for k=1..{max_k}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
