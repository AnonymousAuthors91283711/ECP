. Enumerated answers: Enumerating candidate solutions to f^4(x) = x:. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The given function is piecewise defined:
f(x) = 0 if x < 1, else f(x) = 2x - 2.

Let's analyze the iterates:

1. For x < 1, f(x) = 0.
   Now check f(f(x)) = f(0):
   Since 0 < 1, f(0) = 0.
   So for x < 1, f^2(x) = 0.

2. For x ≥ 1, f(x) = 2x - 2.

Calculate f^2(x) for x ≥ 1:
   f(f(x)) = f(2x - 2).
   If 2x - 2 < 1, then f(f(x)) = 0.
   Otherwise, f(f(x)) = 2(2x - 2) - 2 = 4x - 6.

The condition 2x - 2 < 1 means x < 3/2.

So for x ≥ 1,
- If 1 ≤ x < 3/2, f^2(x) = 0.
- If x ≥ 3/2, f^2(x) = 4x - 6.

Continuing to f^3(x):
For x < 1, f^3(x) = f(f^2(x)) = f(0) = 0.

For 1 ≤ x < 3/2, f^3(x) = f(0) = 0.

For x ≥ 3/2:
f^3(x) = f(4x - 6).
If 4x - 6 < 1, then f^3(x) = 0.
Else f^3(x) = 2(4x - 6) - 2 = 8x - 14.

Condition: 4x - 6 < 1 → x < 7/4 =1.75.

So for x ≥ 3/2,
- If 3/2 ≤ x < 7/4, f^3(x) = 0.
- If x ≥ 7/4, f^3(x) = 8x - 14.

Now f^4(x):

For x < 7/4,
f^4(x) = f(f^3(x)) = f(0) = 0.

For x ≥ 7/4,
f^4(x) = f(8x - 14).
If 8x - 14 < 1, then f^4(x) = 0.
Otherwise, f^4(x) = 2(8x - 14) - 2 = 16x - 30.

Condition: 8x - 14 < 1 → x < 15/8 = 1.875.

So for x ≥ 7/4,
- If 7/4 ≤ x < 15/8, f^4(x) = 0.
- If x ≥ 15/8, f^4(x) = 16x -30.

Now solve f^4(x) = x.

Case 1: For x < 7/4, f^4(x) = 0, so x=0 must hold. x=0 satisfies x<1, so f(x) = 0, f^4(0) = 0. So x=0 is a solution.

Case 2: For 7/4 ≤ x < 15/8, f^4(x)=0, so x=0 no since x≥7/4>0.

No solution here.

Case 3: For x ≥ 15/8,
f^4(x) = 16x -30 = x → 15x =30 → x=2.

2 ≥ 15/8 (1.875), so x=2 is a solution.

Check iterates at x=2: All conditions match as x ≥1.

Check also fixed points and periodic points in intervals less than 1:

For x<1, f(x)=0.
Check if f^4(x) = x.

If any x<1 satisfies this, x must be 0 only because f^4(x) = f(f(f(f(x)))) = f(f(f(0)))=...=0, so only 0.

Check other possibilities:

Try x=1:
f(1) = 0,
f^2(1) = f(0)=0,
f^3(1)=0,
f^4(1)=0,
which is not equal to 1.

Try x=2:
f(2)=2*2-2=2,
f^2(2)=f(2)=2,
f^3(2)=f(2)=2,
f^4(2)=f(2)=2,
so fixed point at 2.

Try x=0:
f(0) = 0,
so fixed point at 0.

Now check for other points that cycle in 4 steps:

Could the point be in the image of 0? f(0)=0.

No other cycles appear because the function pulls small x's to 0, larger x's to linear increasing.

Therefore, solutions are x=0 and x=2.

Now check if other points satisfy f^4(x) = x:

Check for x that f^4(x) = x but x not= 0 or 2.

Is x=1 a solution? No.

Is x=3? f(3)=2*3-2=4,
f^2(3) = f(4)=6,
f^3(3)=f(6)=10,
f^4(3)=f(10)=18,
not equal to 3.

No.

Check x=1.5:

f(1.5)=2*1.5-2=1,
f(1)=0,
f(0)=0,
f(0)=0,
so f^4(1.5)=0 ≠ 1.5.

No.

Thus solutions are x=0 and x=2.

Therefore count of solutions is 2.
