[write_program]
The problem defines a function \( f \) on the natural numbers with initial values \( f(1) = 1 \), \( f(2) = 1 \), and for \( n \geq 3 \), \( f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) \). This is the Fibonacci sequence starting with two 1's. The goal is to find \( f(2018) \).

We will write a Python program to compute \( f(2018) \) efficiently and print intermediate results for some smaller \( n \) to conjecture the pattern. Since \( f(n) \) grows fast, and we are required to print exact values, Python's built-in big integer support will handle the large number. We will:
- Print the first 20 values of \( f(n) \).
- Then print \( f(2018) \).

This will help conjecture the answer and possibly format it for a proof.

```python
# Enumerate Fibonacci numbers f(n) defined by f(1)=1, f(2)=1, f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2) for nâ‰¥3
def fib_up_to(n):
    f = [0, 1, 1]  # 0-index unused, f[1]=1, f[2]=1
    for i in range(3, n+1):
        f.append(f[i-1] + f[i-2])
    return f

def main():
    max_n = 2018
    f = fib_up_to(max_n)
    # Print first 20 Fibonacci numbers
    print("f(n) for n=1 to 20:")
    for i in range(1, 21):
        print(f"f({i}) = {f[i]}")
    print()
    # Print f(2018)
    print(f"f({max_n}) = {f[max_n]}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
