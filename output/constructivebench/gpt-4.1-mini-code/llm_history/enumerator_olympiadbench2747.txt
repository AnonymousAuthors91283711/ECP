The problem involves finding the least natural number \( n \) such that \(\frac{1}{2^n} < \frac{1}{6084}\).

This is equivalent to finding the smallest \( n \) such that \( 2^n > 6084 \).

We enumerate powers of 2, comparing them to 6084, and print each candidate \( n \) along with \( 2^n \). Once we find the smallest \( n \) satisfying \( 2^n > 6084 \), we print it as the answer.

```python
# Enumerate n such that 2^n > 6084
threshold = 6084
n = 1
while True:
    val = 2 ** n
    print(f"n={n}, 2^{n}={val}")
    if val > threshold:
        print(f"Least n with 2^n > {threshold} is {n}")
        break
    n += 1
```
