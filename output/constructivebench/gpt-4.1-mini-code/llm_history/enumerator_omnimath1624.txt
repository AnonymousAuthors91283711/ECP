[write_program]
The problem involves sequences \( P \) of length \( m \), where \( P(i) \in [0,1] \), and the sum and the expression \(1 - \prod_i (1 - P(i))\). The theorem states that these values equal corresponding components of some function `omnimath1624_answer`.

To assist in conjecturing the true answer, I'll write a Python program that, for small \( m \), enumerates sequences \( P \) with values in \(\{0, \frac{1}{q}, \frac{2}{q}, \ldots, 1\}\), for small \( q \), and prints the sum and \(1 - \prod (1-P_i)\). This will help to identify relationships or patterns.

The program will:

- Iterate over small \(m\), e.g., \(m = 1, 2, 3\).
- Iterate over \( P_i \) in \(\{0, 0.5, 1\}\), i.e., denominators 2 for simplicity.
- For each sequence \(P\), compute sum and product formula.
- Print the parameters \(m\), \(P\), sum, and product expression.
- Maximize efficiency by using itertools.product.
- Stop if output limit is near 400 tokens.

```python
# Enumerate P for small m, with P elements in {0,0.5,1}.
# Print sum and 1 - product (1-P_i).

from itertools import product

def enumerate_answers():
    for m in range(1, 4):  # small sample sizes m=1,2,3
        print(f"m = {m}")
        vals = [0.0, 0.5, 1.0]
        for P in product(vals, repeat=m):
            s = sum(P)
            prod_term = 1.0
            for p in P:
                prod_term *= (1 - p)
            diff = 1 - prod_term
            P_str = ", ".join(str(p) for p in P)
            print(f"P = [{P_str}] sum = {s} prod_expr = {diff}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    enumerate_answers()
```
