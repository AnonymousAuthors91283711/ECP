The problem involves finding natural numbers \( n > 0 \) for which there exists an integer \( k \geq 2 \) and positive rational numbers \( a_i \) (for \( i < k \)) such that both the sum and the product of the \( a_i \)'s equal \( n \).

We want to enumerate small values of \( n \) and \( k \), try to find positive rational tuples \( (a_0, \dots, a_{k-1}) \) summing and multiplying to \( n \). 

A natural approach is:
- For each \( n \) in a small range, say \( 1 \) to \( 10 \).
- For each \( k \) from 2 to 5.
- Try to find positive rationals \( a_i \) such that sum = product = n.

Because the \( a_i \) are rationals, we can parametrize all but one \( a_i \), compute the last from sum and product constraints. For simplicity, we try solutions where all \( a_i \) are equal, so \( a_i = x \), then sum \( = kx = n \) and product \( = x^k = n \), so \( x = n/k \) and \( x^k = n \implies (n/k)^k = n \implies n = k^{k/(k-1)} \).

Checking when \( (n/k)^k = n \) has a rational \( n \). For small \( k \), the integer \( n \) has to satisfy \( n^{k-1} = k^k \). So if \( n = m^k \) and \( m = n/k \), more generally we won't get integer \( n \).

We try to semi-brute force in rationals with denominators limited to some small integer (like less than 10), and print any discovered solutions.

The code enumerates, prints \( n \) for which such a \( k \) and \( a_i \)'s exist.

```python
# Enumerate n, k, try to find positive rationals a_i summing and multiplying to n.
# For simplicity, try equal a_i = n/k. Check if product = n.
# Also try small deviations from equal share with denominators up to 5.

    p = Fraction(1,1)
    for x in seq:
        p *= x
    return p

for n_int in range(1, max_n+1):
    found = False
    n = Fraction(n_int,1)
    for k in range(2, max_k+1):
        # Try equal a_i = n/k
        x = n / k
        # product == x^k
        prod = x ** k
        if prod == n:
            print(f"n={n_int}, k={k}, a_i all equal to {x} sum = product = {n_int}")
            found = True

        # Try varying one a_i slightly around n/k to see if sum and product both n possible
        # Fix first k-1 a_i, last a computed from sum = n
        # Enumerate rationals with small denominators for first k-1 a_i

            res = []
            for denom in range(1, limit+1):
                for numer in range(1, denom*2*n_int+1):
                    val = Fraction(numer, denom)
                    if 0 < val < n*2:
                        res.append(val)
            return res

        # To limit output, only do this if not found by equal distribution
        if not found:
            rationals = enum_rationals(max_den)
            # Enumerate tuples of length k-1 from rationals (small limit)
            # To avoid explosion, just try a few random or first several
            # We'll try only all combinations where all a_i equal to some candidate a
            for a_candidate in rationals:
                a_list = [a_candidate] * (k-1)
                sum_first = sum(a_list)
                last = n - sum_first
                if last <= 0:
                    continue
                seq = a_list + [last]
                p = product(seq)
                if p == n:
                    print(f"n={n_int}, k={k}, a={a_candidate}, last={last}, sum=prod={n_int}")
                    found = True
                    break
            if found:
                break
    if found:
        print(f"=> n={n_int} is in omnimath263_answer")
```

The above code tries for small \( n \) and \( k \), prints whenever a solution is found. It tests equal partition first and then tries simple perturbations. The output helps us conjecture the possible values in the answer set.
