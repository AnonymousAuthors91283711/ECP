Ground Truth Answer: fun n k m => choose (choose n k) m
Proposed Answer: fun n k m => if h : m ≤ Nat.choose n k then Nat.choose (Nat.choose n k) m else 0
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is mostly correct but adds an extra condition (the if-then-else) that isn't present in the ground truth answer. The ground truth answer simply gives the combination formula, while the proposed answer handles the case where m exceeds the maximum possible number of k-element subsets (Nat.choose n k) by returning 0. Mathematically, when m > Nat.choose n k, Nat.choose (Nat.choose n k) m would indeed evaluate to 0, so the answers are equivalent in terms of output values, but the proposed answer explicitly handles this edge case while the ground truth doesn't.
