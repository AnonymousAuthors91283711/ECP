The problem is to find a real number \( x \) such that

\[
\log_4 16 = \log_2 x.
\]

Since \(\log_4 16 = \log_2 16 / \log_2 4 = 4 / 2 = 2\), we have

\[
\log_2 x = 2 \implies x = 2^2 = 4.
\]

To illustrate this enumeratively, we can check integer exponents \( k \) for \(\log_2 x = k\) for \( k \) around 1 to 5, checking which \( x = 2^k \) satisfies \(\log_4 16 = k\). We'll output those values.

```python
# Program to enumerate possible answers to log4(16) = log2(x)

import math

def main():
    lhs = math.log(16,4)  # exact value: 2
    print(f"log4(16) = {lhs}")
    
    # enumerate integer k values near lhs
    for k in range(1, 6):
        x = 2**k
        rhs = math.log(x, 2)
        print(f"log2({x}) = {rhs}")
        if abs(rhs - lhs) < 1e-12:
            print(f"Matching x found: {x}")

    print(f"Answer: x = 4")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
