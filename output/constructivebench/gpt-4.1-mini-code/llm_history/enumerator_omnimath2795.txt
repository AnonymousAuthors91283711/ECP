The problem is to find the natural number \( n \) such that \( 10^n = 1000^{20} \). Since \(1000 = 10^3\), \( 1000^{20} = (10^3)^{20} = 10^{60} \). So the solution is \( n = 60 \).

The program below enumerates powers \( n \) and compares \(10^n\) with \(1000^{20}\), printing matches. It prints the found answer at the end.

```python
# Enumerate n in a reasonable range to find n with 10^n = 1000^20 = 10^60

def main():
    target = 1000 ** 20  # 1000^20
    print("Target value (1000^20):", target)
    for n in range(0, 100):
        val = 10 ** n
        if val == target:
            print("Found n:", n, "with 10^n =", val)
            print("Answer: n =", n)
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
