theorem omnimath1875 :

    if p = 0 then c < 360 else c * 10^(digits 10 p).length + p < 360) 
    (Finset.product (Finset.range 60) (Finset.range 60))

Ground Truth Answer: 153 / 1180
Proposed Answer: (119 + 60) / (60 * 60)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about counting valid pairs (c,p) where:
   - If p=0, then c<360 (but c ∈ Finset.range 60 means c<60, so this condition is always true when p=0)
   - Else, c*10^(digits of p) + p < 360

2. Total possible pairs: 60*60 = 3600

3. Ground truth answer: 153/1180 ≈ 0.12966

4. Proposed answer: (119+60)/(60*60) = 179/3600 ≈ 0.04972

The proposed answer is significantly different from the ground truth answer. The numerator (179) is larger than the ground truth's (153), while the denominator is smaller (3600 vs 1180). This suggests they're not equivalent.

The proposed answer seems to be incorrectly counting valid pairs as 179 when it should be 153, and using the wrong denominator (3600 instead of 1180).
