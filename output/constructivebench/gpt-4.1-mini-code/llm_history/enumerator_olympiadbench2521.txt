The problem involves finding right triangles (a, b, c) with sides satisfying a < b < c, the Pythagorean theorem a² + b² = c², the condition b - a = c - b (meaning a, b, c form an arithmetic progression), and at least one side equal to 60. The quantity to enumerate is the area A = (a * b) / 2.

We will enumerate possible triples (a, b, c) under these conditions with a, b, c positive real numbers, focusing on integer values or rational triples for simplicity and using the arithmetic progression condition to reduce variables.

By the arithmetic progression condition:
b = a + d
c = a + 2d
With the Pythagorean condition:
a² + (a + d)² = (a + 2d)²
which simplifies to a² + a² + 2ad + d² = a² + 4ad + 4d²
=> a² + 2ad + d² = 4ad + 4d² - a²
=> Rearrange and solve for a in terms of d or vice versa, or parametrize and test values.

The program will iterate over small integer values for d and a, check the conditions, then report the area when one side is exactly 60.

```python
# Enumerate right triangles (a,b,c) in arithmetic progression with one side = 60 and print area A = a*b/2

def isclose(x, y, tol=1e-9):
    return abs(x - y) < tol

print('Enumerating (a,b,c) with a<b<c, b-a=c-b, a^2+b^2=c^2, one side=60; printing area A = (a*b)/2')

# Since b - a = c - b = d, let a be a variable and d be positive
# c = a + 2d, b = a + d
# Condition: a² + b² = c²
# Substitute:
# a^2 + (a+d)^2 = (a+2d)^2
# a² + a² + 2ad + d² = a² + 4ad + 4d²
# Simplify:
# 2a² + 2ad + d² = a² + 4ad + 4d²
# a² - 2ad - 3d² = 0
# Consider a quadratic in a: a² - 2ad - 3d² = 0

# Solve for a:
# a = [2d ± sqrt((2d)^2 + 12 d²)]/2 = [2d ± sqrt(4d² + 12 d²)]/2 = [2d ± sqrt(16 d²)]/2
# = [2d ± 4d]/2
# Two solutions:
# a = (2d + 4d)/2 = 6d/2 = 3d >0
# a = (2d - 4d)/2 = -2d/2 = -d <0 (discard since a>0)

# So a = 3d
# Then b = a + d = 3d + d = 4d
# c = a + 2d = 3d + 2d = 5d

# So the triple is (3d,4d,5d) a common Pythagorean triple scaled by d>0.

# We want one of the sides = 60:
# Check if 60 equals 3d or 4d or 5d
# For 3d=60 => d=20
# For 4d=60 => d=15
# For 5d=60 => d=12

# Compute area = (a*b)/2 = (3d * 4d)/2 = (12d^2)/2 = 6d^2

for side, d in [('a=3d', 20), ('b=4d', 15), ('c=5d', 12)]:
    a = 3*d
    b = 4*d
    c = 5*d
    A = (a * b) / 2
    print(f"For {side} = 60: (a,b,c) = ({a},{b},{c}), Area = {A}")
```
