The problem asks for the maximum size of a finite subset s of integers within [-n, n] so that there is no triple (a,b,c) in s with a+b+c=0. We want to compute or enumerate the largest size of such sets for small values of n.

We will:
- Enumerate candidate subsets s of integers in [-n,n], for small n
- Check if s has no zero-sum triples a+b+c=0
- Print sizes of such subsets found, and track the maximum size
- Do this for a few small n, e.g. n=2,3,4 to conjecture answer

To keep output within 400 tokens, we limit sample n values and subset sizes.

```python
# Enumerate maximum size of s âŠ† [-n,n], no zero-sum triples a+b+c=0
# For small n, print set sizes and max size found

from itertools import combinations

def has_zero_sum_triple(s):
    arr = sorted(s)
    n = len(arr)
    # Check all triples for sum=0 (optimized)
    # Since s is small, brute force is fine
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            for k in range(j, n):
                if arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[k] == 0:
                    return True
    return False

def max_size_no_zero_triples(n):
    universe = list(range(-n, n+1))
    max_k = 0
    print(f"\nn={n}, universe={universe}")
    # Enumerate subsets by size descending for efficiency
    for size in range(len(universe), 0, -1):
        found = False
        # Use combinations to avoid duplicates
        for subset in combinations(universe, size):
            if not has_zero_sum_triple(subset):
                print(f"Found size={size} subset without zero-sum triples: {subset}")
                max_k = max(max_k, size)
                found = True
        if found:
            print(f"Max size for n={n} is at least {max_k}")
            break
    if max_k == 0:
        print(f"No subsets without zero-sum triples found for n={n}")
    return max_k

# Sample n values for enumeration
for test_n in [2, 3, 4]:
    max_size_no_zero_triples(test_n)
```
