The problem hints at finding a natural number \( k \) such that the sum of the reciprocals \( \sum_{n=1}^k \frac{1}{n} \) exceeds a given \( M = 5 \). This is related to the harmonic series partial sums. The program enumerates \( k \) starting from 1, computes the sum exactly if possible or as a precise float, and prints any \( k \) for which the sum exceeds 5. It then prints the minimal such \( k \).

```python
# Enumerate minimum k so that sum_{n=1}^k 1/n > 5
# We print each k as soon as we find sum > 5, then print the minimal such k.

def harmonic_partial_sum(k):
    # Compute harmonic sum exactly as float since Python has arbitrary precision float
    s = 0.0
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        s += 1.0 / i
    return s

def main():
    target = 5.0
    k = 1
    # We'll stop once sum > 5 found, but keep searching a bit to enumerate close values
    limit = 200000  # reasonable upper bound
    minimal_k = None
    for k in range(1, limit+1):
        s = harmonic_partial_sum(k)
        if s > target:
            print(f"k={k}, sum={s}")
            if minimal_k is None:
                minimal_k = k
                # We found the minimal k, break if you want minimal only, but to satisfy requirement we continue some range
                break

    if minimal_k is not None:
        print(f"Minimal k with harmonic sum > {target}: {minimal_k}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
