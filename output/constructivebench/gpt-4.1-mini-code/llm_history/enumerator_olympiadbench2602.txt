The problem defines a sequence of lists \(a_n\) for natural numbers \(n\) where:
- \(a_1 = [1]\)
- \(a_2 = [0]\)
- For \(n \geq 1\), \(a_{n+3} = a_{n+2} + (a_{n+1})^{\text{reverse}}\)

We want to find how many indices \(n \in [1, 1000]\) produce a palindrome list \(a_n\).

The sequence \(a_n\) is built from concatenations and reversals. We will:
- Generate \(a_n\) for \(n=1\) to \(1000\)
- Check if \(a_n\) equals its reversal
- Print \(n\) whenever \(a_n\) is a palindrome
- Finally, print the total count

Due to the exponential growth of the lists, we cannot store all elements. So I will store the list explicitly for the first few terms and then try to deduce a pattern or use memoization for feasibility. The sequence depends heavily on past two terms and their reversal.

We will limit to a manageable \(n\) for this enumeration, say up to 30, but print the results for [1..1000] as much as possible.

```python
# Enumerate palindromic a_n for n = 1 to 1000 with
# a_1 = [1], a_2 = [0], a_(n+3) = a_(n+2) + reverse(a_(n+1))

def is_palindrome(lst):
    return lst == lst[::-1]

def reverse(lst):
    return lst[::-1]

def main():
    a = {}
    a[1] = [1]
    a[2] = [0]
    
    # We try to compute up to limit n:
    limit = 30  # 1000 too large for memory; pattern might appear early
    
    palindrome_indices = []
    for n in range(3, limit + 1):
        a[n] = a[n-1] + reverse(a[n-2])
    
    count = 0
    for n in range(1, limit +1):
        if is_palindrome(a[n]):
            print(f"Palindrome at n={n}: {a[n]}")
            count += 1
    print(f"Total palindromic a_n in n=1..{limit}: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
