[write_program]
The problem sums over \(a, b \geq 0\) with \(a + b \leq 6\) of the terms \(\binom{6}{a} \binom{6}{b} \binom{6}{a+b}\), then asks for that total modulo 1000. This is a triple binomial coefficient sum with constraints on \(a, b\).

To investigate and conjecture the exact sum (and modulo 1000), I'll write a Python program that:

- Enumerates \(a\) and \(b\) with \(a,b \geq 0\), \(a+b \leq 6\).
- Computes the term \(\binom{6}{a} \binom{6}{b} \binom{6}{a+b}\) exactly.
- Sums these terms and prints each term and partial sum.
- Finally prints the total sum and total mod 1000.

This will help verify the answer and support a formal proof or conjecture.

```python
from math import comb

def main():
    n = 6
    total = 0
    print("Terms (a, b, term):")
    for a in range(n+1):
        for b in range(n+1 - a):
            term = comb(n, a) * comb(n, b) * comb(n, a + b)
            total += term
            print(f"a={a}, b={b}, term={term}")
    print(f"Total sum: {total}")
    print(f"Total sum mod 1000: {total % 1000}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
