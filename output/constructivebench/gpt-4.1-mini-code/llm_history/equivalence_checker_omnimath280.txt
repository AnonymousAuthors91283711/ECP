Ground Truth Answer: fun n => choose (n - 1) 2
Proposed Answer: fun n => (n - 1) * (n - 2) / 2
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum number of pairs (i,j) with i<j where π(i)*π(j) > i*j for some permutation π of {1,...,n}.

2. The ground truth answer is given as "choose (n-1) 2", which is the binomial coefficient C(n-1, 2) = (n-1)(n-2)/2.

3. The proposed answer is "(n-1)*(n-2)/2", which is exactly equal to C(n-1, 2).

The two expressions are mathematically equivalent, as the binomial coefficient C(k, 2) is always equal to k*(k-1)/2 for any integer k ≥ 2.
