The problem involves finding the greatest integer \( m \) such that for a given \( n > 1 \), there exists a family \( T \) of \( 2n \) subsets of a set \( S_m \) with \( |S_m| = m \cdot n \), each subset of size \( m \), with pairwise intersections of size at most 1, and each element of \( S_m \) belonging to exactly two subsets from \( T \).

To explore this, I'll enumerate small values of \( n \) (starting from 2) and try values of \( m \) up to some reasonable bound (e.g. 5), checking the conditions directly by combinatorial enumeration of possible subsets of the appropriate set. I'll print the feasible \( m \) for each \( n \).

This brute-force approach will help conjecture the form of the answer function \( \mathrm{omnimath302\_answer}(n) \).

```python
from itertools import combinations

def satisfies_conditions(n, m):
    # We want:
    # - S of size m*n
    # - T: collection of 2n subsets of S, each of size m
    # - |t1 âˆ© t2| <= 1 for distinct t1, t2 in T
    # - each element in S is in exactly 2 subsets of T
    
    S = set(range(m*n))
    # All m-subsets of S
    m_subsets = list(combinations(S, m))
    # We need to find 2n subsets from m_subsets satisfying conditions.
    
    # Try all 2n-subset families from m_subsets.
    # To reduce search space, filter subsets sharing too much intersection will be handled inside checks.
    from itertools import combinations as comb2

    # Early pruning: minimum number of subsets needed to cover each element twice:
    # Each element belongs to exactly 2 subsets,
    # total subsets = 2n,
    # total elements = m*n,
    # total element memberships = m * 2n (each subset has m elements)
    # but total element memberships = 2 * (m*n) (each element counted twice)
    # Thus count matches: m*2n == 2*m*n, true always.
    # So no info gained here.

    for T_candidate in comb2(m_subsets, 2*n):
        # Check pairwise intersections <= 1
        valid = True
        Tsets = [set(t) for t in T_candidate]
        for i in range(len(Tsets)):
            for j in range(i+1, len(Tsets)):
                if len(Tsets[i].intersection(Tsets[j])) > 1:
                    valid = False
                    break
            if not valid:
                break
        if not valid:
            continue
        # Check each element in S appears in exactly two sets in T
        count_per_element = [0]*(m*n)
        for tset in Tsets:
            for x in tset:
                count_per_element[x] +=1
        if all(c==2 for c in count_per_element):
            return True
    return False

        found = []
        for m in range(1, max_m+1):
            if satisfies_conditions(n,m):
                print(f"  feasible m={m}")
                found.append(m)
        if found:
            print(f"  greatest m up to {max_m}: {max(found)}")
        else:
            print("  no feasible m found up to limit.")
