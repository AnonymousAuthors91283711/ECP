Ground Truth Answer: {4} ∪ {n | n ≥ 6}
Proposed Answer: { n | ∃ (k : ℕ) (hk : k ≥ 2) (r : ℚ), 0 < r ∧ (k : ℚ) * r = n ∧ r ^ k = n }
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is close but not exactly equivalent to the ground truth. The ground truth correctly identifies that only n=4 and n≥6 satisfy the condition, while the proposed answer is a more abstract formulation that doesn't explicitly capture these specific values. The proposed answer's formulation could technically include some values that don't actually work (like n=5), though it's mostly correct in spirit. The main difference is that the ground truth gives the explicit solution set while the proposed answer gives a more general condition.
