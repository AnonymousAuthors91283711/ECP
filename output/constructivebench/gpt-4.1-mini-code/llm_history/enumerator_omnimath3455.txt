The problem involves finding the greatest rational number among a given finite set. We enumerate the given rationals, print each, and identify the greatest exactly using Python's `fractions` module.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Given set of rationals
rationals = [Fraction(3,10), Fraction(4,7), Fraction(5,23), Fraction(2,3), Fraction(1,2)]

max_val = None
print("Enumerating values:")
for q in rationals:
    print(f"{q} = {float(q):.6f}")  # exact fraction and float approximation
    if max_val is None or q > max_val:
        max_val = q

print(f"Greatest value among them: {max_val} = {float(max_val):.6f}")
```
