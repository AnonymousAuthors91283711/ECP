The problem involves sets of integers with certain modular coverage conditions and sums divisible by n. Since the theorem claims the least N for a given m, n, we will enumerate small values of m, n (e.g., 1 to 4), generate finite sets S that cover all residue classes modulo m, then check the minimal cardinality needed to guarantee a nonempty subset A of S with sum divisible by n. We'll output candidate minimal values found.

```python
# Enumerate minimal sizes N for sets S of integers covering all residues mod m,
# such that any subset A ⊆ S (nonempty) has sum divisible by n.
# For small m,n, we find minimal such N.

from itertools import product, combinations

def residues_mod(s, m):
    return set(x % m for x in s)

def check_subset_sum_mod_zero(s, n):
    # Check if there's a nonempty subset A ⊆ s with sum(A) % n == 0.
    # s is a list of ints
    # We'll check all subsets of all sizes quickly (stop at first success).
    if n == 1:
        # sum mod 1 always 0, so always true if s nonempty
        return True
    sums_mod = {0}
    for x in s:
        new_sums = set()
        for sm in sums_mod:
            new_sums.add((sm + x) % n)
        sums_mod |= new_sums
        if 0 in sums_mod and len(s) > 0:
            return True
    return False

    return residues_mod(s, m) == set(range(m))
