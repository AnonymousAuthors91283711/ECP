Ground Truth Answer: fun t p => 1 - (1/2) ^ t
Proposed Answer: fun t p => (1 - Real.exp (-t)) / (1 - Real.exp (-t) * (1 - p))
Let me analyze the problem and the two answers.

The problem involves an infinite series sum over k of terms involving exponentials, factorials, and powers. The ground truth answer is a simple expression `1 - (1/2)^t`, while the proposed answer is a more complex rational expression involving exponentials.

Key observations:
1. The ground truth answer doesn't depend on p, while the proposed answer does
2. The problem specifies that p = log 2, but the ground truth answer doesn't use this value explicitly
3. The proposed answer's form suggests it might be a solution to a different problem involving geometric series

Testing specific values:
- When t=0:
  - Ground truth: 1 - (1/2)^0 = 0
  - Proposed: (1-1)/(1-1*(1-p)) = 0/0 (undefined)
- When t=1:
  - Ground truth: 1 - 1/2 = 0.5
  - Proposed: (1-e^-1)/(1-e^-1*(1-log2)) ≈ 0.632 / (1 - 0.368*0.307) ≈ 0.72 (not 0.5)

The answers give different results and have different dependencies. The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth.
