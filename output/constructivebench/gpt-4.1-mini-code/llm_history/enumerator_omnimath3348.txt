The problem investigates when \( n^n + 1 \) is prime for \( n \) in the range 1 to 15. We enumerate \( n \) in this range, compute \( n^n + 1 \), and test primality. 

We'll print each \( n \) with the primality result, then list those \( n \) where \( n^n + 1 \) is prime.

```python
from sympy import isprime

# Enumerate n from 1 to 15 and check if n^n + 1 is prime
prime_ns = []
print("n : n^n+1 prime?")

for n in range(1, 16):
    val = n**n + 1
    prime = isprime(val)
    print(f"{n:2d}: {prime}")
    if prime:
        prime_ns.append(n)

print("\nValues of n where n^n + 1 is prime:")
print(prime_ns)
```
