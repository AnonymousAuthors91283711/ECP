The problem involves a sequence \(x_i\) with positive terms summing to 1, a given quadratic relation involving sums of products \(x_i x_j\), and a specific weighted sum involving terms \(a_i\) and \(x_i^2\), with \(a_i\) defined piecewise.

The goal is to find the greatest possible value of \(x_1\) (assuming zero-based indexing, \(x_1 = x_{\text{Fin }1}\)) satisfying the conditions.

A suitable way to gain intuition and conjecture the maximum \(x_1\) is to enumerate over discretized distributions \(x_i\) summing to 1 (with some small partition sizes), verify the equation, and print the possible \(x_1\) values as they appear. 

Since exact evaluation of the sum condition is complex, we can focus on a simplified problem with fewer terms (e.g., \(N=6\) instead of 216), approximate \(a_i\), and verify the sum relation approximately, printing \(x_1\) values that nearly satisfy the equality.

We'll enumerate nonnegative \(x_i\) on a fine partition, check constraints, print candidate \(x_1\).

# Enumerate possible (x_i) for i = 0..5 (small N), sum x_i=1,
# satisfying approx condition within tolerance,
# to conjecture max x_1 value.

        s += a_vals[i]*x[i]*x[i]/denom
    return s
