Ground Truth Answer: fun x y z => Real.sqrt 3
Proposed Answer: fun x y z => log y / log x
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives three equations involving x, y, z (all > 1) with logarithmic relationships, and asks to express log y / log x in terms of x, y, z.

2. The ground truth answer claims that log y / log x equals √3 for all x, y, z satisfying the given conditions.

3. The proposed answer simply restates the left-hand side of the equation we're trying to solve (log y / log x) as the solution, without actually solving it.

The proposed answer is just restating what we need to find, not providing an actual solution. It doesn't satisfy the requirement to express log y / log x in terms that don't include log y / log x itself.

The ground truth answer provides a concrete solution (√3) that can be verified by substituting back into the original equations.
