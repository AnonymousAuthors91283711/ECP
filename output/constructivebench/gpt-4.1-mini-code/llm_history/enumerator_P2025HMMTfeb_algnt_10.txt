[write_program]
The system describes a problem involving three complex numbers \(a, b, c\) satisfying \(a^2 = b + 6\), \(b^2 = c + 6\), \(c^2 = a + 6\) with \(a, b, c\) distinct. We want to find possible values for \(a + b + c\).

To explore this algebraic system, I'll choose small integer values to test for triples \((a, b, c)\), checking whether they satisfy the relations exactly. Since the problem involves complex numbers and polynomials, I'll first try integer values in a reasonable range, then extend to simple complex values with integer real and imaginary parts where possible.

The program:
- Enumerates triples \((a, b, c)\) with \(a,b,c\) in a small integer grid (e.g. \(-5\) to \(5\)) and filter those satisfying the constraints exactly.
- Prints each valid sum \(a+b+c\).
- Then prints unique sums obtained.

This helps conjecture the possible sums and the answer set.

```python
# Enumerate integer complex triples (a,b,c) with small integer real parts (imag=0)
# satisfying a^2 = b + 6, b^2 = c + 6, c^2 = a + 6 with a,b,c distinct.
# Prints sums a+b+c when found.

def is_solution(a, b, c):
    return (a != b and b != c and c != a and
            a*a == b + 6 and
            b*b == c + 6 and
            c*c == a + 6)

def main():
    found_sums = set()
    # Search over small integer range for a,b,c as integers
    # since complex with integer real and imag parts would range vastly, start simple.
    for a in range(-5,6):
        for b in range(-5,6):
            for c in range(-5,6):
                if is_solution(a, b, c):
                    s = a + b + c
                    if s not in found_sums:
                        print(f"Found solution triple (a,b,c)=({a},{b},{c}) with sum={s}")
                        found_sums.add(s)

    # Print all sums
    if found_sums:
        print("\nAll sums found:")
        for s in sorted(found_sums):
            print(s)
    else:
        print("No solutions found in the integer search range.")

    main()
