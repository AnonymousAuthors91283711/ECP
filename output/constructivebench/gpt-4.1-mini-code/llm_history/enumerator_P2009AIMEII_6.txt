The problem counts 5-element subsets of {0,..,13} that contain at least one pair of consecutive integers. To conjecture the count (mod 1000), we find all such subsets, print each set's sorted list, and then print the count mod 1000.

We will:
- Enumerate all 5-subsets of {0,...,13} using `itertools.combinations`.
- Check if the subset contains consecutive numbers.
- Print each subset as soon as found (for streaming partial results).
- Finally, print the total count mod 1000.

```python
from itertools import combinations

def has_consecutive(nums):
    # Check if list nums (sorted) has consecutive elements
    for i in range(len(nums)-1):
        if nums[i] + 1 == nums[i+1]:
            return True
    return False

def main():
    universe = list(range(14))
    count = 0
    for subset in combinations(universe, 5):
        if has_consecutive(subset):
            print(subset)
            count += 1
    print("Count mod 1000:", count % 1000)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
