This problem involves finding the sum of the digits (in base 10) of the number 888888 * 9999999. To assist in conjecturing the sum of digits, we'll enumerate the digits, sum them up, and print the exact sum.

```python
# Program to compute and print the sum of digits of 888888 * 9999999
def sum_of_digits(n):
    s = 0
    for digit in str(n):
        s += int(digit)
    return s

def main():
    # compute product
    product = 888888 * 9999999
    print("Product:", product)
    # sum of digits
    s = sum_of_digits(product)
    print("Sum of digits:", s)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
