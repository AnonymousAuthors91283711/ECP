The problem is about counting the number of Boolean matrices f: Fin 6 × Fin 6 → Bool that can be written as the Boolean product of a row indicator function r: Fin 6 → Bool and a column indicator function c: Fin 6 → Bool, where f(i,j) = r(i) && c(j).

Since r and c are functions from Fin 6 = {0,...,5} to {False,True}, they can be identified with subsets of a 6-element set (the set of indices of rows and columns respectively). The function f is then the product of the characteristic function of the subset of rows times the characteristic function of the subset of columns.

Thus, f can be characterized by two subsets R and C of {0,...,5}, and f(i,j) = True iff i ∈ R and j ∈ C.

Hence, the set of such functions is in bijection with pairs of subsets (R, C), i.e., 2^6 × 2^6 = 2^{12} = 4096.

However, we must confirm whether this count needs adjustments (e.g., if r or c are allowed to be empty or not).

If r or c is empty, then f is the zero matrix (all False). So total number of such f is the number of pairs of subsets (R, C), i.e., 2^6 × 2^6 = 4096.

The problem is to compute card {f : Fin 6 → Fin 6 → Bool | ∃ r c such that f(i,j) = r(i) && c(j)}.

In code, this can be enumerated by iterating all subsets R and C of {0,...,5}, building corresponding f, and storing/printing them.

We will enumerate and print each f (identified by its 6x6 Boolean matrix), ensuring no duplicates, but sets R and C suffice.

Because the total number is 4096, which fits comfortably, we'll print each with subsets R and C to check.

```python
# Count and enumerate all Boolean 6x6 matrices f of form f(i,j) = r(i) && c(j)
# where r,c: Fin 6 -> Bool (subsets of size 6).
# We print each pair (R,C).
# Total count should be 2^6 * 2^6 = 4096.

def subsets(n):
    # Generate all subsets of [0..n-1] represented as sorted tuples
    for mask in range(1 << n):
        yield tuple(i for i in range(n) if mask & (1 << i))

def matrix_from_rc(r, c):
    return tuple(bool(i in r and j in c) for i in range(6) for j in range(6))

def main():
    seen = set()
    count = 0
    for r in subsets(6):
        for c in subsets(6):
            f = matrix_from_rc(r, c)
            if f not in seen:
                seen.add(f)
                count += 1
                print(f"R={r} C={c} f={f}")
    print(f"Total distinct matrices: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
