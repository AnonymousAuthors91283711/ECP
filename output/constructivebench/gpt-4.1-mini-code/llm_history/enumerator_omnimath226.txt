The problem involves finding all functions \(f: \mathbb{Q}^+ \to \mathbb{Q}^+\) satisfying a functional equation:
\[
f(x) + f(y) + 2xyf(xy) = \frac{f(xy)}{f(x+y)},
\]
for all positive rational \(x, y\).

To explore possible solutions, I will fix some sample positive rational values for \(x,y\), then enumerate candidates of the form \(f(t) = \frac{a}{b} t^c\) or similar rational expressions and check the equation. This might allow us to guess the form \(f\) must have.

Key points:
- Since the problem is about rational functions, start with rationals such as \(f(t) = c\), or \(f(t) = k/t\), etc.
- Print values of \(f\) at selected points.
- Check if the functional equation holds for these candidates and given points.

I'll enumerate candidates based on simple rational functions and print successes. The output is limited, so I will check about 5 candidate forms and a few (x,y) values each.

```python
# Enumerate candidate functions f: Q+ -> Q+ as simple rational functions and test the functional equation
# For fixed positive rationals, check if equation holds exactly.

from fractions import Fraction

def functional_eq_test(f, xs):
    # xs: list of positive rationals to test pairs (x,y)
    for x in xs:
        for y in xs:
            if x > 0 and y > 0:
                fx = f(x)
                fy = f(y)
                fxy = f(x*y)
                fsum = f(x + y)
                lhs = fx + fy + 2 * x * y * fxy
                # RHS = f(xy) / f(x+y)
                # Check exact equality
                if fsum == 0:
                    # Avoid div by zero
                    return False
                rhs = fxy / fsum
                if lhs != rhs:
                    return False
    return True
