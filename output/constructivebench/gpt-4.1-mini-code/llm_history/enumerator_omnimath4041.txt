The problem defines a sequence \(a_n\) of integers with initial values:

- \(a_1 = 11^{11}\)
- \(a_2 = 12^{12}\)
- \(a_3 = 13^{13}\)

and for \(n \geq 4\),

\[
a_n = |a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}| + |a_{n-2} - a_{n-3}|.
\]

The goal is to find \(a_{14^{14}}\).

This is a very large index in the sequence with very large initial values, which makes direct computation impossible.

The program will:
- Compute the first several terms to detect any cycle or pattern.
- All values are integers, so no approximation needed.
- Print each computed term until we have enough to deduce the behavior.
- Then attempt to identify if the sequence stabilizes or becomes periodic.
- Use small sample runs to conjecture the answer.

We will compute terms up to some maximum index (let's say 50) and observe. We also note these numbers are huge, but the operation is subtraction and absolute value, so maybe the sequence decreases or shows repeating patterns.

We store the terms in a list to print them as we go.

```python
# Compute terms of the sequence defined by:
# a_1 = 11^11, a_2=12^12, a_3=13^13,
# a_n = |a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}| + |a_{n-2} - a_{n-3}| for n >=4.
# Attempt to detect cycle or stabilization in first 50 terms,
# print each term as found.

def main():
    # Initial terms
    a = [0]*50
    a[0] = 11**11
    a[1] = 12**12
    a[2] = 13**13

    print(f"a(1) = {a[0]}")
    print(f"a(2) = {a[1]}")
    print(f"a(3) = {a[2]}")

    for n in range(3, 50):
        a[n] = abs(a[n-1] - a[n-2]) + abs(a[n-2] - a[n-3])
        print(f"a({n+1}) = {a[n]}")

    # Try to detect if sequence repeated or stabilized
    # Check for cycle in last 20 terms
    window = 10
    seq = a[40:50]
    for length in range(1, window//2+1):
        if seq[-length:] == seq[-2*length:-length]:
            print(f"Detected cycle of length {length} starting near term 41")
            print(f"Cycle values: {seq[-length:]}")
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
