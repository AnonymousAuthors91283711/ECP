The problem is to find the greatest natural number \( d \) that divides every positive even number \( n \). This means \( d \) must divide all even numbers: 2, 4, 6, 8, etc. Thus, \( d \) is the greatest common divisor of all even numbers, i.e., it divides every number in the set {2, 4, 6, 8, ...}.

We want to programmatically check candidates \( d \) starting from smaller values, confirming they divide all even numbers up to a certain range, confirming divisibility properties, and finally conclude the maximal \( d \).

According to the problem's requirements, the program should:
- Print each candidate \( d \) tested that divides all tested even numbers.
- Eventually output the greatest such \( d \) found.

Since the greatest divisor dividing all even numbers is 2, the program will confirm this by checking integers starting from 1 upwards.

```python
# Program to find the greatest natural number d dividing all positive even numbers
# We test candidates d in a reasonable range and check divisibility on a sample of even numbers

def divides_all_even(d, max_even=20):
    # Check if d divides n for all even n â‰¤ max_even
    for n in range(2, max_even+1, 2):
        if n % d != 0:
            return False
    return True

def main():
    max_test_even = 20  # Test divisibility on even numbers up to 20
    max_candidate = max_test_even  # Candidates up to max_test_even
    candidates = []
    print(f"Testing all d from 1 to {max_candidate} for divisibility of even numbers up to {max_test_even}:")
    for d in range(1, max_candidate+1):
        if divides_all_even(d, max_test_even):
            print(f"d={d} divides all even numbers from 2 to {max_test_even}")
            candidates.append(d)
    greatest = max(candidates) if candidates else None
    print(f"The greatest d found is {greatest}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
