abbrev P2005AMCB_21_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem P2005AMCB_21 (n : ℕ) (hn : 0 < n) (h60 : Finset.card (divisors n) = 60) (h80 : Finset.card (divisors (7 * n)) = 80) : 
  IsGreatest {k | 7^k ∣ n} P2005AMCB_21_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Number of divisors of n: 60
Number of divisors of 7*n: 80

Possible k: 2 (because (k+1)*d = 3*20 = 60, (k+2)*d = 4*20 = 80). Expected Answer Type: ℕ
