Ground Truth Answer: ((1 + 2^1005) / 2^1007)^2
Proposed Answer: (1 / 4) ^ (2012 / 2) * (8 * (3 ^ (2012 / 2))) / 4^2012
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about counting valid paths of length 2012 where each step is one of 4 possible moves in 2D integer space, and we want the final position to be divisible by 8 in both coordinates.

2. The ground truth answer ((1 + 2^1005)/2^1007)^2 suggests:
   - The probability is the square of a similar 1D problem (since x and y coordinates are independent)
   - For each coordinate, the probability is (1 + 2^(n/2-1))/2^(n/2+1) where n=2012

3. The proposed answer (1/4)^(2012/2)*(8*(3^(2012/2)))/4^2012 simplifies to:
   (3^(1006)*8)/(4^2012) which is very different from the ground truth

4. The proposed answer doesn't account for the modular condition properly and seems to be counting something else entirely.
