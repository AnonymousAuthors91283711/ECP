Ground Truth Answer: 251
Proposed Answer: 216
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest positive integer n that can be expressed as the sum of three cubes in two different ways (where the order of cubes matters, but not their permutation).

2. The ground truth answer is 251, which is correct because:
   - 251 = 1³ + 5³ + 5³ = 2³ + 3³ + 6³
   - These are two distinct representations (different multisets)

3. The proposed answer is 216, which is incorrect because:
   - While 216 = 6³ + 6³ + (-6)³ (but negative numbers aren't natural numbers)
   - Or 216 = 3³ + 4³ + 5³ (only one representation with natural numbers)
   - There's no second distinct representation with natural numbers
