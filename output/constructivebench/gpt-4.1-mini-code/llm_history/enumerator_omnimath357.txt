The problem involves determining \( p \in \mathbb{R} \) such that the measure (volume) of the set
\[
\{(x,y) \in [0,1]^2 : x > p \text{ or } y > p\}
\]
equals \(1 - p^2\). Since the set is within the unit square, this volume corresponds to the area of the union of two rectangles: 
\[
\{x > p\} \times [0,1] \quad \cup \quad [0,1] \times \{y > p\}.
\]
We first check candidate values \(p \in [0,1]\) because outside this range the volume conditions are trivial. The area of the set is:
\[
\text{Area} = \text{Area}(\{x>p\} \times [0,1]) + \text{Area}([0,1] \times \{y>p\}) - \text{Area}(\{x>p\} \times \{y>p\})
= (1-p) \times 1 + 1 \times (1-p) - (1-p)^2 = 2(1-p) - (1-p)^2.
\]

We want to find all \(p\) such that:
\[
2(1-p) - (1-p)^2 = 1 - p^2.
\]

We will enumerate \(p\) in small increments to verify this equality.

```python
# Enumerate p in [0,1] with small increments, compute both sides, print p when close
def area_union(p):
    # Area of union: 2*(1-p) - (1-p)^2
    return 2*(1 - p) - (1 - p)**2

def rhs(p):
    # Right side: 1 - p^2
    return 1 - p**2

print("Enumerating candidate p in [0,1] with step 0.01:")
for i in range(101):
    p = i / 100
    left = area_union(p)
    right = rhs(p)
    diff = abs(left - right)
    # Print all p where values are close (difference less than 1e-8)
    if diff < 1e-8:
        print(f"p = {p:.2f} satisfies area_union(p) = 1 - p^2 = {left:.6f}")

# Algebraically solve for p:
# 2(1-p) - (1-p)^2 = 1 - p^2
# Expand:
# 2 - 2p - (1 - 2p + p^2) = 1 - p^2
# 2 - 2p -1 + 2p - p^2 = 1 - p^2
# (2 -1) - 2p + 2p - p^2 = 1 - p^2
# 1 - p^2 = 1 - p^2 (always true)
# The equality holds for all p in [0,1].

print("\nConjecture: For all p in [0,1], the equality holds.")
```
