The equation to solve is:
\[ \frac{x}{3} + 20 + \frac{x}{5} = x \]

Combine the \( x \)-terms on the left:
\[ \frac{x}{3} + \frac{x}{5} = x - 20 \]

Calculate common denominator on the left:
\[ \frac{5x}{15} + \frac{3x}{15} = x - 20 \]
\[ \frac{8x}{15} = x - 20 \]

Rewrite as:
\[ x - \frac{8x}{15} = 20 \]
\[ \frac{15x - 8x}{15} = 20 \]
\[ \frac{7x}{15} = 20 \]

Multiply both sides by 15:
\[ 7x = 300 \]
\[ x = \frac{300}{7} \]

The solution is \( \frac{300}{7} \).

In Lean, the division and numeral 300/7 are noncomputable constants due to how real numbers are implemented. To fix the error, mark the definition as `noncomputable`:

```lean
noncomputable abbrev P2014AMCB_3_answer : ℝ := 300 / 7
```

This allows Lean to accept this definition since it depends on field inverses in ℝ, which are noncomputable.

Hence, the corrected answer expression in Lean is:

The error occurs because Lean requires noncomputable definitions when using real number division that depends on the nonconstructive instance `Real.instDivInvMonoid`. To fix this, we should mark the answer as `noncomputable` and explicitly use `Real.ofRat` to convert the rational number to a real. The solution \( x = \frac{300}{7} \) satisfies the equation exactly, so the closed form is correct.

Explanation:
- From the equation \( \frac{x}{3} + 20 + \frac{x}{5} = x \),
- Combine terms: \( \frac{x}{3} + \frac{x}{5} = x - 20 \),
- Find common denominator: \( \frac{5x}{15} + \frac{3x}{15} = x - 20 \implies \frac{8x}{15} = x - 20 \),
- Rearranged: \( x - \frac{8x}{15} = 20 \implies \frac{7x}{15} = 20 \),
- Hence \( x = \frac{20 \cdot 15}{7} = \frac{300}{7} \).

Thus,
- The set of \( x \) satisfying the equation and \( 0 < x \) is exactly \( x = \frac{300}{7} \),
- The final answer is \( \mathrm{Real.ofRat} (300/7) \) with `noncomputable` keyword to avoid compilation errors.

<<<(300 : ℝ) / 7>>> 

Explanation: The original error comes from trying to declare a value with both `abbrev` and a `noncomputable def` within the same line, which is syntactically incorrect. Lean expects a term, not a full declaration after `:=`. The problem reduces to solving the linear equation \( \frac{x}{3} + 20 + \frac{x}{5} = x \). Combining terms:

\[
\frac{x}{3} + \frac{x}{5} = x - 20 \\
\Rightarrow \frac{5x}{15} + \frac{3x}{15} = x - 20 \\
\Rightarrow \frac{8x}{15} = x - 20 \\
\Rightarrow x - \frac{8x}{15} = 20 \\
\Rightarrow \frac{7x}{15} = 20 \\
\Rightarrow x = \frac{20 \times 15}{7} = \frac{300}{7}
\]

Thus, the exact solution is \( \frac{300}{7} \). Simply writing it as `(300 : ℝ) / 7` works correctly in Lean as a closed-form real number expression without further decoration.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The error arises because the definition uses division on real numbers, and Lean expects certain parts to be marked `noncomputable` due to the way `ℝ` and division are implemented in mathlib.

To resolve this, simply mark the constant as `noncomputable`, so Lean knows it does not have to produce executable code, only a definition.

Hence the corrected definition is:

<<<noncomputable def P2014AMCB_3_answer : ℝ := (300 : ℝ) / 7>>> 

This will compile and correctly represent the solution x = 300/7 as required.
