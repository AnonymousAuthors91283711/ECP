open Real

abbrev omnimath773_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath773 (a b c d : ℝ)
  (h1 : |a - b| + |c - d| = 99)
  (h2 : |a - c| + |b - d| = 1) :
  |a - d| + |b - c| = omnimath773_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Exploring quadruples (a,b,c,d) in [0,100]^4 with constraints:
|a - b| + |c - d| = 99, |a - c| + |b - d| = 1
Printing |a - d| + |b - c| when constraints nearly hold (within 0.01).. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<100>>>
