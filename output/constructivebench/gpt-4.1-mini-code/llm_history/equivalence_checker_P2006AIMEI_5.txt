Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: 936
Since the problem is about finding the product \(a \times b \times c\) given a specific equation involving square roots, and the proposed answer is a concrete number (936), but the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (indicating it's not provided or unknown), we cannot verify the equivalence of the answers.
