The problem involves variables \(a, b, c \geq 0\) satisfying \(ab+bc+ca=3\) and a complicated equality, and asks about minimal values of a certain function \(omnimath480\_answer(a,b,c)\). To explore conjectures, I will:

- Enumerate triples \((a,b,c)\) with nonnegative rationals/cut-offs,
- Check the constraints approximately,
- Then print candidates for \(omnimath480\_answer(a,b,c)\) using a placeholder function to be refined.

Since the function is unknown ("sorry") I will try some numeric approximations to evaluate candidate parameter sets and output possible values, which may suggest the minimal value or patterns.

```python
# Enumerate triples (a,b,c) with a,b,c in {0,0.5,1,1.5,2,2.5}
# Check if ab+bc+ca≈3 and the cubic relation≈9/2, then print the triple and candidate answer.
# Here we just output (a,b,c) and value = a+b+c as a placeholder to assist conjecturing.

import math

vals = [i*0.5 for i in range(6)]  # 0,0.5,...2.5

def close(x,y,eps=1e-5):
    return abs(x - y) < eps

# Placeholder for omnimath480_answer (unknown) - here just sum as proxy
def omnimath480_answer(a,b,c):
    # Could refine to some expression if known
    return a + b + c

found = []
for a in vals:
    for b in vals:
        for c in vals:
            if a >= 0 and b >= 0 and c >= 0:
                s = a * b + b * c + c * a
                if close(s, 3, eps=1e-2):  # allow some tolerance
                    left = (a**3)*b + (b**3)*c + (c**3)*a + 2 * a * b * c * (a + b + c)
                    if close(left, 4.5, eps=1e-1):  # 9/2=4.5
                        val = omnimath480_answer(a,b,c)
                        print(f"a={a:.2f}, b={b:.2f}, c={c:.2f} => omnimath480_answer={val:.5f}")
                        found.append(val)

if found:
    print(f"Minimum candidate value found: {min(found):.5f}")
else:
    print("No candidates found.")
```
