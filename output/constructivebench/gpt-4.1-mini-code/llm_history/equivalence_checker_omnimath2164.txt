Ground Truth Answer: fun a => (2 * a + 5) / 5
Proposed Answer: fun (a : ℝ) => if a = -5 then 4 else if a = -2 then 0 else (a + 8) / (a + 2)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for a condition on c (in terms of a) that makes the system of equations solvable for all b.

2. The ground truth answer gives c = (2a + 5)/5.

3. The proposed answer has three cases:
   - a = -5 ⇒ c = 4
   - a = -2 ⇒ c = 0
   - otherwise ⇒ c = (a + 8)/(a + 2)

Let's test some values:
- For a = 0:
  - Ground truth: c = (0 + 5)/5 = 1
  - Proposed: c = (0 + 8)/(0 + 2) = 4 (≠ 1)
- For a = 1:
  - Ground truth: c = (2 + 5)/5 = 7/5 = 1.4
  - Proposed: c = (1 + 8)/(1 + 2) = 3 (≠ 1.4)

The answers clearly give different results for most values of a. The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth.
