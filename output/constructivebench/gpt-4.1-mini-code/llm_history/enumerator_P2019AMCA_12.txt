The problem involves real numbers \(x, y > 0\), \(x \neq 1\), \(y \neq 1\), with constraints involving logarithms to various bases:

\[
\log_2 x = \log_y 16, \quad xy = 64,
\]

and asks for the value of \((\log_2(x/y))^2\).

We'll enumerate plausible values of \(x\) and \(y\) satisfying these with high precision, by iterating over values \(x > 0, x \neq 1\), computing \(y = 64 / x\), checking if \(\log_2 x\) equals \(\log_y 16\) (within tolerance), and printing \((\log_2 (x / y))^2\).

To keep it manageable:
- Iterate \(x\) over powers of 2 (since logs base 2 appear) and nearby values,
- Compute corresponding \(y\),
- Check the log equality numerically,
- Print \((\log_2 (x / y))^2\).

```python
import math

# Tolerance for floating comparisons
EPS = 1e-9

def log_base(b, a):
    # log base b of a
    return math.log(a) / math.log(b)

print("Searching values (x,y) with x>0,x!=1 and y=64/x>0,y!=1 satisfying log_2 x = log_y 16")

for e_x in range(1, 10):  # powers of 2 for x to cover reasonable range
    x = 2 ** e_x
    if x == 1:
        continue
    y = 64 / x
    if y == 1 or y <= 0:
        continue

    # Calculate logs
    lhs = math.log2(x)
    # log_y 16 = ln(16)/ln(y)
    rhs = math.log(16) / math.log(y)
    if abs(lhs - rhs) < EPS:
        val = math.log2(x / y)
        val_sq = val ** 2
        print(f"x=2^{e_x}={x:.5g}, y={y:.5g}, (log2(x/y))^2 = {val_sq:.10g}")

# Also try some fractional powers around these to search for other solutions
for x_exp in [0.5, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5]:
    x = 2 ** x_exp
    if x == 1:
        continue
    y = 64 / x
    if y == 1 or y <= 0:
        continue
    lhs = math.log2(x)
    rhs = math.log(16) / math.log(y)
    if abs(lhs - rhs) < EPS:
        val = math.log2(x / y)
        val_sq = val ** 2
        print(f"x=2^{x_exp}={x:.5g}, y={y:.5g}, (log2(x/y))^2 = {val_sq:.10g}")
```
This program prints candidate values of \((\log_2(x/y))^2\) for examples satisfying the problem's conditions, assisting with conjecture on the exact answer.
