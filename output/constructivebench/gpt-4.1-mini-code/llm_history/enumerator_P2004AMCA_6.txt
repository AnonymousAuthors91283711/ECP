The problem compares differences between terms of the form \(a_k = c \cdot 2004^k\), specifically computing which difference is greatest among \(U-V\), \(V-W\), \(W-X\), \(X-Y\), and \(Y-Z\). We'll enumerate these differences numerically for small powers and print them to help conjecture the greatest one.

```python
# Enumerate differences analogous to problem with smaller powers to conjecture the greatest difference.

def main():
    base = 5  # Smaller base to keep numbers manageable
    powers = [6, 5, 5, 4, 4, 3]  # Powers corresponding to U,V,W,X,Y,Z but smaller for speed
    # Define terms analogous to problem:
    # U = 2 * base^6
    # V = base^5
    # W = (base-1) * base^5
    # X = 2 * base^4
    # Y = base^4
    # Z = base^3

    U = 2 * base**powers[0]
    V = base**powers[1]
    W = (base - 1) * base**powers[2]
    X = 2 * base**powers[3]
    Y = base**powers[4]
    Z = base**powers[5]

    diffs = []
    diffs.append(("U-V", U - V))
    diffs.append(("V-W", V - W))
    diffs.append(("W-X", W - X))
    diffs.append(("X-Y", X - Y))
    diffs.append(("Y-Z", Y - Z))

    print(f"Base = {base}")
    for name, val in diffs:
        print(f"{name} = {val}")

    # Find greatest difference
    max_diff = max(diffs, key=lambda x: x[1])
    print(f"Greatest difference: {max_diff[0]} = {max_diff[1]}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
