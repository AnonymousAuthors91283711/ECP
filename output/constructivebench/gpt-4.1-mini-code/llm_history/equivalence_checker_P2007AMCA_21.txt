Ground Truth Answer: fun a b c => a
Proposed Answer: fun (a b c : ℂ) => a
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer matches exactly with the ground truth answer. Both are functions that take three complex numbers a, b, c and simply return a. The variable names and types are identical, and the function behavior is identical. Therefore, the answers are equivalent.
