Ground Truth Answer: (238, 238, 477)
Proposed Answer: (7, 4, 3)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks to find all triples (a,b,c) of positive integers satisfying:
   gcd(a²,b²) + gcd(a,bc) + gcd(b,ac) + gcd(c,ab) = 199

2. Ground truth answer is (238, 238, 477)
   - Let's verify:
     gcd(238²,238²) = 238² = 56644
     But this alone is already much larger than 199, so this can't be correct
     (Note: There seems to be an error in the ground truth answer)

3. Proposed answer is (7,4,3)
   - Calculate each term:
     gcd(7²,4²) = gcd(49,16) = 1
     gcd(7,4*3) = gcd(7,12) = 1
     gcd(4,7*3) = gcd(4,21) = 1
     gcd(3,7*4) = gcd(3,28) = 1
     Total sum = 1+1+1+1 = 4 ≠ 199

Both answers appear incorrect, but they are clearly not equivalent to each other. The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the equation, and the ground truth answer seems to have an error in its verification.
