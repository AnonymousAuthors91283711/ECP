theorem omnimath2152 :
  {(a, b) : ℕ × ℕ | a > 0 ∧ b > 0 ∧ (2 * a + 1) ∣ (3 * b - 1) ∧ (2 * b + 1) ∣ (3 * a - 1)} = omnimath2152_answer ↔ True :=

. Enumerated answers: Enumerating (a,b) with a,b>0, up to 50:
(a,b)=(2,2) satisfies conditions
(a,b)=(12,17) satisfies conditions
(a,b)=(17,12) satisfies conditions

Minimal solution candidates found:
(2, 2)
(12, 17)
(17, 12). Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ)
<<<{(2, 2), (12, 17), (17, 12)}>>>
