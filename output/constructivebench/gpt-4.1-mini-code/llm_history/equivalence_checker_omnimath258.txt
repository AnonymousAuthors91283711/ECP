theorem omnimath258 (k : ℕ) (hk : 0 < k) :
  IsLeast {N : ℕ | ∃ (s : Finset ℕ), 
    s.card = 2 * k + 1 ∧ 
    (∀ x ∈ s, 0 < x) ∧ 
    (∀ (t : Finset ℕ), t ⊆ s → t.card = k → t.sum id ≤ N / 2) ∧ 
    s.sum id > N} 
  (omnimath258_answer k) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun k => 2 * k^3 + 3 * k^2 + 3 * k
Proposed Answer: fun k : ℕ => (2 * k + 1) * (3 * k + 1)
Let's analyze the two expressions:

Ground truth: 2k³ + 3k² + 3k
Proposed: (2k + 1)(3k + 1) = 6k² + 5k + 1

Let's compare them for k=1:
Ground truth: 2(1) + 3(1) + 3(1) = 8
Proposed: 6(1) + 5(1) + 1 = 12

These are clearly different values, so the answers are not equivalent.
