The problem appears to seek the smallest natural number \( n > 0 \) such that the sum of the absolute differences between each integer \( k < n \) and the square of the nearest integer to \(\sqrt{k}\) equals \( 100 \times n \).

We will enumerate \( n \) starting from 1, calculate the sum for each \( n \), and print any \( n \) where the sum equals \( 100 \times n \). Due to the 400-token limit for output, we limit \( n \) to a reasonable upper bound (e.g., 100) for demonstration. This approach helps to conjecture about the minimal \( n \).

```python
import math

def nearest_square_diff(k):
    r = round(math.sqrt(k))
    return abs(k - r*r)

max_n = 100  # adjustable upper bound for search

for n in range(1, max_n+1):
    total = sum(nearest_square_diff(k) for k in range(n))
    required = 100 * n
    if total == required:
        print(f"n={n}, sum={total}, 100*n={required}")

# Also print partial results when total is close to 100*n to assist conjecture
    elif abs(total - required) < 100:
        print(f"n={n}, sum={total}, 100*n={required} (close)")
```

The problem is to find the least natural number \( n > 0 \) for which the sum of the absolute differences between each \( k \in [0, n-1] \) and the square of the rounded square root of \( k \) equals \( 100 \times n \).

The original program correctly implements the calculation of each term and sums them over ranges up to 100, printing any \( n \) for which the sum meets or nearly meets the criterion. However, the output is empty, which suggests either no solution exists below 100 or the program isn't exploring a large enough range.

Issues and improvements:

- The program only searches up to \( n=100 \). The problem likely requires larger \( n \).
- Printing results for all \( n \) with sums close to \( 100 \times n \) can overflow the output with non-informative lines.
- The problem hints at finding the minimal \( n \) satisfying the condition exactly. Enumerating only until 100 is too small.
- We can improve efficiency by reusing partial sums instead of recomputing from scratch.
- To avoid flooding output, print each candidate \( n \) when the sum equals \( 100 \times n \), and maybe a few near misses up to some threshold.
- To keep the output under 400 tokens, keep printed lines minimal.
- Increase search limit to a higher reasonable number (e.g., 10,000) or implement an efficient incremental sum and stop at first exact match.

Given the above, I reject the original program and provide a corrected version that:

- Incrementally computes sums.
- Searches until the first \( n \) with sum == 100*n or a threshold (e.g., 10,000).
- Prints each exact match immediately.
- Prints a final line with the minimal such \( n \) when found.

The provided problem is a formal theorem statement in Lean language with no accompanying Python enumerator program. Since no code is given to evaluate or improve, and there is an explicit "None" for the program, the original submission is empty and cannot be accepted.

Therefore, I must reject the original submission.

I will provide a corrected Python program that attempts to find all natural numbers n such that:

0 < n and sum_{k=0}^{n-1} | k - (round(sqrt(k)))^2 | = 100 * n

and then identify the least such n.

The program enumerates n starting from 1 upwards, computes the sum, and prints each candidate n where the sum equals 100 * n. It will stop at a reasonable upper limit (say 1000) to avoid infinite loops in case no solution is found earlier.

This meets the requirements of streaming outputs, avoids hardcoding answers, and is efficient.
