The problem involves solving the equation involving nested fractions:  
\[ m + \frac{1}{n + \frac{1}{p}} = \frac{17}{3} \]  
for positive integers \(m, n, p\).  
We want to find tuples \((m, n, p)\) that satisfy this exactly, under \(m, n, p > 0\).  
The code below enumerates small positive values for \(m, n, p\), checks the equality exactly using fractions, and prints solutions immediately as they are found.  
The output will help conjecture the true solution, especially the unknown \(n\).

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Target value to match
target = Fraction(17, 3)

print("Enumerating possible (m, n, p) with m,n,p > 0 and m,n,p <= 10")

for m in range(1, 11):
    for n in range(1, 11):
        for p in range(1, 11):
            # Compute expression: m + 1/(n + 1/p)
            inner = Fraction(n) + Fraction(1, p)
            val = Fraction(m) + Fraction(1, inner)
            if val == target:
                print(f"Solution found: m={m}, n={n}, p={p}")

# From the output we conjecture the required n value
```
