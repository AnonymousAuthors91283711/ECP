The problem involves the function \( f(z) = z^2 - 19z \) on complex numbers and identifying right triangles with vertices \( z \), \( f(z) \), and \( f(f(z)) \). We want to find positive integers \( m, n \) such that
\[
z = m + \sqrt{n} + 11i,
\]
and the triangle formed by \( z \), \( f(z) \), \( f(f(z)) \) is right-angled (with a specific condition relating the vertices).

The goal is to enumerate possible \((m,n)\) pairs that satisfy the right triangle condition and eventually conjecture the sum \( m + n \).

We can:
- Enumerate small positive integers \( m \) and \( n \),
- Construct \( z = m + \sqrt{n} + 11i \),
- Compute \( f(z) \), \( f(f(z)) \),
- Check if the triangle with these vertices is right angled according to the given conditions,
- Print all candidates \( (m,n) \),
- Finally print the conjectured answer \( m+n \).

Note: We'll treat complex numbers of the form \( m + \sqrt{n} + 11i \) as complex with real part \( m + \sqrt{n} \) and imaginary part \( 11 \).

    bc = dist_sq(fz, ffz)
    ac = dist_sq(z, ffz)
    # Check the three right angle conditions with vertex condition
    conds = []
    # Right angle at C = f(z)
    conds.append((math.isclose(ab + bc, ac, abs_tol=1e-9) and ffz == fz))
    # Right angle at B = f(f(z))
    conds.append((math.isclose(ab + ac, bc, abs_tol=1e-9) and fz == ffz))
    # Right angle at A = z
    conds.append((math.isclose(bc + ac, ab, abs_tol=1e-9) and z == ffz))
    return any(conds)

def f(z):
    # z is (x,y), interpret as complex x+iy; x may be a float involving sqrt.
    x, y = z
    # z^2 = (x+iy)^2 = (x^2 - y^2) + 2ixy
    z_sq_x = x*x - y*y
    z_sq_y = 2*x*y
    # f(z) = z^2 - 19z
    # 19z = (19x, 19y)
    fx = z_sq_x - 19*x
    fy = z_sq_y - 19*y
    return (fx, fy)

def approx_equal(a, b, eps=1e-9):
    return abs(a-b) < eps

# Since the problem is complicated, we analyze the law of cosines and vertex condition
# Actually, the condition is that the vertex of the right angle corresponds to the image point
# So check the three cases exactly:
def is_right_triangle_with_vertex(z, fz, ffz):
    def dist_sq(a,b):
        return (a[0]-b[0])**2 + (a[1]-b[1])**2
    ab = dist_sq(z, fz)
    bc = dist_sq(fz, ffz)
    ac = dist_sq(z, ffz)
    # Case 1: right angle at C=ffz, and ffz = fz
    if approx_equal(ab + bc, ac) and ffz == fz:
        return True
    # Case 2: right angle at B=fz, and fz = ffz
    if approx_equal(ab + ac, bc) and fz == ffz:
        return True
    # Case 3: right angle at A=z, and z = ffz
    if approx_equal(bc + ac, ab) and z == ffz:
        return True
    return False

# However, the problem says:
# A right triangle with vertices A,B,C satisfies one of:
# ‖A-B‖²+‖B-C‖²=‖A-C‖² and C=f(B)
# or ‖A-B‖²+‖A-C‖²=‖B-C‖² and B=f(C)
# or ‖B-C‖²+‖A-C‖²=‖A-B‖² and A=f(C).

# So the vertex of the right angle is that which equals f(...) of the other vertex.

# So we implement these three checks directly:

def is_right_triangle_condition(z, fz, ffz):
    def dist_sq(a,b):
        return (a[0]-b[0])**2 + (a[1]-b[1])**2
    ab = dist_sq(z,fz)
    bc = dist_sq(fz,ffz)
    ac = dist_sq(z,ffz)
    # Check each condition:
    # 1) Right angle at C, C=f(B): ab + bc = ac and C == f(B)
    cond1 = abs(ab + bc - ac) < 1e-9 and ffz == fz
    # 2) Right angle at B, B=f(C): ab + ac = bc and B == f(C)
    cond2 = abs(ab + ac - bc) < 1e-9 and fz == ffz
    # 3) Right angle at A, A=f(C): bc + ac = ab and A == f(C)
    cond3 = abs(bc + ac - ab) < 1e-9 and z == ffz
    return cond1 or cond2 or cond3

# Actually, checking ffz==fz or fz==ffz or z==ffz with floats is unlikely.
# The original problem likely means equal as complex numbers; here we keep exact comparisons.

# Our approach:
# For integers m,n >0, z = (m + sqrt(n), 11)
# We'll compute f(z), f(f(z)), each as complex points.
# Then test the 3 conditions using approximations.
# If satisfied, print (m,n).

# Let's fix max ranges for speed:
max_m = 20
max_n = 20
