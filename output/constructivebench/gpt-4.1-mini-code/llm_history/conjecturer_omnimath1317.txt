The Lean error is caused by the use of the symbol +∞ which is not a valid term. In Lean, `Set ℝ` is typically represented with intervals using `Icc` (closed), `Ioo` (open), etc. unions. For unbounded intervals like "greater than something", we use `Ioi` to mean (a, ∞).

From the enumerated answers and the signs tested, the solution set is

(-9/2, (1/2 - sqrt(5)/2)) ∪ ((1/2 + sqrt(5)/2), ∞)

excluding the points where the denominator is zero: x ≠ -2 and x ≠ -9/2

Since we've excluded -9/2 and -2 explicitly, we must note that (-9/2, ...) excludes -9/2 anyway and the union is taken over sets that don't include these points.

We can express the solution set in Lean as

{ x | x ∈ Ioo (-(9/2)) (1/2 - Real.sqrt 5 / 2) ∪ Ioi (1/2 + Real.sqrt 5 / 2) ∧ x ≠ -2 }

Because -2 lies in (-9/2, ...) interval, but we must exclude it explicitly.

Alternatively, since -2 ∈ (-9/2, 1/2 - sqrt(5)/2), we have to exclude it from the left interval (since -9/2 ≈ -4.5 and -2 > -4.5), so we can write

{ x | (x ∈ Ioo (-(9/2)) (1/2 - Real.sqrt 5 / 2) \ {-2}) ∪ Ioi (1/2 + Real.sqrt 5 / 2) }

This is the cleanest way to express the solution set.

So the corrected Lean set expression is

{ x : ℝ | (x ∈ (Ioo (-(9/2)) (1/2 - Real.sqrt 5 / 2)) \ {-2}) ∪ Ioi (1/2 + Real.sqrt 5 / 2) }

We don't include the point -9/2 in the intervals since they are open intervals anyway.

Therefore:

<<<
{ x : ℝ | (x ∈ (Ioo (-(9 / 2)) (1 / 2 - Real.sqrt 5 / 2)) \ {-2}) ∪ (Ioi (1 / 2 + Real.sqrt 5 / 2)) }

The main Lean error arises because the expression after "{ x : ℝ | ... }" is a proposition, not a set membership predicate. The current formulation uses nested membership tests and unions at the level of propositions, but inside a set definition the content should be a proposition.

To fix this, define the answer set as a union of intervals excluding the points -2 and -9/2 explicitly, i.e., combine the relevant intervals into one set (using Set union and difference as operations on sets) and exclude the points where denominators vanish.

From the numerical test and equation roots, the solution intervals for the inequality are:
- from -9/2 < x < (1/2 - sqrt 5 / 2), excluding x = -2
- also from (1/2 + sqrt 5 / 2) < x (i.e., open interval starting from that root)

Note -2 is excluded since denominator x+2=0 is forbidden by hypothesis.

We should write the set as union of two sets:
(Ioo (-(9/2)) (1/2 - sqrt5/2)) \ {-2} union Ioi (1/2 + sqrt5/2)

Hence the correct Lean code expression for the set omnimath1317_answer is:

<<<
(Ioo (-(9/2)) (1/2 - Real.sqrt 5 / 2)) \ {-2} ∪ Ioi (1/2 + Real.sqrt 5 / 2)
