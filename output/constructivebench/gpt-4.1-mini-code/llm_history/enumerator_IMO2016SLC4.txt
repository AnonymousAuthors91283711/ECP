The problem involves constructing \(n \times n\) tables with entries from \(\{0,1,2\}\) having specific combinatorial properties related to rows, columns, and certain diagonals or symmetric pairs. We want to enumerate possible \(n\) for which such a table exists.

Since the problem is quite abstract and linked to a 2016 IMO shortlist problem, we will:

- Try small \(n\) values (e.g., \(1 \le n \le 6\)).
- For each \(n\), try to construct or partially verify existence of such a table that meets the conditions.
- Print each \(n\) checked and whether a candidate table seems possible.
- Due to complexity, focus on the first two conditions (rows and columns having all 3 values exactly) as a necessary condition.
- Attempt simple heuristics or structured tables (latin squares or rotations) to generate candidates.

Our goal here is to enumerate plausible \(n\) values and their constructive attempts to guide further proofs.

```python
# Enumerate n and attempt to build an n x n table with values in {0,1,2},
# such that each row and column contains all three values exactly.
# This is a necessary (not necessarily sufficient) condition.

def all_three_in_row_and_col(table, n):
    # Check each row and column contains all 3 values exactly once.
    for i in range(n):
        row = set(table[i])
        if row != {0,1,2}:
            return False
        col = set(table[r][i] for r in range(n))
        if col != {0,1,2}:
            return False
    return True

def try_construct(n):
    # For n < 3, impossible to have 3 distinct values in every row/col
    if n < 3:
        return None
    # For n % 3 != 0, immediate fail because we can't distribute 3 values equally in a row or column of length n
    if n % 3 != 0:
        return None
    # Construct a base pattern repeated n/3 times in rows and columns:
    # Each row is a permutation of [0,1,2] repeated n//3 times.
    base = [0,1,2] * (n//3)
    table = []
    # Rotate base row by i mod 3 for better mixing
    for i in range(n):
        row = base[i%3:] + base[:i%3]
        table.append(row)
    if all_three_in_row_and_col(table, n):
        return table
    return None

def main():
    print("Checking small n values for possible tables satisfying row/col conditions and value distribution:")
    for n in range(1, 7):
        print(f"n = {n}")
        tab = try_construct(n)
        if tab:
            print(f"  Possible candidate table for n={n}:")
            for row in tab:
                print("   ", row)
        else:
            print(f"  No candidate table found for n={n}.")
