The problem involves rational numbers and a relation between them. To explore, I will try small integer or rational values near the fractions given, calculate the target and transfer values, and print them in exact fractions.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Given values from problem
total = Fraction(3) + Fraction(1,3)  # 3 + 1/3 = 10/3
target = total / 4                   # total/4 = (10/3)/4 = 10/12 = 5/6
transfer = target - Fraction(1,3)   # target - 1/3 = 5/6 - 1/3 = 5/6 - 2/6 = 3/6 = 1/2
answer = transfer / 3                # (1/2)/3 = 1/6

print(f"total = {total} = {float(total)}")
print(f"target = total/4 = {target} = {float(target)}")
print(f"transfer = target - 1/3 = {transfer} = {float(transfer)}")
print(f"answer = transfer/3 = {answer} = {float(answer)}")
```
