[write_program]
The problem defines functions f and g with specified conditions and asks to determine g explicitly. Given f(x) = 2x + 1 and that g(f(x)) = 4xÂ² + 1, we want to find g(y). Since y = f(x) = 2x + 1, we solve for x in terms of y and then express g(y) accordingly. This suggests g(y) = 4 * ((y - 1)/2)^2 + 1, which simplifies to (y - 1)^2 + 1.

To support and explore such a conjecture, I provide a Python program that enumerates sample values of x, computes corresponding y = f(x), and computes g(y) = 4x^2 + 1 accordingly. It will print pairs (y, g(y)) exactly, to observe g's form on sample points. This helps conjecture g's form and may assist in proving the result.

```python
# Enumerate sample values for x, compute y = 2x + 1, compute g(y) = 4x^2 + 1 and print pairs (y, g(y))
def f(x):
    return 2 * x + 1

def g(fx):
    # We do not know g exactly, but we know g(f(x)) = 4x^2 + 1
    # For the enumerator, we compute g(f(x)) using the right hand side
    return 4 * x_values[fx_index[fx]] ** 2 + 1

# Choose sample integer x values
x_values = list(range(-5, 6))  # -5 to 5 inclusive

# Map from f(x) to index for lookup
fx_index = {}

print("Enumerating sample points (y = f(x), g(y) = 4x^2 + 1):")
for i, x in enumerate(x_values):
    y = f(x)
    fx_index[y] = i

for x in x_values:
    y = f(x)
    gy = 4 * x**2 + 1
    # Print exact rational values when possible - here all integers
    print(f"g({y}) = {gy}")

# Conjecture g(y) form:
print("\nConjecture: g(y) = ((y - 1)**2) + 1")
```
