The problem looks for the greatest radius \( r \geq 0 \) such that there exists a center \( c = (c_1, c_2) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \) so that for every point \( p = (x,y) \) in the closed ball of radius \( r \) centered at \( c \), the inequality \(|x + |y|| \leq 1\) holds.

To gain insight, we'll:
- Enumerate a grid of possible centers \( c \) with small integer coordinates in a reasonable range.
- For each center and candidate radius \( r \), check the maximum of \(|x + |y||\) over the ball of radius \( r \) centered at \( c \).
- Increment \( r \) in small steps to find approximate maximal radius \( r \) for which the inequality holds.
- Print results streaming as found.

Since the condition involves maximum absolute value over a disk, we will approximate by checking points at multiple directions on the circle of radius \( r \). 

```python
import math

def max_abs_sum(c1, c2, r, samples=36):
    # For radius r and center (c1,c2), find max of |x + |y|| over circle boundary
    max_val = 0
    for i in range(samples):
        theta = 2 * math.pi * i / samples
        x = c1 + r * math.cos(theta)
        y = c2 + r * math.sin(theta)
        val = abs(x + abs(y))
        if val > max_val:
            max_val = val
    return max_val

def approx_radius_for_center(c1, c2, r_step=0.01, max_r=2.0):
    # Increment r until max_val > 1, return max r where max_val <= 1
    r = 0.0
    while r <= max_r:
        m = max_abs_sum(c1, c2, r)
        if m > 1:
            return round(r - r_step, 4)
        r += r_step
    return max_r

def main():
    # Try centers with coordinates from -1 to 1 step 0.5 for brevity
    centers = [x * 0.5 for x in range(-2, 3)]
    print("center(r1,r2) and max radius r:")
    max_r_global = 0
    max_c = (0,0)
    for c1 in centers:
        for c2 in centers:
            r = approx_radius_for_center(c1, c2)
            print(f"Center=({c1:.1f},{c2:.1f}), max r={r}")
            if r > max_r_global:
                max_r_global = r
                max_c = (c1, c2)
    print(f"Maximum radius found: r={max_r_global} at center={max_c}")
