The problem seems related to coloring a 3D n×n×n cube with k colors so that for any slice along any axis, the set of colors appearing is the same across all slices and orientations. The question involves the greatest number k of colors possible for which such a coloring exists.

Since this is quite involved combinatorics, we can explore small n values and enumerate possible k and colorings to guess olympiadbench1818_answer(n).

We'll try n=2 and n=3, enumerating candidate k and checking whether a coloring with the described properties might exist. Due to complexity, we will only enumerate candidates and print some existence conditions heuristically for small k.

```python
from itertools import product

def slices_colors(coloring, n, k):
    # For each orientation and each slice, compute the set of colors appearing in that slice
    # orientation: 0=x fixed, 1=y fixed, 2=z fixed
    # Returns a dict: keys are (orientation, slice), values are sets of colors
    res = {}
    for orientation in range(3):
        for slice_idx in range(n):
            s = set()
            for i in range(n):
                for j in range(n):
                    if orientation == 0:
                        c = coloring[(slice_idx,i,j)]
                    elif orientation == 1:
                        c = coloring[(i,slice_idx,j)]
                    else:
                        c = coloring[(i,j,slice_idx)]
                    s.add(c)
            res[(orientation,slice_idx)] = s
    return res

def candidate_check(n, k):
    # Enumerate some colorings (impractical for large n,k), so do random samples or structured guesses
    # Here, we check only colorings where color depends only on coordinate modulo k or something similar
    # We'll enumerate colorings given by function c(x,y,z) = (ax + by + cz) mod k for small a,b,c in 0..k-1
    # For each coloring of this form, we check the slices' color sets are equal
