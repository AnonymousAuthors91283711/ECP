[write_program]
The problem defines a set of natural numbers \( n \) for which there exists a sequence \( a : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \) of positive integers up to \( n \), satisfying the recurrence relation for \(2 \leq k \leq n-1\):
\[
a_{k+1} = \frac{a_k^2 + 1}{a_{k-1} + 1} - 1.
\]

We want to find such \( n \) where this is possible. The program tries small \( n \) and small initial values \( a(0) \), \( a(1) \) (both at least 1), then computes the sequence to check if all terms remain positive integers satisfying the relation.

It prints each \( n \) for which such an \( a \) is found, along with the corresponding \( (a(0), a(1)) \) and sequence. The program enumerates candidates up to \( n=10 \), \( a(0), a(1) \in [1..5] \) for brevity. This helps conjecture which \( n \) are in the answer set.

```python
# Enumerate n and initial terms a0,a1 trying to satisfy the recurrence with positive integers
# Print all found sequences and corresponding n, then print max n found.

def valid_sequence(n, a0, a1):
    a = [a0, a1]
    for k in range(2, n+1):
        denom = a[k-2] + 1
        numer = a[k-1]**2 + 1
        if numer % denom != 0:
            return None
        val = numer // denom - 1
        if val <= 0:
            return None
        a.append(val)
    return a

max_n_found = 0
print("Enumerating n from 3 to 10 with initial a0,a1 in [1..5]...")
for n in range(3, 11):
    found_for_n = False
    for a0 in range(1, 6):
        for a1 in range(1, 6):
            seq = valid_sequence(n, a0, a1)
            if seq is not None:
                print(f"n={n}, a0={a0}, a1={a1} sequence={seq}")
                found_for_n = True
    if found_for_n:
        max_n_found = n

print(f"Maximum n with such sequence found up to 10: {max_n_found}")
```
