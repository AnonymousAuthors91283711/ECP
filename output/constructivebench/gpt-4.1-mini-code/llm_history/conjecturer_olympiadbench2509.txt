Explanation: From the system, log_a(3+b)+c=5, log_a(5+b)+c=4, log_a(11+b)+c=3. Subtracting equations gives log ratios and solving shows a=1/3, b=-2, c=5 satisfies all.[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The error comes from using the Unicode fraction character `⅓` directly in Lean, which does not parse as a number. Instead, use the Lean rational expression `1 / 3`, and for clarity, use `((1 : ℝ) / 3)` to ensure it's treated as a real number. The numbers `-2` and `5` are fine as integers since Lean coerces them to reals.

Thus, the fixed answer is the triple `(1/3, -2, 5)` as reals.

Explanation:  
From the given equations with logs base `a`:  
logₐ(3 + b) + c = 5  
logₐ(5 + b) + c = 4  
logₐ(11 + b) + c = 3  

Subtracting the second from the first:  
logₐ(3 + b) - logₐ(5 + b) = 1 - c + c = -1  

Similarly, logs behave like logs, suggesting the ratio of (3 + b) to (5 + b) is a power of `a` reflecting the decrement by 1, and similarly for third equation. One can solve the system to get `(a, b, c) = (1/3, -2, 5)`.

Final Lean expression:

<<<((1 : ℝ) / 3, -2, 5)>>>
