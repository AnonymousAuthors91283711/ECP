The problem deals with numbers expressed in base 4 with digits less than 4, truncated after index 2012, and looks at the greatest such number (which is \(4^{2013} - 1\)) modulo 210. We want to find the remainder of \(4^{2013} - 1\) modulo 210 via enumeration of powers mod 210 and verify the greatest number condition indirectly by printing some candidates.

```python
# Enumerate 4^i mod 210 for i in range to find (4^2013 - 1) % 210
# Print intermediate powers and finally print the remainder

def main():
    mod = 210
    pow_mod = 1
    for i in range(2014):
        if i < 10 or i == 2013:  # print first 10 and the final power mod 210
            print(f"4^{i} mod 210 = {pow_mod}")
        pow_mod = (pow_mod * 4) % mod
    
    remainder = (pow_mod - 1) % mod
    print(f"(4^2013 - 1) % 210 = {remainder}")

    # Enumerate some sample numbers sum d_i * 4^i with digits <4, finite support
    # For example, choose k = 3, print all numbers with digits 0..3 at i=0..2
    print("Sample sums for digits with support size 3:")
    base_powers = [1,4,16]
    for d0 in range(4):
        for d1 in range(4):
            for d2 in range(4):
                N = d0*base_powers[0] + d1*base_powers[1] + d2*base_powers[2]
                print(f"d=( {d0}, {d1}, {d2} ) sum = {N}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
