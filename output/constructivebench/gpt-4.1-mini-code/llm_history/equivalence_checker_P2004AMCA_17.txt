Ground Truth Answer: fun n => 2^(n-1)
Proposed Answer: fun n => 2^(n * (n - 1) / 2)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive function f with:
   - Base case: f(1) = 1
   - Recursive case: f(2n) = n * f(n)

2. The ground truth answer is f(2^n) = 2^(n-1)

3. The proposed answer is f(2^n) = 2^(n*(n-1)/2)

Let's verify with small values of n:
- For n=1:
  Ground truth: 2^(0) = 1
  Proposed: 2^(0) = 1
  Both match f(2^1) = f(2) = 1*f(1) = 1

- For n=2:
  Ground truth: 2^1 = 2
  Proposed: 2^(2*1/2) = 2^1 = 2
  Both match f(4) = 2*f(2) = 2*1 = 2

- For n=3:
  Ground truth: 2^2 = 4
  Proposed: 2^(3*2/2) = 2^3 = 8
  Actual f(8) = 4*f(4) = 4*2 = 8
  Proposed matches, ground truth doesn't

- For n=4:
  Ground truth: 2^3 = 8
  Proposed: 2^(4*3/2) = 2^6 = 64
  Actual f(16) = 8*f(8) = 8*8 = 64
  Proposed matches, ground truth doesn't

The ground truth answer is incorrect for n≥3, while the proposed answer matches all cases. The correct answer should indeed be 2^(n*(n-1)/2).
