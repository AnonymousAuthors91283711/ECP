[write_program]
The problem involves polynomials indexed by \( n \in \mathbb{N} \):
\[
f_n(x) = x^2 + (2n-1)x + (n^2 - 22).
\]
We want to find all \( n > 0 \) such that \( f_n(x) \neq 0 \) for all real \( x \), meaning \( f_n \) has no real roots.

This holds iff the discriminant of \( f_n \) is negative:
\[
\Delta = (2n-1)^2 - 4(n^2 - 22) < 0.
\]

I will write a Python program to enumerate small \( n > 0 \), compute \(\Delta\), and print \( n \) where \(\Delta < 0\) (no roots). Then I will print all such \( n \) and highlight the exact \( n \) satisfying the condition.

```python
# Enumerate n > 0 to find those for which f_n = x^2 + (2n-1)x + (n^2-22) has no real roots.
# Condition: discriminant = (2n-1)^2 - 4(n^2 - 22) < 0

def main():
    print("n where f_n has no real roots (discriminant < 0):")
    candidates = []
    for n in range(1, 30):  # small range to find candidates
        discriminant = (2*n - 1)**2 - 4*(n**2 - 22)
        # print intermediate values to trace
        print(f"n={n}, discriminant={discriminant}")
        if discriminant < 0:
            print(f" --> f_{n} has no real roots")
            candidates.append(n)
    if candidates:
        print("\nAll n with no real roots:", candidates)
        # The problem states a unique n satisfies the condition, so print it
        if len(candidates) == 1:
            print("Unique n found:", candidates[0])
        else:
            print("Multiple candidates found; problem may require further analysis.")
    else:
        print("No n found with negative discriminant in the tested range.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
