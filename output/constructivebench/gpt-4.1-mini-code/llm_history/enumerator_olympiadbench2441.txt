[write_program]
The problem asks to count the number of positive integers \( n \) up to 300 that satisfy:
- \( 0 < n \leq 300 \),
- \( n \) is divisible by 3 or 5,
- but \( n \) is not divisible by 10 or 15.

The program below enumerates such \( n \) and prints each. Finally, it prints the total count.

```python
# Enumerate n from 1 to 300 satisfying:
# (3 divides n or 5 divides n) and not (10 divides n or 15 divides n)
# Print each n immediately, then print total count at the end.

def divides(a, b):
    return b % a == 0

count = 0
print("Values of n:")
for n in range(1, 301):
    div3 = divides(3, n)
    div5 = divides(5, n)
    div10 = divides(10, n)
    div15 = divides(15, n)
    if (div3 or div5) and not (div10 or div15):
        print(n)
        count += 1

print("Total count:", count)
```
