. Enumerated answers: Enumerating n with sum of squares mod 100 == 0
n = 24, sum_squares mod 100 = 0
n = 87, sum_squares mod 100 = 0
n = 112, sum_squares mod 100 = 0
n = 175, sum_squares mod 100 = 0
n = 199, sum_squares mod 100 = 0
n = 200, sum_squares mod 100 = 0
Minimal such n = 24. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
