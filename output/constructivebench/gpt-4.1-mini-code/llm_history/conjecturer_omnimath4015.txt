<<<C * monomial 1 1>>>
Explanation: The inequality suggests P(x) is essentially linear with degree 1. The enumerations confirm polynomials proportional to x satisfy the inequality. So P = C * x (monomial with coeff C at degree 1).[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The error arises because `C` is not defined and you cannot multiply a scalar by a polynomial without specifying it correctly in Lean. Moreover, `monomial 1 1` is a polynomial with coefficient 1 at \(x^1\), but you must specify coefficients numerically.

From the enumeration, polynomials satisfying the condition appear to be multiples of \(x\) (monomials with degree 1) with positive coefficients. So the answer is any nonzero scalar multiple of \(X\).

To fix the error and match the problem's style, define `omnimath4015_answer` as the monomial polynomial \(X\) itself, i.e., polynomial with coefficient 1 at degree 1 and 0 elsewhere.

Hence, the fixed final answer is simply the polynomial \(X\), represented as `monomial 1 1` without any unknown scalar multiplier.
