The problem is about counting pairs of distinct 4x4 sub-squares inside an 8x8 grid that intersect non-trivially. We denote by S and T the sets of all 4x4 sub-squares indexed by their top-left corners from a 4x4 grid (since 8 - 4 + 1 = 5 but the problem uses Fin 4 likely meaning 4 indices 0..3, so sub-squares starting at positions 0..3). The set P consists of pairs of such sub-squares that are distinct and intersect.

We want to compute the ratio |P| / (|S| * |T|).

We will write a Python program that:
- Enumerates all 4x4 sub-squares by their (r, c) in 0..3
- For each pair ((r, c), (r', c')) with (r, c) != (r', c'), check if the two 4x4 squares intersect
- Count the number of intersecting pairs, print each pair as found
- In the end, print the total count and the ratio over 16*16 = 256 (since |S|=|T|=16)
- This allows conjecturing the exact rational value

We use 0-based indexing and treat the points p : Fin 2 â†’ Fin 8 as pairs (x, y) in 8x8 grid.

```python
# Enumerate the pairs of 4x4 subgrids in 8x8 indexed by top-left corners (r,c) with r,c in 0..3
# Each subgrid covers rows r..r+3 and cols c..c+3
# For each pair of distinct subgrids ((r,c), (r',c')), check if they intersect.
# Print each intersecting pair immediately.
# At the end, print total count and ratio = count / (16*16)

def main():
    N = 8
    k = 4
    indices = range(N - k + 1)  # 0..4, but problem seems to use 0..3 (Fin 4)
    # use 0..3 to match the problem's Fin 4 indexing
    indices = range(4)

    intersecting_pairs = 0

                    cols_overlap = not (c1 + k - 1 < c2 or c2 + k - 1 < c1)
