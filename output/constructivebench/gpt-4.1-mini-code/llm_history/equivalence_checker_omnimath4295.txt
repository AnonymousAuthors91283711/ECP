Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ a b : ℝ, f = (fun x => a * x^2 + b * x - 1) ∧ ((a = 0 ∧ (b = -1 ∨ b = 2)) ∨ (a = 1 ∧ b = 0))}

The proposed answer captures the general form of the solutions (quadratic functions) and includes specific cases (linear functions when a=0 and a specific quadratic when a=1). However, it might be missing some edge cases or constraints, and the ground truth answer isn't provided for full verification. The proposed answer seems mostly correct but might not be exhaustive.
