The problem involves a polynomial \( P(x) = x^4 + 2x^3 - 13x^2 - 14x + 24 \) and another polynomial \( Q(x) \) whose roots are the squares of the roots of \( P \). The theorem claims there's a polynomial \( R = Q / (P(x)) \) evaluated suitably, equal to some polynomial \( \text{omnimath3377\_answer} \).

To explore and conjecture the answer, we want to:

- Find roots of \( P \).
- Form polynomial \( Q(x) = \prod (x - r^2) \).
- Compute the ratio \( Q(x^2)/P(x) \) for generic \( x \) (symbolically).
- Try to express it as a polynomial to identify \( \text{omnimath3377\_answer} \).

We'll write code in Python using sympy to:

- Define P,
- Find roots,
- Construct Q,
- Compute the ratio \( \frac{Q(x^2)}{P(x)} \),
- Verify if it simplifies to polynomial,
- Print out intermediate and final results.

```python
from sympy import symbols, Poly, roots, simplify, factor, pprint

x = symbols('x')

# Define polynomial P(x)
P = Poly(x**4 + 2*x**3 - 13*x**2 -14*x + 24, x)
print("Polynomial P(x):")
pprint(P.as_expr())
print()

# Find roots of P (symbolic/rational roots first)
rts = roots(P, multiple=True)
print("Roots of P:")
for r in rts:
    pprint(r)
print()

# Construct Q(x) = product of (x - r^2) for each root r of P
# Use symbol 'X' to define Q variable
X = symbols('X')
Q_expr = 1
for r in rts:
    Q_expr *= (X - r**2)
Q = Poly(Q_expr, X)
print("Polynomial Q(X) with roots r^2:")
pprint(Q.as_expr())
print()

# Compute ratio polynomial R(x) = Q(x^2)/P(x) and simplify
expr = Q.as_expr().subs(X, x**2) / P.as_expr()
simplified = simplify(expr)
print("Simplified Q(x^2)/P(x):")
pprint(simplified)
print()

# Verify if simplified is polynomial in x, and get its poly form if yes
try:
    R = Poly(simplified, x)
    print("Resulting polynomial R(x) = Q(x^2)/P(x):")
    pprint(R.as_expr())
except:
    print("Result is not a polynomial in x.")

```

This code prints roots, the constructed polynomial Q, the rational expression, and checks if the ratio simplifies to a polynomial, potentially the polynomial \( \text{omnimath3377\_answer} \).
