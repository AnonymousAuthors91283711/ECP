Ground Truth Answer: fun a b c => (1 / (a + 1)) + (1 / (b + 1)) + (1 / (c + 1))
Proposed Answer: fun a b c => (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) + 3 * a * b * c
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us a cubic equation (X-a)(X-b)(X-c) = X³ - X + 1, which implies:
   - a + b + c = 0 (sum of roots)
   - ab + bc + ca = -1 (sum of product of roots)
   - abc = -1 (product of roots)

2. The ground truth answer is the sum of reciprocals of (a+1), (b+1), (c+1).

3. The proposed answer is (a³ + b³ + c³) + 3abc.

Let's evaluate the proposed answer:
Using a + b + c = 0, we know a³ + b³ + c³ = 3abc.
So the proposed answer becomes 3abc + 3abc = 6abc = 6*(-1) = -6.

But the ground truth answer evaluates to -2 (as given in the theorem statement).

The two answers give different values (-6 vs -2), so they are not equivalent.
