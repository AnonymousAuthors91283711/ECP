The problem involves analyzing the sum of digits of the product \(\prod_{i=0}^n (10^{2^i} - 1)\). This product expands into a particular integer, and we want the sum of its digits in base 10.

Because the factors are special numbers of the form \(10^{2^i} - 1\), they have a pattern of digits consisting of all 9's of length \(2^i\). The product structure likely follows a pattern relating to repunits or concatenations of 9's.

The program below enumerates \(n\) from 0 to 7, computes the product exactly using integer arithmetic, then prints each product and the sum of its digits immediately. This enumeration may help uncover a pattern or formula for \(\text{omnimath578\_answer}(n)\).

```python
# Enumerate n from 0 to 7, compute product and digit sums.
def digit_sum(x):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(x))

def product_term(i):
    return 10**(2**i) - 1

def main():
    max_n = 7
    for n in range(max_n + 1):
        prod = 1
        for i in range(n + 1):
            prod *= product_term(i)
        s = digit_sum(prod)
        print(f"n={n}, product={prod}, digit_sum={s}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
