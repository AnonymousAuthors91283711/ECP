The problem involves finding real exponents \(x_n\) such that \((4+n)^{x_n} = 5+n\) for \(n=0,1,...,123\), and then computing the product \(\prod_{n=0}^{123} x_n\). Since \(x_n = \log_{4+n}(5+n) = \frac{\ln(5+n)}{\ln(4+n)}\), the product simplifies to \(\prod_{n=0}^{123} \frac{\ln(5+n)}{\ln(4+n)} = \frac{\prod \ln(5+n)}{\prod \ln(4+n)}\).

We can numerically approximate this product by evaluating the logs for \(n=0\) to \(123\), and print the incremental partial products to look for patterns or simplifications. The program will print each \(x_n\) and the cumulative product up to \(n\), helping conjecture an exact form.

```python
import math

def main():
    N = 124
    product = 1.0
    print(f"Enumerating x_n = log_(4+n)(5+n) and cumulative product for n=0 to {N-1}:\n")
    for n in range(N):
        base = 4 + n
        val = 5 + n
        # x_n = ln(val)/ln(base)
        ln_val = math.log(val)
        ln_base = math.log(base)
        x_n = ln_val / ln_base
        product *= x_n
        print(f"n={n}: x_n = ln({val})/ln({base}) ≈ {x_n:.6f}, cumulative product ≈ {product:.6f}")

    print("\nApproximate final product:")
    print(product)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
