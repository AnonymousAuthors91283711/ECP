noncomputable abbrev omnimath3382_answer : ℕ → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3382 (k : ℕ) (hk : k > 0) :
  omnimath3382_answer k = 1/6 + 1/(3 * (-2)^k) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun k => 1/6 + 1/(3 * (-2)^k)
Proposed Answer: fun k : ℕ => if k = 0 then 0 else (1/6 : ℝ) + 1 / (3 * (-2 : ℝ)^k)
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is mostly correct but differs from the ground truth in two aspects:
1. It handles the k=0 case specially (returning 0), while the ground truth doesn't have this special case
2. The ground truth answer is defined for all k, while the proposed answer explicitly restricts to k : ℕ

The mathematical expressions are equivalent for k > 0, but the domain/constraint handling differs.
