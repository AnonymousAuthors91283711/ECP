Ground Truth Answer: 15/64
Proposed Answer: ((2 * 120 * 15) - 15^2) / (120^2 : ℝ)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is calculating the probability that two independent uniform random variables in [0,120] are within 15 units of each other.

2. The ground truth answer is 15/64 ≈ 0.234375

3. The proposed answer is ((2*120*15) - 15²)/120² = (3600 - 225)/14400 = 3375/14400 = 15/64

The proposed answer simplifies to exactly the same value as the ground truth answer. The calculation is correct and complete.
