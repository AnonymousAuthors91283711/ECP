theorem P2004AMCB_8 (n : ℕ) (h : n = 100) : 
  IsLeast {k : ℕ | Finset.sum (Finset.range k) (fun i => 2 * i + 1) = n} (P2004AMCB_8_answer n) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n = 1, minimal k = 1 with sum = 1
n = 4, minimal k = 2 with sum = 4
n = 9, minimal k = 3 with sum = 9
n = 16, minimal k = 4 with sum = 16
n = 25, minimal k = 5 with sum = 25
n = 36, minimal k = 6 with sum = 36
n = 49, minimal k = 7 with sum = 49
n = 64, minimal k = 8 with sum = 64
n = 81, minimal k = 9 with sum = 81
n = 100, minimal k = 10 with sum = 100
n = 121, minimal k = 11 with sum = 121
n = 150 not a perfect square sum of first k odd numbers.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
<<<fun n : ℕ => Nat.sqrt n>>>
