noncomputable abbrev P2025AIMEI_9_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2025AIMEI_9 :
  ∃! (p : ℝ × ℝ), p.2 = p.1^2 - 4 ∧
  let θ := π / 3
  let x' := p.1 * cos θ - p.2 * sin θ
  let y' := p.1 * sin θ + p.2 * cos θ
  y' = x'^2 - 4 ∧
  p.1 > 0 ∧ p.2 < 0 ∧
  p.2 = P2025AIMEI_9_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Searching points p = (x,y) with y = x^2 - 4, x>0, y<0,
such that rotated p by pi/3 also lies on y = x^2 - 4 within tolerance.
No candidates found. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
