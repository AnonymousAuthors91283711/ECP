The problem involves splitting 8 pizza slices into plain and anchovy halves, with given costs, and computing payments for Dave and Doug based on their consumption. We want to explore how Dave's and Doug's payments compare for various slices eaten by Dave.

We'll enumerate possible values for total slices (fixed at 8), costs, and slices eaten by Dave to observe the difference in payments.

```python
# Enumerate sensible pizza slice consumption scenarios to compare Dave's and Doug's payments
total_slices = 8
plain_cost = 8
anchovy_cost = 2
anchovy_slices = total_slices // 2
plain_slices = total_slices - anchovy_slices

print(f"total_slices={total_slices}, plain_cost={plain_cost}, anchovy_cost={anchovy_cost}")

# Dave eats anchovy_slices anchovy slices (all anchovy) and varies plain slices eaten from 0 to plain_slices
for dave_ate_plain in range(0, plain_slices + 1):
    dave_ate_anchovy = anchovy_slices
    doug_ate_plain = plain_slices - dave_ate_plain

    # Dave pays for anchovy slices with anchovy cost included
    dave_payment = (dave_ate_plain * plain_cost / total_slices) + (dave_ate_anchovy * (plain_cost + anchovy_cost) / anchovy_slices)
    doug_payment = doug_ate_plain * plain_cost / total_slices

    diff = dave_payment - doug_payment
    # print exact fraction values and float approximation for clarity
    print(f"Dave plain slices: {dave_ate_plain}, Dave payment: {dave_payment:.3f}, Doug payment: {doug_payment:.3f}, Difference: {diff:.3f}")
```
