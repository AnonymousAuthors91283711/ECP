No n found with the exact trailing zeros count.. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
The number of trailing zeros of n! in base 10 is given by:

padicValNat 10 (n!) = min(padicValNat 2 (n!), padicValNat 5 (n!)) = padicValNat 5 (n!)

since factors of 2 are abundant. The formula for padicValNat 5 (n!) is:

⨉k≥1, floor(n / 5^k).

We want this to be exactly 1987. Checking around ranges:

- floor(7920/5) = 1584
- floor(7920/25) = 316
- floor(7920/125) = 63
- floor(7920/625) = 12
- floor(7920/3125) = 2
Sum: 1584+316+63+12+2=1977, too low

Try 7940:

7940/5=1588, 7940/25=317, 7940/125=63, 7940/625=12, 7940/3125=2 sum=1982

Try 7960:

7960/5=1592, 7960/25=318, 7960/125=63, 7960/625=12, 7960/3125=2 sum=1987

Exactly 1987 at n=7960.

So the smallest n>0 with padicValNat 10 (n!)=1987 is 7960. The set of such n’s with that exact valuation is all n with 1987 trailing zeros, i.e. n in [7960, 7964], because 7965/5 adds an extra zero.

Hence the set is {n ∈ ℕ | n ∈ Finset.Icc 7960 7964}.

Therefore,

<<<{n : ℕ | 7960 ≤ n ∧ n ≤ 7964}>>>
