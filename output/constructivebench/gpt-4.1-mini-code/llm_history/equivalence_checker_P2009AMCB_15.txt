Ground Truth Answer: fun r => (log (7/3)) / (log (1 + r/10))
Proposed Answer: fun r : ℝ => (Real.log (7/3)) / Real.log (1 + r / 10)
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer and the ground truth answer are equivalent. Both expressions represent the same mathematical function, where:
1. Both use the natural logarithm (log) of 7/3 in the numerator
2. Both use the natural logarithm of (1 + r/10) in the denominator
3. The only difference is the explicit type annotation in the proposed answer (ℝ) and the fully qualified Real.log, which doesn't change the mathematical meaning
4. Both would produce the same output for any valid input r in the specified domain (0 < r < 3)
