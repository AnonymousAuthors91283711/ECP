Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (n + 1)! - (n - 1)!
Proposed Answer: fun n => 2^(n - 1)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum cardinality of a certain type of subset A of functions from Fin n to ℕ with specific closure properties (closed under max and min operations).

2. The ground truth answer is (n + 1)! - (n - 1)!, which grows factorially with n.

3. The proposed answer is 2^(n - 1), which grows exponentially with n.

For n = 2:
- Ground truth: (3)! - (1)! = 6 - 1 = 5
- Proposed: 2^(1) = 2
These don't match.

For n = 3:
- Ground truth: (4)! - (2)! = 24 - 2 = 22
- Proposed: 2^(2) = 4
Again, different.

The growth rates and specific values show these are fundamentally different answers. The proposed exponential answer is incorrect compared to the factorial-based ground truth.
