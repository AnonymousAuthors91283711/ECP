The problem asks about subsets \( S \subseteq \{1, \dots, 10^5\} \) of size 1983 with no 3-term arithmetic progression. This relates to finding large progression-free subsets of integers. 

We will enumerate subsets with no 3-term arithmetic progression for small cases (smaller ranges and sizes) to gain understanding. We will print sets and check if they contain 3-APs, focusing on efficiency. Since enumerating subsets of size 1983 from \(10^5\) is impossible, we use smaller parameters (e.g., up to 30) to generate maximal 3-AP free sets or approximate constructions (like the Salem-Spencer set).

```python
# Enumerate 3-AP-free subsets of {1,...,N} for small N and sizes,
# Print candidates to explore maximal size without 3-term arithmetic progression.

from itertools import combinations

def has_3ap(s):
    arr = sorted(s)
    pos = set(arr)
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        for j in range(i+1,len(arr)):
            a,b = arr[i],arr[j]
            c = 2*b - a
            # Check if c in s and a < b < c
            if c in pos and c > b:
                return True
    return False

def enumerate_3ap_free(N, max_size):
    print(f"Enumerating 3-AP-free subsets of [1..{N}] with size up to {max_size}")
    for size in range(1,max_size+1):
        for s in combinations(range(1,N+1), size):
            if not has_3ap(s):
                print(f"3-AP free subset size={size}: {s}")

# Run for small parameters
enumerate_3ap_free(15,5)
```
