theorem omnimath3554 (f : ℕ → ℕ) :
  (∀ n, 0 < n → (IsSquare (∑ k in Finset.range n, f (k+1)))) ∧ (∀ n, 0 < n → (f n ∣ n^3)) ↔ f = omnimath3554_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: f = (1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343), partial sums = [1, 9, 36, 100, 225, 441, 784]. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
<<<fun n : ℕ => n^3>>>
