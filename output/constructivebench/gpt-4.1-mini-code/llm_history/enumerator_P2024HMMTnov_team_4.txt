The problem involves summing the digit sums of multiples of 9 from 9 up to 9*111 = 999. We want to enumerate and print the digit sums for these numbers and then provide their total sum.

```python
def digit_sum(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

def main():
    multiples = [9 * (k + 1) for k in range(111)]
    total = 0
    for m in multiples:
        s = digit_sum(m)
        print(f"digit_sum({m}) = {s}")
        total += s
    print(f"Total sum: {total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
