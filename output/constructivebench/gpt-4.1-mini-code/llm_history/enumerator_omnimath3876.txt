The problem describes a functional equation on functions \( f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \):
\[
\forall m,n \in \mathbb{N}, \quad f(f(n) + f(m)) = m + n.
\]
We want to find all functions \( f \) satisfying this property.

We will try to enumerate possible functions on small finite domains (e.g., \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\)) and verify the property for these domain values, printing functions that satisfy the equation on this sample domain. This helps conjecture the form of \( f \). 

By iterating over all functions \( f: \{0,1,2,3\} \to \{0,1,2,3,4,5,6\} \) (range bigger than domain to allow outputs adding up), we check if 
\[
f(f(n) + f(m)) = n + m
\]
holds for all \( n,m \in \{0,1,2,3\} \).

We print \( f \) if it holds, and later hope to identify candidates or patterns.

```python
# Enumerate candidate functions f: {0,1,2,3} -> {0,...,7} satisfying:
#   f(f(n)+f(m)) = n + m for all n,m in {0,1,2,3}
# This helps to conjecture the true answer.

def check_f(f_vals):
    # f_vals is a list of length 4: f(0), f(1), f(2), f(3)
    # Check if f(f(n)+f(m)) = n+m holds for all n,m in 0..3
    for n in range(4):
        for m in range(4):
            arg = f_vals[n] + f_vals[m]
            if arg >= len(f_vals):
                # f has domain only 0..3, input out of domain: invalid for this test domain
                # So discard this f function
                return False
            lhs = f_vals[arg]
            rhs = n + m
            if lhs != rhs:
                return False
    return True

def main():
    from itertools import product
    domain = 4
    max_output = 7  # try outputs 0..7 to cover sums in domain {0..3}+{0..3}=0..6 possibly
    candidate_count = 0
    print("Enumerating candidate functions f: {0..3} -> {0..7}...")
    for f_vals in product(range(max_output+1), repeat=domain):
        # Check if the function satisfies the condition
        if check_f(f_vals):
            candidate_count += 1
            print(f"Candidate #{candidate_count}: f = {list(f_vals)}")
    if candidate_count == 0:
        print("No candidates found with this domain and output range.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
