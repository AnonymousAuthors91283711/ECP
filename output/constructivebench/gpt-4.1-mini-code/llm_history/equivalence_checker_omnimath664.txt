Ground Truth Answer: (-7) / 16
Proposed Answer: 1 / 2
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the sum of squares of all distinct roots of a given 10th degree polynomial.

2. The ground truth answer is -7/16, while the proposed answer is 1/2.

3. To verify, we can use Vieta's formulas. For a polynomial p(X) = aₙXⁿ + ... + a₀, the sum of roots is -a_{n-1}/aₙ, and the sum of products of roots two at a time is a_{n-2}/aₙ.

4. For the given polynomial p(X) = 4X¹⁰ - 7X⁹ + ..., the sum of roots is 7/4 and the sum of products of roots two at a time is 5/4.

5. The sum of squares of roots is (sum of roots)² - 2*(sum of products two at a time) = (7/4)² - 2*(5/4) = 49/16 - 10/4 = 49/16 - 40/16 = 9/16.

6. However, the problem asks for the sum of squares of distinct roots. The polynomial appears to have multiple roots (since 9/16 ≠ -7/16), but the exact multiplicity isn't given.

7. The proposed answer 1/2 doesn't match either the sum of squares of all roots (9/16) or the ground truth (-7/16).
