abbrev olympiadbench2521_answer : Set ℝ := sorry
theorem olympiadbench2521 (A : ℝ) :
    A ∈ olympiadbench2521_answer ↔
    ∃ (a b c : ℝ), a < b ∧ b < c ∧
    a^2 + b^2 = c^2 ∧
    b - a = c - b ∧
    (a = 60 ∨ b = 60 ∨ c = 60) ∧
    A = a * b / 2 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating (a,b,c) with a<b<c, b-a=c-b, a^2+b^2=c^2, one side=60; printing area A = (a*b)/2
For a=3d = 60: (a,b,c) = (60,80,100), Area = 2400.0
For b=4d = 60: (a,b,c) = (45,60,75), Area = 1350.0
For c=5d = 60: (a,b,c) = (36,48,60), Area = 864.0. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
<<<{2400, 1350, 864}>>>
