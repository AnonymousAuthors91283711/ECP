The problem is to count odd integers \( n \) such that \( \frac{17}{4} < n < \frac{35}{2} \). We can enumerate integer candidates in this interval, check oddness, and count them. The program will print each such \( n \) and the count.

```python
# Enumerate odd integers n with 17/4 < n < 35/2 and print each.
# Then print the total count.

def main():
    lower = 17/4  # 4.25
    upper = 35/2  # 17.5
    count = 0
    start = int(lower) + 1  # smallest integer greater than 4.25 is 5
    end = int(upper)        # integers less than 17.5 have max 17

    for n in range(start, end + 1):
        if n % 2 == 1:  # odd check
            print(n)
            count += 1
    print("Count:", count)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
