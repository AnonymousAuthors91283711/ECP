The problem is to find pairs of positive integers \((a,b)\) such that:
1. \(\gcd(2a - 1, 2b + 1) = 1\).
2. \(a + b\) divides \(4ab + 1\).

We will enumerate all pairs \((a,b)\) with small \(a,b\), check these conditions, and print any pairs satisfying them immediately. This will help conjecture the form of solutions.

```python
# Enumerate pairs (a,b) with 1 <= a,b <= 50
# Check gcd(2a-1, 2b+1) = 1 and (a+b) divides (4ab+1)
# Print all such pairs found

from math import gcd

MAX = 50

for a in range(1, MAX+1):
    for b in range(1, MAX+1):
        x = 2*a - 1
        y = 2*b + 1
        if gcd(x,y) == 1:
            s = a + b
            val = 4*a*b + 1
            if val % s == 0:
                print(f"Pair found: (a={a}, b={b}), divides: {val}//{s}={val//s}, gcd({x},{y})=1")
```
