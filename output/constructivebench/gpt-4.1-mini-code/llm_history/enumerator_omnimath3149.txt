[write_program]
Let's interpret this as a problem involving a function on pairs of natural numbers, say `omnimath3149_answer : (ℕ × ℕ) × (ℕ × ℕ) → ℕ`, and the goal is to determine its value. Since the theorem states that `omnimath3149_answer (3, 1) (4, 2) = 14`, we can try to guess what function on pairs could produce 14 for these inputs (3,1) and (4,2).

A natural approach: maybe the output is a function of `(a,b)` and `(c,d)` like some combination of products, sums, or gcd/lcm. We can enumerate functions like `a*c + b*d`, `a*d + b*c`, etc., and see which equal 14 for these inputs.

We will write a Python program to enumerate values of various candidate functions for `(3,1)` and `(4,2)` and print those that produce 14. Also, print the results of these functions for other input pairs with small samples to inform conjecture.

```python
# Enumerate candidate functions from pairs of (a,b) and (c,d) to an integer.
# For (3,1) and (4,2), find functions f((3,1),(4,2))=14.
# Consider combinations: a*c, b*d, a*d, b*c, sums, products, etc.

def functions(a, b, c, d):
    # Simple arithmetic combinations
    yield a*c + b*d
    yield a*d + b*c
    yield a*c + b*c + a*d + b*d
    yield (a + b) * (c + d)
    yield abs(a*c - b*d)
    yield abs(a*d - b*c)
    yield max(a, b) * max(c, d)
    yield min(a, b) * min(c, d)
    yield a*b + c*d
    yield a*b*c*d
    yield (a + b) * c + d
    yield a + b + c + d
    yield a*c*b*d
    yield (a+b+c+d)**2
    yield (a*b + c*d)**2

def main():
    a, b = 3, 1
    c, d = 4, 2
    
    values = set()
    for val in functions(a, b, c, d):
        if val == 14:
            print(f"For input ({a},{b}),({c},{d}) got candidate value: {val}")
            values.add(val)
    
    # Enumerate for small values to see results of one promising candidate:
    # Try f(a,b,c,d) = a*c + b*d
    print("Enumerating values of f(a,b,c,d) = a*c + b*d for small values (a,b,c,d in [1..5]):")
    for a in range(1,6):
        for b in range(1,6):
            for c in range(1,6):
                for d in range(1,6):
                    val = a*c + b*d
                    if val <= 20:
                        print(f"f(({a},{b}),({c},{d})) = {val}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
