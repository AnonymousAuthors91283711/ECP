[write_program]
The problem seems to involve finding the greatest possible value \(\mu\) related to configurations of points inside the unit square \((0,1) \times (0,1)\), considering subsets \(C\) of size \(4n\) and rectangles \(R\) contained within the open unit square that contain exactly one point of \(C\). The goal is to explore candidate values of \(\mu\) (likely representing volumes of rectangles containing a unique point of \(C\)).

I'll write a Python program to generate sets \(C\) with \(4n\) points in the unit square for small \(n\), enumerate all axis-aligned rectangles defined by pairs \((a,b)\) and \((c,d)\) with \(0 < a < b < 1\), \(0 < c < d < 1\), and check how the rectangles contain points of \(C\). This will help conjecture the greatest \(\mu\) values.

The program will:
- Use small values of \(n\) (e.g. 1 and 2).
- Generate points in the unit square spaced nicely.
- Enumerate rectangles defined by pairs of points from the \(C\).
- Check which rectangles contain exactly one point.
- Print candidate \(\mu\) = area(R) when such rectangles found.

```python
# Enumerate candidate rectangle areas containing exactly one point from C,
# with |C| = 4n points in (0,1)^2 for small n.

def rectangles_with_one_point(C):
    # C: list of points (x,y) in (0,1)^2
    # Enumerate rectangles defined by distinct x,y-coordinates from C and boundaries in (0,1)
    # Check rectangles that contain exactly one point
    xs = sorted(set(p[0] for p in C))
    ys = sorted(set(p[1] for p in C))
    candidates = set()
    n = len(C)//4
    
    # To create rectangles with 0 < a < b < 1 and 0 < c < d < 1, 
    # we take adjacent xs, ys and move slightly inside edges to avoid endpoints
    eps = 1e-12
    
    # We'll define candidate intervals between adjacent xs and ys
    x_intervals = [(xs[i]+eps, xs[i+1]-eps) for i in range(len(xs)-1)]
    y_intervals = [(ys[i]+eps, ys[i+1]-eps) for i in range(len(ys)-1)]
    
    for (a,b) in x_intervals:
        for (c,d) in y_intervals:
            # Define rectangle R = (a,b) x (c,d)
            pts_inside = [p for p in C if a < p[0] < b and c < p[1] < d]
            if len(pts_inside) == 1:
                area = (b - a)*(d - c)
                # Print candidate mu = area and the rectangle and point
                print(f"n={n} rectangle (({a:.6f},{b:.6f}),({c:.6f},{d:.6f})) "
                      f"area={area:.6f} unique_point={pts_inside[0]}")
                candidates.add(area)
    if candidates:
        max_area = max(candidates)
        print(f"n={n} maximal candidate area (mu): {max_area:.6f}")

def main():
    # We use n=1 and n=2 for tractability
    # For n=1, 4 points arranged as grid points inside (0,1)^2
    n = 1
    C1 = [(0.25,0.25),(0.25,0.75),(0.75,0.25),(0.75,0.75)]
    # For n=2, 8 points as 2x4 grid inside (0,1)^2
    n = 2
