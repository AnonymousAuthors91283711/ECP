The problem asks us to find all real-coefficient quintic polynomials with constant term 2020 such that the roots are closed under multiplication by a specific complex cube root of unity \(\omega = \frac{-1 + i \sqrt{3}}{2}\). In particular, for each root \(r\), \(\omega r\) is also a root. This implies the roots come in orbits of size 3 under multiplication by \(\omega\), or roots fixed by multiplication by \(\omega\).

Given the polynomial is degree 5, root multiplicity and fixed roots by \(\omega\) impose strong conditions.

To explore, let's try to enumerate possible polynomials:

- The constant term is fixed at 2020.

- Roots either come in triples \(\{r, \omega r, \omega^2 r\}\) with product \(r \cdot \omega r \cdot \omega^2 r = r^3\), or roots fixed by \(\omega\). The only number fixed by \(\omega\) is zero, so zero is the only root fixed under \(\omega\).

So the polynomial's roots are:

- Either 0 with some multiplicity (max 2 since degree 5), or no zeros,

- Plus factors of cubics built from orbits of three roots under multiplication by \(\omega\).

The polynomial factors as a product of polynomials corresponding to these orbits.

One natural approach is to consider the minimal polynomial for each orbit:

Let \(r \neq 0\). Then the minimal polynomial for \(\{r, \omega r, \omega^2 r\}\) is

\[
(x - r)(x - \omega r)(x - \omega^2 r) = x^3 - r^3.
\]

Because \(\omega, \omega^2\) are cube roots of unity satisfying \(z^3 = 1\), the product expands to \(x^3 - r^3\).

Thus, the quartic/quintic polynomial must factor as a product of something like:

- Factors of the form \(x^3 - a\) for some real \(a = r^3\),

- Possibly factors of \(x\) (for zero roots),

with the constraint of total degree 5 and constant term 2020.

We can try all partitions of degree 5 into sums of degrees 3 and 2 or 3 and 1+1:

- \(5 = 3 + 2\) or \(5 = 3 + 1 + 1\) or with zero factors multiplicity.

Try to find real polynomials of the form:

\[
(x^3 - a)(x^2 + b x + c) \quad \text{with real coefficients and} \quad \text{constant term }= 2020.
\]

We know that the roots of the quadratic aren't necessarily closed under \(\omega\), so to satisfy problem conditions, the quadratic factor must also satisfy the root closure condition or be a power of \(x\) (for zero roots).

Also, the problem says "∀ roots \(r\), \(\omega r\) is a root", so the polynomial's roots are invariant under multiplication by \(\omega\). A linear or quadratic factor would not have that property unless all roots are zero.

So the polynomial must be of the form:

\[
(x^3 - a)(x^2 - m x + n)
\]

and the roots of the quadratic must be stable under multiplication by \(\omega\), that is, if \(r\) is a root, then so is \(\omega r\). The only fixed point is \(r=0\), so the roots of quadratic must be zero or zero multiplicity, implying quadratic factors can't appear unless it is \(x^2\).

So the polynomial must be:

\[
(x^3 - a)(x^2) \quad \Rightarrow \quad x^5 - a x^2,
\]

with constant term zero, contradicting the problem's constant term 2020.

Therefore, the roots cannot be just \(x^2\) times \(x^3 - a\). We must consider a polynomial with a single root at zero repeated once or zero times, and two orbits of roots under \(\omega\).

Since 5 is not divisible by 3, only 0 or 1 roots can be fixed.

Try the factorization:

\[
p(x) = (x^3 - a)(x^2 - b x + c),
\]

and impose the condition that the roots of the quadratic are also closed under multiplication by \(\omega\).

But multiplication by \(\omega\) maps the root \(r\) to \(\omega r\), so the roots are closed if the quadratic is basically \(x^2\) (roots both zero), or null.

We can check the problem constraints by brute forcing some integer values for \(a, b, c\) with the constant term of the polynomial equal to 2020 (the constant term is \(c \cdot (-a)\)):

\[
\text{constant term} = (-a) \cdot c = 2020.
\]

Since \(a\) and \(c\) are real numbers. Let's try integer divisors of 2020 for \(a, c\) to satisfy the equation.

Given these hints, write a program to enumerate integer divisors of 2020 and test possible factorizations, printing all polynomials found satisfying the root closure condition numerically (or checking symbolic constraints).

```python
# enumerator.py
from math import isclose

omega = complex(-0.5, (3**0.5)/2)  # the cube root of unity
const = 2020

def poly_coeffs(a, b, c):
    # p(x) = (x^3 - a)*(x^2 - b x + c) = x^5 - b x^4 + (c - a) x^3 + a b x^2 - a c x - a c
    # Actually, multiply carefully:
    # (x^3 - a)*(x^2 - b x + c) = x^5 - b x^4 + c x^3 - a x^2 + a b x - a c
    # constant term = -a c
    return [1, -b, c, -a, a*b, -a*c]

def roots_closure(poly_roots):
    # Check if roots are closed under multiplication by omega
    roots = poly_roots
    for r in roots:
        w_r = omega * r
        if not any(isclose(w_r.real, rr.real, abs_tol=1e-6) and isclose(w_r.imag, rr.imag, abs_tol=1e-6) for rr in roots):
            return False
    return True

def main():
    divisors = []
    for i in range(1, abs(const)+1):
        if const % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            divisors.append(-i)

    divisors = list(set(divisors))
    divisors.sort()
    from numpy.polynomial import Polynomial as P
    import cmath

    for a in divisors:
        for c in divisors:
            if -a * c == const:
                # Try all integer b in reasonable range
                for b in range(-10,11):
                    coeffs = poly_coeffs(a, b, c)
                    p = P(coeffs[::-1])  # numpy poly expects low-to-high coeffs
                    roots = p.roots()
                    # Check roots closure approx
                    if roots_closure(roots):
                        print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, poly: x^5 - {b}x^4 + {c}x^3 - {a}x^2 + {a*b}x - {a*c} = 0")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This enumerates candidate polynomials with factorization \((x^3 - a)(x^2 - b x + c)\) having constant term 2020, checking approximate root closure under multiplication by \(\omega\). This hopefully helps conjecture the exact answer.

If the problem wants the number of polynomials, one can count printed results.
[refine_program]
The original program attempts to find all polynomials \( p(x) = x^5 + a x^4 + b x^3 + c x^2 + d x + 2020 \) whose roots are closed under multiplication by \(\omega = \frac{-1 + i \sqrt{3}}{2}\) (a primitive cube root of unity). The problem reduces to enforcing the condition on roots of \(p\).

The program heuristically assumes \( p(x) = (x^3 - a)(x^2 - b x + c) \) factorization and tries to find integer \(a,b,c\) so that \(p\) has the correct constant term and roots form omega-closed sets. However:
- This factorization assumption is unjustified and too restrictive.
- The closure check ignores that roots could coincide or require exactly permuted sets.
- B values are tested in a narrow range \(-10 \leq b \leq 10\), which is arbitrary.
- No attempt is made to verify the coefficient matching for the original polynomial format.
- The polynomial coefficients printed contradict the problem's form (coefficients are mismatched).

Because the original program outputs nothing, it suggests the logic or assumptions are incorrect or incomplete, so it must be rejected.

### Corrected Approach

Key insights from the problem:

- The polynomial is monic degree 5 with constant 2020.
- Its roots are closed under multiplication by \(\omega\), a primitive cube root of unity.
- This implies roots group into orbits of size 3 (or fixed points if root == 0).
- The polynomial must factor as a product of factors with roots stable under multiplication by \(\omega\).
- Since degree 5 is not divisible by 3, one root must be fixed by \(\omega\) (which would be 0).
- So polynomial factors as \( x \cdot q(x) \), where \(q\) is degree 4 with root sets stable under multiplication by \(\omega\).
- The orbits of \(\omega\) are of size 3; degree 4 is not divisible by 3 either, so possibly one root fixed at 0 again or a quadratic factor.
- Alternatively, the orbit structure implies the polynomial factors as \((x - r)(x - \omega r)(x - \omega^2 r)\) times a quadratic whose roots are also \

The original submission contains no program and no enumeration attempts, only the problem statement in Lean syntax. Since the task is to provide a Python program enumerating answers per the problem's requirements, and the original submission is empty, it must be rejected and a proper Python program provided.

Judgement: The problem involves finding polynomials of degree 5 with real coefficients, leading term 1 and constant term 2020, whose roots are invariant under multiplication by a cube root of unity ω = (-1 + i√3)/2. This implies the roots come in orbits under multiplication by ω, so roots come in triplets unless they are fixed by multiplication by ω.

Since ω^3 = 1, roots fixed by ω satisfy r = ω r ⇒ (ω - 1)r = 0 ⇒ r=0, and 0 is not a root of the polynomial since the constant term is 2020 ≠ 0. Therefore, all roots must come in orbits of size 3 under multiplication by ω.

The polynomial is degree 5, so the number of roots counting multiplicities is 5, but the roots are in orbits of size 3. This is impossible unless some roots have multiplicity >1 and the multiplicities sum to 5, decomposed into orbits of size 3 or possibly other conditions. This suggests the problem is subtle.

We need to find all real polynomials p(x) = x^5 + a x^4 + b x^3 + c x^2 + d x + 2020 such that whenever r is root, ω r and ω^2 r are also roots. Note, the problem is a known 2020 AMC problem, likely ACM 12B, problem 17 or similar.

The task requests a program that enumerates all polynomials meeting the condition and counts them.

Since the problem is complex and involves algebraic manipulations beyond simple enumeration, I'll write a program enumerating the possible factorizations into irreducible factors over ℝ with roots closed under multiplication by ω.

Key insight:

- The roots come in orbits of size 3 under multiplication by ω.

- Since degree = 5, total roots (counted with multiplicity) = 5.

- So possible orbits partitions:

  - One orbit of size 3 and a double root (orbit of size 1 or orbit of size 2?)

But orbit sizes are 3 since multiplication by
