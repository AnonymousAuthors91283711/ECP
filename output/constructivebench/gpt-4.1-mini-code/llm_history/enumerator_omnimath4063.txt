The problem is: find positive integers \(a, b, c\) such that each of \(a b + 1\), \(b c + 1\), and \(c a + 1\) is a factorial number. We want to enumerate triples \((a,b,c)\) with small values to find all solutions.

We'll try \(a,b,c\) up to a small limit (say 20) to keep output short and find all triples where each product plus one is a factorial. We'll generate factorials once, map them to their inverse products, and print triples as found.

```python
import math

# Precompute factorials up to 10! (suitable for numbers up to ~3,628,800)
factorials = [math.factorial(i) for i in range(2, 11)]
fact_set = set(factorials)

# Max value for a,b,c to try
MAX = 20

print("Trying a,b,c in [1..20], looking for (a,b,c) with a*b+1, b*c+1, c*a+1 all factorials:")

for a in range(1, MAX+1):
    for b in range(1, MAX+1):
        ab1 = a*b+1
        if ab1 not in fact_set:
            continue
        for c in range(1, MAX+1):
            bc1 = b*c+1
            if bc1 not in fact_set:
                continue
            ca1 = c*a+1
            if ca1 not in fact_set:
                continue
            # Found a triple meeting the conditions
            print(f"(a,b,c)=({a},{b},{c}), with factorial values: a*b+1={ab1}, b*c+1={bc1}, c*a+1={ca1}")
```
