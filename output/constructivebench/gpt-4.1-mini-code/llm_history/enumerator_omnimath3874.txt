This problem asks to find all integer pairs \((a,b)\) satisfying:
\[
(b^2 + 7(a - b))^2 = a^3 b
\]

We will enumerate a reasonable range of integer \((a,b)\), compute the left and right sides exactly, and print all pairs that satisfy this equation. We prioritize exact integer checks and print as soon as we find solutions. We show results for \(-50 \le a,b \le 50\) for demonstration.

```python
# Enumerate integer pairs (a,b) in range [-50,50]
# Check if (b^2 + 7(a - b))^2 == a^3 * b holds.
# Print all exact solutions immediately.

def main():
    limit = 50
    for a in range(-limit, limit + 1):
        for b in range(-limit, limit + 1):
            # Avoid zero division or trivial issues if any (none here)
            lhs = (b**2 + 7*(a - b))**2
            rhs = a**3 * b
            if lhs == rhs:
                print(f"(a, b) = ({a}, {b}) satisfies (b^2 + 7(a - b))^2 = a^3 b")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
