The problem appears to involve finding the smallest natural number \( n \) such that \( 9 \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \) equals some number, and this number is minimal or unique in some way. To assist, I will enumerate values of \( n \) and their corresponding values \( 9 \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \), print them immediately, and identify candidates for this minimal value.

```python
# Enumerate n and compute 9 * (n * (n + 1) // 2), print values and
# identify minimal such values up to a reasonable n

def main():
    max_n = 20  # small sample range
    seen_values = {}
    print("Enumerating values of n and 9*n(n+1)/2:")
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        val = 9 * n * (n + 1) // 2
        print(f"n={n}, value={val}")
        # track first occurrence of each value
        if val not in seen_values:
            seen_values[val] = n

    # Find minimal n for each value and print the minimal value and n
    min_val = min(seen_values.keys())
    min_n = seen_values[min_val]
    print(f"Minimal value: {min_val} achieved at n={min_n}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
