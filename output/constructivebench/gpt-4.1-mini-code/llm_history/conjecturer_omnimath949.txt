Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
The count of permutations with exactly one fixed point is given by choosing the fixed point (6 ways) and deranging the other 5 elements. Since Lean does not have a `Nat.derangement` function by default, we can define it ourselves using the standard formula for derangements:

derangement(n) = n! * ∑_{k=0}^n (-1)^k / k!

For n=5, the derangement number is known to be 44.

So the count is 6 * 44 = 264, and the total number of permutations is 6! = 720, so the answer is 264/720 = 11/30.

Hence, we can write the answer directly as a rational number:

<<< 11 / 30 >>>
