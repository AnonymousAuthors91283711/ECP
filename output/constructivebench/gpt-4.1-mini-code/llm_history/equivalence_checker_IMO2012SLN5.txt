Ground Truth Answer: {f | ∃ (a m : ℕ), ∀ (n : ℕ), f n = a * n ^ m}
Proposed Answer: { f : ℕ → ℕ | ∃ c n0 : ℕ, (f = fun n => c * n0 ^ n) ∨ (f = fun n => c * (rad n) ^ n0) }
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

1. Ground truth: All functions of the form f(n) = a * n^m where a and m are constants.
2. Proposed answer: Two cases:
   - f(n) = c * n0^n (exponent is variable, base is constant)
   - f(n) = c * (rad n)^n0 (base is radical function, exponent is constant)

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
- The first case has the exponent as the variable n, which is different from the ground truth where the exponent is fixed.
- The second case uses rad(n) as the base, which isn't equivalent to n^m since rad(n) only includes distinct prime factors.
- Neither case matches the ground truth's form of a * n^m where both a and m are constants.
