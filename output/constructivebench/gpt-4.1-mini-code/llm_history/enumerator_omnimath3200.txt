The equation is 5*(n-2)=85. Solve for n: n-2=85/5=17, so n=19. The program below enumerates integer n and checks when 5*(n-2) = 85, printing matches immediately.

```python
# Enumerate integers near the expected solution of 5*(n-2)=85, print matches immediately
def main():
    for n in range(10, 30):  # small range around expected 19
        lhs = 5 * (n - 2)
        if lhs == 85:
            print(f"n = {n}, satisfies 5*(n-2)=85")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
