. Enumerated answers: Enumerating integers m in [-1000,1000]:
m = -105, n = ±181, n^2 = 32761
m = -8, n = ±13, n^2 = 169
m = -1, n = ±1, n^2 = 1
m = 0, n = ±1, n^2 = 1
m = 7, n = ±13, n^2 = 169
m = 104, n = ±181, n^2 = 32761
Greatest n found: 181 for m = -105, since 181^2 = 3*-105^2 + 3*-105 + 1. Expected Answer Type: ℤ
The problem involves finding the greatest integer n such that n^2 = (m+1)^3 - m^3 for some integer m. We start by simplifying the difference of cubes:

(m+1)^3 - m^3 = 3m^2 + 3m + 1

We want n^2 = 3m^2 + 3m + 1. The enumerated data shows the largest n is 181 at m = -105 or 104, giving n^2 = 32761. Since 181^2 = 32761, and the values repeat symmetrically around these m values, the greatest n is ±181. Thus:

<<<181>>>
