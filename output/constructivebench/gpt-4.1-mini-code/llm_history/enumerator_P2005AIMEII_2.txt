The problem involves a combinatorial probability expressed as a fraction, specifically:

- total = C(9,3)*C(6,3)*C(3,3)
- favorable = 6 * (3!)^3
- probability = favorable / total

We want to find the fraction in lowest terms (coprime numerator and denominator).

The program below computes total and favorable exactly, reduces the fraction, and prints all intermediate and final results streaming as required.

```python
# Enumerate all relevant combinatorial values and reduce fraction for probability from the 2005 AIME II Problem 2.
from math import comb, factorial
from math import gcd

# Compute total number of ways to select the teams:
c9_3 = comb(9, 3)
print(f"C(9,3) = {c9_3}")
c6_3 = comb(6, 3)
print(f"C(6,3) = {c6_3}")
c3_3 = comb(3, 3)
print(f"C(3,3) = {c3_3}")

total = c9_3 * c6_3 * c3_3
print(f"Total = {total}")

# Compute favorable outcomes:
favorable = 6 * (factorial(3)**3)
print(f"Favorable = {favorable}")

# Print raw fraction:
print(f"Raw fraction = {favorable}/{total}")

# Reduce fraction to lowest terms:
g = gcd(favorable, total)
num = favorable // g
den = total // g

print(f"Reduced fraction = {num}/{den}")

# Format output as numerator and denominator pair:
print((num, den))
```
