The problem involves a recursively defined sequence where each term after the first two is the product of the previous two terms. We want to examine the 2-adic and 5-adic valuations of the 14th term in the sequence and find their minimum.

To assist with this, we enumerate the sequence values and compute the 2-adic and 5-adic valuations using a helper function. We print all intermediate valuations and the minimum valuation for n=14.

```python
def v_p(n, p):
    # p-adic valuation of n wrt prime p
    if n == 0:
        return float('inf')
    count = 0
    while n % p == 0:
        n //= p
        count += 1
    return count

def custom_sequence(n):
    # Sequence defined by:
    # a0 = 2, a1 = 5, a_{n+2} = a_n * a_{n+1}
    seq = [2, 5]
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        seq.append(seq[i-2]*seq[i-1])
    return seq

def main():
    n = 14
    seq = custom_sequence(n)
    val_2 = v_p(seq[n], 2)
    val_5 = v_p(seq[n], 5)
    print(f"custom_sequence({n}) = {seq[n]}")
    print(f"v_2(custom_sequence({n})) = {val_2}")
    print(f"v_5(custom_sequence({n})) = {val_5}")
    print(f"min(v_2, v_5) = {min(val_2, val_5)}")

    # Optional: print valuations for all terms to conjecture pattern
    print("\nIndex: v_2, v_5")
    for i, val in enumerate(seq):
        print(f"{i}: {v_p(val,2)}, {v_p(val,5)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
