Ground Truth Answer: 335
Proposed Answer: 6 * 7^2 + 5 * 7 + 6
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. Let's break it down:

1. The proposed answer is 6 * 7² + 5 * 7 + 6
2. Calculating this: 6*49 + 5*7 + 6 = 294 + 35 + 6 = 335
3. The ground truth answer is 335
4. The problem asks for the greatest number in the set {n | ∃ A B, A ≠ B ∧ n = A*7² + B*7 + A}
5. The proposed answer gives exactly this form with A=6, B=5 (A≠B) and evaluates to 335

Therefore, the answers are equivalent.
