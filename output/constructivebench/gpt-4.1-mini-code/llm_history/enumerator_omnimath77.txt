[write_program]
This problem involves characterizing functions \( f:\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \) that satisfy the functional equation
\[
f(m \cdot \varphi(n^3)) = f(m) \cdot \varphi(n^3)
\]
for all positive integers \( m, n \) with \( m \ge n \), where \(\varphi\) denotes Euler's totient function.

To assist in conjecture, our program will:
- Compute \(\varphi(n^3)\) for small \( n \).
- For small \( n, m \) (with \( m \ge n \)) enumerate tuples \((m, n)\).
- Enumerate candidate functions \( f \) defined on a small domain (like the first few natural numbers).
- Check the equation for each candidate \( f \).
- Print exact function values and confirm which satisfy the equation for sampled values.

Because the function domain and codomain are infinite, we'll restrict to functions defined on small initial segments of \(\mathbb{N}\) and try some natural function candidates (like identity, constant, multiplicative with prime powers, etc.) and output immediate results.

```python
from math import gcd
from sympy import totient

# Define small domain and range to test candidate functions
MAX_N = 5  # max n in dom(n), as n^3 will be computed
MAX_M = 7  # max m in domain of f to test

# Candidate functions f on {1,..., MAX_M}
# We'll try:
# 1) identity f(x)=x
# 2) constant function f(x)=1
# 3) f(x)=c*x for c=2 (homothety)
# 4) f(x) = totient(x) (if defined on range)
# 5) f(x) = 1 if x=1 else 0 (simple, to check)
# 6) f multiplicative-like: f(p^k) = p^k or 1
