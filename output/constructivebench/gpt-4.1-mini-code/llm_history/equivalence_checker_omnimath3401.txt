Ground Truth Answer: fun p => 100 - p
Proposed Answer: fun p : ℝ => 100 - p
<<<True>>>

Explanation: The proposed answer `fun p : ℝ => 100 - p` is exactly equivalent to the ground truth answer `fun p => 100 - p`. The only difference is the explicit type annotation `: ℝ` in the proposed answer, which doesn't affect the mathematical meaning or behavior of the function. Both answers correctly represent the function that subtracts the input p from 100. The type annotation is just a syntactic detail that doesn't change the function's essence.
