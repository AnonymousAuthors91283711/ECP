Given the problem involves counting handshake combinations within twins and triplets and their mixed interactions, I will enumerate handshake counts for small numbers of twins and triplets. Then the total handshakes will be printed to help conjecture the general formula or the specific value for the provided counts.

```python
# Enumerate handshake totals for small counts of twins and triplets to assist conjecture
# Twins each have 2 people; triplets have 3 people.
# Handshakes among twins and triplets groups and between groups are counted.

def handshake_count(twin_groups, triplet_groups):
    twins = 2 * twin_groups
    triplets = 3 * triplet_groups
    # Total handshakes among twins groups:
    # Each twin person shakes hands with others in the same group and among triplet groups.
    # The problem formula suggests interactions within groups and half interactions between groups.
    twin_handshakes = twin_groups * (2 * (twins - 2) + 2 * (triplets / 2))
    triplet_handshakes = triplet_groups * (3 * (triplets - 3) + 3 * (twins / 2))
    return (twin_handshakes + triplet_handshakes) / 2

print("Enumerating handshake counts for sample values:")
for twins_count in range(1, 5):
    for triplets_count in range(1, 5):
        total = handshake_count(twins_count, triplets_count)
        print(f"twins = {twins_count}, triplets = {triplets_count}, handshakes = {int(total)}")

# Using problem's original specific counts: twins = 9 groups, triplets = 6 groups
twin_groups = 9
triplet_groups = 6
result = handshake_count(twin_groups, triplet_groups)
print(f"Original problem counts: twins = {twin_groups}, triplets = {triplet_groups}")
print(f"Total handshakes = {int(result)}")
```
