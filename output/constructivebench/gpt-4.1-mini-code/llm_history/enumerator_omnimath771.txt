The problem involves finding the sum of the digits of the binomial coefficient "1000 choose 100". Since the number is huge, direct computation of it by exact arithmetic in Python and then summing its digits is feasible using Python's built-in arbitrary-precision integers.

The program below calculates C(1000, 100), converts it to a string, sums the digits, and prints the resulting sum. This verifies the theorem's claim about the digit sum. Since we want to print partial results and demonstrate the process, I'll also print the binomial coefficient digits length and some intermediate steps.

```python
from math import comb

def main():
    n, k = 1000, 100
    print(f"Computing C({n}, {k})...")

    c = comb(n, k)  # exact binomial coefficient
    digits_str = str(c)
    print(f"Number of digits in C({n},{k}): {len(digits_str)}")

    digit_sum = 0
    for d in digits_str:
        digit_sum += int(d)
    print(f"Sum of digits of C({n},{k}): {digit_sum}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
