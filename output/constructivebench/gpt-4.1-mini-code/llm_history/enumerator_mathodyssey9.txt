The problem involves finding all triples \((a,b,c)\) of natural numbers such that \(a > b > c > 1\) and the product \(a b c\) divides \((a b - 1)(b c - 1)(c a - 1)\).

We want to enumerate possible \((a,b,c)\) triples with small values, test the divisibility condition, and print those satisfying it. This can help conjecture the number of such triples and their nature.

We'll:
- Iterate over \(c\) from 2 to a small limit (say 10),
- \(b\) from \(c+1\) to a small max (say 15),
- \(a\) from \(b+1\) to a small max (say 20),
- Check the divisibility condition,
- Print each valid triple immediately.

This approach will keep the output concise and reveal patterns.

```python
# Enumerate triples (a,b,c) with a>b>c>1 and check divisibility condition

def main():
    max_c = 10
    max_b = 15
    max_a = 20

    count = 0
    for c in range(2, max_c + 1):
        for b in range(c + 1, max_b + 1):
            for a in range(b + 1, max_a + 1):
                abc = a * b * c
                numerator = (a * b - 1) * (b * c - 1) * (c * a - 1)
                if numerator % abc == 0:
                    print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, divides={(numerator // abc)}")
                    count += 1

    print(f"Total solutions found (limited search): {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
