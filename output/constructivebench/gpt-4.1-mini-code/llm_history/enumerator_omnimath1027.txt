The problem counts the number of triples \((a,b,c)\) with \(a,b,c \in \{0,\ldots,5\}\) that satisfy the triangle inequalities: 
\(a+b>c\), \(a+c>b\), and \(b+c>a\).

We want to enumerate all such triples and output the ratio \(\frac{|S|}{6^3}\).

```python
# Enumerate all triples (a,b,c) in [0..5]^3 satisfying triangle inequalities:
# a+b>c, a+c>b, b+c>a, then print each triple and finally print the ratio.

N = 6
count = 0
total = N**3

for a in range(N):
    for b in range(N):
        for c in range(N):
            if a + b > c and a + c > b and b + c > a:
                print(f"Valid triple: (a={a}, b={b}, c={c})")
                count += 1

ratio = count / total
print(f"Number of valid triples: {count}")
print(f"Ratio |S| / 6^3 = {ratio}")
```
