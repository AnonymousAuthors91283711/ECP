The problem asks to count integers \(n\) between 4 and 2014 (inclusive) such that \(n \mod 5 = 4\) and the sum of their decimal digits is even. We will enumerate all such numbers, compute their digit sums modulo 2, and count them, printing each satisfying number as it is found. Finally, we will print the total count.

```python
# Enumerate numbers n in [4..2014] with n % 5 == 4 and even digit sum
def digit_sum(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

count = 0
for n in range(4, 2015):
    if n % 5 == 4:
        s = digit_sum(n)
        if s % 2 == 0:
            print(n)  # print each qualifying number immediately
            count += 1
print("Total count:", count)
```
