The problem asks to evaluate the expression \((2+4+6)/(1+3+5) - (1+3+5)/(2+4+6)\). We want to find its exact value as a rational number.

We will sum the numerators and denominators, then compute the expression exactly and print the result. Since the problem uses simple fixed values, we can compute directly and print the rational value.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Define the sums of even and odd numbers as given
even_sum = 2 + 4 + 6
odd_sum = 1 + 3 + 5

# Compute the expression as a Fraction to keep exact values
result = Fraction(even_sum, odd_sum) - Fraction(odd_sum, even_sum)

print("Computing (2+4+6)/(1+3+5) - (1+3+5)/(2+4+6):")
print(f"({even_sum})/({odd_sum}) - ({odd_sum})/({even_sum}) = {result}")
```
