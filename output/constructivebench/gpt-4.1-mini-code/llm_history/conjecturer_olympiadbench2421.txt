The error arises because of incorrect set-builder notation in Lean. In Lean, the notation `{x | p x}` expects a `Prop` following the `|`. To express a set of integers given by `5 + 4 * d` for integers `d` that satisfy a certain equation, we use `{ y : ℤ | ∃ d : ℤ, y = 5 + 4 * d ∧ ... }`, making the predicate a proposition.

Additionally, the candidate uses `d` directly outside a binder, causing "unknown identifier" errors.

From the problem, the condition is:

25 + (5 + d)^2 + (5 + 2d)^2 = (5 + 3d)^2 + (5 + 4d)^2.

This characterizes the values of `a5` of the form `5 + 4d` where the given quadratic sum condition holds. We encapsulate this condition inside an existential quantifier for `d`.

Thus the correct Lean expression for the set is:

{ a5 : ℤ | ∃ d : ℤ, a5 = 5 + 4 * d ∧ 25 + (5 + d)^2 + (5 + 2 * d)^2 = (5 + 3 * d)^2 + (5 + 4 * d)^2 }

This resolves all the issues: the predicate after `|` is a valid `Prop`, `d` is locally bound, and the set is properly typed as a subset of ℤ.

This is the closed form for the answer set.

<<<{ a5 : ℤ | ∃ d : ℤ, a5 = 5 + 4 * d ∧ 25 + (5 + d)^2 + (5 + 2 * d)^2 = (5 + 3 * d)^2 + (5 + 4 * d)^2 } >>>
