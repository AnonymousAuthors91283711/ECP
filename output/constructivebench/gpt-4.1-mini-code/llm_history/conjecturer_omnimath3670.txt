abbrev omnimath3670_answer : ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3670 (f : ℝ → ℝ) (hf : ∀ x, x > 0 → f x > 0) :
  (∀ x y, x > 0 → y > 0 → f (x * y + f x) = x * f y + 2) ↔ f = omnimath3670_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing functions f(x) = a*x + b for a,b in {0,1,2}:
f(x) = 1*x + 1 satisfies the condition. Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
<<<fun x : ℝ => x + 1>>>
