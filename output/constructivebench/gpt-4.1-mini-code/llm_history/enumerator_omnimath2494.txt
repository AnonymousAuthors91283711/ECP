The given Lean mathlib snippet suggests a limit involving the product of a sequence's terms indexed by natural numbers. To explore such behaviors numerically, we can consider simple sequences `a(i)` and compute finite products to look for convergence patterns.

We'll choose sample sequences like:
- a(i) = 1 + 1/(i+1) (which diverges)
- a(i) = 1 - 1/(i+2) (which converges to zero)
- a(i) = 1 + (-1)^i/(i+2) (oscillatory)
and compute partial products for n up to some small range to track convergence numerically.

This enumeration will help conjecturing limits of products and their approximations.

```python
# Enumerate partial products of sample sequences to explore convergence.
def a1(i):
    return 1 + 1/(i+1)         # Diverges, product grows

def a2(i):
    return 1 - 1/(i+2)         # Converges to zero product

def a3(i):
    return 1 + (-1)**i/(i+2)   # Oscillates

def compute_products(a_func, max_n=15):
    prod = 1.0
    for n in range(1, max_n+1):
        prod *= a_func(n-1)
        print(f"n={n}, product={prod:.6f}")

print("Sequence a1: a(i) = 1 + 1/(i+1)")
compute_products(a1)
print("\nSequence a2: a(i) = 1 - 1/(i+2)")
compute_products(a2)
print("\nSequence a3: a(i) = 1 + (-1)^i/(i+2)")
compute_products(a3)
```
