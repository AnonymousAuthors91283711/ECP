Ground Truth Answer: 469
Proposed Answer: 6 + 24 + 2.4
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem involves solving for a, b, and c given three exponential equations with logarithms in the exponents.

2. The ground truth answer is 469, which comes from:
   - Solving for a gives 3^3 = 27
   - Solving for b gives 7^2 = 49
   - Solving for c gives 11^(1/2) = √11
   - Summing these gives 27 + 49 + √11 ≈ 27 + 49 + 3.3166 ≈ 79.3166, but this doesn't match 469

3. The proposed answer is 6 + 24 + 2.4 = 32.4, which is clearly different from both the ground truth and the correct calculation.

4. Both answers seem incorrect based on the problem's requirements and the actual solution path.
