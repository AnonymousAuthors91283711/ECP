Ground Truth Answer: 70
Proposed Answer: (7/10 : ℚ) * 100
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer (7/10 : ℚ) * 100 simplifies to 70, which matches the ground truth answer. The calculation is equivalent, just expressed in a different form (as a fraction of the total rather than the direct numerical value). Both represent the same quantity.
