The problem concerns finding a quadratic polynomial \( f \) with integer coefficients such that for every natural number \( n \), the value \( f(n) \) is a power of 2. The problem states no such polynomial exists (¬ ∃ f of degree 2 with this property).

To assist in conjecturing and proof, I will write a Python program that enumerates quadratic polynomials \( f(x) = a x^2 + b x + c \) with small integer coefficients \( a,b,c \), tests values for \( n = 0,1,2,3,4 \), and prints results if all \( f(n) \) are powers of 2.

By scanning small coefficients and small \( n \), the program can help identify if any such polynomial might have all outputs powers of two (highly unlikely). This helps conjecture that none exist.

```python
# Enumerate quadratic polynomials f(x) = a x^2 + b x + c with small integer coefficients
# For each polynomial, check f(n) for n in 0..4, print if all are powers of two

def is_power_of_two(x):
    return x > 0 and (x & (x-1)) == 0

def poly_eval(a,b,c,n):
    return a*n*n + b*n + c

def main():
    max_coeff = 10  # coef range from -10 to 10
    ns = range(5)   # check first 5 natural numbers
    count_found = 0
    for a in range(-max_coeff, max_coeff+1):
        if a == 0:
            continue  # degree must be 2
        for b in range(-max_coeff, max_coeff+1):
            for c in range(-max_coeff, max_coeff+1):
                # Evaluate polynomial for n in ns
                vals = [poly_eval(a,b,c,n) for n in ns]
                # Must be positive and powers of two
                if all(v > 0 and is_power_of_two(v) for v in vals):
                    print(f"f(x) = {a} x^2 + {b} x + {c}; values at {list(ns)} = {vals}")
                    count_found += 1
                    if count_found >= 10:
                        print("...stopped after 10 found examples")
                        return

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
