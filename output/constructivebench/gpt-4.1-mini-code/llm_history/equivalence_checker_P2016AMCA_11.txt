Ground Truth Answer: 64
Proposed Answer: 71
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. This is a classic inclusion-exclusion problem with three sets (singers, dancers, actors) where:
   - Total students = 100
   - Non-singers = 42 ⇒ Singers = 58
   - Non-dancers = 65 ⇒ Dancers = 35
   - Non-actors = 29 ⇒ Actors = 71
   - No student is in all three groups simultaneously

2. We need to find the number of students in exactly two groups (the union of pairwise intersections).

3. Using inclusion-exclusion principles:
   - Total in at least one group = 100 - (students in none)
   - But we don't have direct info about students in none
   - Alternative approach: Sum all groups (58+35+71=164), subtract those in exactly two groups (x) and twice those in all three (0, from h_no_all)
   - The overlap is 164 - 100 = 64

The ground truth answer (64) is correct based on this calculation, while the proposed answer (71) incorrectly uses just the number of actors rather than computing the proper overlap.
