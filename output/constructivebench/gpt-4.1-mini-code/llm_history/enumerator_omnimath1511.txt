The problem is to find the least natural number \( x = a + b + c \) for distinct positive natural numbers \( a, b, c \) such that there exists an integer \( k \) with
\[
k = \sqrt{a \sqrt{b \sqrt{c}}}.
\]

We want to enumerate triples \((a,b,c)\) with distinct positive integers summing to some \(x\), check if \( \sqrt{a \sqrt{b \sqrt{c}}} \) is an integer, and find the smallest such \(x\). The computation involves nested square roots and checking integer-ness without floating errors.

We enumerate small values for \(a,b,c\), \(a,b,c \leq 20\), to keep computations quick. We print each triple and sum where the integer condition holds and finally print the minimum sum found.

```python
from math import isqrt, sqrt

def is_perfect_square(n):
    r = isqrt(n)
    return r*r == n

def rational_nested_sqrt(a, b, c):
    # Compute a * sqrt(b * sqrt(c))
    # Check if sqrt(value) is integer, i.e., value is a perfect square
    # value = a * sqrt(b * sqrt(c))
    # Let's compute inner = b * sqrt(c)
    inner_root = sqrt(c)
    inner = b * inner_root
    # sqrt(inner) = (b * sqrt(c))^{1/2} = b^{1/2} * c^{1/4}
    # total = a * sqrt(inner)
    # total_sqrt = sqrt(a * sqrt(b * sqrt(c))) = k integer
    # Check if total_sqrt is integer:
    # Let's do approximate check (then verify close integers)
    val = a * sqrt(b * sqrt(c))
    k = round(val**0.5)
    if abs(k*k - val) < 1e-10:
        # Check if k is integer (this is float approx, but close enough)
        # Better: check if val is a perfect square in exact arithmetic?
        # Since floats are inexact, check val ~ k^2
        return k
    return None

found = []
min_sum = None

# Enumerate distinct positive integers a,b,c up to 20
for a in range(1,21):
    for b in range(1,21):
        if b == a:
            continue
        for c in range(1,21):
            if c == a or c == b:
                continue
            s = a + b + c
            k = rational_nested_sqrt(a,b,c)
            if k is not None:
                print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, sum={s}, k={k}")
                if (min_sum is None) or (s < min_sum):
                    min_sum = s

if min_sum is not None:
    print("Minimum sum with integer k:", min_sum)
else:
    print("No triple found with the condition in given range.")
```
