This problem involves a cubic polynomial \( P(x) = x^3 + a x^2 + b x + c \) with roots related by certain complex numbers shifts involving a root \( w \). The roots are:
- \( w + 3i \)
- \( w + 9i \)
- \( 2w - 4 \)

We want to find \( |a + b + c| \) given these roots.

From the polynomial roots, \( P(x) = (x - r_1)(x - r_2)(x - r_3) \) where \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \) are the roots.

We know:
\[
a = -(r_1 + r_2 + r_3), \quad
b = r_1 r_2 + r_2 r_3 + r_3 r_1, \quad
c = -r_1 r_2 r_3
\]
Hence,
\[
a + b + c = -(r_1 + r_2 + r_3) + (r_1 r_2 + r_2 r_3 + r_3 r_1) - r_1 r_2 r_3
\]

We can write a program to enumerate samples for \( w \) (both real and complex parts small integers) and compute \( A = a + b + c \) for those roots, then compute its absolute value. This may help conjecture the exact value.

```python
# Enumerate sample complex values for w to compute |a+b+c| given roots w+3i, w+9i, 2w-4
def main():
    from itertools import product
    import math
    # To keep output manageable, test w = x + yi where x,y in {-2,-1,0,1,2}
    vals = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]
    printed = set()
    print("w (real, imag) : |a+b+c| values")
    for x, y in product(vals, repeat=2):
        w = complex(x, y)
        r1 = w + 3j
        r2 = w + 9j
        r3 = 2*w - 4
        a = -(r1 + r2 + r3)
        b = r1*r2 + r2*r3 + r3*r1
        c = -r1*r2*r3
        A = a + b + c
        # Only real parts of coefficients are from problem, but roots may be complex
        val = abs(A)
        key = round(val,8)
        if key not in printed:
            printed.add(key)
            print(f"w=({x},{y}) |a+b+c|={val:.8f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
