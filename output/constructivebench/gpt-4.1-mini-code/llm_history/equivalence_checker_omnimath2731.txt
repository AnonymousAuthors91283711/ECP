theorem omnimath2731 (x : ℝ) :
    (5 + x) / 2 = 7 ∧ (x + 9) / 2 = 12 ∧ (5 + 9) / 2 = 10 ↔ x = omnimath2731_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 15
Proposed Answer: 8
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us three equations combined with ∧ (AND) operations:
   - (5 + x)/2 = 7
   - (x + 9)/2 = 12
   - (5 + 9)/2 = 10

2. The third equation (5 + 9)/2 = 14/2 = 7 ≠ 10 is false, which makes the entire left side of the biconditional false regardless of x's value.

3. The ground truth answer is 15. Let's check:
   - (5 + 15)/2 = 10 ≠ 7 (first equation fails)
   - (15 + 9)/2 = 12 (second equation holds)
   - (5 + 9)/2 = 7 ≠ 10 (third equation fails)

4. The proposed answer is 8:
   - (5 + 8)/2 = 6.5 ≠ 7
   - (8 + 9)/2 = 8.5 ≠ 12
   - (5 + 9)/2 = 7 ≠ 10

Both answers make the left side of the biconditional false, but they are not equivalent solutions. The ground truth answer (15) at least satisfies one equation, while the proposed answer (8) satisfies none.
