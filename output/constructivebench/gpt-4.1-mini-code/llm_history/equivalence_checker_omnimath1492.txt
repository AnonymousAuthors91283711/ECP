theorem omnimath1492 (n m : ℤ) :

Ground Truth Answer: {(0, 0), (1, 1)}
Proposed Answer: {(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (0, 0), (1, -1), (1, 1)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The equation is 2^(3^|n|) = 3^(2^|m|) - 1
2. The absolute value operations (natAbs) make the equation symmetric for positive and negative values of n and m
3. We need to find all integer pairs (n, m) that satisfy the equation

Testing the ground truth answer:
- (0,0): 2^(3^0) = 2^1 = 2 and 3^(2^0)-1 = 3^1-1 = 2 → valid
- (1,1): 2^(3^1) = 8 and 3^(2^1)-1 = 9-1 = 8 → valid

Testing the proposed answer additions:
- (-1,-1): Same as (1,1) due to absolute value → valid
- (-1,1): Same as (1,1) → valid
- (1,-1): Same as (1,1) → valid

However, these are just sign variations of the same solutions. The ground truth answer {(0,0), (1,1)} is complete because it contains all unique solution pairs when considering the absolute value symmetry. The proposed answer includes redundant sign variations, but doesn't add any new unique solutions.

The answers are equivalent in terms of the solution space they represent, as the additional pairs in the proposed answer are just sign variations of the ground truth pairs.
