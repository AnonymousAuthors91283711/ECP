. Enumerated answers: Enumerating candidates for x satisfying x = Σ_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^{n+1} x^n
No candidates found in tested range.. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
Explanation: The given equation is x = ∑_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^{n+1} x^n. When n=0, the term is (-1)^1 * x^0 = -1, so the series sum is -1 + ∑_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n+1} x^n. Interpreting it as a geometric series with ratio -x starting at n=1, the sum from n=1 to ∞ is x/(1+x) for |x|<1. Thus, the series sum is -1 + x/(1+x) = (x - 1 - x - 1)/(1+x) = -1/(1+x), which can’t equal x for real x. Rearranging gives x = -1/(1+x) => x(1+x) = -1 => x^2 + x + 1=0, which has no real roots since discriminant < 0. Therefore, the only candidates can be checked for convergence and equality at x= -1 (excluded due to division by zero) or considering convergence radius. The series converges for |x|<1, so final solution set is empty (no real x satisfies the equality). 

Therefore, the answer set is the empty set.
