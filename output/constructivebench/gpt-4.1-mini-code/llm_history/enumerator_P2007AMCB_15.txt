The problem involves real numbers \(a, r\) with \(|r| < 1\), and infinite sums of geometric series:

\[
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} a r^{n} = 7
\quad \text{and} \quad
\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a r^{2k+1} = 3.
\]

We want to explore possible \((a, r)\) pairs satisfying these constraints and examine the value of the expression noted as \(P2007AMCB\_15\_answer(a, r) = \frac{5}{2}\).

From the sums:

1. \(\sum_{n=0}^\infty a r^{n} = a \cdot \frac{1}{1-r} = 7\)
2. \(\sum_{k=0}^\infty a r^{2k+1} = a r \cdot \frac{1}{1-r^2} = 3\)

This yields relations:

\[
a = 7(1 - r),
\]
\[
7(1 - r) \cdot \frac{r}{1 - r^2} = 3.
\]

Let's solve for \(r\), then \(a\), and compute the requested value. We'll enumerate possible \(r\) values near the solution (from -1 to 1 skipping problematic points), print \(a\), and verify sums, printing relevant values.

```python
# enumerator.py
# Enumerate values (a, r) satisfying the infinite sum constraints:
# sum_{n} a r^n = 7, sum_{k} a r^{2k+1} = 3 with |r|<1.

# The sum formulas:
# sum_n a r^n = a/(1-r) = 7 => a = 7(1 - r)
# sum_k a r^{2k+1} = a r/(1-r^2) = 3

# Substitute a in the second:
# 7(1-r)*r/(1 - r^2) = 3

# Let's solve for r numerically and enumerate around the roots.

from math import isclose

print("Enumerate candidate (r,a) pairs where |r|<1 satisfying the sums and computed value.")

def check(r):
    if abs(r) >= 1:
        return
    a = 7*(1 - r)
    lhs2 = a * r / (1 - r**2)
    if not isclose(lhs2, 3, abs_tol=1e-12):
        return
    # Compute the value a/(1-r) and a*r/(1-r^2) again to confirm:
    sum1 = a/(1-r)
    sum2 = a*r/(1 - r**2)
    # Confirm sums
    if not (isclose(sum1, 7, abs_tol=1e-12) and isclose(sum2,3,abs_tol=1e-12)):
        return
    # Now compute the value in problem (which should equal 5/2)
    # The problem does not explicitly state what P2007AMCB_15_answer is,
    # but presumably it's the value a/(1-r^2) or similar.
    # Let's check a/(1 - r^2):
    val = a / (1 - r**2)
    print(f"r = {r:.14f}, a = {a:.14f}, val = {val:.14f}") 

def solve():
    # The equation is:
    # 7 r (1 - r) / (1 - r^2) = 3
    # Rewrite as:
    # 7 r (1 - r) = 3 (1 - r^2)
    # 7 r - 7 r^2 = 3 - 3 r^2
    # 0 = 3 - 3 r^2 - 7 r + 7 r^2 = 3 + 4 r^2 -7 r
    # 4 r^2 - 7 r + 3 = 0
    # Solve quadratic:
    # r = [7 ± sqrt(49 - 48)]/8 = (7 ± 1)/8
    # r = 1 or r = 3/4
    # But r=1 not allowed (radius of convergence <1)
    # So r=0.75 is a valid root
    # Check |r|<1, yes.

    for r in [0.75]:
        check(r)

    # Let's try near r=0.75 by tiny increments print a few for sanity
    for dr in [-0.01, 0, 0.01]:
        rr = 0.75 + dr
        check(rr)
