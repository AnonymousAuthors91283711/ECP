The problem counts assignments from a 5-element set to a 4-element set, with two "parent" elements {0,1} and three "children" elements {2,3,4}, such that the image of any parent differs from the image of any child. Concretely: for all p in {0,1} and c in {2,3,4}, f(p) â‰  f(c). We want to count how many such functions f : {0,...,4} -> {0,...,3} exist.

This means: no parent shares the same value with any child, but parents may share colours and children may share colours (except the cross-condition).

We can enumerate all functions and count those that satisfy the condition. But there are 4^5 = 1024 functions, so it's efficient enough to brute-force.

Let's do a direct enumeration and print all valid functions (or at least count) immediately as we find them to help identify patterns. We print counts as well.

```python
# Enumerate assignments f : {0..4} -> {0..3}
# parents = {0,1}, children = {2,3,4}
# Condition: for all p in parents, c in children: f(p) != f(c)
# That is, no parent value is equal to any child value.

def main():
    parents = [0, 1]
    children = [2, 3, 4]
    n_parents = len(parents)
    n_children = len(children)
    n_domain = 5
    n_range = 4
    total = 0
    
    # We'll print valid functions as tuples (p0,p1,c2,c3,c4)
    # but only print first few to avoid excess verbosity
    
    max_print = 10
    printed = 0
    
    for f0 in range(n_range):
        for f1 in range(n_range):
            parent_vals = {f0, f1}
            for f2 in range(n_range):
                for f3 in range(n_range):
                    for f4 in range(n_range):
                        child_vals = {f2, f3, f4}
                        # Check condition: parent_vals and child_vals are disjoint
                        if parent_vals.isdisjoint(child_vals):
                            total += 1
                            if printed < max_print:
                                print(f"Valid f: ({f0}, {f1}, {f2}, {f3}, {f4})")
                                printed += 1
    print(f"Total valid assignments: {total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This prints some valid assignments and the total count, enabling to conjecture the answer.
