Ground Truth Answer: 195
Proposed Answer: 77
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives two equations:
   - h₁: n*(2a + (n-1)d) = 1430 (sum of arithmetic sequence)
   - h₂: n*(2a + (n-1)d) + n² = 1672

2. From h₁ and h₂, we can derive:
   1430 + n² = 1672 ⇒ n² = 242 ⇒ n = √242 ≈ 15.56
   But n must be a natural number, so this seems problematic.

3. The proposed answer (77) is significantly different from the ground truth (195).

4. The arithmetic doesn't work out with natural numbers for n, suggesting either:
   - The problem statement might have an error
   - The proposed answer is incorrect

Given that the ground truth is 195 and the proposed answer is 77, and considering the arithmetic doesn't support the proposed answer:

<<<False>>>
