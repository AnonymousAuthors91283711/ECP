[write_program]
The problem asks for the smallest natural number \( n > 0 \) such that the product of factorials from 1! to (n-1)! exceeds \((n!)^2\). The program enumerates \( n \) from 2 upward, computes the product of factorials up to \( (n-1)! \) and compares it with \((n!)^2\). It prints each \( n \) where the inequality holds and finally prints the smallest such \( n \).

```python
import math

def factorial_prod(n):
    # Compute product of factorials from 1! up to (n-1)!
    prod = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        prod *= math.factorial(i)
    return prod

def main():
    threshold = 10  # search up to 10 for brevity
    candidates = []
    for n in range(2, threshold+1):
        lhs = factorial_prod(n)
        rhs = math.factorial(n)**2
        if lhs > rhs:
            print(f"n={n}: ∏(i=1 to {n-1}) i! = {lhs} > ({n}!)^2 = {rhs}")
            candidates.append(n)
    if candidates:
        print(f"Smallest n satisfying product > (n!)^2 is {min(candidates)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
