The problem is to find \(x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2}\) given that \(x + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{13}{6}\), where \(x\) is rational.

We know the identity:
\[
\left(x + \frac{1}{x}\right)^2 = x^2 + 2 + \frac{1}{x^2} \implies x^2 + \frac{1}{x^2} = \left(x + \frac{1}{x}\right)^2 - 2.
\]

So given \(x + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{13}{6}\), we directly get the answer.

Below, the program performs this calculation in exact rational arithmetic and prints the result, demonstrating the calculation steps as well.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def main():
    # Given x + 1/x = 13/6
    sum_val = Fraction(13, 6)
    print(f"x + 1/x = {sum_val}")

    # Calculate (x + 1/x)^2
    squared = sum_val * sum_val
    print(f"(x + 1/x)^2 = {squared}")

    # Compute x^2 + 1/x^2 = (x + 1/x)^2 - 2
    result = squared - 2
    print(f"x^2 + 1/x^2 = (x + 1/x)^2 - 2 = {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
