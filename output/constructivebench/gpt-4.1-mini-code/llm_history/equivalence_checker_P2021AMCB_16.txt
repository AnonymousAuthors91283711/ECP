Ground Truth Answer: fun a b c => (1 + a + b + c) / c
Proposed Answer: fun a b c => (a*b + b*c + c*a) / (a*b*c)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a rational function g that has roots which are reciprocals of the roots of f, and specifically evaluates g at 1.

2. The ground truth answer is (1 + a + b + c)/c, which comes from:
   - If f has roots r, s, t, then g has roots 1/r, 1/s, 1/t
   - g(x) = (x - 1/r)(x - 1/s)(x - 1/t)
   - g(1) = (1 - 1/r)(1 - 1/s)(1 - 1/t)
   - Using Vieta's formulas and some algebra, this simplifies to (1 + a + b + c)/c

3. The proposed answer is (a*b + b*c + c*a)/(a*b*c), which would be equivalent to 1/a + 1/b + 1/c. This represents the sum of reciprocals of roots (1/r + 1/s + 1/t), not the product (1 - 1/r)(1 - 1/s)(1 - 1/t).

The proposed answer gives the sum of reciprocal roots, while the ground truth gives the evaluation of g at 1 (which involves the product of terms). These are different quantities.
