Ground Truth Answer: 75
Proposed Answer: 10^(81/2)
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem involves logarithms and their relationships, with a final expression involving the square root of sum of squared logs.

2. The ground truth answer is 75, which is a simple integer value.

3. The proposed answer is 10^(81/2), which simplifies to 10^40.5 or approximately 3.16 × 10^40.

4. The proposed answer is vastly different from the ground truth answer (75 vs ~3.16×10^40).

5. The proposed answer doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, as it's derived from the product condition (x*y*z=10^81) rather than the logarithmic relationships.

6. The correct approach would involve setting a=log x, b=log y, c=log z and solving the system of equations, leading to the answer 75.
