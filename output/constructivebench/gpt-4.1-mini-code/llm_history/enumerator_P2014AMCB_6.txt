The problem involves rational numbers and certain equations related to drinks shared by Ed and Ann. We want to find positive rational numbers r for which the conditions hold, including equality of final amounts and a certain sum. I will enumerate rational values for r and compute the related quantities, checking the conditions and printing candidates as fractions when found.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Enumerate rational r = p/q with small p,q (positive),
# check if conditions hold (Ed final = Ann final),
# print the sum if so, then print r and involved quantities.

print("Enumerating candidates for r = p/q with p,q in [1..10], positive rationals:")

for q in range(1, 11):
    for p in range(1, 11):
        r = Fraction(p, q)
        if r <= 0:
            continue

        large = Fraction(3, 2) * r
        ed_initial = r
        ann_initial = large

        ed_first_drink = Fraction(3, 4) * ed_initial
        ann_first_drink = Fraction(3, 4) * ann_initial

        ann_remaining = ann_initial - ann_first_drink
        ann_gives = ann_remaining / 3 + 2

        ed_final = ed_initial - ed_first_drink + ann_gives
        ann_final = ann_remaining - ann_gives

        if ed_final == ann_final:
            total = ed_first_drink + ed_final + ann_first_drink + ann_final
            # Output in simplest fraction form
            print(f"r = {r}, total = {total}, ed_final = {ed_final}, ann_final = {ann_final}")
```
