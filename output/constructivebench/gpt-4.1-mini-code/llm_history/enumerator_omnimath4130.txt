The problem involves finding triples \((a,b,c)\) of positive integers such that each of the three expressions \(a b - c\), \(b c - a\), and \(c a - b\) is a power of two. The program below enumerates triples \((a,b,c)\) up to a certain limit and checks the conditions, printing each found triple. It also prints the parameters used and stops after reasonable search limits to keep output concise.

```python
# Enumerate triples (a,b,c) with a,b,c > 0 up to a max_limit.
# Check if a*b - c, b*c - a, c*a - b are powers of two.
# Print each triple immediately when found.

def is_power_of_two(x):
    return x > 0 and (x & (x - 1)) == 0

max_limit = 20  # sample parameter to limit search space

print(f"Enumerating triples (a,b,c) with 1 ≤ a,b,c ≤ {max_limit}")

for a in range(1, max_limit + 1):
    for b in range(1, max_limit + 1):
        for c in range(1, max_limit + 1):
            x = a*b - c
            y = b*c - a
            z = c*a - b
            if is_power_of_two(x) and is_power_of_two(y) and is_power_of_two(z):
                print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c} -> ab-c={x}, bc-a={y}, ca-b={z}")
```
