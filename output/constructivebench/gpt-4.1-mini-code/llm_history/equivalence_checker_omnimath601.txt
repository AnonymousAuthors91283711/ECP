Ground Truth Answer: { (2013 : ℂ) ^ 2014 / ((2013 : ℂ) ^ 2013 - 1) }
Proposed Answer: { s : ℂ | ∃ k : Fin 2013, s = 1 / (1 - (1 / (2013 : ℂ)) * exp (2 * Real.pi * Complex.I * k / 2013)) }
Let me analyze the problem and the two answers.

The problem is asking for the set of complex numbers s that can be expressed as s = 1/(1-r) where r is a root of r^2013 = 1/2013^2013.

The ground truth answer gives a single value, while the proposed answer gives a set of 2013 values (one for each k in Fin 2013).

Key observations:
1. The equation r^2013 = 1/2013^2013 has exactly 2013 distinct roots in ℂ
2. Each root can be expressed as (1/2013) * exp(2πik/2013) for k = 0,...,2012
3. Therefore, there should be 2013 distinct values of s, not just one

The ground truth answer appears to be incorrect as it only provides one value, while the proposed answer correctly identifies all 2013 possible values of s.
