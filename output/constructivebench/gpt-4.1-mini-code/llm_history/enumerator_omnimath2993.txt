The problem is about counting positive integers k â‰¤ 2940 such that gcd(205800, 35*k) is a perfect square. We want to enumerate such k and find the total count.

Key observations:
- gcd(205800, 35*k) = gcd(205800, 35) * gcd(205800 / gcd(205800, 35), k) since 35*k shares factors with 205800 partially via 35.
- We can factorize 205800 and 35, then analyze gcd and perfect squares.
- We'll test k from 1 to 2940, check gcd(205800, 35*k), and output k if gcd is a perfect square.
- Count how many such k there are.

```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def is_perfect_square(x):
    if x < 0:
        return False
    r = int(x**0.5)
    return r*r == x

LIMIT = 2940
m = 205800
base = 35

count = 0
for k in range(1, LIMIT+1):
    g = gcd(m, base * k)
    if is_perfect_square(g):
        print(f"k={k}, gcd={g} (perfect square)")
        count += 1
print(f"Total count: {count}")
```
