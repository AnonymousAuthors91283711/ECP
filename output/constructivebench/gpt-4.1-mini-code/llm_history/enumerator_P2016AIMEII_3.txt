The problem involves three real numbers \(x, y, z\) with the conditions:
- \(x y z = 1\)
- \(\frac{\log x}{\log 5} = 100\)
- \(\frac{\log y}{\log 5} = -60\)
- \(\frac{\log z}{\log 5} = 20\)

We want to verify the sum of the absolute values of these logarithmic expressions.

Since these are exact logs given, the sum should be the absolute values of 100, -60, and 20, i.e. 180. To assist conjecturing, I'll enumerate these values directly and print intermediate results.

```python
# Enumerate the logarithmic expressions and their absolute values
def main():
    logs = [100, -60, 20]
    print("Given logarithmic values (log_x/log_5):")
    for v in logs:
        print(v)
    abs_logs = [abs(v) for v in logs]
    print("Absolute values:")
    for v in abs_logs:
        print(v)
    total = sum(abs_logs)
    print("Sum of absolute values:")
    print(total)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
