The problem searches for integer triples \((a,b,c)\) with \(a < b < c\), \(b - a = c - b\) (so the triple is an arithmetic progression), \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = b (b-a)^2\), and \(a,b,c \in [-100,100]\). It wants the sum of all such \(c\).

Since \(b-a = d\), then \(c = b + d\). The conditions become:
- \(a < b < c\), so \(d > 0\),
- \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = b d^2\) with \(c = b + d\).

We can rewrite \(a = b - d\) and substitute into the equation to get a single equation in \(b,d\), then enumerate integers \(b,d\) in ranges and check integer \(a,b,c\).

Below is Python enumeration for \(-100 \leq a,b,c \leq 100\). We print each triple when found and sum the \(c\)'s.

```python
# Enumerate integer triples (a,b,c), a<b<c, b-a=c-b=d>0,
# satisfying a^2+b^2+c^2 = b * d^2, a,b,c in [-100,100].
# Print each found triple and finally print sum of c-values.

def main():
    total_c = 0
    for b in range(-100, 101):
        for d in range(1, 101):
            a = b - d
            c = b + d
            if not (-100 <= a <= 100 and -100 <= c <= 100):
                continue
            if a >= b or b >= c:
                continue
            lhs = a**2 + b**2 + c**2
            rhs = b * (d**2)
            if lhs == rhs:
                print(f"Found triple: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}")
                total_c += c
    print(f"Sum of all c: {total_c}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
