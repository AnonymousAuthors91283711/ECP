Ground Truth Answer: fun x y z => y + z
Proposed Answer: fun x y z => x * (z - 1) * (1 + y + y^2)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a function of x, y, z that is positive under the given constraints:
   - 0 < x < 1
   - -1 < y < 0
   - 1 < z < 2

2. Ground Truth Answer (y + z):
   - Since y > -1 and z > 1, y + z > -1 + 1 = 0
   - This satisfies the requirement of being positive

3. Proposed Answer (x*(z-1)*(1 + y + y²)):
   - x > 0 (positive)
   - z-1 > 0 since z > 1 (positive)
   - For y ∈ (-1,0), 1 + y + y² > 0 (minimum at y=-0.5 gives 1-0.5+0.25=0.75 > 0)
   - Therefore the product is positive

While both answers satisfy the positivity condition, they are clearly different functions. The ground truth is a simple linear function while the proposed answer is a more complex expression. Both work for the given constraints, but they are not equivalent functions.
