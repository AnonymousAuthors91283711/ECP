The problem relates to complex numbers \(x\neq 0\) and the polynomial \(X^3 + X^2 - 2X - 1\). The goal is to explore the relationship between values \(r = x + x^{-1}\) for which \(r\) is a root of the polynomial, and the expression \(x^7 + x^{-7}\).

To experimentally conjecture and verify the formula for \(x^7 + x^{-7}\) in terms of \(r=x+x^{-1}\), we enumerate roots \(r\) of the polynomial and compute \(x^7 + x^{-7}\) for corresponding \(x\) values. Since \(r = x + 1/x\), \(x\) satisfies \(x^2 - r x + 1=0\), so \(x = \frac{r \pm \sqrt{r^2-4}}{2}\).

The program:
- Finds roots \(r\) of the polynomial.
- For each root \(r\), computes the two possible values of \(x\).
- Computes \(x^7 + x^{-7}\) for each \(x\).
- Prints all such values for inspection.

```python
import cmath
import numpy as np

# Polynomial: X^3 + X^2 - 2X -1
coeffs = [1, 1, -2, -1]  # degree 3 to 0

# Find roots r of the polynomial with np.roots
roots = np.roots(coeffs)

print("Roots r of polynomial X^3 + X^2 - 2X -1:")
for r in roots:
    print(f"r = {r}")

print("\nFor each r, compute x from x^2 - r x +1=0 and then compute x^7 + x^{-7}:")

for r in roots:
    # Solve x^2 - r x +1=0
    disc = r*r - 4
    sqrt_disc = cmath.sqrt(disc)
    x_candidates = [(r + sqrt_disc)/2, (r - sqrt_disc)/2]

    for x in x_candidates:
        if abs(x) < 1e-14:
            continue  # x=0 invalid
        val = x**7 + x**(-7)
        print(f"r={r}, x={x}, x^7 + x^-7 = {val}")
```
