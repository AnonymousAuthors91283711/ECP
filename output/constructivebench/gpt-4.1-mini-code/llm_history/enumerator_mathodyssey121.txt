The problem seeks the least natural number \( n \) such that \( 7n \equiv 0 \pmod{52} \) and \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{2} \).

We will enumerate natural numbers \( n \) and check these two conditions to find candidates. The key is to find all \( n \) with \( 7n \equiv 0 \pmod{52} \) and \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{2} \), then identify the least such \( n \).

```python
# Enumerate small n to check conditions:
# 7 * n ≡ 0 (mod 52), n ≡ 0 (mod 2)

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

# Since 7 * n ≡ 0 mod 52 means 52 | 7n.
# 7 and 52 are coprime since gcd(7, 52)=1
# So 52 | n
# Also n ≡ 0 mod 2 means n divisible by 2

# Therefore, n must be a multiple of lcm(52,2) = 52
# So minimal n is 52

def main():
    print("Checking n from 1 to 200 for conditions:")
    for n in range(1, 201):
        cond1 = (7 * n) % 52 == 0
        cond2 = n % 2 == 0
        if cond1 and cond2:
            print(f"n = {n} satisfies 7*n ≡ 0 (mod 52) and n ≡ 0 (mod 2)")

    print("Conjecture: minimal such n is 52")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
