The given sum involves an infinite series of terms depending on n with squares of odd numbers. To help conjecture the closed form sum (omnimath449_answer), we enumerate partial sums for a range of n and print them immediately for observation. We'll use rational approximations when possible and then give a decimal approximation for guidance.

```python
# Enumerate partial sums to conjecture the exact value of the infinite sum.
def partial_sum(N):
    s = 0.0
    for n in range(N):
        a = 2*n + 1
        b = 2*n + 3
        denom_diff = (b**2 - a**2)  # (2n+3)^2 - (2n+1)^2
        term = (1 / denom_diff) * ((1 / a**2) - (1 / b**2))
        s += term
        print(f"n={n}: partial sum = {s:.16f}")
    return s

print("Enumerating partial sums up to n=20:")
partial_sum(20)
```
This will print the partial sums for n=0 to 19, allowing observation of convergence to conjecture the exact value.
