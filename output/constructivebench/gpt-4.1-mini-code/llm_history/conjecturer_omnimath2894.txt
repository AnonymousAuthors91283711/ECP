abbrev omnimath2894_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2894 : 
  ∀ (x : ℝ), (y = 1 ∧ 4 * x - 2 * y + 3 = 3 * x + 3 * y) ↔ x = omnimath2894_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Given y = 1
x = 2 satisfies 4*2 - 2*1 + 3 = 3*2 + 3*1
Exact solution computed:
x = 2 -> LHS = 9, RHS = 9
x ~ 2.0 satisfies the equation approximately
. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<2>>>
