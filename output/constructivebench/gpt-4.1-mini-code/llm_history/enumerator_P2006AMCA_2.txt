[write_program]
We want to explore values of the function defined by tensor(x, y) = x^3 - y and express tensor(h, tensor(h, h)) in terms of h for integers h. We'll enumerate integer values for h in a small range, compute the nested tensor expression, and print results to conjecture a closed form or pattern.

```python
# Enumerate values for h from -10 to 10
def tensor(x, y):
    return x**3 - y

for h in range(-10, 11):
    inner = tensor(h, h)
    outer = tensor(h, inner)
    print(f"h = {h}, tensor(h, tensor(h, h)) = {outer}")
```
