The problem involves summing, over all subsets E of the set S = {0, 1, 2, ..., 1998}, the ratio of the sum of elements in E to the sum of elements in the whole set S. We want to understand the sum:

\[
\sum_{E \subseteq S} \frac{\sum_{x \in E} x}{\sum_{x \in S} x}
\]

Since the denominator is fixed, the main challenge is to evaluate:

\[
\sum_{E \subseteq S} \sum_{x \in E} x
\]

We can simplify this by exchanging sums:

\[
\sum_{E \subseteq S} \sum_{x \in E} x = \sum_{x \in S} \sum_{\substack{E \subseteq S \\ x \in E}} x = \sum_{x \in S} x \cdot |\{ E \subseteq S : x \in E \}|
\]

Each element belongs to exactly half of the subsets (since for each subset that excludes it, there is a corresponding subset including it). So:

\[
|\{ E : x \in E \}| = 2^{|S| - 1}
\]

Thus:

\[
\sum_{E \subseteq S} \sum_{x \in E} x = 2^{|S| - 1} \cdot \sum_{x \in S} x
\]

Dividing by \(\sum_{x \in S} x\), the sum becomes:

\[
\sum_{E \subseteq S} \frac{\sum_{x \in E} x}{\sum_{x \in S} x} = 2^{|S| - 1}
\]

I will write a Python program to verify this for smaller sets by enumerating all subsets and printing the results for small \(n\). 

```python
# Verify the sum for small n by enumerating subsets:
def subsets(lst):
    # Generate all subsets of a list
    if not lst:
        yield []
    else:
        for s in subsets(lst[1:]):
            yield s
            yield [lst[0]] + s

def check(n):
    S = list(range(n))
    total_sum = sum(S)
    if total_sum == 0:
        # Avoid division by zero: sum zero means all elements 0 (only n=0 or n=1 with element zero)
        # For n=0, sum over E in powerset S of sum(x in E)/sum(x in S) undefined
        print(f"n={n}: sum(S)={total_sum}, skipping")
        return
    subsets_list = list(subsets(S))
    # To avoid large output, just sum the values
    total = 0
    for E in subsets_list:
        sE = sum(E) 
        val = sE / total_sum
        print(f"n={n}, subset={E}, sum(E)={sE}, ratio={val}")
        total += val
    print(f"n={n}, total sum = {total}")
    print(f"2^(n-1) = {2**(n-1)}")

# Test small n's
for n in range(1, 6):
    check(n)
```
