This problem asks to find \( f(1) \) given a functional equation on integers:

\[
f(x) + f(y) = f(x+1) + f(y-1)
\]

for all integers \( x, y \), plus the values \( f(2016) = 6102 \) and \( f(6102) = 2016 \).

We need to enumerate candidates for \( f(1) \) consistent with these constraints. First, I'll explore the equation properties for some small integers \( x,y \), and check how \( f \) behaves with plug-in values to find patterns and possible values of \( f(1) \).

The script will:
- Test various integer values \( x,y \) with the functional equation,
- Deduce candidate general forms or numeric constraints for \( f \),
- Print consistent candidates for \( f(1) \) given \( f(2016) \) and \( f(6102) \).

```python
# Enumerate candidates for f(1) satisfying the functional equation and given values
# Try to find f(x) patterns from the equation:
# f(x) + f(y) = f(x+1) + f(y-1)
# which rearranges to f(x) - f(x+1) = f(y-1) - f(y)
# LHS depends on x only, RHS on y only => both equal a constant

def main():
    # Let c = f(x) - f(x+1) for all x (a constant)
    # Then f(x+1) = f(x) - c
    # So f is linear: f(x) = A - c*x for some A
    # Using given values:
    # f(2016) = A - 2016*c = 6102
    # f(6102) = A - 6102*c = 2016
    # Subtract equations:
    # (A -2016c) - (A -6102c) = 6102 - 2016
    # -2016c +6102c = 4086
    # 4086 c = 4086 => c = 1
    # Substitute c=1:
    # f(2016) = A -2016 = 6102 => A = 8118
    # Then f(1) = A - c*1 = 8118 -1= 8117

    # We'll enumerate around these steps to verify

    c_candidates = []
    for c in range(-10, 11):  # guess c from -10 to 10
        A1 = 6102 + 2016*c  # from f(2016)
        A2 = 2016 + 6102*c  # from f(6102)
        # Check if A1 == A2 to get consistent A
        if A1 == A2:
            c_candidates.append((c, A1))

    for c, A in c_candidates:
        f1 = A - c*1
        print(f"Candidate c: {c}, A: {A}, f(1): {f1}")

    # Conclude max/min f(1)
    f1_values = [A - c for c, A in c_candidates]
    if f1_values:
        print("All f(1) candidates:", f1_values)
        print("Minimum f(1):", min(f1_values))
        print("Maximum f(1):", max(f1_values))
    else:
        print("No candidates found")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
