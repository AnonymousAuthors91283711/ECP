The problem is to find the value of the cubic polynomial \(x^3 + x^2 + Bx + C\) at \(x=5\), given that it factors as \((x - 2\alpha)(x - \cos^2(\alpha))(x + \csc^2(\alpha))\) for some real \(\alpha\), where \(B\) and \(C\) are expressed in terms of \(\alpha\).

We want to enumerate values of \(\alpha\) in some small range, compute \(B\), \(C\), and then evaluate the polynomial at 5 according to the factorization to detect any pattern or closed form.

```python
import math

# Enumerate alpha in a small positive range avoiding singularities (sin alpha â‰  0)
for deg in range(5, 91, 5):  # degrees from 5 to 90 step 5
    alpha = math.radians(deg)
    cos_sq = math.cos(alpha)**2
    sin_alpha = math.sin(alpha)
    if abs(sin_alpha) < 1e-6:
        continue
    csc_sq = 1 / (sin_alpha**2)
    
    # The polynomial is (x - 2*alpha)(x - cos^2 alpha)(x + csc^2 alpha)
    # Expand it symbolically for x^3 + x^2 + B x + C:
    # Roots: r1 = 2 alpha, r2 = cos^2(alpha), r3 = - csc^2(alpha)
    r1 = 2*alpha
    r2 = cos_sq
    r3 = -csc_sq
    
    # Sum and products of roots:
    S = r1 + r2 + r3
    P = r1 * r2 * r3
    SP = r1*r2 + r2*r3 + r3*r1
    
    # Polynomial is x^3 - S x^2 + SP x - P
    # Given polynomial is x^3 + x^2 + B x + C, so:
    # Compare coefficients:
    # -S = 1 => S = -1
    # SP = B
    # -P = C
    
    # Compute actual polynomial at x=5:
    val = (5 - r1)*(5 - r2)*(5 - r3)
    
    print(f"alpha (deg): {deg}, S: {S:.6f}, B (sum pairs): {SP:.6f}, C (-product): {-P:.6f}, value at 5: {val:.6f}")
```
