The problem describes natural numbers \(a, b\) satisfying:
- \(a + b = s\),
- \(a - b = 60\),
- there exists \(k \in \mathbb{N}\) such that \(\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{k}\),
- and \(k\) is not a perfect square.

The goal is to find the greatest \(s\) for which such \((a,b,k)\) exist.

To assist with conjecture, I'll enumerate plausible pairs \((a,b)\) for increasing sums \(s = a+b\) with \(a - b = 60\), meaning \(a = b + 60\), so \(s = 2b + 60\), \(b \geq 0\). For each \((a,b)\), I'll check if \(\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b}\) is a perfect square root of some natural number \(k\). That means \(\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{k}\), so

\[
(\sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b})^2 = k \implies a + b + 2 \sqrt{ab} = k.
\]

Since \(k\) must be natural but not a perfect square, \(k = a + b + 2 \sqrt{ab}\) should be integer but not a perfect square.

But \(\sqrt{ab}\) must be rational (to avoid irrational \(k\)).

Thus, to have integral \(k\), \(\sqrt{ab}\) should be rational, so \(ab\) is a perfect square. We'll enumerate \(b\), compute \(a=b+60\), check if \(ab\) is a perfect square, then compute \(k = a+b + 2 \sqrt{ab}\), check if \(k\) is integer and not a perfect square. We'll print all such \(s = a+b\) and highlight the greatest found among a small range.

```python
import math

def is_square(n):
    r = int(math.isqrt(n))
    return r*r == n

max_b = 500  # limit search to keep output short
candidates = []
print("Searching for s = a + b with a - b = 60")
for b in range(1, max_b+1):
    a = b + 60
    s = a + b
    ab = a * b
    if is_square(ab):
        sqrt_ab = int(math.isqrt(ab))
        k = s + 2 * sqrt_ab
        if k == int(k):  # integer k
            # k must not be a perfect square
            if not is_square(k):
                print(f"s={s}, a={a}, b={b}, k={k} (not perfect square)")
                candidates.append(s)

if candidates:
    max_s = max(candidates)
    print(f"Greatest s found: {max_s}")
else:
    print("No candidates found.")
```
