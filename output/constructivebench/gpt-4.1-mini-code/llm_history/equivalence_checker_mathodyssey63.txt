Ground Truth Answer: 0
Proposed Answer: 3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the greatest natural number n such that there exists a multiset of integers with exactly n distinct elements where for each x in the multiset, (P∘P)(x) = x².

2. The ground truth answer is 0, meaning there are no integers x satisfying (P∘P)(x) = x².

3. The proposed answer is 3, suggesting there are 3 distinct integers satisfying the condition.

To evaluate:
- The polynomial P is constrained by three evaluation points, but we don't have enough information to determine P completely.
- However, the condition (P∘P)(x) = x² is very restrictive. For any solution x, P(P(x)) = x².
- Given the evaluation points, it's unlikely that there would be any integers satisfying this condition, let alone 3 distinct ones.
- The ground truth answer of 0 is more plausible as it's the safest answer when no solutions are guaranteed.
