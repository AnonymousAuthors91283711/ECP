The problem involves an integer sequence starting at \(a_1 = 5\) and increasing by \(d\), and a relation involving sums of squares:

\[
a_1^2 + (a_1 + d)^2 + (a_1 + 2d)^2 = (a_1 + 3d)^2 + (a_1 + 4d)^2
\]

We want to find all possible \(a_5 = a_1 + 4d\) such that this holds with integers \(d\).

The program will:
- Fix \(a_1 = 5\)
- Enumerate integer \(d\) in a small range, say \([-10,10]\) excluding zero (to avoid trivial repetition)
- Check the equation and if satisfied, print the corresponding \(a_5\)

This enumeration helps to conjecture the full set of answers.

```python
# Enumerate integer d values where the given quadratic relation holds for a1=5.
a1 = 5
print(f"Parameters: a1={a1}, d in [-10..10]")

for d in range(-10, 11):
    # Compute terms
    lhs = a1*a1 + (a1 + d)**2 + (a1 + 2*d)**2
    rhs = (a1 + 3*d)**2 + (a1 + 4*d)**2
    if lhs == rhs:
        a5 = a1 + 4*d
        print(f"d={d}, a5={a5}")
```
