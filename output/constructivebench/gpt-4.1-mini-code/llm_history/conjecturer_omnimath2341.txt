Candidates found (white set sizes): at least up to 0. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<6>>> 

Explanation: The black set contains 6 points with distinct rows and columns, forcing the white set to be independent similarly. The enumerations show white sets always empty, so the maximal k with white set of size k is 0. But the question is on the greatest k where black has size 6; since black is fixed at 6, and the conditions force no white points, the greatest k is 0. But since the set is {k | ... }, the greatest k is 0, so the answer is 0. However, black is fixed at cardinality 6, so the maximal white k is 0. Hence the greatest element in the set is 0. The Isabelle style marker after review suggests omnimath2341_answer = 0.
