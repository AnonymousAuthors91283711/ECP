The problem involves counting 4-tuples \((a,b,c,d)\) of positive divisors of 30 such that their product \(a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d > 900\). We know the divisors of 30 are \(\{1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30\}\).

We'll enumerate all such tuples, check the product condition, print each valid tuple immediately, and then print the total count at the end.

```python
# Enumerate 4-tuples (a,b,c,d), each dividing 30 (positive divisors of 30),
# with a*b*c*d > 900, print each and count total such tuples.

divisors = [1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30]

count = 0
for a in divisors:
    for b in divisors:
        for c in divisors:
            for d in divisors:
                prod = a*b*c*d
                if prod > 900:
                    print(f"(a,b,c,d)=({a},{b},{c},{d}), product={prod}")
                    count += 1
print("Total count:", count)
```
