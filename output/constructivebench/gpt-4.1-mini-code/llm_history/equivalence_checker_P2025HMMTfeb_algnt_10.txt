Ground Truth Answer: {↑((-1 + Real.sqrt 17) / 2), ↑((-1 - Real.sqrt 17) / 2)}
Proposed Answer: {3}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us three complex numbers a, b, c with cyclic relationships:
   a² = b + 6
   b² = c + 6
   c² = a + 6

2. The ground truth answer provides two possible sums: complex numbers formed from (-1 ± √17)/2

3. The proposed answer suggests the sum is simply {3}

Analysis:
- If we assume a = b = c (which contradicts the given h₁, h₂, h₃), we get x² = x + 6 ⇒ x = 3 or x = -2
- However, the problem explicitly states a ≠ b ≠ c ≠ a
- The correct solution involves solving the system while maintaining distinctness, leading to roots of x³ + 5x² + 12x + 30 = 0
- The sum of roots (a+b+c) would be -5 by Vieta's formula, but the actual distinct roots give different sums
- The ground truth answer correctly identifies the possible sums from the distinct roots case

The proposed answer {3} is incorrect because:
1. It violates the distinctness conditions
2. It doesn't match the correct solution for the distinct roots case

<<<False>>>
