The problem is about analyzing the set of values 
\[ y = \frac{x^2 + 2 - \sqrt{x^4 + 4}}{x} \] 
for \( x > 0 \), and finding the greatest element in that set. To assist, we'll enumerate values for some \( x > 0 \), and print them exactly if possible or as decimals otherwise. We will try small positive values of \( x \), and print the expressions and approximate decimal values to conjecture the supremum.

```python
from math import sqrt

# Evaluate the expression for a given x > 0
def expr(x):
    numerator = x**2 + 2 - sqrt(x**4 + 4)
    return numerator / x

# Print values for x = 0.1, 0.2, ..., 5.0
xs = [i / 10 for i in range(1, 51)]

print("x\tvalue")
for x in xs:
    val = expr(x)
    print(f"{x:.1f}\t{val:.10f}")

# Print values around x = 1 to see if max might be near there
print("\nValues near x=1")
for x in [0.9, 0.95, 1, 1.05, 1.1]:
    val = expr(x)
    print(f"x={x:.2f} -> {val:.10f}")

# Try to output candidate for greatest value found:
vals = [(x, expr(x)) for x in xs]
max_x, max_val = max(vals, key=lambda pair: pair[1])
print(f"\nMaximum value approximately {max_val:.10f} at x={max_x:.1f}")
```
This script enumerates the values of the function at small positive values to conjecture the greatest value in the set.
