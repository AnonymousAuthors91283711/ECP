The problem asks to find all real solutions x to the equation:

\[
(x^2 + 3x + 2)(x^2 - 7x + 12)(x^2 - 2x -1) + 24 = 0
\]

We want to enumerate all such x to conjecture the solution set. We'll:

- Factor each quadratic to understand roots roughly.
- Iterate over a range of real values and also attempt to solve the equation exactly for quadratics or quartics.
- Print each root found exactly when possible or its numerical approximation.
- Since roots are roots of the polynomial expression, we'll solve the resultant polynomial and print roots.

Because the polynomial is of degree 6 (product of three quadratics plus 24), the total polynomial degree is 6.

We'll compute the product polynomial, expand, define a degree-6 polynomial p(x), and then find its roots using numpy's roots function approximated numerically.

Also, check if any roots coincide with roots of factors set to certain values.

We'll print roots with few decimals.

```python
# Enumerate real solutions x to (x^2+3x+2)(x^2-7x+12)(x^2-2x-1)+24=0
# by expanding the polynomial and finding roots.

import numpy as np

def main():
    # Define the factors as polynomials: coefficients from highest degree to constant
    # x^2 + 3x + 2
    p1 = [1, 3, 2]
    # x^2 - 7x + 12
    p2 = [1, -7, 12]
    # x^2 - 2x -1
    p3 = [1, -2, -1]

    # Multiply p1*p2
    p12 = np.polymul(p1, p2)
    # Multiply p12 * p3
    p123 = np.polymul(p12, p3)

    # Now p123 represents (x^2+3x+2)(x^2-7x+12)(x^2-2x-1)
    # Add 24 to the constant term
    p123[-1] += 24

    print("Polynomial coefficients (degree 6 to 0):", p123)

    # Find roots numerically using numpy
    roots = np.roots(p123)

    # Filter real roots (imaginary part near zero)
    rtol = 1e-10
    real_roots = []
    for r in roots:
        if abs(r.imag) < 1e-10:
            real_roots.append(r.real)

    # Sort and print each root immediately
    real_roots = sorted(real_roots)
    for root in real_roots:
        # Print with rational approximation if possible
        # Otherwise print float with 8 decimals
        print("Root:", round(root, 8))

    main()
