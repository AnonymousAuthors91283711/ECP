Ground Truth Answer: fun n => if n = 2 then 4 else if n = 3 then 6 else 7
Proposed Answer: fun n => n + 1
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the minimal number of triples (subsets of size n) needed to cover all pairs of elements from a 2n-element set, where each triple contains exactly n elements.

2. The ground truth answer shows specific values for n=2 (4), n=3 (6), and defaults to 7 for larger n.

3. The proposed answer suggests a simple linear formula n+1.

Comparison:
- For n=2: ground truth says 4, proposed says 3 → mismatch
- For n=3: ground truth says 6, proposed says 4 → mismatch
- For n>3: ground truth says 7, proposed says n+1 (which grows) → mismatch

The proposed answer doesn't match any of the cases in the ground truth and follows a completely different pattern.
