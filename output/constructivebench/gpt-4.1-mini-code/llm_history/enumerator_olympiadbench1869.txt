The problem involves functions \( f : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \) satisfying a divisibility and nonzero condition for all positive \( m, n \). We want to enumerate candidate functions on small domains and test conditions to guess the structure of such functions.

```python
# Enumerate functions f: {1..N} -> ℕ for small N, check conditions:
# For 1 ≤ m,n ≤ N, m,n>0,
# 1) f(m)+f(n) - m*n ≠ 0
# 2) (f(m)+f(n)-m*n) divides (m*f(m) + n*f(n))
# Print all functions satisfying these on range.

N = 4  # small N to keep search feasible
from math import gcd

def divides(a,b):
    return a != 0 and b % a == 0

def check_f(f):
    for m in range(1,N+1):
        for n in range(1,N+1):
            diff = f[m-1]+f[n-1] - m*n
            if diff == 0:
                return False
            if not divides(diff, m*f[m-1] + n*f[n-1]):
                return False
    return True

def main():
    # Enumerate f in [0..N*N], since f(m) >=0, try small ranges
    max_f = N*N
    count = 0
    for vals in range((max_f+1)**N):
        f = []
        x = vals
        for _ in range(N):
            f.append(x % (max_f+1))
            x //= (max_f+1)
        if check_f(f):
            print("Candidate f on [1..{}]: {}".format(N, f))
            count += 1
    print("Total candidates found:", count)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This enumerates all functions on {1..4} into {0..16} and prints those verifying the divisibility condition. This helps conjecture the solution's form.
