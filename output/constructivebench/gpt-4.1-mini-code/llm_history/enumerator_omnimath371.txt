The problem involves finding the minimal integer sum of floor values defined on pairs of a 5-element real vector summing to 20. We want to enumerate candidate values for the sum of floors over all pairs (i,j) with i<j, where f is a vector with sum 20. By sampling various vectors f with sum 20, we can compute the sum of floors and print these sums to conjecture the minimal value.

We'll enumerate samples f with nonnegative components (for simplicity) summing to 20 in increments of 5 or smaller. Then we compute and print the sum over pairs of floor(f_i + f_j).

```python
# Enumerate candidate sums of floor(f_i + f_j) for f in R^5, sum f_i = 20
# f_i sampled from multiples of 5 (0 to 20), sums to 20, generating all integer partitions into 5 parts.
# Compute sum of floor(f_i + f_j) for i<j and print values found.

import itertools

def enumerate_candidates(step=5):
    parts = range(0, 21, step)
    found = set()
    count = 0
    print("Sampling f in (0..20)^5 with sum=20, step =", step)
    for f in itertools.product(parts, repeat=5):
        if sum(f) != 20:
            continue
        # Compute sum of floor(f_i + f_j) over i<j
        total = 0
        for i in range(5):
            for j in range(i+1,5):
                total += (f[i] + f[j]) // 1  # integer sum, floor is redundant here
        if total not in found:
            found.add(total)
            print(total)
            count += 1
        if count >= 30:  # limit to 30 results for brevity
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    enumerate_candidates()
```
This will output possible sums for various partitions and help conjecture the minimal achievable sum.
