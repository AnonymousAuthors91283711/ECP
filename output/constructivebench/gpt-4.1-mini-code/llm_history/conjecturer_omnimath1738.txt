The error occurs because Lean expects a function literal using `↦` or `=>` after `:=` but instead a lambda was written with a comma, which Lean does not accept there. Changing the comma to `↦` or `=>` fixes the syntax.

From the enumerated outputs, functions of the form f(n) = a * n satisfy the functional equation for some integer a. The proper Lean expression for the predicate `omnimath1738_answer` is that there exists an integer a such that f n equals a * n for all integers n.

Hence the fixed expression is:

<<<λ f => ∃ a : ℤ, ∀ n : ℤ, f n = a * n>>>
