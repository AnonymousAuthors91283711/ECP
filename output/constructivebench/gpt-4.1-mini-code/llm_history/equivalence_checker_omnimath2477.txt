theorem omnimath2477 : 
  Nat.card {s : Multiset (Fin 26) | Multiset.card s = 9} = omnimath2477_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: (34).choose 9
Proposed Answer: Nat.choose (26 + 9 - 1) 9
<<<True>>>

Explanation: The problem is asking for the number of multisets of size 9 where each element is from a set of 26 distinct elements (Fin 26). The number of k-combinations with repetition from a set of size n is given by the formula (n + k - 1) choose k. Here, n = 26 and k = 9, so the correct count is (26 + 9 - 1) choose 9 = 34 choose 9. The proposed answer matches exactly with the ground truth answer.
