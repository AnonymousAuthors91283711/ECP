Ground Truth Answer: -3 / 2
Proposed Answer: 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us a quadratic polynomial P(x) = x² + bx + c
2. We have two conditions:
   - P(P(1)) = 0
   - P(P(2)) = 0
3. And an additional condition that P(P(1)) ≠ P(P(2)) (which implies the polynomial has two distinct roots)

From P(P(1)) = 0 and P(P(2)) = 0, we know that P(1) and P(2) must be roots of P. Since P is quadratic, these must be the two roots (though they could be equal, but the hP12 condition prevents this).

Let's set:
P(1) = r₁
P(2) = r₂
where r₁ ≠ r₂ are the roots of P.

Then P(x) = (x - r₁)(x - r₂) = x² - (r₁ + r₂)x + r₁r₂

But we also have P(x) = x² + bx + c, so:
b = -(r₁ + r₂)
c = r₁r₂

Now evaluate P at 1 and 2:
P(1) = 1 + b + c = r₁
P(2) = 4 + 2b + c = r₂

Subtract the first equation from the second:
3 + b = r₂ - r₁

But from b = -(r₁ + r₂), we can substitute:
3 - (r₁ + r₂) = r₂ - r₁
3 - r₁ - r₂ = r₂ - r₁
3 = 2r₂
r₂ = 3/2

Now substitute back into b = -(r₁ + r₂):
b = -(r₁ + 3/2)

From P(1) = 1 + b + c = r₁:
1 - (r₁ + 3/2) + c = r₁
c = 2r₁ + 1/2

But c = r₁r₂ = r₁*(3/2) = (3/2)r₁

Set equal:
2r₁ + 1/2 = (3/2)r₁
1/2 = -1/2 r₁
r₁ = -1

Now we can find b and c:
b = -(-1 + 3/2) = -1/2
c = (-1)(3/2) = -3/2

Finally, P(0) = 0 + 0 + c = c = -3/2

The ground truth answer is -3/2, while the proposed answer is 2. These are clearly different.
