The problem involves finding natural numbers \( k \geq 2 \) such that for all distinct integers \( m, n \in [1,k] \), \( k \) does not divide \( n^{n-1} - m^{m-1} \). We want to enumerate candidates for \( k \) and check this divisibility property.

The Python program below:
- Iterates over sample \( k \) values.
- Checks all pairs \( (m,n) \) in \([1,k]\) with \( m \neq n \).
- Tests if \( k \mid n^{n-1} - m^{m-1} \).
- Prints \( k \) if no such divisibility occurs (i.e., \( k \) satisfies the condition).
- Enumerates for \( k \) from 2 up to a chosen threshold (20 to keep output brief).

This enumeration should help conjecture the set of all such \( k \).

```python
# Enumerate k â‰¥ 2 up to 20 and check the divisibility condition
def check_k(k):
    # For all distinct m,n in [1,k]
    for m in range(1, k+1):
        for n in range(1, k+1):
            if m != n:
                diff = pow(n, n-1, k) - pow(m, m-1, k)
                if diff % k == 0:
                    return False
    return True

def main():
    print("k values satisfying the condition:")
    for k in range(2, 21):
        if check_k(k):
            print(k)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
