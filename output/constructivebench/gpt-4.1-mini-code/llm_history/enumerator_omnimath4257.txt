The problem is to find all integer triples \((x, y, z)\) such that:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 8 \quad \text{and} \quad x + y + z = 8.
\]

We can use a brute force search for integer triples within a reasonable range because cubes grow quickly. Since the sum of cubes is 8, which is relatively small, and the sum is 8, \(x,y,z\) likely lie within \([-10, 10]\).

I'll write a Python program to:
- Enumerate all \((x,y,z)\in[-10,10]^3\).
- Check both conditions.
- Print each found triple immediately.

```python
# Enumerate all integer triples (x,y,z) with x,y,z in [-10,10]
# Check the conditions:
#  x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 8
#  x + y + z = 8
# Print each triple immediately upon finding.

def main():
    for x in range(-10, 11):
        for y in range(-10, 11):
            z = 8 - x - y  # From the linear constraint x+y+z=8
            # Check if z is within the range
            if z < -10 or z > 10:
                continue
            if x**3 + y**3 + z**3 == 8:
                print((x, y, z))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
[refine_program]
The provided program intelligently uses the linear relation x + y + z = 8 to compute z from x and y, reducing the complexity from O(21^3) to O(21^2), which is efficient. It then checks the cubic sum condition x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 8 and prints solutions immediately.

However, the program outputs nothing in the range [-10, 10], indicating no solutions found. Since cubic and linear equations have infinitely many integer solutions, perhaps the search range is too narrow.

To resolve this:
- Expand search range to something larger, e.g. Â±100, increasing coverage but still manageable.
- Also, print parameters chosen (range).
- Print found solutions immediately on discovery.

This corrected program complies with all problem requirements, prints immediate partial results, and does not rely on any "ground truth" or True/False returns.

    print(f"Enumerating integer triples (x,y,z) with x,y in [-{bound},{bound}] and z computed by z=8 - x - y")
    for x in range(-bound, bound+1):
        for y in range(-bound, bound+1):
            z = 8 - x - y
            if z < -bound or z > bound:
                continue
            if x**3 + y**3 + z**3 == 8:
                print((x, y, z))
