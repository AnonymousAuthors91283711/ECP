theorem omnimath2159 :
  let V := Fin 9
  let adj : V → V → Prop := fun v w => v + 1 = w ∨ w + 1 = v ∨ v - 1 = w ∨ w - 1 = v
  let triangles : Set (Finset V) := {t | t.card = 3 ∧ ∀ v ∈ t, ∀ w ∈ t, (v - w) % 3 = (w - v) % 3}
  let valid_colorings (k : ℕ) := {c : V → Fin k | 
    (∀ v w, adj v w → c v ≠ c w) ∧ 
    (∀ t ∈ triangles, Set.InjOn c (t : Set V))}
  let m := sInf {k | Nonempty (valid_colorings k)}
  let n := Nat.card (valid_colorings m)
