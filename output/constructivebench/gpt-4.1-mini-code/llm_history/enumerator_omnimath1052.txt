The problem concerns counting functions \( f \) from a 5-element finite set (Fin 5) to the set of unordered pairs (Sym2) of that same finite set, under these conditions:
1. \( f(i) \neq \{i\} \) (no diagonal pairs),
2. every unordered pair in the image appears exactly twice,
3. the function is injective (distinct inputs map to distinct pairs).

We want to enumerate such functions \( f: \{0,\dots,4\} \to \text{Sym}^2(\{0,\dots,4\}) \), satisfying the constraints, and print each candidate as found.

Key facts and approach:
- \(|\text{Sym}^2(\{0,\dots,4\})| = 15\) pairs (all 2-subsets of 5 elements).
- \(f\) maps 5 elements, each to a 2-subset different than its diagonal.
- The image of \( f \) has exactly 5 pairs, each pair appearing exactly twice in the preimage — but the preimage is only 5 elements total! So the condition that “card {i | f i = x} = 2” can't hold literally as stated (since the domain is size 5, but every image-pair should appear exactly twice, implying preimage size 10). There must be a misunderstanding, or rather: since domain is size 5, for each pair in image, number of preimage elements \(i\) with \(f(i) = x\) is 2. So the total domain size must be multiple of 2 for this to be possible.

Notice the domain is Fin 5, but the condition requires each image element appears exactly twice in the domain. The domain has size 5, so this is impossible unless I've misunderstood.

Wait, the original theorem states:
card {f : Fin 5 → Sym2 (Fin 5) |
(∀ i, f i ≠ diag i) ∧
(∀ x, card {i | f i = x} = 2) ∧
(∀ i j, i ≠ j → f i ≠ f j)} = omnimath1052_answer

The last condition (∀ i ≠ j, f i ≠ f j) contradicts the second, which says each image element x is used twice, so the function is not injective.

This is a contradiction.

Possibility: The variable names are reused, and the third condition says for distinct inputs i, j, images are different??? No, it's negated by the second condition.

Perhaps the problem wants: "For all x in the codomain, card{i | f i = x} is either 0 or 2". So image pairs appear exactly two times, and there are 5 preimages total. We want a partition of 5 elements into pairs of equal images.

But 5 elements cannot be partitioned into pairs of size 2. So domain size probably is 10, or the problem contains a typo.

Given the task is to provide enumeration code to help conjecture the answer, I will assume the domain is Fin 10 (instead of 5) or fix the sizes accordingly.

Alternately, my task is to write a Python program which enumerates candidate functions \( f: \{0,...,4\} \to \text{Sym}^2(\{0,...,4\}) \) satisfying:

- \( f(i) \neq \{i\} \) (no diagonals),
- all images distinct (since \( f i \neq f j \) for \( i \neq j \)),
- each image appears exactly twice (impossible unless domain size is at least 10).

Likely the condition "(∀ x, card {i | f i = x} = 2)" means for any x in the image, the number of preimages is 2 or 0. So \(f\) is a 2-to-1 function onto a 5/2 = 2.5-element set, impossible.

Alternatively, maybe the function is from Fin 10 → Sym2(Fin 5), since the set size of pairs is 15, and the preimage size is 10. Then it's possible to have a function whose image has 5 pairs each appearing exactly twice. Since the problem is in Lean, with Fin 5 in the domain and in the codomain elements, but this is becoming speculative.

Based on the instructions:

I will assume the problem is about functions from domain size 5 to Sym2(Fin 5), with conditions:

- no \( f(i) = \{i\} \),
- images are distinct,
- enumerate all such functions.

To assist conjecturing, let's print all functions from Fin 5 to Sym2(Fin 5) such that \( f(i) \neq \{i\} \), and \( f(i) \neq f(j) \) for \( i \neq j \). We will try to also check the card conditions and print those that satisfy them, if possible.

We will generate all 15 possible pairs \((a,b)\), \(0 \leq a < b \leq 4\), representing unordered pairs (Sym2(Fin 5)).

We want functions \( f : \{0,...,4\} \to \text{Sym}^2(\{0,...,4\}) \), with distinct values \( f(i) \) (i.e. injective functions) with the constraint \( f(i) \neq \{i\} \).

Since 5 is small, we enumerate all injective functions:

- Choose a 5-element subset of 15 pairs (the image set) (there are C(15,5) = 3003 subsets),
- assign each pair to a distinct input in 5! ways (120),
- total ways = 3003*120 ~360k functions, too many to print.

Alternatively, for efficiency, just enumerate the 5 subsets (combinations) of pairs not containing \{i\} for the corresponding i.

However, the problem states the extra condition about "card {i | f i = x} = 2" which does not hold for an injective function.

Thus, the "card" condition probably means: for the function's codomain Sym2(Fin 5), the set \( \{f i | i \in Fin 5\} \) is a set of 5 distinct pairs such that every image of f appears in the "preimage" twice — i.e. the function is two-to-one and domain is size 10, says "card {i | f i = x} = 2" (image size 5, domain size 10).

Therefore, the problem as stated probably has Fin 10 in the domain.

Given that, I'll proceed with a Python enumeration for domain=10 elements {0..9}, codomain Sym2(Fin 5) (size 15 pairs). We want functions f: domain→Sym2(Fin 5), with:

- For all i, f(i) ≠ diag i (but i goes up to 9 but pairs are from Fin 5, so no diagonal in this sense? Probably the diagonal means for i in domain, the pair f(i) should not be {i}. But i>4? So i from 0..9? Maybe the domain is doubled.

Alternatively, let's interpret the domain as 10 elements, codomain as 15 pairs, so that we want to find sets of 5 pairs each used twice (because each pair must appear exactly twice as image), and the inputs map to the pairs in a 2-to-1 way.

We also require for each i in domain, \( f(i) \neq \operatorname{diag} i \), which means each i is an element of Fin 10, but the codomain has only elements from Fin 5.

Probably, the diagonal is defined on the codomain side, so \( f(i) \neq \{i\} \) is interpreted as forbidding forbidden pairs for that input i? The problem is unclear.

Therefore, I'll generate all 2-element subsets (pairs) of \{0..4\}, no loops as diagonals.

Then we must find 5 distinct pairs that partition the inputs into pairs of size 2.

But the input size is 10, and the image size is 5. So we may try all possible partitions of domain {0..9} into 5 pairs, and assign each pair in domain to a unique 2-subset of codomain {0..4}.

Further, we want that for each i in domain, f(i) ≠ diag_i, where diag_i means the diagonal pair of i, but since i ∈{0..9} and pairs use {0..4}, seems there's a mismatch.

Given the complexity and ambiguity, we can write a Python program enumerating all 5-element subsets of the 15 pairs, generating all 2-to-1 functions from a set of size 10 onto that set of 5 images.

For efficiency, we won't try all functions but just partition 10 inputs into 5 pairs and map each input pair to one codomain pair.

For each input pair (a,b), check that neither f(a) nor f(b) equals diag(a) or diag(b), interpreted as input points forbidden from mapping to the diagonal pair containing themselves. Since input domain is 10 elements 0..9, and codomain pairs are pairs from 0..4, the domain elements are outside the codomain element range. So "diag i" for i in domain may not make sense.

Hence we may ignore the diagonal condition for now or only require that f(i) ≠ {k,k} for any k (which are not in the codomain, since only off-diagonal pairs exist).

Therefore, putting all together:

- Domain: {0..9}
- Codomain: 15 unordered 2-subsets of {0..4}
- We enumerate:

   - All 5-element subsets S of codomain.
   - For each such S:

      - Enumerate all partitions of domain {0..9} into pairs: For each pairing, assign pairs (two domain inputs) to distinct codomain elements in the subset S.

      - For each domain element i in a pair mapped to pair p: if desired, verify f(i) ≠ diag i, but probably impossible since i > 4.

We print candidates where conditions hold.

Finally, print the total count.

Given that, I'll write an efficient enumeration of these functions treating domain as 10 elements and codomain pairs as 15 possible pairs; for each 5-element subset of codomain, enumerate pairings of 10 inputs into 5 pairs, then assign these pairs to codomain pairs.

I will do a partial enumeration with small sample values to keep the output within token limits.

Note: The problem is nontrivial; we focus on enumerating candidate objects and printing them.
