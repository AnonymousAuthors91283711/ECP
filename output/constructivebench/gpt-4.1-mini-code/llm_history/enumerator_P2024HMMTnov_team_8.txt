The problem involves solving for real numbers \( x < 3 \) satisfying
\[
\sqrt{(3 - x)(4 - x)} + \sqrt{(4 - x)(6 - x)} + \sqrt{(6 - x)(3 - x)} = x.
\]

Because the domain requires \( x < 3 \), all the factors inside the square roots are positive or zero there. We want to find all such \( x \).

I'll write a Python enumerator that samples \( x \) values less than 3, starting from just below 3 down to a reasonable lower bound (say -10), with a small step (e.g., 0.01). For each \( x \), check if the equation holds approximately within some tolerance (since exact evaluation might be complicated), but I will print exact values for \( x \) where the LHS and RHS are very close. This will help conjecture the answer.

```python
import math

def f(x):
    # Compute the sum of the three square roots
    try:
        s1 = math.sqrt((3 - x)*(4 - x))
        s2 = math.sqrt((4 - x)*(6 - x))
        s3 = math.sqrt((6 - x)*(3 - x))
        return s1 + s2 + s3
    except ValueError:
        return None

def main():
    candidates = []
    print("Enumerating x < 3 to solve sqrt((3-x)(4-x)) + sqrt((4-x)(6-x)) + sqrt((6 - x)(3 - x)) = x")
    step = 0.001
    x = 2.999
    while x > -10:
        val = f(x)
        if val is not None:
            diff = val - x
            if abs(diff) < 1e-5:
                print(f"x = {x:.6f}, LHS = {val:.6f}, RHS = {x:.6f}, diff = {diff:.6e}")
                candidates.append(x)
        x -= step

    if candidates:
        min_candidate = min(candidates)
        max_candidate = max(candidates)
        print(f"Number of candidates found: {len(candidates)}")
        print(f"Minimal solution approx: {min_candidate}")
        print(f"Maximal solution approx: {max_candidate}")
    else:
        print("No candidates found.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
