Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {x : ℤ | x ^ 2 < 3}
<<<None>>>
Since the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's intentionally left undefined in Lean), we cannot compare it with the proposed answer. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the proposed answer is correct, partially correct, or incorrect. The equivalence is undecidable in this case.
