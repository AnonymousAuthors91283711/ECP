The problem likely concerns characterizing all positive integers \( a \) such that the function \( f(x) = \text{xor}(x, a \times x) \) is injective over \(\mathbb{N}\). To explore this, I will enumerate over small \( a \) and test if \( f \) is injective for \( x \) in a small range. We print each \( a \) tested and whether it appears to keep \( f \) injective for that range.

```python
# Enumerate candidate 'a' values and check injectivity of f(x) = xor(x, a*x) over x in [0..N)

N = 20  # domain upper bound for x to test injectivity approximately

def test_injective(a, N):
    seen = set()
    for x in range(N):
        val = x ^ (a * x)
        if val in seen:
            return False
        seen.add(val)
    return True

print("Testing a in [1..30] for injectivity of f(x) = xor(x, a*x) on x in [0..20)")
candidates = []
for a in range(1, 31):
    if test_injective(a, N):
        candidates.append(a)
        print(f"a={a}: injective on {N} values")

# Print candidates collectively as a conjectured set
print("\nConjectured omnimath104_answer (within tested range):")
print("{" + ", ".join(map(str, candidates)) + "}")
```
