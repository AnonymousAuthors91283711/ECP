The problem is about finding natural numbers \(A, B\) with \(B = A+1\) such that 
\[B^2 + 2B + 3 = A^2 + 2A + 3.\]
We want to find the least sum \(s = A + B\) for which this equality holds.

Rewrite the equation without the constant terms:
\[B^2 + 2B = A^2 + 2A.\]

Substitute \(B = A + 1\):
\[(A+1)^2 + 2(A+1) = A^2 + 2A.\]

Expand and simplify:
\[A^2 + 2A + 1 + 2A + 2 = A^2 + 2A.\]
\[A^2 + 4A + 3 = A^2 + 2A\]
\[4A + 3 = 2A\]
\[2A = -3\]

No natural number solution here, so no solutions for \(m=1\).

However, this is just for the original problem statement posted.

To explore similar cases, let’s generalize with a parameter \(m\), \(B = A + m\), and look for pairs where
\[B^2 + 2B + 3 = A^2 + 2A + 3.\]

We can enumerate small values of \(A, B\) increasing and record all sums \(A+B\) where the equality holds, printing them when found.

```python
# Enumerate solutions (A,B) with B = A+1 such that B^2 + 2B + 3 = A^2 + 2A + 3
# The problem reduces to checking the equality for pairs with B = A+1.
# Print any solutions found along with their sum A+B.

def main():
    # We know no solutions for B=A+1 from algebra, but let’s check up to some bound to explore.
    max_A = 1000
    solutions = []
    for A in range(1, max_A+1):
        B = A + 1
        lhs = B**2 + 2*B + 3
        rhs = A**2 + 2*A + 3
        if lhs == rhs:
            s = A + B
            print(f"Found solution: A={A}, B={B}, sum={s}")
            solutions.append(s)
    if solutions:
        print(f"Minimum sum found: {min(solutions)}")
    else:
        print("No solutions found for B = A + 1 with A ≤ 1000.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
