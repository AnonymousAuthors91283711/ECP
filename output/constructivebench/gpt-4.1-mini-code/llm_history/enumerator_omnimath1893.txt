The problem involves positive real numbers \(a, b, c, n\) with conditions on their ratios. We have:
\[
\frac{a+b}{a} = 3, \quad \frac{b+c}{b} = 4, \quad \frac{c+a}{c} = n
\]
We want to enumerate possible values of \(n\).

From the first two equations:
\[
\frac{a+b}{a} = 3 \implies \frac{b}{a} = 2
\]
\[
\frac{b+c}{b} = 4 \implies \frac{c}{b} = 3
\]
Using \(b = 2a\), \(c = 3b = 6a\).

Then,
\[
n = \frac{c + a}{c} = \frac{6a + a}{6a} = \frac{7}{6}
\]

We will confirm this by enumerating possible positive integers and printing the computed \(n\).

```python
# Enumerate plausible values for a, b, c under given ratio constraints and print n
# We only need small integers since the ratios are fixed: b=2a, c=3b=6a, so n=7/6 fixed
def enumerate_n():
    from fractions import Fraction
    # a > 0 integer samples
    for a in range(1, 6):
        b = 2 * a
        c = 3 * b
        n = Fraction(c + a, c)  # exact value as fraction
        print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, n={n} (approx {float(n):.6f})")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    enumerate_n()
```
This confirms \(n = \frac{7}{6}\) for all positive a,b,c satisfying the ratios.
