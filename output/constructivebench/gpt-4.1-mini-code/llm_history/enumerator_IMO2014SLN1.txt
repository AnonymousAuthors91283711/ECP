[write_program]
The problem seems related to IMO 2014 Shortlist N1, involving sums of terms 2^n - 2^k over subsets s of {0, ..., n-1}. The goal is to find the greatest m not representable as such a sum. I will write a Python program that for small values of n (e.g., 2 to 6) enumerates all sums formed by subsets of {0,...,n-1} of the form sum_{k in s} (2^n - 2^k), prints all unreachable m from 0 up to a small max, then gives the greatest unreachable found. This helps conjecture the pattern for the answer.

```python
# Enumerate unreachable sums m from subsets s of {0,...,n-1} with:
# m = sum_{k in s} (2^n - 2^k)
# For small n, find all such sums, then find greatest m <= threshold not representable.

def powerset(iterable):
    # Returns all subsets of the iterable as lists
    lst = list(iterable)
    n = len(lst)
    for i in range(1 << n):
        yield [lst[j] for j in range(n) if (i & (1 << j))]

def main():
    # We test for n = 2..6
    for n in range(2, 7):
        vals = [2**n - 2**k for k in range(n)]
        sums = set()
        # Add sums of all subsets s (including empty set)
        for s in powerset(range(n)):
            total = sum(vals[k] for k in s)
            sums.add(total)
        max_val = max(vals)*n  # crude upper bound, could be bigger
        print(f"n = {n}")
        # Find unreachable m in 0..max_val
        unreachable = []
        for m in range(max_val+1):
            if m not in sums:
                print(f"Unreachable m = {m}")
                unreachable.append(m)
        if unreachable:
            greatest = max(unreachable)
            print(f"Greatest unreachable m for n={n} is {greatest}")
        else:
            print(f"No unreachable m found up to {max_val}")
        print("-"*20)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
