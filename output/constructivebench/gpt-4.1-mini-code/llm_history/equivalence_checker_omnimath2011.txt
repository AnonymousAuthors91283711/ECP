Ground Truth Answer: 2^35
Proposed Answer: 2^(20 + 16 - 1)
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about counting the number of possible configurations of a 20×16 grid of booleans where each configuration can be obtained by flipping rows and columns (with row_flips and col_flips operations).

2. The ground truth answer is 2^35.

3. The proposed answer is 2^(20 + 16 - 1) = 2^35.

The two expressions are mathematically equivalent since 20 + 16 - 1 = 35. The proposed answer correctly accounts for:
- 20 possible row flips
- 16 possible column flips
- Minus 1 because flipping all rows and all columns gives the same configuration (so one degree of freedom is redundant)
