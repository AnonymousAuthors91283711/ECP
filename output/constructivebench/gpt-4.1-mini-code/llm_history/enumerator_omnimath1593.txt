The problem involves sequences \(a_i, b_i, c_i\) with indices modulo 2019 and 2018, with constraints linking them:
- Each \(a_i < 2^{2018}\),
- For each \(i\), \(b_{i+1} = a_i + a_{i+1}\),
- \(c_{i+1} = a_i \text{ OR } a_{i+1}\) bitwise.

Our task is presumably to count the number of possible \((b, c)\) pairs arising from some \(a\). The problem is large but resembles a combinatorial or bitwise constraint counting problem on a cycle.

To guess the answer, we can test smaller cycles \(n\) and max values \(M\), enumerate all sequences \(a\) and generate \((b,c)\), then count distinct \((b,c)\) pairs. Because fully enumerating \(2^{2018 \times 2019}\) states is impossible, we take small parameters (like \(n=3\), max bits 2 or 3) to detect patterns.

The program:
- Fix small \(n\) (e.g. 3,4) and max bit length of \(a_i\) (e.g. 2 bits = numbers < 4).
- Enumerate all sequences \(a\) of length \(n\),
- For each, compute \(b_i, c_i\) for \(i \in [0..n-2]\),
- Store the unique pairs \((b,c)\),
- Print the number of such pairs.

This may help conjecture a formula or behavior related to the original problem.

```python
# Enumerate possible (b,c) pairs induced by sequences a of length n with entries < max_val.
# Parameters chosen small for tractability.

def main():
    import itertools

    # Sample parameters for testing
    samples = [
        (3, 4),  # n=3, max_val=4 (a_i in [0..3])
        (4, 4),  # n=4, max_val=4
        (3, 8),  # n=3, max_val=8
    ]

    for n, max_val in samples:
        print(f"Parameters: n={n}, max_val={max_val}")

        # We'll build b and c of length n-1 per problem statement
        # b[i] = a[i] + a[i+1]
        # c[i] = a[i] | a[i+1]

        seen = set()
        # Enumerate all sequences a of length n with elements in [0,max_val)
        for a in itertools.product(range(max_val), repeat=n):
            b = tuple(a[i] + a[i+1] for i in range(n-1))
            c = tuple(a[i] | a[i+1] for i in range(n-1))
            pair = (b, c)
            if pair not in seen:
                seen.add(pair)
                print(f"a={a} -> b={b}, c={c}")

        print(f"Total distinct (b,c) pairs for n={n}, max_val={max_val}: {len(seen)}\n")
