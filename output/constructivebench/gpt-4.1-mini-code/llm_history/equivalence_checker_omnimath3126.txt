Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: 14
To determine if the proposed answer is correct, let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. **Given Equation**:  
   The problem states that for all real numbers \( x \), the equation \((x + a)(x + 8) = x^2 + b x + 24\) holds.

2. **Expand the Left Side**:  
   Expanding \((x + a)(x + 8)\) gives:  
   \(x^2 + (a + 8)x + 8a\).

3. **Compare Coefficients**:  
   The expanded form must match the right-hand side \(x^2 + b x + 24\) for all \(x\). Therefore, we can equate the coefficients of corresponding terms:  
   - Coefficient of \(x^2\): \(1 = 1\) (trivially true).  
   - Coefficient of \(x\): \(a + 8 = b\).  
   - Constant term: \(8a = 24\).

4. **Solve for \(a\) and \(b\)**:  
   From \(8a = 24\), we get \(a = 3\).  
   Substituting \(a = 3\) into \(a + 8 = b\) gives \(b = 11\).

5. **Compute \(a + b\)**:  
   \(a + b = 3 + 11 = 14\).

The proposed answer is \(14\), which matches our calculation. Therefore, the proposed answer is correct.
