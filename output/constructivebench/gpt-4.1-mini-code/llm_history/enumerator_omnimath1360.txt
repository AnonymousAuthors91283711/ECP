The problem asks to characterize the set of real numbers \( r = \frac{d}{a} \) where \( a, d \in \mathbb{R} \), \( a \neq 0 \), and satisfy the quadratic relation:
\[ a^2 - 6 a d + 8 d^2 = 0. \]

Rearranging the equation, dividing by \( a^2 \) (since \( a \neq 0 \)):
\[ 1 - 6 \frac{d}{a} + 8 \left(\frac{d}{a}\right)^2 = 0. \]

Set \( r = \frac{d}{a} \), then:
\[ 8r^2 - 6r + 1 = 0. \]

This is a quadratic equation in \( r \). Let's find its roots exactly:
\[ r = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 32}}{16} = \frac{6 \pm 2}{16}. \]

So the solutions for \( r \) are:
\[ r = \frac{8}{16} = \frac{1}{2}, \quad r = \frac{4}{16} = \frac{1}{4}. \]

The Python program below enumerates this set by solving the quadratic equation symbolically and printing the exact roots.

```python
import math
from fractions import Fraction

# Coefficients of the quadratic 8r^2 -6r +1 = 0
a_coef, b_coef, c_coef = 8, -6, 1

# Compute discriminant
discriminant = b_coef**2 - 4 * a_coef * c_coef
print(f"Discriminant: {discriminant}")

if discriminant < 0:
    print("No real roots, set is empty.")
else:
    sqrt_discriminant = math.isqrt(discriminant) if int(math.sqrt(discriminant))**2 == discriminant else math.sqrt(discriminant)
    # Enumerate roots
    for sign in [1, -1]:
        numerator = -b_coef + sign * sqrt_discriminant
        denominator = 2 * a_coef
        # Try to express numerator/denominator as a fraction for exactness if possible
        # If discr is a perfect square:
        if isinstance(sqrt_discriminant, int):
            frac = Fraction(numerator, denominator)
            print(f"Exact root: {frac} = {float(frac)}")
        else:
            # Approximate root
            val = numerator / denominator
            print(f"Approximate root: {val}")
```
This outputs the two possible \( r \) values exactly as fractions: 1/2 and 1/4, matching the set we want to characterize.
