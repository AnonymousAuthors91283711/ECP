Ground Truth Answer: 1 / 14
Proposed Answer: (118098 : ℚ) / 75420
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the ratio of the sum of odd divisors to the sum of even divisors of N = 34 × 34 × 63 × 270.

2. First, let's factorize N:
   - 34 = 2 × 17
   - 63 = 7 × 9
   - 270 = 2 × 3³ × 5
   - So N = 2² × 17² × 3³ × 5 × 7 × 3² = 2² × 3⁵ × 5 × 7 × 17²

3. For the sum of odd divisors, we ignore the 2² factor:
   - Sum of odd divisors = σ(3⁵ × 5 × 7 × 17²)
   - = σ(3⁵) × σ(5) × σ(7) × σ(17²)
   - = (1+3+9+27+81+243) × (1+5) × (1+7) × (1+17+289)
   - = 364 × 6 × 8 × 307

4. For the sum of even divisors, it's total sum minus odd sum:
   - Total sum = σ(2²) × σ(odd part) = (1+2+4) × 364 × 6 × 8 × 307
   - = 7 × 364 × 6 × 8 × 307
   - Even sum = Total - Odd = (7-1) × 364 × 6 × 8 × 307 = 6 × 364 × 6 × 8 × 307

5. The ratio would be:
   - Odd/Even = (364 × 6 × 8 × 307)/(6 × 364 × 6 × 8 × 307) = 1/6

Wait, this contradicts both answers. Let me re-examine:

Looking at the proposed answer 118098/75420:
- 118098 = 2 × 3¹⁰
- 75420 = 2² × 3² × 5 × 419
- Simplified form is 19683/12570, not matching 1/14

The ground truth answer is 1/14, which doesn't match my calculation either. However, my calculation might be incorrect in considering the even divisors.

Given that both the proposed answer and my calculation don't match the ground truth, and the proposed answer doesn't simplify to 1/14, I conclude:

<<<False>>>
