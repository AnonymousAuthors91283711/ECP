The problem involves three positive real numbers \(x, y, z\) satisfying a system of logarithmic equations with bases 4 and 8, and relates to the product \(x y z\) being a power of 2 with an exponent \(k\). The goal is to explore the structure of this system and enumerate possible \(x, y, z\) and corresponding \(k\).

We will:
- Use base conversion for logarithms to express in terms of \(\log_2\).
- Check consistency and possible values for \(x, y, z\) assuming simple integer powers of 2.
- Enumerate possible integer values for \(\log_2(x), \log_2(y), \log_2(z)\) within a small range, then compute each side to verify the equations.
- Print all triples \((x, y, z)\) and the corresponding \(k = \log_2(x y z)\) that satisfy the system within a small tolerance.

```python
# Enumerate possible (x,y,z) with x,y,z = 2^a, 2^b, 2^c for integers a,b,c in [-3..8]
# Check the three equations involving logarithms base 4 and 8
# log_4 x + log_8 (y z) = 2
# log_4 y + log_8 (x z) = 4
# log_4 z + log_8 (x y) = 5
# Using: log_4 t = log_2 t / 2, log_8 t = log_2 t / 3
# So
# (a/2) + ((b+c)/3) = 2
# (b/2) + ((a+c)/3) = 4
# (c/2) + ((a+b)/3) = 5

    return abs(x - y) < eps
