The problem is to find the least natural number \( n \) such that 
\[
\sqrt{n + 99} - \sqrt{n} < 1.
\]
Rearranging and considering domain constraints, we want to find the smallest \( n \in \mathbb{N} \) satisfying the inequality. We will enumerate \( n \) starting from 0, compute the exact difference \(\sqrt{n+99} - \sqrt{n}\), and print values where the difference is less than 1, then output the minimum such \( n \).

```python
import math

def main():
    limit = 200  # search range
    candidates = []
    for n in range(limit):
        diff = math.sqrt(n + 99) - math.sqrt(n)
        if diff < 1:
            print(f"n={n}, diff={diff}")
            candidates.append(n)
    if candidates:
        print("\nMinimum n with sqrt(n+99) - sqrt(n) < 1 is:", min(candidates))
    else:
        print("No such n found in range")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
