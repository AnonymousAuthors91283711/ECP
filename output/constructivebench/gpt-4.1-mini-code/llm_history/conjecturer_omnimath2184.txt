n=2012 count = unknown (too large to compute here). Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The pattern suggests the count is n^(n-1) for the set of functions x from Fin n to [0..n-1] with sum of (i+1)*x_i divisible by n. For n=2,3,4,5, counts 2,9,64,625 match 2^(2-1), 3^(3-1), 4^(4-1), 5^(5-1) respectively. So:

<<<2012 ^ (2012 - 1)>>>
