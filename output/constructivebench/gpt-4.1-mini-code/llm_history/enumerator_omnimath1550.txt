The problem is to enumerate the natural numbers \( n \) for which there exists \( m \) such that \( m^2 = n \) and \( m^2 \) divides \( 2^3 \cdot 3^5 \cdot 5^7 \cdot 7^9 \). Essentially, we want to count the perfect squares dividing \( 2^3 \cdot 3^5 \cdot 5^7 \cdot 7^9 \).

A perfect square divisor corresponds to choosing exponents for the primes that are even and at most the exponent in the factorization of the number.

We can iterate over possible even exponents (0 or 2 sometimes 4 etc.) up to the prime exponents in the factorization of the number, and count the combinations.

```python
# Enumerate perfect square divisors of 2^3 * 3^5 * 5^7 * 7^9
# For each prime factor p^e, the exponent in a perfect square divisor must be an even integer <= e

def enumerate_perfect_square_divisors():
    primes_exponents = [(2, 3), (3, 5), (5, 7), (7, 9)]
    exps_lists = []

    # Generate all even exponents up to the given max exponent for each prime
    for p, e in primes_exponents:
        # possible exponents are even numbers <= e
        even_exps = [x for x in range(0, e+1) if x % 2 == 0]
        exps_lists.append(even_exps)

    count = 0
    # Iterate over all combinations of exponents
    for e2 in exps_lists[0]:
        for e3 in exps_lists[1]:
            for e5 in exps_lists[2]:
                for e7 in exps_lists[3]:
                    count += 1
                    # Compute the divisor corresponding to exponents
                    divisor = (2 ** e2) * (3 ** e3) * (5 ** e5) * (7 ** e7)
                    print(divisor)
    print("Count of perfect square divisors:", count)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    enumerate_perfect_square_divisors()
```
