The problem asks for the fraction of permutations on 7 elements with exactly 6 fixed points. We want to enumerate permutations on 7 elements, count how many have exactly 6 fixed points, and print that ratio.

```python
import math
from itertools import permutations

n = 7
all_perms = permutations(range(n))
total = math.factorial(n)
count_6_fixed = 0

for p in all_perms:
    fixed_points = sum(1 for i in range(n) if p[i] == i)
    if fixed_points == 6:
        count_6_fixed += 1
        print(f"Permutation with 6 fixed points: {p}")

print(f"Total permutations: {total}")
print(f"Number with exactly 6 fixed points: {count_6_fixed}")
print(f"Fraction = {count_6_fixed}/{total} = {count_6_fixed/total}")
```
