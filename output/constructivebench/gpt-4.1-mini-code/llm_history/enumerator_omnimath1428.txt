The problem is to find all real numbers \(x\) such that:

\[
x^4 + (2 - x)^4 = 34.
\]

We want to enumerate all real \(x\) satisfying this equation, preferably producing exact solutions if possible or good numeric approximations. Since this quartic in \(x\) is symmetric around \(x=1\) and the values involved are not trivial, we'll try scanning rational candidates with small denominators, plus numeric root finding via Python.

We'll output solutions as found, use exact fractions when possible and approximate decimals with reasonable precision otherwise.

```python
from fractions import Fraction
from math import isclose

def f(x):
    return x**4 + (2 - x)**4

def approx_eq(a, b, tol=1e-10):
    return abs(a - b) < tol

def rational_candidates(numer_max=10, denom_max=10):
    seen = set()
    for denom in range(1, denom_max + 1):
        for numer in range(-numer_max, numer_max + 1):
            frac = Fraction(numer, denom)
            if frac in seen:
                continue
            seen.add(frac)
            yield frac

# Check rational candidates first
print("Checking rational candidates for solutions to x^4 + (2 - x)^4 = 34:")
for x in rational_candidates():
    val = f(float(x))
    if approx_eq(val, 34):
        print(f"x = {x} (exact fraction) => {val}")

# Since no obvious rationals satisfy, approximate with numeric methods
# We'll scan float values from -2 to 4 stepping 0.01 and print roots with f(x) close to 34

print("\nApproximate real solutions found by scanning from -2 to 4 with step 0.01:")
last_printed = None
x = -2.0
step = 0.01
while x <= 4.0:
    val = f(x)
    if abs(val - 34) < 0.01:
        # Avoid printing too many close points (only print if sufficiently spaced)
        if last_printed is None or abs(x - last_printed) > 0.1:
            print(f"x ≈ {x:.4f}, x^4+(2-x)^4 ≈ {val:.5f}")
            last_printed = x
    x += step
```
