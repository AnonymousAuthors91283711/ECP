Ground Truth Answer: fun x y => (sin (2 * x) / sin (2 * y)) + (cos (2 * x) / cos (2 * y))
Proposed Answer: fun x y => (sin x * cos y) / (sin y * cos x)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives two trigonometric ratios (sin x/sin y = 3 and cos x/cos y = 1/2) and asks for some expression involving x and y that simplifies to a rational number p/q where p+q=107.

2. The ground truth answer combines double-angle terms: sin(2x)/sin(2y) + cos(2x)/cos(2y)

3. The proposed answer gives (sin x cos y)/(sin y cos x), which can be simplified to (sin x/sin y)*(cos y/cos x) = 3 * (1/(1/2)) = 6

The proposed answer is a much simpler expression that evaluates to a constant (6), while the ground truth answer is a more complex expression that evaluates to 101/6 (since 101 + 6 = 107). These are clearly different answers to the problem.
