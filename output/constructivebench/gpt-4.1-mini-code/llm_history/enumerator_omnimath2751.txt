The problem counts the number of integer pairs \( (a,b) \) with \( 4 < a < b < 22 \) such that \(\frac{4 + a + b + 22}{4} = 13\). Simplifying, this constraint reduces to \(a + b = 26\). We need to enumerate all pairs \((a,b)\) with integer \(a,b\) satisfying \(4 < a < b < 22\) and \(a + b = 26\).

The program enumerates valid pairs \((a,b)\) and prints them immediately before printing the total count of such pairs.

```python
# Enumerate integer pairs (a,b) with 4 < a < b < 22 and a + b = 26
def main():
    count = 0
    total = 26
    print("Enumerating pairs (a,b) with 4 < a < b < 22 and a + b = 26:")
    for a in range(5, 22):
        b = total - a
        if a < b < 22:
            print(f"Pair found: a={a}, b={b}")
            count += 1
    print(f"Total number of such pairs: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
