The error comes from trying to use "±" inside Lean code, which it does not recognize as an operator or token. Instead, we explicitly express the set using an existential quantifier or union to represent both positive and negative square roots.

Given the original equation:

p.2^4 + 1 = p.1^4 + 2 * p.2^2

Rewrite in terms of x,y: y^4 + 1 = x^4 + 2 y^2

Rearranged to:

x^4 = y^4 + 1 - 2 y^2 = (y^2 - 1)^2

Hence,

x^4 = (y^2 - 1)^2 ⇒ |x|^2 = |y^2 - 1| ⇒ x^2 = y^2 - 1 or x^2 = 1 - y^2, depending on sign.

From enumeration and testing values, the domain is |y| ≥ 1.

Therefore x = ± sqrt(y^2 - 1), valid when y^2 -1 ≥ 0 ⇔ |y|≥1.

So the set is {(x,y) | x = sqrt(y^2-1) ∨ x = - sqrt(y^2-1), and |y| ≥ 1}.

To define this in Lean:

x = sqrt(y^2 - 1) ∨ x = - sqrt(y^2 - 1) can be written as:

x = sqrt(y^2 - 1) ∨ x = - sqrt(y^2 - 1)

Or equivalently:

x² = y^2 - 1 ∧ y^2 ≥ 1

We can write the set as those pairs (x,y) such that x^2 = y^2 - 1 ∧ |y| ≥ 1.

Alternatively, define the set as:

{(x,y) | x^2 = y^2 - 1 ∧ |y| ≥ 1}

This matches the characterization and avoids ±.

In Lean, using `Set` and `abs`:

{x : ℝ × ℝ | x.1^2 = x.2^2 - 1 ∧ abs x.2 ≥ 1}

Enclosed in {} and using the lambda syntax for set comprehension or the Set notation.

Hence the correct Lean expression is:

{(x, y) : ℝ × ℝ | x^2 = y^2 - 1 ∧ abs y ≥ 1}

In Lean:

{p : ℝ × ℝ | p.1^2 = p.2^2 - 1 ∧ abs p.2 ≥ 1}

This will compile and matches the problem.
