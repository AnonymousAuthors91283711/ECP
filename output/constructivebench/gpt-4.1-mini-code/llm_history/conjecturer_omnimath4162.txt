The problem is about characterizing quadruples (a, b, n, p) with p prime, where 2^a + p^b = n^(p-1). From the enumerations and error, it appears that for p=2, the equation becomes:

2^a + 2^b = n^(1), i.e., n = 2^a + 2^b.

For p > 2, since p is prime and p-1 ≥ 2, n^(p-1) grows too fast compared to sums of prime powers. Also from enumerations, no solutions seem to appear for p > 2.

Hence the solution set is:

- For p=2, all (a, b, n, 2) with n = 2^a + 2^b,
- For p > 2, no solutions at all.

To express this as a set in Lean, the previous expression had a syntax error because it tried to define a set as a set comprehension with an equation (n = ...), but set comprehensions require a predicate returning Prop (a boolean condition). We must define the set properly using set.filter or ` {(a,b,n,p) | p = 2 ∧ n = 2^a + 2^b }`.

Also, to be a set on ℕ × ℕ × ℕ × ℕ, we must express it as a subset of that space by a predicate returning Prop.

Hence the corrected Lean expression is:

```
{(a, b, n, p) : ℕ × ℕ × ℕ × ℕ | p = 2 ∧ n = 2^a + 2^b}
```

This will fix the error and matches the enumerated solutions, stating explicitly the solutions only occur for p=2 with n = 2^a + 2^b.
