The problem asks to solve for real numbers \( x \) with \(-\frac{\pi}{2} < x < \frac{\pi}{2}\) such that:

\[
1 - \sin^4 x - \cos^2 x = \frac{1}{16}
\]

We want to enumerate possible solutions \( x \). Since the equation involves \( \sin^4 x \) and \( \cos^2 x \), it is nontrivial to isolate \( x \) exactly. 

To enumerate answers, I will:
- Iterate over \( x \) values in the interval with a reasonable step, 
- Check the equation for near equality,
- Print numeric approximations of \( x \) where the equation holds closely,
- Also attempt exact candidate checks for notable angles like 0, \(\pm \frac{\pi}{6}\), \(\pm \frac{\pi}{4}\), \(\pm \frac{\pi}{3}\), \(\pm \frac{\pi}{2}\) to identify any exact roots.

This approach prints approximate solutions found and can inspire conjectures for an exact closed-form answer or symbolic manipulations.

```python
import math

# The function to check the equation
def f(x):
    return 1 - math.sin(x)**4 - math.cos(x)**2

# The target value to match
target = 1/16

# Tolerance for floating-point equality
tol = 1e-6

print("Exact notable angle checks and corresponding f(x) values:")

notable_angles = [0, math.pi/6, math.pi/4, math.pi/3, math.pi/2]
# Include negative angles in domain (-pi/2, pi/2)
for angle in notable_angles:
    for x in (-angle, angle):
        if -math.pi/2 < x < math.pi/2:
            val = f(x)
            print(f"x = {x:.6f}, f(x) = {val:.8f}, diff = {val - target:.8f}")

print("\nEnumerating approximate solutions in (-pi/2, pi/2):")

step = 0.001
x = -math.pi/2 + step
while x < math.pi/2:
    val = f(x)
    if abs(val - target) < tol:
        print(f"Approximate solution: x = {x:.6f}, f(x) = {val:.8f}")
    x += step
```
