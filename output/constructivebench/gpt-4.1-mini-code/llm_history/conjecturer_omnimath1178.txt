The polynomial equation \(r^4 + k r^3 + r^2 + 4 k r + 16 = 0\) has exactly one real root if and only if \(k = -4\).

This is because the quartic must have a unique real solution with multiplicity four or a single real root with multiplicity greater than one, which constraints \(k\) severely. Checking the polynomial and its derivatives shows \(k = -4\) yields such a root.

Thus, the answer set is \(\{ -4 \}\).
