This problem revolves around a real interval [L, P] and points M, N inside it, with conditions about equal subinterval lengths. To explore the problem, I will enumerate rational points M and N on an interval [L, P] subdivided into thirds, checking the equal spacing conditions. We expect M and N to partition the segment into three equal parts.

The program enumerates sample segments [L, P] using small integers and rational candidates for M and N, prints candidates that satisfy the conditions to help conjecture the explicit formula for M.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# We'll try sample intervals [L, P] with integer endpoints and enumerate candidate M, N as fractions between L and P
def check(L, P):
    print(f"L={L}, P={P}")
    interval = P - L
    # Enumerate M as L + k/12 * interval for k=1..11 to get some rational subdivisions
    for k in range(1, 12):
        M = L + Fraction(k, 12)*interval
        # According to problem: M = L + (1/3)*(P - L), N = L + (2/3)*(P - L)
        # So N must be equidistant from M and P
        # Check for N satisfying M-L = N-M = P-N
        # Then N = (M + P)/2 and M - L = N - M = P - N requires these distances equal
        # So 3*(M - L) = P - L
        if 3*(M - L) == interval:
            N = L + 2*Fraction(k,12)*interval
            # Check the equal differences
            d1 = M - L
            d2 = N - M
            d3 = P - N
            if d1 == d2 == d3:
                print(f"M={float(M):.6f} (exact {M}), N={float(N):.6f} (exact {N}), equal difference={float(d1):.6f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Try some examples
    sample_points = [(0, 3), (1, 4), (-2, 1), (0, 9)]
    for L,P in sample_points:
        check(L, P)
```
