The problem involves coloring edges between points on a triangular lattice with adjacency defined as in `triangularAdjacent`. We want to find the minimal number \( N \) of colors such that on any path between two non-adjacent vertices, there exist two edges of different colors.

To help conjecture the minimum \( N \), we'll enumerate small lattice segments (paths) within a grid of limited size and attempt assign colors to edges to check if the conditions can be met for small \( N \). We'll try \( N = 2, 3, 4 \) and print any found valid colorings or contradictions.

```python
# We enumerate edges in a small triangular lattice grid,
# verify the adjacency, and attempt to find a minimal edge-coloring
# number N satisfying the problem conditions by brute force.

from itertools import product, combinations

# Define triangular adjacency based on given logic
def triangular_adjacent(v1, v2):
    x1, y1 = v1
    x2, y2 = v2
    return ((x1 == x2 and abs(y1 - y2) == 1) or
            (y1 == y2 and abs(x1 - x2) == 1) or
            ((x1 + y1) == (x2 + y2) and abs(x1 - x2) == 1))

# Generate vertices in a small grid (0 <= x,y <= 3)
vertices = [(x, y) for x in range(4) for y in range(4)]
# Filter vertices to those fitting triangular lattice shape: x,y >=0 and within bounds
vertices = [v for v in vertices if 0 <= v[0] <= 3 and 0 <= v[1] <=3]

# Generate edges (undirected but store ordered for simplicity)
edges = []
for v1, v2 in combinations(vertices, 2):
    if triangular_adjacent(v1, v2):
        edges.append((v1, v2))

edge_index = {e: i for i, e in enumerate(edges)}

# Paths as sequences of vertices with chain property
def is_chain(p):
    return all(triangular_adjacent(p[i], p[i+1]) for i in range(len(p)-1))

# Generate short paths length 3 or 4 to check chain conditions
short_paths = []
for length in [3, 4]:
    for p in product(vertices, repeat=length):
        if len(set(p)) == length and is_chain(p):
            short_paths.append(p)

# We'll test coloring edges with N colors for N in 2..4
# For each coloring, verify conditions on edges and paths
# Due to complexity, just try naive assignments for edges

def edges_in_path(p):
    return [(p[i], p[i+1]) if (p[i], p[i+1]) in edge_index else (p[i+1], p[i]) for i in range(len(p)-1)]

from itertools import product as iterprod

# Enumerate coloring assignments with N colors
# For tractability, limit enumeration to few edges only

max_edges = 7  # Drop edges to first 7 for complexity
test_edges = edges[:max_edges]
ei_map = {e:i for i,e in enumerate(test_edges)}

# Filter short paths that use only test_edges
def path_uses_edges(p):
    e_in_path = edges_in_path(p)
    return all(e in ei_map for e in e_in_path)

path_candidates = [p for p in short_paths if path_uses_edges(p)]

print("Testing small lattice with", len(test_edges), "edges and", len(path_candidates), "paths")

for N in range(2,5):
    print(f"Trying coloring with N={N} colors")
    assignments_tried = 0
    from itertools import product
    
    # Assign colors to edges
    # Edges not in test_edges are ignored
    for coloring in product(range(N), repeat=len(test_edges)):
        assignments_tried += 1
        # Condition 1: For every pair of adjacent vertices, color assigned (trivially true here)
        # Condition 2: For any non-adjacent v1,v2 connected by path p, there exist two edges colored differently on p
        
        all_paths_valid = True
        for p in path_candidates:
            v1, v2 = p[0], p[-1]
            if triangular_adjacent(v1, v2):
                continue  # condition applies only if not adjacent
            e_in_path = edges_in_path(p)
            colors_on_path = [coloring[ei_map[e]] for e in e_in_path]
            if len(set(colors_on_path)) == 1:
                # all edges same color -> fails condition
                all_paths_valid = False
                break
        if all_paths_valid:
            print("Found valid coloring for N =", N)
            print("Edge colors:")
            for e, c in zip(test_edges, coloring):
                print(f"  {e}: color {c}")
            break
    else:
        print(f"No valid coloring found for N = {N} after {assignments_tried} assignments")
```
This program prints attempts to find minimal coloring N, each candidate coloring, and stops when finding a valid coloring for small grids and paths. It helps conjecture the minimal \( N \) and observe that below some threshold no colorings meet conditions.
