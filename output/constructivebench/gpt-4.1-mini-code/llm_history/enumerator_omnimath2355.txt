The problem involves finding the maximum number \( k \) of vertices with degree at least 3 in a connected graph on \( n \) vertices where between any two vertices there exists a unique path. Such a structure is a tree (since unique paths between vertices imply no cycles) and the task involves enumerating values of \( k \) for small \( n \).

The program below:
- Interprets the problem as enumerating all trees on \( n \) vertices for \( 2 \le n \le 6 \).
- For each tree, counts vertices of degree at least 3.
- Prints all possible \( k \) found for each \( n \).
- Prints the maximum \( k \) found for each \( n \).

This enumeration supports conjecturing the form of `omnimath2355_answer n` and its maximality.

    adj = {i: set() for i in range(n)}
    for u,v in edges:
        adj[u].add(v)
        adj[v].add(u)
    return adj

    if len(edges) != n-1:

        visited.add(u)
        for w in adj[u]:
            if w not in visited:
                dfs(w)
    dfs(0)
    return len(visited) == n

def degree_count(adj):
    # count vertices with degree >= 3
    return sum(1 for v in adj if len(adj[v]) >=3)

    print(f"n = {n}")
    for edges in combinations(all_edges, n-1):
        if is_tree(n, edges):
            adj = edges_to_adjlist(n, edges)
            k = degree_count(adj)
            k_values.add(k)
            print(f"  found k = {k}")
            if k > max_k:
                max_k = k
    print(f"max k for n={n}: {max_k}\n")
