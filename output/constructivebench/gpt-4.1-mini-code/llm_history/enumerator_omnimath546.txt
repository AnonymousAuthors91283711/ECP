The problem involves characterizing all integers \(m\) such that \(k^2 = m^2 + 6m + 28\) for some integer \(k\). Rearranging,

\[
k^2 = m^2 + 6m + 28 = (m+3)^2 + 19.
\]

So \(k^2 - (m+3)^2 = 19\), which can be factored as \((k - (m+3))(k + (m+3)) = 19\). Since \(19\) is prime, the factors must be \(\pm 1\) and \(\pm 19\), giving a small set of possible equations. Our program will iterate over a range of \(m\) values and check if \(m^2 + 6m + 28\) is a perfect square, printing these \(m\).

```python
import math

# Enumerate integers m in a small range
for m in range(-50, 51):
    val = m*m + 6*m + 28
    if val < 0:
        continue
    k = int(math.isqrt(val))
    if k*k == val:
        print(f"m = {m}, k^2 = {val}")
```
