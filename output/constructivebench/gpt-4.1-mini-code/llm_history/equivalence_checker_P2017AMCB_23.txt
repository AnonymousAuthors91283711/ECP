Ground Truth Answer: 24/5
Proposed Answer: -11
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives a cubic polynomial f with known values at x=2,3,4 (4,9,16 respectively).
2. It also provides conditions about points D,E,F lying on secant lines and summing to 24.
3. The ground truth answer is 24/5 (4.8).
4. The proposed answer is -11.

The ground truth answer comes from solving the system of equations for a cubic polynomial that fits the given conditions. The proposed answer (-11) is significantly different from the correct value (4.8).

Since the proposed answer doesn't match the correct solution, and isn't even close numerically, we can conclude:

<<<False>>>
