Ground Truth Answer: fun n => n / 2 + 1
Proposed Answer: fun n => if n = 1 then 1 else 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the minimal size of a set S ⊆ {1,...,n} such that for any β > 0, if S can be represented as floor(βm) for some integers m, then all numbers in {1,...,n} can be represented this way.

2. The ground truth answer suggests the size is n/2 + 1 (integer division).

3. The proposed answer gives:
   - 1 when n=1
   - 2 otherwise

For n=1:
- Both answers give 1 (since 1/2+1=1)
- Correct

For n=2:
- Ground truth: 2/2+1=2
- Proposed: 2
- Correct

For n=3:
- Ground truth: 3/2+1=2 (integer division)
- Proposed: 2
- Correct

For n=4:
- Ground truth: 4/2+1=3
- Proposed: 2
- Incorrect (we need at least 3 numbers to guarantee the property)

The proposed answer is only correct for n ≤ 3, but incorrect for larger n. Therefore:

<<<False>>>
