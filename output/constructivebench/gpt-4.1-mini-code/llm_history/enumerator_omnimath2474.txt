The problem involves finding the smallest number \(n\) such that for every strictly monotone function on a set of size 512, there exists a subset \(L\) of size \(n\) with certain properties related to monotonicity and subsets inclusion conditions.

To assist in conjecturing the answer, we can:
- Enumerate small cases, for example smaller sets like size 3, 4, or 5, and strictly monotone functions on them.
- For each function, try to find subsets \(L\) of various sizes meeting the condition.
- Print candidates \(n\) based on these simulations.
- Since 512 is large, we focus on smaller sizes to infer a pattern.

The core challenge: For a strictly monotone function on set {0,...,k-1}, find minimal subset \(L\) of size \(n\), such that for each \(t\in L\), there exist \(t_1,t_2 \in Fin k\) with \(f(t_1) > f(t_2) > f(t)\), and any element \(s\) with \(f(s) > f(t)\) is in \(L\).

We'll test this for k in {3, 4, 5} with strictly increasing functions f (mapping each index to its index, which is strictly monotone), and try to find minimal \(n\).

The program enumerates subsets \(L\) for each candidate size \(n\), checking the specified condition, and outputs possible \(n\) values.

```python
# Enumerate small cases to conjecture minimal n for the problem.
# For each k (like 3,4,5), test strictly monotone functions (identity),
# find minimal n and print candidates.

    # find t1,t2 so that f[t1]>f[t2]>f[t], and
    # for all s with f[s]>f[t], s in L
    vals = [f(i) for i in range(k)]
    for t in L:
        ft = vals[t]
        # Condition: for all s with f[s]>ft => s in L
