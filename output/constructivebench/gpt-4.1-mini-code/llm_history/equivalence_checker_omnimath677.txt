Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (2^n - 2) / 3
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => (2^(n - 1) + ((-1 : ℚ))^(n - 1)) / 3
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

The ground truth answer is (2^n - 2)/3
The proposed answer is (2^(n-1) + (-1)^(n-1))/3

Let's test some values of n to see if they match:

For n=1:
Ground truth: (2-2)/3 = 0
Proposed: (1 + 1)/3 = 2/3 ≠ 0

For n=2:
Ground truth: (4-2)/3 = 2/3
Proposed: (2 + (-1))/3 = 1/3 ≠ 2/3

For n=3:
Ground truth: (8-2)/3 = 2
Proposed: (4 + 1)/3 = 5/3 ≈ 1.666... ≠ 2

The answers consistently give different results for small values of n, which means they cannot be equivalent.
