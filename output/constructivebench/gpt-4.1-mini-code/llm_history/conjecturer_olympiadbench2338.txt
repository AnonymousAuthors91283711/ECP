. Enumerated answers: Testing small integer candidates:
x = -2 is a root exactly: lhs = -2.0, rhs = -2.0
x = -1 is a root exactly: lhs = -4.0, rhs = -4.0
x = 2 is a root exactly: lhs = 2.0, rhs = 2.0

Testing small fractional candidates:
x = -1.0 is a root exactly: lhs = -4.0, rhs = -4.0
x = -2.0 is a root exactly: lhs = -2.0, rhs = -2.0
x = -1.0 is a root exactly: lhs = -4.0, rhs = -4.0
x = -1.0 is a root exactly: lhs = -4.0, rhs = -4.0
x = -2.0 is a root exactly: lhs = -2.0, rhs = -2.0
x = -1.0 is a root exactly: lhs = -4.0, rhs = -4.0
x = -1.0 is a root exactly: lhs = -4.0, rhs = -4.0
x = 2.0 is a root exactly: lhs = 2.0, rhs = 2.0
x = 2.0 is a root exactly: lhs = 2.0, rhs = 2.0

Numerical root approximations:
Root approx: 2.000000000000, f(root)=0.00e+00. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
