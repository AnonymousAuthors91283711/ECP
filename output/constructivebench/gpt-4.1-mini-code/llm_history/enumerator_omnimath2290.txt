[write_program]
The problem involves enumerating positive integers \( k \) between 1 and 99 that are relatively prime to 200. We want to count how many such integers exist (the size of the set). The program enumerates these values and prints them, then outputs the total count.

```python
# Enumerate k in (0,100) that are coprime with 200 and count them

import math

def is_coprime(a, b):
    return math.gcd(a, b) == 1

def main():
    coprime_numbers = []
    for k in range(1, 100):
        if is_coprime(k, 200):
            print(f"Found coprime: {k}")
            coprime_numbers.append(k)
    count = len(coprime_numbers)
    print(f"Total count of k coprime with 200 in (0,100): {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
