Ground Truth Answer: 4.2
Proposed Answer: 4.1697459393
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer 4.1697459393 is very close to the ground truth answer 4.2, but not exactly equal. The difference is small enough that it might be due to rounding or calculation precision, but since the problem asks for an exact answer with proof, we should consider them not exactly equivalent. The proposed answer is numerically very close but not identical to the ground truth.
