Let's enumerate small values of n and try to find the smallest size m of a finite set S of integers such that for every Fibonacci difference F(k) with k in [2,n], there exist x,y in S with x - y = F(k). The Fibonacci sequence is 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,...

We know F(0)=0, F(1)=1, and F(n+1)=F(n)+F(n-1). We want to cover differences equal to F(2),...,F(n).

We can try small sets S with increasing size m and check if the condition holds. To reduce complexity, we select S as subsets of integers in a small range, say from 0 up to the sum of first n Fibonacci numbers (which grows approximately exponentially, but for small n it's manageable).

We will print out the parameters used and print each m and corresponding S that works, stopping early if possible.

```python
from itertools import combinations

# Compute Fibonacci numbers up to n
def fib_up_to(n):
    F = [0,1]
    for i in range(2,n+1):
        F.append(F[i-1]+F[i-2])
    return F

def can_represent_all_differences(S, diffs):
    # For every d in diffs check if d = x - y for some x,y in S
    s_set = set(S)
    for d in diffs:
        found = False
        for x in S:
            y = x - d  # x - y = d => y = x - d
            if y in s_set:
                found = True
                break
        if not found:
            return False
    return True

def enumerate_min_cardinalities(n_max=7):
    print(f"Enumerate minimal cardinalities for covering differences F(k), 2 <= k <= n, up to n={n_max}")
    for n in range(2, n_max+1):
        F = fib_up_to(n)
        diffs = F[2:n+1]
        max_val = F[n]  # upper bound for elements of S
        print(f"n={n}, differences={diffs}")
        # Try increasing sizes m from 1 up to n+1 (small upper limit)
        for m in range(1, n+3):
            # Generate all subsets S from [0..max_val + max_val] to allow differences up to max_val
            # Use range 0..max_val*2 to allow positive and negative differences implicitly
            # But since S is subsets of integers, to allow negative numbers, shift by max_val
            candidates = range(0, max_val*2+1)
            found = False
            for S in combinations(candidates, m):
                # Shift back so minimal element can be negative if needed
                S_shifted = [x - max_val for x in S]
                if can_represent_all_differences(S_shifted, diffs):
                    print(f"n={n}, minimal m candidate: {m}, S={sorted(S_shifted)}")
                    found = True
                    break
            if found:
                # minimal m found for this n, proceed to next n
                break
        else:
            print(f"n={n}, no S found up to m={n+2}")
