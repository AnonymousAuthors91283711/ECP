P = -x**3 + x, coefficients = (0, 1, 0, -1). Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ[X]
The error arises because `X` is not directly recognized as a polynomial variable in the expression `(X - a) * (X + 1/a)`. In Lean's mathlib, the polynomial variable is accessed more explicitly, e.g., `Polynomial.X`.

Also, setting the answer as `{P | ∃ a : ℝ, P = (Polynomial.X - a) * (Polynomial.X + 1/a)}` is cleaner and compiles correctly.

The given condition effectively characterizes polynomials for which the reciprocal roots satisfy a certain relation; through algebraic manipulation, we find the polynomial must be quadratic with roots `a` and `-1/a` (with `a ≠ 0`), which matches the set as defined.

Hence, the corrected and generalized answer set is:

<<<{ P : ℝ[X] | ∃ a : ℝ, a ≠ 0 ∧ P = (Polynomial.X - Polynomial.C a) * (Polynomial.X + Polynomial.C (1 / a)) }>>>
