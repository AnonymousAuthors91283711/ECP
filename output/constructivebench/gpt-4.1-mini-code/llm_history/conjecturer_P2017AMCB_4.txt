The error occurs because you're defining a real number using division in Lean's core logic, which is noncomputable without marking as 'noncomputable'. To fix it, you should mark the definition as 'noncomputable' to allow the usage of real division. Also, since your problem involves checking an equality involving a float-like number, this setting is common.

Moreover, the candidate answer (44/60) * 2 corresponds to d, which is consistent with t₁ + t₂ = 44/60 and t₁ = (d/2)/17, t₂ = (d/2)/5. Writing t₁ + t₂ = d/2 * (1/17 + 1/5) = d/2 * ( (5 + 17)/85 ) = d/2 * 22/85 = d * 11/85 = 44/60 → d = (44/60) * (85/11) = (44 * 85)/(60 * 11) = (44 * 85)/(660) = let's simplify:

44 * 85 = 44 * (80 +5) = 44*80 + 44*5 = 3520 + 220 = 3740

So d = 3740 / 660 = divide numerator and denominator by 20: 187 / 33 ≈ 5.666...

So the exact answer for d is 187 / 33.

Therefore, the answer should be 187 / 33 (a rational number), which is more exact than (44/60)*2 = 88/60 = 44/30 = 22/15 ≈ 1.466..., which is different from above.

Summarizing,

t₁ + t₂ = (d/2)(1/17 + 1/5) = (d/2)(22/85) = d * 11/85 = 44/60

Hence, d = (44/60) * (85/11) = (44*85)/(60*11) = (3740)/(660) = 187/33.

Hence, the correct answer is 187/33 as a real number.

You can encode it in Lean as: (187 : ℝ) / 33

Finally, to fix the error, mark it noncomputable:

noncomputable abbrev P2017AMCB_4_answer : ℝ := (187 : ℝ) / 33

But your problem wants only the expression, you want just the expression enclosed between <<< >>>, so the final fixed version is:

<<<(187 : ℝ) / 33>>>

This will compile without division error because no division by zero occurs, and it's a simple rational constant.

Explanation:

We derived d from the equation:

t₁ + t₂ = 44/60

where t₁ = (d/2)/17, t₂ = (d/2)/5

Sum: (d/2)(1/17 + 1/5) = (d/2)(22/85) = d * 11/85 = 44/60

Hence d = (44/60) * (85/11) = 187/33

This is the exact solution to the problem.

Hence the answer is (187 : ℝ) / 33.

If you want, you can mark the abbrev noncomputable in Lean when defining.

The problem involves finding a real number d > 0 satisfying two conditions involving fractions of d and a time sum equal to 44/60. Given the conditions:

t₁ = (d/2)/17 = d/(2*17) = d/34
t₂ = (d/2)/5 = d/(2*5) = d/10
We have t₁ + t₂ = d/34 + d/10 = 44/60

Combine the fractions:

d*(1/34 + 1/10) = 44/60
Find common denominator for (1/34 + 1/10):
LCD = 170
1/34 = 5/170, 1/10 = 17/170
Sum = 22/170 = 11/85

So:
d * 11/85 = 44/60
d = (44/60) * (85/11) = (44 * 85) / (60 * 11) = (44 * 85) / 660

Simplify numerator:
44 * 85 = 44 * (80 + 5) = 44 * 80 + 44 * 5 = 3520 + 220 = 3740
Divide numerator and denominator by 20 to reduce:
3740 / 660 = 187 / 33

Therefore:
d = 187 / 33

Now check the rounded value (d/2), times 10, rounded, then divided by 10

d / 2 = (187 / 33) / 2 = 187 / 66 ≈ 2.8333

(d / 2) * 10 = (187 / 66) * 10 = 1870 / 66 ≈ 28.3333

round(28.3333) = 28

28 / 10 = 2.8

So the rounded value is 2.8

Therefore, the answer is d = 187 / 33 and P2017AMCB_4_answer = 2.8

In Lean, we can use rational numbers and convert to Real:

P2017AMCB_4_answer = 2.8, or more precisely 28/10 = 14/5 : ℝ

The Lean error occurs because division on reals involves the `Real.instDivInvMonoid` instance, which is noncomputable, so you must mark your definition as `noncomputable` to allow this.

Also, your candidate answer (187/33) is a rational number and valid as is, just requires it to be declared `noncomputable` when using division in reals.

Hence, to fix the Lean error, prepend `noncomputable` to your abbrev, i.e.:

The error occurs because Lean's Reals are noncomputable by default for division, so definitions using division over ℝ need to be marked `noncomputable` or you should use numerals without explicit type casts where possible. The candidate value \(\frac{187}{33}\) is an approximate solution for the distance \(d\) that satisfies the given constraint:

\[
\frac{d/2}{17} + \frac{d/2}{5} = \frac{44}{60}
\]


Simplify the equation:

\[
\frac{d}{2} \left(\frac{1}{17} + \frac{1}{5}\right) = \frac{44}{60}
\Rightarrow \frac{d}{2} \times \frac{22}{85} = \frac{44}{60}
\Rightarrow d = \frac{44}{60} \times \frac{2 \times 85}{22} = \frac{44}{60} \times \frac{170}{22} = \frac{44 \times 170}{60 \times 22} = \frac{44 \times 170}{1320}
\]

Calculate numerator and denominator:

\[
44 \times 170 = 7480, \quad 1320 = 1320
\]

Simplify fraction:

\[
\frac{7480}{1320} = \frac{187}{33}
\]

So the candidate solution \(\frac{187}{33}\) is exact.

We fix the error by marking the abbreviation as `noncomputable` and providing the fraction as a rational number cast to ℝ:

```lean
noncomputable abbrev P2017AMCB_4_answer : ℝ := (187 : ℚ) / 33
```

This avoids using `Real.instDivInvMonoid` in definition because Lean will treat it via coercion from ℚ to ℝ.

Hence, the fixed answer in Lean is:
