The problem involves real numbers a, b and rounding functions defined as round (to nearest integer) and round_tenth (to nearest tenth). Given two equations with these roundings, we want to find the smallest natural number n equal to round(10*(a+b)) satisfying these equations. To assist, we enumerate candidate integers n and search for real a, b that satisfy the equations within rounding constraints.

We'll:
- Iterate over candidate n (likely around 980 to 1000 to keep search small),
- For each n, a and b can be guessed from possible round and round_tenth values implied by the equations,
- We reconstruct intervals for a, b from rounding definitions,
- Check if a + b rounds to n/10 by the 10x rounding,
- Print all candidates with explanations for manual review.

```python
# Enumerate possible (a,b) and n = round(10*(a+b)) satisfying given rounding equations.
# round(x) rounds to nearest integer, round_tenth(x) = round(10*x)/10 rounds to nearest tenth.
# Given round_tenth(a) + round(b) = 98.6 and round(a) + round_tenth(b) = 99.3,
# find least n in N with round(10*(a+b)) = n.

def round_bounds(x):
    # Returns interval of reals that round(x) can be, midpoint rounding half up
    # From definition, e.g. round(3.2) = 3 means x in [2.5,3.5)
    # We'll invert rounding: round(x)=m means x in [m-0.5,m+0.5), with half round up handled
    # We'll apply half round up as per hround in statement.
    return (x - 0.5, x + 0.5)

def round_tenth_bounds(x):
    # round_tenth(x) = round(10*x)/10 = r,
    # so 10*x in [10*r - 0.5, 10*r + 0.5), so
    # x in [(10*r - 0.5)/10, (10*r + 0.5)/10)
