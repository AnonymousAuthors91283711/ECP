The problem asks to find the number of positive real numbers \( x \) satisfying the equation
\[
(3 \cdot 2^{\lfloor \log_2 x \rfloor} - x)^{16} = 2022 \cdot x^{13}.
\]
We want to enumerate such \( x \) and count them. The main difficulty is the floor function inside and the high powers.

To approach this:
- For integer \( n = \lfloor \log_2 x \rfloor \), \( x \in [2^n, 2^{n+1}) \).
- On each interval, rewrite the equation and check for solutions.
- Enumerate over a reasonable range of \( n \) (e.g., small integers) because the powers make values large.
- Solve \( (3 \cdot 2^n - x)^{16} = 2022 \cdot x^{13} \) for \( x \in [2^n, 2^{n+1}) \).

We print all positive real solutions found with their intervals and values. We approximate roots efficiently by evaluating the polynomial on a fine grid and applying a root-finding method near sign changes.

```python
# Enumerate solutions x > 0 to (3*2^(floor(log2 x)) - x)^16 = 2022*x^13
# For n = floor(log2 x), x in [2^n, 2^{n+1}), solve (3*2^n - x)^16 = 2022 * x^13
# Scan small n, search for solutions and print them immediately

import math

def f(x, n):
    # Evaluate left - right (inside ^16) to find zeros
    # We consider y = (3 * 2^n - x)^16 - 2022 * x^13 = 0
    # To find roots numerically.
    left = (3 * 2**n - x)**16
    right = 2022 * x**13
    return left - right

def sign(x):
    return 1 if x > 0 else (-1 if x < 0 else 0)

    roots = []

            a, b = xs[i], xs[i+1]

                    b, fb = m, fm
