Total perfect square divisors of 10^10: 36. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<(5 + 1) * (5 + 1)>>> 
-- Explanation: The prime factorization of 10^10 is 2^10 * 5^10. The perfect square divisors correspond to even exponents from 0 to 10 on each prime. Number of even exponents from 0 to 10 inclusive is 6 for each prime, so total is 6*6 = 36.
