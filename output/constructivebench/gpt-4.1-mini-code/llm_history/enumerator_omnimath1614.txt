The problem is about finding a minimum-size subset \( C \) of pairs \((p,q)\) with \(p,q \in \{0,\ldots,8\}\) such that every pair \((i,j)\) in \(\{0,\ldots,9\}^2\) lies in at least one overlapping 2x2 block defined by \((p,p+1) \times (q,q+1)\) corresponding to elements of \(C\).

The task is to enumerate possible sizes and coverings to conjecture the minimal \(|C|\).

We check subsets of possible 81 pairs \((p,q)\) with \(p,q \in \{0,\ldots,8\}\).

We will:
- Enumerate sets \(C\) by size starting from small.
- Check coverage of all 100 points.
- Prioritize minimal size solutions.
- Limit the enumeration up to some size threshold (e.g., 10) due to complexity.

We print sizes and found solutions immediately. We will only print a few due to complexity and token limits.

```python
from itertools import combinations, product

# The grid for (i,j) is 0..9 x 0..9
# Candidates (p,q) are 0..8 x 0..8, defining 2x2 blocks covering points (i,j) with i in {p,p+1}, j in {q,q+1}

all_points = set(product(range(10), repeat=2))
candidates = list(product(range(9), repeat=2))

def covers_point(pq, point):
    p, q = pq
    i, j = point
    return (i == p or i == p+1) and (j == q or j == q+1)

def is_covering(C):
    # Check if every (i,j) is covered by some (p,q) in C
    for pt in all_points:
        if not any(covers_point(c, pt) for c in C):
            return False
    return True

max_size = 10  # Threshold to limit search

found_sizes = []

print("Enumerating covering sets candidate sizes...")

for size in range(1, max_size+1):
    # combinations of candidates of given size
    # Due to explosive growth, we only print the size each time we find a solution
    count = 0
    for C in combinations(candidates, size):
        if is_covering(C):
            print(f"Found covering set of size {size}: {C}")
            found_sizes.append(size)
            count += 1
            # Limit output to a few to avoid overflow
            if count >= 3:
                break
    if len(found_sizes) > 0:
        # Found minimal size covering sets at this size
        # Print summary and stop further search
        print(f"Minimal covering set size found: {size}")
        break

if not found_sizes:
    print(f"No covering sets found up to size {max_size}")
```
