The problem appears to involve combinatorial selection strategies on card sets with constraints, parameterized by \( n \) and \( k \). To assist in conjecturing and proving the theorem, we will enumerate small values of \( n \) and \( k \), simulating initial assignments of cards and checking for pairs within chosen subsets.

We will:
- Iterate over small \( n \) (e.g., 1 to 3) and \( k \) (e.g., 1 to 3).
- For each, generate all initial functions from \( Fin(2n) \) to \( \mathbb{N} \) where each value \( 1 \ldots n \) appears exactly twice.
- Enumerate possible strategies as functions mapping initial assignments to subsets of size \( k \).
- Check whether for every initial assignment there exists a subset selected by the strategy containing a pair of equal values.
- Print partial results immediately for observed configurations and potential candidates for "m" or minimal/maximal conditions if applicable.

This enumeration will print potential answers or witnesses to guide further proof attempts.
