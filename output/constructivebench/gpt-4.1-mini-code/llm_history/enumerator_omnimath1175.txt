This problem counts functions \( f : \{0,1\}^{2010} \to \{0,1\}^{2} \) which are compositions of 2010 functions each from \(\{0,1\}\) to \(\{0,1\}\) (two possibilities each), and the overall composition is constant with value \(c \in \{0,1\}\). We want to enumerate such function sequences and count those for which there exists a constant output \(c\).

We can try a smaller version where the domain size and number of steps are small to find a pattern. We will:

- Enumerate all functions at each step \(f_i : \{0,1\} \to \{0,1\}\), of which there are 4 each.

- For a given length \(n\), enumerate sequences \(f_0, \ldots, f_{n-1}\).

- Compose them in order and check whether the resulting function is constant (always 0 or always 1).

We will run for small values of \(n\), print the counts of such sequences that produce constant functions, for \(n=1,2,3,4\), and observe patterns.

```python
# Enumerate sequences of functions f_i : {0,1}->{0,1} of length n,
# each f_i is one of 4 functions: 
# 0->0,1->0 (const 0)
# 0->1,1->1 (const 1)
# 0->0,1->1 (id)
# 0->1,1->0 (neg)
# Count sequences where composition is constant function

# Define all 4 functions as tuples of images (f(0), f(1))
funclist = [(0,0),(1,1),(0,1),(1,0)]  # const0, const1, id, neg

def compose(f, g):
    # composition f∘g : x ↦ f(g(x))
    return (f[g[0]], f[g[1]])

def is_const(f):
    return f[0] == f[1]

def enum_constant_compositions(n):
    # Enumerate all length-n sequences of indices in range(4)
    from itertools import product
    count = 0
    for seq in product(range(4), repeat=n):
        # Compose from right to left: f0∘f1∘...fn-1 
        comp = (0,1) # identity function (id)
        for idx in reversed(seq):
            comp = compose(funclist[idx], comp)
        if is_const(comp):
            print(f"Length={n}, seq={seq}, comp={comp} constant")
            count += 1
    print(f"Total sequences length {n} with constant composition: {count}")

def main():
    for n in range(1,5):  # small n due to combinatorial explosion
        enum_constant_compositions(n)

if __name__=="__main__":
    main()
