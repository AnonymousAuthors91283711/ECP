The problem seems to involve finding Mary's age based on Alice's age and the condition that the ratio of Mary's age to Alice's age is 3/5. Given Alice's age is 30, Mary's age should satisfy maryAge / 30 = 3 / 5, so maryAge = (3/5)*30 = 18. To confirm and explore this, I will write a Python program that enumerates possible Mary's ages for sample Alice ages and checks the ratio condition.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def enumerate_mary_ages():
    # Sample Alice ages including 30
    for alice_age in [15, 20, 25, 30, 35]:
        print(f"Alice's age: {alice_age}")
        # We seek mary_age such that mary_age / alice_age = 3/5
        target_ratio = Fraction(3, 5)
        # Try candidate mary ages near 3/5 * alice_age
        start = max(1, (3 * alice_age) // 5 - 1)
        end = (3 * alice_age) // 5 + 2
        for mary_age in range(start, end):
            ratio = Fraction(mary_age, alice_age)
            if ratio == target_ratio:
                print(f"Mary's age: {mary_age} (exact ratio {ratio})")
            elif abs(ratio - target_ratio) < Fraction(1, alice_age*10):
                # print near misses as approximations
                print(f"Mary's age: {mary_age} (approx ratio {float(ratio):.3f})")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    enumerate_mary_ages()
```
