theorem P2004AMCB_15 :
  ∃ (j b : ℕ),
    j < 100 ∧ b < 100 ∧
    j / 10 = b % 10 ∧ j % 10 = b / 10 ∧
    j + 5 = 2 * (b + 5) ∧
    |(j - b : ℤ)| = P2004AMCB_15_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Listing solutions with j,b < 100:
j=31, b=13, |j-b|=18
Minimum |j-b| = 18. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<18>>>
