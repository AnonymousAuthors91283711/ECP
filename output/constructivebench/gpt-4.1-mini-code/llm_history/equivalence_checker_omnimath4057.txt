Ground Truth Answer: fun a b => 
    if a = b ∧ a % 2 = 0 then 2 * (a / 2) + 3
    else max a b + 2
Proposed Answer: fun a b => a + b + 3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest number m such that any set of m integers between -a and b (inclusive) must contain three distinct elements that sum to zero.

2. The ground truth answer handles two cases:
   - When a = b and both are even: returns 2*(a/2) + 3
   - Otherwise: returns max(a,b) + 2

3. The proposed answer simply returns a + b + 3 for all cases

Let's test some examples:
- Case 1: a=2, b=2 (both even)
  - Ground truth: 2*(2/2)+3 = 5
  - Proposed: 2+2+3 = 7
  - 5 ≠ 7

- Case 2: a=3, b=5
  - Ground truth: max(3,5)+2 = 7
  - Proposed: 3+5+3 = 11
  - 7 ≠ 11

The proposed answer consistently gives larger numbers than needed and doesn't match the ground truth's case handling. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
