Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: (-2, -2)
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer (-2, -2) satisfies the first condition when substituted into the equation, but it fails to satisfy the uniqueness condition (the second part of the theorem statement). The problem requires both existence AND uniqueness of the solution. While (-2, -2) works for the equation, it's not necessarily the only solution that satisfies the equation for all x. Therefore, the proposed answer is partially correct but incomplete.
