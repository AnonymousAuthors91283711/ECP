The problem is to find the value of \(x + y\) given the condition:
\[
x^2 + y^2 = 10x - 6y - 34.
\]

We can rearrange and complete the square to find possible \((x,y)\) pairs that satisfy the equation, then compute \(x+y\). To assist in conjecturing the possible values of \(x+y\), I'll write a Python program that enumerates integer candidates \(x,y\) in a reasonable range, checks the equation, and prints \(x+y\) when the equation holds.

```python
# Enumerate integer pairs (x,y) such that x^2 + y^2 = 10x - 6y - 34
# Print all possible x+y values found for conjecture

def main():
    # rearranged equation:
    # x^2 -10x + y^2 +6y +34 = 0
    # Complete the square:
    # (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 5^2 + (-3)^2 - 34 = 25 + 9 - 34 = 0
    # So (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 0, implies x=5 and y=-3 as unique solution.
    # Let's enumerate close integers to verify this.

    candidates = set()
    for x in range(0, 11):        # 0 to 10 covers neighborhood of 5
        for y in range(-10, 5):   # from -10 to 4 covers neighborhood of -3
            lhs = x**2 + y**2
            rhs = 10*x - 6*y - 34
            if lhs == rhs:
                s = x + y
                print(f"x={x}, y={y}, x+y={s}")
                candidates.add(s)

    if candidates:
        print("Possible values of x+y found:", candidates)
        print("Minimum x+y:", min(candidates))
        print("Maximum x+y:", max(candidates))
    else:
        print("No integer solutions found in the range.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This will print the integer solutions in the specified ranges, their sums \(x+y\), and summarize the found values.
