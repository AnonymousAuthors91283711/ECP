[write_program]
The problem is to find all natural numbers \( n \) for which the equation
\[
n^2 - 10n + 70 = 5 + 10(n - 1)
\]
holds true. I'll write a Python program to enumerate values of \( n \) in a reasonable range and check this equality exactly.

The program will:
- Loop over \( n \) from 0 to 30 (sample reasonable values),
- Check the equality,
- Print \( n \) if the equality holds.

This helps conjecture the exact solution set for the problem.

```python
# Enumerate natural numbers n to find which satisfy:
# n^2 - 10*n + 70 == 5 + 10*(n - 1)
# We'll check n in range 0 to 30

def lhs(n):
    # Compute left hand side exactly
    return n**2 - 10*n + 70

def rhs(n):
    # Compute right hand side exactly
    return 5 + 10*(n - 1)

print("Checking values of n from 0 to 30 for the equality:")
for n in range(31):
    if lhs(n) == rhs(n):
        print(f"n = {n} satisfies the equality.")
```
