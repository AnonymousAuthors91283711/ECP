This problem involves solving a linear system with parameters \(a\), \(b\), \(w\), and \(c\), and finding the expression \(c + w\) in terms of \(a\) and \(b\). The system is:

\[
\begin{cases}
\frac{2}{3} c + w = a \\
\frac{1}{2} c + w = b
\end{cases}
\]

We want to find \(c+w\).

We will enumerate sample values of \(a, b\) (small integers), solve for \(c, w\), and print \(c+w\).

```python
# Enumerate sample values for a, b and solve the system:
# 2/3 c + w = a
# 1/2 c + w = b
#
# Then compute c + w and print it immediately.

def solve_and_print(a, b):
    # Subtract second from first:
    # (2/3 c + w) - (1/2 c + w) = a - b
    # (2/3 - 1/2) c = a - b
    # (4/6 - 3/6) c = a - b
    # (1/6) c = a - b  => c = 6(a - b)
    c = 6*(a - b)
    # From second eq: w = b - 1/2 c
    w = b - 0.5 * c
    # c + w
    result = c + w
    print(f"a={a}, b={b} => c+w = {result}")

def main():
    print("Enumerating c+w for sample a,b")
    for a in range(-3, 4):       # sample a from -3 to 3
        for b in range(-3, 4):   # sample b from -3 to 3
            solve_and_print(a, b)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
