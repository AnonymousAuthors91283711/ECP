The problem involves finding positive integers \(a, b, c\) such that \((a^{1/3} + b^{1/3} + 1)/c\) is a root of the polynomial \(8x^3 - 3x^2 - 3x - 1 = 0\) and \(a + b + c = 98\).

We will:
- Iterate over positive integer triples \((a,b,c)\) with \(a+b+c=98\).
- Compute the cube roots and check the polynomial exactly if possible or by floating-point approximation.
- Print candidates where the polynomial value is (close to) zero.

Since exact algebraic manipulation is tricky in float, we'll check with a small epsilon. We'll prioritize smaller c to reduce search space.

```python
import math

def poly(x):
    return 8*x**3 - 3*x**2 - 3*x - 1

N = 98
eps = 1e-9

print("Enumerating triples (a,b,c) with a+b+c=98 and checking polynomial...")
for c in range(1, N-1):
    max_a = N - c - 1
    for a in range(1, max_a+1):
        b = N - a - c
        if b <= 0:
            continue
        val = (a**(1/3) + b**(1/3) + 1) / c
        p = poly(val)
        if abs(p) < eps:
            print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, x={val:.9f}, poly(x)={p:.2e}")

# After enumeration, print minimal c candidate with close to zero polynomial if any
```
