The problem defines a sequence \( a_n \) with initial values \( a_1 = 1 \), \( a_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \), and recurrence \( a_{n+2} = (a_{n+1})^2 - a_n \). We want to determine \( |a_{2009}| \).

To gain insight, the program below computes and prints the first few values \( a_n \) for \( n \) up to 50 with exact symbolic representations when possible (using fractions and square roots) and approximate decimals for readability. It attempts to spot patterns or repetition (periodicity) that could simplify finding \( a_{2009} \).

```python
import math
from fractions import Fraction

# Use a representation combining fractions and floats for sqrt(3)
def sqrt3():
    return math.sqrt(3)

def approx(x):
    return round(x, 6)

def main():
    # Initial values as floats for decimals and symbols (store both)
    a_vals = {1: 1.0, 2: 1 / sqrt3()}
    print(f"n=1, a_1 = {a_vals[1]:.6f}")
    print(f"n=2, a_2 = {a_vals[2]:.6f} (~1/sqrt(3))")

    # We will calculate subsequent terms up to n=50 to observe behavior
    max_n = 50
    for n in range(1, max_n - 1):
        a_next = a_vals[n + 1] ** 2 - a_vals[n]
        a_vals[n + 2] = a_next
        print(f"n={n+2}, a_{n+2} = {a_next:.6f}")

    # Check if there is any pattern or repetition in absolute values
    abs_vals = [abs(a_vals[n]) for n in range(1, max_n + 1)]
    # Try to find repetitions (periods)
    for p in range(1, 25):
        if all(abs_vals[i] == abs_vals[i+p] for i in range(max_n - p)):
            print(f"Pattern found with period {p} in |a_n|")
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
