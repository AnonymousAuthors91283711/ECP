The problem involves finding the greatest product \( xy \) such that \( x > 0, y > 0 \), and the system
\[
\begin{cases}
x + \frac{1}{y} = 3 \\
y + \frac{2}{x} = 3
\end{cases}
\]
holds. We will enumerate positive values of \( x \) and solve for \( y \) from the first equation; then check if the second equation holds approximately, then print the product. After enumerating, print the maximum product found.

```python
# Enumerate x > 0 in small steps, solve for y, check second equation, print product xy if constraints met
def main():
    import math

    print("Enumerating products xy with x,y > 0, satisfying x+1/y=3 and y+2/x=3")

    max_product = None
    step = 0.01
    xs = [step * i for i in range(1, int(10 / step))]  # x in (0,10)
    for x in xs:
        # From x + 1/y =3 => 1/y = 3 - x => y = 1/(3 - x)
        denom = 3 - x
        if denom <= 0:
            continue
        y = 1 / denom
        if y <= 0:
            continue
        # Check y + 2/x = 3
        lhs = y + 2/x
        if abs(lhs - 3) < 1e-6:
            product = x * y
            print(f"x={x:.4f}, y={y:.4f}, xy={product:.6f}")
            if (max_product is None) or (product > max_product):
                max_product = product

    if max_product is not None:
        print(f"Maximum product xy found approximately: {max_product:.6f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
