abbrev omnimath2812_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2812 :
  (let x : ℝ := 2;
   (x + 2 - x) * (2 - x - 2) = omnimath2812_answer) :=
sorry
. Enumerated answers: Evaluating (x + 2 - x) * (2 - x - 2) for x near 2:
x = 1.9: value = -3.8
x = 2.0: value = -4.0
x = 2.1: value = -4.199999999999999

Expression simplifies to -2 * x.
At x = 2, value = -4. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<-4>>>
