abbrev omnimath3649_answer : Set ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3649 (x y : ℝ) (h : x^2 * y^2 + x * y + 1 = 3 * y^2) :
    let F := (y - x) / (x + 4 * y)
    F ∈ omnimath3649_answer ↔ (0 ≤ F ∧ F ≤ 4) := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating F = (y - x)/(x + 4y) for (x,y) satisfying x^2*y^2 + xy + 1 = 3*y^2
F = -0.0 for x=-1.0 y=-1.0
F = 1.5 for x=2.0 y=-1.0

Enumerated candidate F values lie between 0 and 4 inclusive.. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
<<<{F | 0 ≤ F ∧ F ≤ 4}>>>
