The problem involves summing over all 7-tuples of natural numbers a : Fin 7 → ℕ the expression (sum of a_i) / 3^(sum of a_i). This can be simplified by noting the variables only appear as sums. Since each a_i ranges over ℕ independently, the total sum is essentially over all sums n = ∑ a_i from 0 to ∞, counting how many tuples have sum n and multiplying by (n / 3^n).

The number of tuples a : Fin 7 → ℕ with sum n is the number of weak compositions of n into 7 parts, which is C(n+7-1, 7-1) = C(n+6,6).

So we want to compute:
S = ∑_{n=0}^∞ [ C(n+6,6) * n / 3^n ]

To approximate, we can enumerate n from 0 up to some N (e.g. N=30 for convergence), compute term = C(n+6,6) * n / 3^n, and sum.

We print each term immediately for streaming partial results.

We also print partial sums after each addition to see convergence.

Finally, we print the approximate sum as the answer.

```python
from math import comb

def main():
    # Enumerate n and compute terms of the series:
    # term_n = C(n+6,6)*n / 3^n
    # Sum from n=0 to some max N to approximate the infinite sum.
    N = 30
    partial_sum = 0.0
    print("n, term, partial_sum")
    for n in range(N+1):
        c = comb(n+6,6)
        if n == 0:
            term = 0  # Because n=0 term is 0*n/3^0=0
        else:
            term = c * n / (3**n)
        partial_sum += term
        print(f"{n}, {term}, {partial_sum:.10f}")
    print()
    print(f"Approximate sum (partial sum up to n={N}): {partial_sum:.10f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
