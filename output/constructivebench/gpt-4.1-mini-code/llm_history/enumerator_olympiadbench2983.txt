The problem: find positive integers \(a,b,c,d\) such that 
\[
a! \times b! \times c! = d! \quad \text{and} \quad a+b+c+d = 37,
\]
then calculate \(a \times b \times c \times d\).

We want to enumerate all quadruples \((a,b,c,d)\) with positive integers and sum 37, checking the factorial product condition. We'll restrict the search reasonably given factorial growth.

```python
import math

def main():
    N = 37
    # To reduce search space, note that d! grows fast.
    # For given sum 37, d can be at most 34 because a,b,c >=1.
    for d in range(1, N):
        # a,b,c positive integers with a+b+c = 37 - d
        total_abc = N - d
        # Enumerate a,b with 1 <= a,b <= total_abc-2 (since c>=1)
        for a in range(1, total_abc - 1):
            for b in range(1, total_abc - a):
                c = total_abc - a - b
                if c < 1:
                    continue
                # Check factorial product
                try:
                    lhs = math.factorial(a) * math.factorial(b) * math.factorial(c)
                    rhs = math.factorial(d)
                    if lhs == rhs:
                        prod = a * b * c * d
                        print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d} | product={prod}")
                except OverflowError:
                    # Factorials get huge, skip
                    continue

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
