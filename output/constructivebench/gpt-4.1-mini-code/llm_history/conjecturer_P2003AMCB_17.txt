noncomputable abbrev P2003AMCB_17_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2003AMCB_17 (x y : ℝ) (hx : x > 0) (hy : y > 0)
  (h1 : log (x * y^3) = 1) (h2 : log (x^2 * y) = 1) :
  log (x * y) = P2003AMCB_17_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating values based on solution of system:
log(x)=0.4, log(y)=0.2, log(xy)=0.6
x=1.49182, y=1.2214, log(x y^3)=1, log(x^2 y)=1
Exact solution from algebraic manipulation:
log(x) = 0.4, log(y) = 0.2, log(x y) = 0.6000000000000001. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
