The problem counts triples \((a,b,c)\) with \(a,b,c \in \{1,\dots,n\}\) such that \(3 \mid a b c + a b + a\). We want to investigate the ratio \(\frac{\#\{(a,b,c): 3 \mid abc + ab + a\}}{n^3}\).

We can enumerate triples for small \(n\) to conjecture the ratio and identify \(P2010AMCB\_16\_answer\).

```python
# Enumerate triples (a,b,c) in [1..n]^3 and count when 3 divides a*b*c + a*b + a
def count_divisible_triples(n):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n+1):
        for b in range(1, n+1):
            # Precompute ab and terms mod 3 to speed up:
            ab = a * b
            # For c, we want 3|(a*b*c + a*b + a)
            # Since modular arithmetic mod 3:
            # (a*b*c + a*b + a) mod 3 = (ab * c + ab + a) mod 3
            # For each c in [1..n], check divisibility
            for c in range(1, n+1):
                val = ab * c + ab + a
                if val % 3 == 0:
                    count += 1
                    print(f"Valid triple: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, val={val}")
    return count

def main():
    # Select small n to detect pattern
    for n in [3, 6, 9]:
        print(f"n = {n}")
        total = n ** 3
        count = count_divisible_triples(n)
        ratio = count / total
        print(f"Count = {count}, Total = {total}, Ratio = {ratio:.6f}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
