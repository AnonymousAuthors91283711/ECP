The given statement defines a natural number and asks to identify a number omnimath784_answer equal to the large integer 1007021035035021007001. Since it's a natural number equality, the goal is to analyze properties of this large number, possibly factors or digits, to understand its structure.

A useful approach is to try to factor it or find some remarkable arithmetic property (e.g., palindrome, prime factorization, sums). The Python program will enumerate candidates for factors or decompositions of this large number, print partial factorizations or properties, and help conjecture the nature of this number.

```python
# Enumerate factors of the large number up to a limit, print divisors immediately.
N = 1007021035035021007001

print(f"Number N = {N}")

# Check if N has small factors to find a pattern
limit = 10**7  # limit factor search for efficiency

found_factors = False

for i in range(2, limit):
    if N % i == 0:
        print(f"Factor found: {i}")
        print(f"Co-factor: {N // i}")
        found_factors = True
        break  # stop after the first factor to limit output

if not found_factors:
    print("No small factors found up to", limit)

# Check if N is a palindrome number
s = str(N)
if s == s[::-1]:
    print("The number is a palindrome.")
else:
    print("The number is not a palindrome.")

# Print digit sum
digit_sum = sum(int(d) for d in s)
print(f"Digit sum: {digit_sum}")

# Enumerate possible sums of digits of factors if found to check for numeric patterns
```
