[write_program]
The problem concerns the volume of the set of points in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) relative to a 4-point configuration (a tetrahedron with edge length 1), such that the sum of squared distances from a point \(p\) to these 4 points is at most 15. The set is defined by such \(p\) and \(s\), with \(s\) defining vertices of a unit-edge-length tetrahedron.

We want to explore configurations of 4 points in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) with pairwise distances 1, then compute or approximate the volume of points where sum of squared distances to those points is â‰¤ 15.

Since the size of this problem is complex algebraically, I'll write a Python program that:
- Enumerates some canonical tetrahedron configurations with edge length 1.
- Computes the volume of points \( p \) in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) satisfying \( \sum_{i=1}^4 \|p - s_i\|^2 \leq 15 \).
- \( \sum \|p - s_i\|^2 \) defines a quadratic inequality; the set of \( p \) satisfying this is an ellipsoid.
- Compute its volume exactly (or approximated by computing the ellipsoid axes lengths).
- Print these volumes for sample configurations.

This will help conjecture the volume (and thus the omnimath2072 answer).
