The problem involves summing the reciprocals of all positive divisors of 144, a finite sum. We will enumerate all positive divisors of 144, compute 1/d for each, and sum them exactly as fractions. The program will print each divisor with its reciprocal and then print the final sum.

```python
from math import gcd

def divisors(n):
    divs = set()
    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5)+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divs.add(i)
            divs.add(n//i)
    return sorted(divs)

from fractions import Fraction

def main():
    n = 144
    print(f"Divisors of {n}:")
    divs = divisors(n)
    total = Fraction(0,1)
    for d in divs:
        val = Fraction(1, d)
        print(f"1/{d} = {val}")
        total += val
    print(f"Sum of reciprocals of divisors of {n} = {total} = {float(total)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
