Ground Truth Answer: fun x => (x - 1) * (x - 2) / 6
Proposed Answer: fun m : ℝ => (m - 1) * (m - 2) / 6
<<<True>>>

Explanation: The proposed answer is exactly equivalent to the ground truth answer. Both are functions that take a real number as input and return the value (x-1)(x-2)/6 (or (m-1)(m-2)/6, which is the same formula with a different variable name). The variable name change from x to m doesn't affect the mathematical equivalence. The formula correctly represents the sum of floor(k/3) for k from 1 to m-1 when m is a natural number greater than 4.
