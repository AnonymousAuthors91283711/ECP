The problem asks to find all quadruples \((a,b,c,d)\) of natural numbers satisfying \(a \leq b \leq c \leq d\) and such that the set \(\{ab + cd, ac + bd, ad + bc\}\) equals \(\{40, 70, 100\}\).

The goal is to enumerate all such quadruples, printing them as we find them. We will try all \(a,b,c,d\) up to a reasonable maximum (like 20 or 30), since the expressions involved can reach up to 100. We'll prune by the ordering \(a \leq b \leq c \leq d\) and use sets to compare the sums.

We print each found quadruple immediately. After enumeration, we print the total count.

```python
# Enumerate all quadruples (a,b,c,d) with 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d ≤ 20
# such that {a*b + c*d, a*c + b*d, a*d + b*c} = {40, 70, 100}

def main():
    target = {40, 70, 100}
    max_n = 20
    count = 0

    for a in range(1, max_n+1):
        for b in range(a, max_n+1):
            for c in range(b, max_n+1):
                for d in range(c, max_n+1):
                    s1 = a*b + c*d
                    s2 = a*c + b*d
                    s3 = a*d + b*c
                    sums = {s1, s2, s3}
                    if sums == target:
                        print(f"a={a} b={b} c={c} d={d}")
                        count += 1
    print(f"Total quadruples found: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
