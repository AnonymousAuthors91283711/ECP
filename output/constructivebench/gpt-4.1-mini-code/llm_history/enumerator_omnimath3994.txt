The problem involves finding the greatest sum s of values in any 3x3 submatrix of a 5x5 matrix M with entries 0 or 1 under certain divisibility constraints on their indices. We want to enumerate possible matrices M that satisfy the constraints and compute the maximum 3x3 submatrix sum.

We will:
- Generate all possible 5x5 {0,1}-matrices (too many, so prune)
- For each M, check constraints on entry values depending on whether the linear index k (1-based) is odd or even
- For valid matrices, compute sums of all 3x3 submatrices and track the max
- Print all sums found and eventually print the greatest sum found

Index k = i*5 + j + 1 (1-based), odd indices must correspond to entries = 1, even indices must be 0.

Because trying all 2^(25) matrices is huge, we instead use this characterization:

- At odd positions k, must have M[i][j] = 1
- At even positions k, must have M[i][j] = 0

So the matrix is fixed and unique! We can compute the sums over all 3x3 submatrices directly.

```python
# Enumerate answers for the problem about 5x5 matrix M of 0/1 with position parity constraint:
# At position k (1-based) k odd => M[i][j] = 1, k even => M[i][j] = 0
# Compute the maximum sum of any 3x3 submatrix

def main():
    # Build matrix M[i][j] for i,j in 0..4
    # k = i*5 + j +1
    M = [[1 if ((i*5 + j +1) % 2 == 1) else 0 for j in range(5)] for i in range(5)]
    
    print("Matrix M (1=odd position, 0=even position):")
    for row in M:
        print(row)

    max_sum = -1
    # Iterate over all 3x3 submatrices: top-left corner (r,c): 0<=r<=2, 0<=c<=2
    for r in range(3):
        for c in range(3):
            sub_sum = 0
            for i in range(r, r+3):
                for j in range(c, c+3):
                    sub_sum += M[i][j]
            print(f"Sum of submatrix starting at ({r},{c}): {sub_sum}")
            if sub_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = sub_sum

    print(f"Maximum 3x3 submatrix sum: {max_sum}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
