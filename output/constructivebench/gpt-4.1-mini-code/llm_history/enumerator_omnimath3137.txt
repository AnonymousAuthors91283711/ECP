[write_program]
The problem hints at evaluating the expression (5 * 4) + (4 * 3), which simplifies to 20 + 12 = 32. To assist in conjecturing this, the program will compute (n * (n - 1)) for given n values and sum them up, printing each intermediate step.

```python
# Enumerate values for n and compute n*(n-1) for given n's
ns = [5, 4]
total = 0
for n in ns:
    val = n * (n - 1)
    print(f"{n} * ({n} - 1) = {val}")
    total += val
print(f"Sum = {total}")
```
