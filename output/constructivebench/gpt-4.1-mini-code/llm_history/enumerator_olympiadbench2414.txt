This problem involves summing floor((k+1)/3) for k from 0 to 59, i.e., for k+1 from 1 to 60.

We can enumerate all terms and sum them directly.

```python
# Sum floor((k+1)/3) for k in [0..59]
total = 0
for k in range(60):
    val = (k+1) // 3
    print(f"Term k={k}: floor(({k+1})/3) = {val}")
    total += val
print(f"Sum: {total}")
```
