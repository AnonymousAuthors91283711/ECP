The problem revolves around finding all pairs of positive integers \((x,y)\) such that 
\[
(xy + 1)(xy + x + 2)
\]
is a perfect square. To explore this, the program below enumerates pairs \((x, y)\) with small values and checks if the product is a perfect square, printing all such pairs found. It then identifies and prints the minimum such value \(k\).

```python
import math

def is_perfect_square(n):
    r = int(math.isqrt(n))
    return r * r == n

print("Enumerating (x,y) where (x*y+1)*(x*y + x + 2) is a perfect square:")

max_val = 20  # small values for exploration
found = []
for x in range(1, max_val+1):
    for y in range(1, max_val+1):
        val = (x*y + 1) * (x*y + x + 2)
        if is_perfect_square(val):
            k = int(math.isqrt(val))
            found.append((x,y,k))
            print(f"x={x}, y={y}, k={k}, value={val}")

if found:
    min_k = min(t[2] for t in found)
    print(f"Minimum k among discovered solutions: {min_k}")
else:
    print("No solutions found in the given range.")
```
