Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {x | x = -10 ∨ x = -8 ∨ x = -6}
<<<None>>>
Since the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's not provided), we cannot determine whether the proposed answer {x | x = -10 ∨ x = -8 ∨ x = -6} is equivalent to it. The problem requires comparing two answers, but one is missing. Therefore, we must return "None" as we're unsure about their equivalence.
