The problem involves finding all positive integers \( d \) in the interval \([10, 99]\) that exactly divide \(2^{32} - 1\), then summing those divisors. We'll enumerate these divisors, print each found divisor, and finally print their sum.

```python
# Enumerate divisors d in [10,99] dividing 2^32 - 1 exactly, print each divisor and sum

N = 2**32 - 1
divisors = []
print(f"N = {N}")

for d in range(10, 100):
    if N % d == 0:
        print(d)
        divisors.append(d)

print("Sum:", sum(divisors))
```
