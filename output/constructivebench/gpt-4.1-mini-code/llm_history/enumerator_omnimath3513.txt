The problem defines a set xvals with specified real numbers and asks to find the subset of xvals where each element x satisfies x > xÂ². We need to enumerate elements in xvals = {-2, -1/2, 0, 1/2, 2} that satisfy x > xÂ².

```python
# Python program to enumerate elements x in xvals = {-2, -1/2, 0, 1/2, 2} where x > x^2

xvals = [-2, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 2]

print("xvals:", xvals)
print("Elements x in xvals with x > x^2:")

for x in xvals:
    lhs = x
    rhs = x**2
    if x > rhs:
        print(x)
```
