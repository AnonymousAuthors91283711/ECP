To explore the equation system, let's try small integer and simple rational values for \( x \) and \( y \). We will test values, compute both sides of the equations, and print those pairs that satisfy the system within a reasonable numerical tolerance.

```python
import math

def close(a, b, tol=1e-9):
    return abs(a - b) < tol

print("Trying small integer and rational values for x and y...")

# We'll try x and y in the range [-5, 5] excluding zero to avoid division by zero
for x_num in range(-5, 6):
    if x_num == 0:
        continue
    for x_den in [1, 2]:
        x = x_num / x_den
        for y_num in range(-5, 6):
            if y_num == 0:
                continue
            for y_den in [1, 2]:
                y = y_num / y_den

                # left side of first equation
                try:
                    lhs1 = 1 / x + 1 / (2*y)
                    lhs2 = 1 / x - 1 / (2*y)
                except ZeroDivisionError:
                    continue

                # right side of equations
                rhs1 = (x**2 + 3 * y**2) * (3 * x**2 + y**2)
                rhs2 = 2 * (y**4 - x**4)

                if close(lhs1, rhs1) and close(lhs2, rhs2):
                    print(f"x={x}, y={y} satisfy the system:")
                    print(f"  1/x + 1/(2y) = {lhs1} ≈ {rhs1}")
                    print(f"  1/x - 1/(2y) = {lhs2} ≈ {rhs2}")
```
