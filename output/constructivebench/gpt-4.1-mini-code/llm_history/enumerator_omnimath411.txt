The problem involves the Fibonacci sequence \( F \) defined by \( F_0=0 \), \( F_1=1 \), and \( F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_n \). We want to count the number of \( n \) in \([0,100]\) such that \( 13 \mid F_n \).

The program below enumerates \( F_n \) for \( n=0 \) to \( 100 \), checks divisibility by 13, immediately prints the indices \( n \) where \( F_n \) is divisible by 13, and finally prints the count of such indices.

```python
# Enumerate all n in [0..100] where Fibonacci(n) is divisible by 13
def fibonacci_mod_13():
    mod = 13
    fib = [0, 1]
    # Precompute Fibonacci numbers up to 100 modulo 13 to avoid large numbers
    for i in range(2, 101):
        fib.append((fib[i-1] + fib[i-2]) % mod)
    count = 0
    for n in range(101):
        if fib[n] == 0:
            print(f"n={n}, F_n divisible by 13")
            count += 1
    print(f"Count of n in [0..100] with 13 | F_n: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    fibonacci_mod_13()
```
