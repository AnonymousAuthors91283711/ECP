The problem sums all positive even numbers less than 233 that are not divisible by 10. To assist in conjecturing the answer, we enumerate the numbers meeting these conditions and print their running sum.

```python
# Enumerate even positive integers less than 233 but not divisible by 10,
# print them and maintain the running total.

def main():
    total = 0
    for n in range(1, 233):
        if n % 2 == 0 and n % 10 != 0:
            print(n)
            total += n
    print("Sum =", total)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
