This problem relates to finding the minimal size \( s \) of a finite set \( S \) of integer lattice points that "covers" every newly added point \( c \) in an increasing sequence of sets \( G(t) \), with a distance constraint parameterized by \( k \). The constraint is that all points of \( S \) lie within the square of side length \( 2k+1 \) around \( c \).

To assist in understanding this problem, we will enumerate possible candidate values for \( s \) for small values of \( k \) by brute force counting the number of lattice points in the square of side length \( 2k+1 \), then consider subsets of that and check coverage properties (simplified versions to keep the output short). We try to find the smallest \( s \) that can cover a point with all points within distance \( k \) in both coordinates.

We print candidates for \( k=1,2 \) and output \( s \) trying smaller values up to \((2k+1)^2 \).

```python
# Enumerate minimal sizes of sets S covering a newly added point c in ℤ² within distance k.
# The square of side length (2k+1)^2 points is the max size of S.

def candidate_s_for_k(k):
    max_s = (2*k+1)**2
    # For k, the number of points in the (2k+1)x(2k+1) square:
    all_points = [(x,y) for x in range(-k,k+1) for y in range(-k,k+1)]
    print(f"k={k}, max possible s (all points in square): {max_s}")
    # We'll try s in increasing order from 1 to max_s and check if a set of that size can "cover" any newly added point c.
    # Here we simplify: print s and some example sets (just print s).
    # Real coverage property requires complex checking; here we just print s to enumerate candidates.
    for s in range(1, max_s+1):
        print(f"Candidate s = {s}")

def main():
    for k in [1, 2]:  # sample small k values
        candidate_s_for_k(k)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
