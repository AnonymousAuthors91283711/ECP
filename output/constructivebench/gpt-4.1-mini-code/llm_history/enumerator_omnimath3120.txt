This problem involves evaluating nested square roots of the form \( \sqrt{13 + \sqrt{7 + \sqrt{4}}} \). To conjecture a possible simplified exact form, the program will enumerate expressions of the form \( \sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b} \) for appropriate integer \(a, b\) that might match the nested radicals.

The program tries integers \(a,b\) in a small range, evaluates \( \sqrt{a} + \sqrt{b} \), squares it, and compares with the nested radical value. Since exact equality is difficult, the code tries to match the squared value to be near the nested expression, and prints out candidates.

```python
import math

# Nested expression evaluated numerically
def nested_value():
    return math.sqrt(13 + math.sqrt(7 + math.sqrt(4)))

target = nested_value()
target_sq = target**2

print(f"Nested value: {target}")
print(f"Nested value squared: {target_sq}")

# Enumerate pairs (a,b) with small integers to check if sqrt(a)+sqrt(b) equals target
# (sqrt(a)+sqrt(b))^2 = a + b + 2*sqrt(a*b), so nested expression should match this

# We'll try integers a,b from 0 to 20
epsilon = 1e-12
for a in range(21):
    for b in range(a, 21):
        # Compute s = sqrt(a)+sqrt(b)
        s = math.sqrt(a) + math.sqrt(b)
        s_sq = s*s
        # Check if s is close to target
        if abs(s - target) < 1e-10:
            print(f"Found exact match: sqrt({a}) + sqrt({b}) = {s} matches nested sqrt")
        # Otherwise check if squared matches target_sq approximately
        # Because (sqrt(a) + sqrt(b))^2 = a + b + 2*sqrt(a*b)
        # We'll try to solve if nested expression squared can be expressed as a+b+2*sqrt(a*b)
        # We check if s_sq close to target_sq
        if abs(s_sq - target_sq) < 1e-10:
            print(f"Close sq: sqrt({a}) + sqrt({b}) squared = {s_sq} approx nested squared")

# Additionally, try to see if nested expression matches sqrt(c) + d for integer c,d or similar patterns
for c in range(21):
    for d in range(21):
        val = math.sqrt(c) + d
        if abs(val - target) < 1e-10:
            print(f"Found sqrt({c}) + {d} = {val} matches nested value")

# Finally print approximate numeric value for reference
print(f"Approx nested value: {target:.12f}")
```
