This problem involves the Lebesgue measure (volume) on the unit square [0,1]×[0,1], restricted to points (a,b) where a + b > 1 and satisfying one of three quadratic inequalities. To understand the shape and estimate its area, we enumerate points (a,b) on a fine grid over [0,1]² and count those satisfying the conditions, then estimate the area as the fraction of points times the unit square area (1).

We print intermediate exact counts and the approximate area whenever a new point matching is found. This enumerates candidates over a mesh grid for visualization and conjecture. We keep a coarse grid due to the token limit.

```python
# Enumerate points (a,b) in [0,1]^2 satisfying:
# a + b > 1 and (a^2 + b^2 < 1 or a^2 + 1 < b^2 or b^2 + 1 < a^2)
# Count such points on a 101x101 grid and print cumulative count and approx area.

N = 100
count = 0
total = (N+1)**2
print("N =", N, "Total points =", total)
for i in range(N+1):
    a = i / N
    for j in range(N+1):
        b = j / N
        if a + b > 1:
            cond = (a**2 + b**2 < 1) or (a**2 + 1 < b**2) or (b**2 + 1 < a**2)
            if cond:
                count += 1
                area_approx = count / total  # since unit square area = 1
                print(f"Count: {count}, Approx area: {area_approx:.5f} at (a,b)=({a:.2f},{b:.2f})")

print("Final count:", count)
print("Final approximate volume:", count / total)
```
