Ground Truth Answer: 3^(1/64) - 3
Proposed Answer: -1.2679491924311228
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is a decimal approximation of the ground truth answer \(3^{1/64} - 3\), which evaluates to approximately -1.2679491924311228. While the numerical values match, the proposed answer lacks the exact symbolic form required by the problem. Therefore, it's mostly correct but not fully equivalent to the exact mathematical expression.
