Ground Truth Answer: 36
Proposed Answer: 9
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a tournament scenario where:
   - There are n players divided into two groups (L and R)
   - The size relationship is 2*L = R
   - Total players n = L + R
   - Total games played is n(n-1)/2 (everyone plays everyone else)
   - The wins are divided between groups with ratio 5:7 (5*wins_L = 7*wins_R)

2. Let's check the proposed answer (9):
   - If n=9, then L+R=9 and 2L=R → L=3, R=6
   - Total games = 9*8/2 = 36
   - Wins ratio 5:7 means wins_L/wins_R = 7/5
   - But wins_L + wins_R = 36 → wins_L = 21, wins_R = 15
   - Check ratio: 5*21 = 105 vs 7*15 = 105 (this checks out)

3. However, the ground truth answer is 36:
   - If n=36, L=12, R=24
   - Total games = 36*35/2 = 630
   - wins_L = 367.5, wins_R = 262.5 (not integers)

The proposed answer (9) actually satisfies all conditions correctly, while the ground truth answer (36) leads to non-integer wins. The proposed answer is correct and the ground truth appears incorrect.
