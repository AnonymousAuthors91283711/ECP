The problem involves finding natural numbers \(n\) such that for every \(m\) coprime to \(n\), there exists a permutation \(\pi\) of \(\{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}\) where \(\pi^2(k) \equiv m k \pmod n\). This is a deep number-theoretic property related to permutation representations modulo \(n\).

To investigate, I will:

- Enumerate small values of \(n\),
- For each \(n\), check all \(m\) with \(\gcd(m,n)=1\),
- For each \(m\), attempt to find a permutation \(\pi\) of \(\{0, \ldots, n-1\}\) such that \(\pi(\pi(k)) \equiv m k \pmod n\) for all \(k\).

Since permutations of size \(n\) can be large, I will focus on verifying the functional condition \(\pi^2(k) = m k \pmod n\) via the order and cycle structure. Importantly, \(\pi^2\) corresponds to the function "multiplication by \(m\)" modulo \(n\).

A key observation: applying \(\pi\) twice corresponds to \(m\) times the identity modulo \(n\). So \(\pi\) is effectively a "square root" of the multiplication-by-\(m\) permutation.

I will:

- For each \(n\), verify existence of such a \(\pi\) for all coprime \(m\),
- Print candidate \(n\) values that satisfy the condition.

This should suggest which \(n\) are in `omnimath3264_answer`.

        res = check_n(n)

            print(f"n={n} satisfies the condition")
