The problem relates to placing \( K \) knights on an infinite integer lattice so they don't attack each other, and finding a queen position attacking none of them but different from all knights. The goal is to find the maximum such \( K \).

I will enumerate small values of \( K \), test configurations of knights and possible queen positions on a small grid (like 7x7), check knight attack constraints and queen attack conditions, then print feasible \( K \) found and sample solutions.

```python
# Enumerate configurations of knights and queen positions for small K,
# find the maximal K allowing a queen position attacking no knight.
# Knights do not attack each other by knight moves.
# Queen position attacks no knight by queen moves and differs from knights.

from itertools import combinations, product

# Knight moves offset (squared distance=5)
knight_moves = [(2,1),(2,-1),(-2,1),(-2,-1),(1,2),(1,-2),(-1,2),(-1,-2)]

def attacks_knight(p, q):
    dx, dy = p[0]-q[0], p[1]-q[1]
    return dx*dx + dy*dy == 5 and (p != q)

def attacks_queen(p, q):
    dx, dy = p[0]-q[0], p[1]-q[1]
    return p[0] == q[0] or p[1] == q[1] or abs(dx) == abs(dy)

def knights_attack_each_other(knights):
    for i in range(len(knights)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(knights)):
            if attacks_knight(knights[i], knights[j]):
                return True
    return False

def queen_attacks_any(queen, knights):
    for k in knights:
        if attacks_queen(queen, k):
            return True
    return False

def queen_is_knight(queen, knights):
    return queen in knights

# Grid range -7..7 to allow knight jumps
GRID = list(range(-3,4))

# Enumerate all sets of K knight positions on GRID
# For efficiency, print results only for K=1..5 and stop early if no configs found.
maxK_found = 0
for K in range(1,8):
    found_config = False
    knight_positions = list(combinations(product(GRID, GRID), K))
    # Limit number of combinations to keep output short
    knight_positions = knight_positions[:1000]  # limit
    for knights in knight_positions:
        if knights_attack_each_other(knights):
            continue
        # Try all queen positions on GRID (not in knights)
        for q in product(GRID, GRID):
            if queen_is_knight(q, knights):
                continue
            if queen_attacks_any(q, knights):
                continue
            # Found a solution for this K
            print(f"K={K}, knights={knights}, queen={q}")
            found_config = True
            break
        if found_config:
            break
    if found_config:
        maxK_found = K
    else:
        print(f"No solution found for K={K}, stop search")
        break
print(f"Maximal K found = {maxK_found}")
```
