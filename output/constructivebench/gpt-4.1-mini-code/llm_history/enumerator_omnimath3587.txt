The problem is about graphs with a fixed number of edges (2022), vertices having degrees all at least 3 and degrees differing by at most 1, and edge-colorings with k colors that yield monochromatic paths connecting any two vertices. The goal is to find the greatest such k.

To assist in conjecturing the answer, we enumerate graphs with a small number of edges (e.g. up to 10) and try various k values, printing results about possible k and colorings.

We will:
- Pick small edge counts (e.g. 4, 5,... 10) and try k = 1, 2, 3.
- Enumerate simple graphs where degrees differ by at most 1 and are at least 3.
- For found graphs, try edge colorings with k colors and print if the monochromatic path connectivity holds.
  
We print each k, edges, and result to assist in understanding the problem. We keep output short and simple due to problem complexity.

        degs[v] += 1
    min_deg = min(degs)
    max_deg = max(degs)
    return min_deg >= 3 and max_deg - min_deg <= 1
