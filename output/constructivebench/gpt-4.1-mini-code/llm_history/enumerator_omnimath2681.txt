This problem asks for the greatest natural number n > 0 such that n^200 < 3^500.

We want to find the maximal n in ℕ with n^200 < 3^500, or equivalently n < (3^500)^(1/200) = 3^{500/200} = 3^{2.5} = 3^{5/2}.

Since 3^{2.5} = 3^{2} * 3^{0.5} = 9 * sqrt(3) ≈ 9 * 1.732 = 15.588..., the greatest n satisfying the inequality is the greatest integer less than 15.588..., i.e. 15.

We can confirm by enumerating n from 1 to 20, computing n^200 and 3^500 (both large, but Python int can handle), and checking inequality.

The code will compute these powers efficiently, print the n satisfying n^200 < 3^500, and then print the maximum.

We prioritize exact values by using integers directly.

```python
# Enumerate n > 0 with n^200 < 3^500 and find maximum

def main():
    boundary = 3**500
    max_n = 0
    print(f"3^500 = {boundary}")
    for n in range(1, 21):
        val = n**200
        if val < boundary:
            print(f"{n}^200 = {val} < 3^500")
            max_n = n
    print(f"Maximum n with n^200 < 3^500 is {max_n}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
