open Real

abbrev olympiadbench2375_answer : Set ℝ := sorry
theorem olympiadbench2375 (x : ℝ) :
    3^(x - 1) * 9^(3 / (2 * x^2)) = (27 : ℝ) ↔ x ∈ olympiadbench2375_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Checking rational candidates:
Root found: x = 1
Root found (approx): x ≈ -0.791287847478
Root found (approx): x ≈ 3.791287847478
All roots found (exact or approximate):
x = -0.791287847478
x = 1
x = 3.791287847478. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
<<<{1, (3 - Real.log 3 / Real.log (27)) , (3 + Real.log 3 / Real.log (27))}>>>
