The problem searches for 5 distinct integers (V, U, Q, A, R) from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} satisfying a complex equation involving powers and sums with division. We will enumerate all 5! = 120 permutations of {1,2,3,4,5} to find all candidates. For each tuple, we check if

((V + U + Q + A + R)^2) / (V - U - Q + A + R) == V^(U^(Q^(A^R)))

and print those that satisfy the equation exactly.

We must be careful about division by zero, integer division vs float division, and large exponentials. Use integer arithmetic whenever possible, and skip invalid cases.

```python
from itertools import permutations

S = {1,2,3,4,5}

def power_tower(v,u,q,a,r):
    # Compute v^{u^{q^{a^r}}} carefully using pow with three arguments to avoid overflow if needed
    # But here exponents are small, so normal pow is okay.
    return pow(v, pow(u, pow(q, pow(a, r))))

for tup in permutations(S):
    V,U,Q,A,R = tup
    sum_val = V+U+Q+A+R
    denom = V - U - Q + A + R
    if denom == 0:
        continue
    numerator = sum_val*sum_val
    if numerator % denom != 0:
        continue
    left = numerator // denom
    try:
        right = power_tower(V,U,Q,A,R)
    except OverflowError:
        continue
    if left == right:
        print(f"Found solution: V={V}, U={U}, Q={Q}, A={A}, R={R}")
```
