The problem involves a functional equation with parameters \(A, C, x > 0\) and a radical equality. We want to explore possible \(x\) values that satisfy 

\[
\sqrt{2 + A C + 2 C x} + \sqrt{A C - 2 + 2 A x} = \sqrt{2 (A + C) x + 2 A C}.
\]

We will enumerate for small positive integer values of \(A, C\) and positive rational \(x\) to identify solutions and identify a potential pattern or formula for the solution \(x\).

```python
import math

def lhs(A, C, x):
    # Compute left-hand side of the equation
    val1 = 2 + A * C + 2 * C * x
    val2 = A * C - 2 + 2 * A * x
    if val1 < 0 or val2 < 0:
        return None
    return math.sqrt(val1) + math.sqrt(val2)

def rhs(A, C, x):
    # Compute right-hand side of the equation
    val = 2 * (A + C) * x + 2 * A * C
    if val < 0:
        return None
    return math.sqrt(val)

# We'll test for A, C in 1..5, and for x rational from 0.1 to 5 in steps of 0.1
print("Enumerating solutions for sqrt(2 + A*C + 2*C*x) + sqrt(A*C - 2 + 2*A*x) = sqrt(2*(A+C)*x + 2*A*C):")
eps = 1e-10
for A in range(1, 6):
    for C in range(1, 6):
        # To avoid domain errors, check A*C - 2 must be >=0 to allow sqrt argument non-negative for some x>=0
        # But since 0 < A, C, try and see if any solution arises anyway
        found = False
        for xi_times_10 in range(1, 51):  # x from 0.1 to 5.0
            x = xi_times_10 / 10
            l = lhs(A, C, x)
            r = rhs(A, C, x)
            if l is None or r is None:
                continue
            diff = abs(l - r)
            if diff < eps:
                print(f"A={A}, C={C}, x={x} satisfies equation; LHS={l:.12f}, RHS={r:.12f}")
                found = True
        if found:
            # After enumerating x, try to compute a candidate value for x = ?
            # Numerically solve for x assuming equality squared is easier
            # Compute candidate x formula based on guess (optional)
            pass
```
