The problem is to find coprime positive integers \(a, b\) such that \(b - a = 15\), \(\frac{5}{9} < \frac{a}{b} < \frac{4}{7}\), and output the fraction \(\frac{a}{b}\) that satisfies these. I will enumerate all positive integer pairs \((a,b)\), check gcd, difference, and bounds, then print each valid fraction as a `Fraction` to keep exact form.

```python
from math import gcd
from fractions import Fraction

print("Enumerating pairs (a,b) with b - a = 15 and 5/9 < a/b < 4/7, gcd(a,b) = 1:")

# Convert bounds to Fractions for exact comparison
lower = Fraction(5,9)
upper = Fraction(4,7)

# Since b - a = 15, b = a + 15
# a, b positive integers, so a >= 1
# For fractions a/b to be > 5/9 and < 4/7, roughly 0.555.. < a/(a+15) < 0.5714..
# Let's try a from 1 up to 100 to find all such fractions

candidates = []
for a in range(1, 101):
    b = a + 15
    if gcd(a,b) != 1:
        continue
    frac = Fraction(a,b)
    if lower < frac < upper:
        print(f"a={a}, b={b}, fraction={frac}")
        candidates.append(frac)

if candidates:
    # minimum fraction among candidates by numerator/denominator order is the unique answer if unique
    ans = candidates[0]
    print("Answer fraction:", ans)
else:
    print("No fraction found matching all conditions.")
```
