The problem involves finding positive integers n up to 1000 where the difference between cozy_jumps(n) and dash_jumps(n) equals 19. 
We'll enumerate n in [1..1000], compute the difference, print all such n, sum them, and print the digit sum of that sum.

```python
def cozy_jumps(steps):
    return steps // 2 if steps % 2 == 0 else steps // 2 + 1

def dash_jumps(steps):
    return steps // 5 if steps % 5 == 0 else steps // 5 + 1

def digit_sum(x):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(x))

def main():
    candidates = []
    for n in range(1, 1001):
        diff = cozy_jumps(n) - dash_jumps(n)
        if diff == 19:
            print(f"n={n}, cozy_jumps(n)={cozy_jumps(n)}, dash_jumps(n)={dash_jumps(n)}, diff=19")
            candidates.append(n)
    s = sum(candidates)
    print("Sum =", s)
    print("Digit sum of sum =", digit_sum(s))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
