The problem looks like solving for a rational number \( x \) such that:

\[
\frac{3}{4} + \frac{4}{x} = 1.
\]

We want to find rational solutions \( x \) to this equation. Rearranging:

\[
\frac{4}{x} = 1 - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{4}, \quad \Longrightarrow \quad x = \frac{4}{1/4} = 16.
\]

Since the problem comes from the Lean/Mathlib context with rational numbers, let's write a Python program to enumerate all rational \( x = p/q \) (in reduced form) with small denominators \( q \) and numerators \( p \) and check if they satisfy the equation exactly (within rational arithmetic). We'll enumerate small denominators and numerators in a small range and print all \( x \) that satisfy the equation exactly.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Enumerate rational numbers x = p/q with small |p|, |q|
# and check if 3/4 + 4/x == 1 holds exactly

target = Fraction(1,1)
fixed = Fraction(3,4)

max_den = 10
max_num = 20  # numerators up to 20 in absolute value

found = []

print("Enumerating rational x = p/q with |p| <= 20, 1 <= q <=10, satisfying 3/4 + 4/x = 1")

for q in range(1, max_den+1):
    for p in range(-max_num, max_num+1):
        if p == 0:
            continue  # division by zero forbidden
        x = Fraction(p, q)
        val = fixed + Fraction(4,1)/x  # 3/4 + 4/x
        if val == target:
            print(f"x = {x} satisfies 3/4 + 4/x = 1")
            found.append(x)

# Print minimal (numerically smallest positive) solution among found
positive_solutions = [x for x in found if x > 0]
if positive_solutions:
    minimum = min(positive_solutions)
    print(f"Minimum positive solution found: x = {minimum}")
else:
    print("No positive solution found in range.")
```
