The problem relates to integer triples (x,y,z) satisfying the cubic Diophantine equation:
10x³ + 20y³ + 2006xyz = 2007z³,
and we want to analyze the set of sums s = x + y + z for which solutions exist.

To assist in conjecturing the maximum or possible sums, we'll enumerate integer triples (x,y,z) with small absolute values (e.g. -10 to 10), check the equation exactly, and print any valid sums s = x+y+z found. This may help identify any pattern or maximum sum. We print solutions immediately when found and include the parameters' range.

```python
# Enumerate (x,y,z) in range -10 to 10 satisfying
# 10*x^3 + 20*y^3 + 2006*x*y*z == 2007*z^3
# Print each found sum s = x + y + z

def cube(n):
    return n*n*n

def main():
    R = 10
    print(f"Enumerating integer triples x,y,z in [{-R},{R}]")
    found_sums = set()
    for z in range(-R, R+1):
        if z == 0:
            # avoid division by zero issues or meaningless cases
            continue
        cz3 = 2007 * cube(z)
        for x in range(-R, R+1):
            x3 = cube(x)
            for y in range(-R, R+1):
                lhs = 10*x3 + 20*cube(y) + 2006*x*y*z
                if lhs == cz3:
                    s = x + y + z
                    if s not in found_sums:
                        found_sums.add(s)
                        print(f"Found solution: x={x}, y={y}, z={z}, sum={s}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
