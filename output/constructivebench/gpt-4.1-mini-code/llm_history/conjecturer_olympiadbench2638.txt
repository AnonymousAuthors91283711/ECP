theorem olympiadbench2638 :
  ∃! Y, Y < 10 ∧ (∀ X, X < 10 → ¬ (11 ∣ 1230000 + X * 1000 + 5 * 100 + Y * 10 + 7)) ∧ Y = olympiadbench2638_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Checking Y in 0..9 for condition:
Y=0: divisible by 11 when X=3, val=1233507
Y=1: divisible by 11 when X=2, val=1232517
Y=2: divisible by 11 when X=1, val=1231527
Y=3: divisible by 11 when X=0, val=1230537
Y=4: no X in 0..9 yields divisible by 11 -> candidate
Y=5: divisible by 11 when X=9, val=1239557
Y=6: divisible by 11 when X=8, val=1238567
Y=7: divisible by 11 when X=7, val=1237577
Y=8: divisible by 11 when X=6, val=1236587
Y=9: divisible by 11 when X=5, val=1235597

Candidates Y that satisfy condition (unique?): [4]
Unique answer: 4. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
