Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {x | x = 10^5 ∨ x = -10^5 ∨ 
        (x^2 = 10^10 ∧ (x = 1 ∨ x = -1))}
Let me analyze the proposed answer and the problem:

1. The problem is to find the solution set for the equation:
   x⁴ - (2·10¹⁰ + 1)x² - x + 10²⁰ + 10¹⁰ - 1 = 0

2. The proposed answer suggests solutions:
   x = ±10⁵ or (x² = 10¹⁰ and x = ±1)

3. Let's test x = 10⁵:
   (10⁵)⁴ - (2·10¹⁰ + 1)(10⁵)² - 10⁵ + 10²⁰ + 10¹⁰ - 1
   = 10²⁰ - (2·10¹⁰ + 1)(10¹⁰) - 10⁵ + 10²⁰ + 10¹⁰ - 1
   = 10²⁰ - 2·10²⁰ - 10¹⁰ - 10⁵ + 10²⁰ + 10¹⁰ - 1
   = -10⁵ - 1 ≠ 0 → Doesn't satisfy the equation

4. For x = 1 (with x² = 10¹⁰):
   This is impossible since 1² ≠ 10¹⁰

The proposed answer contains incorrect solutions and misses the actual roots of the quartic equation. The roots would be more complex than this simple proposal.
