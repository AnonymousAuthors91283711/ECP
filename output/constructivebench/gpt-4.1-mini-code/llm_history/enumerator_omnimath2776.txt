The equation is: 2^11 * 6^5 = 4^x * 3^y, with x, y positive integers. Since 6 = 2 * 3 and 4 = 2^2, we rewrite both sides factoring primes:

Left:
2^11 * 6^5 = 2^11 * (2^1 * 3^1)^5 = 2^11 * 2^5 * 3^5 = 2^(11+5) * 3^5 = 2^16 * 3^5

Right:
4^x * 3^y = (2^2)^x * 3^y = 2^(2x) * 3^y

Equating powers of 2 and 3, we get:
2x = 16 → x = 8
y = 5

Sum: x + y = 13

This is unique since prime factorization is unique. Let's write code to confirm this and print all positive integer solutions (x, y) that satisfy the equation, then print the sum.

```python
# Enumerate positive integers x, y such that 2^11 * 6^5 = 4^x * 3^y and print x, y, and their sum

def prime_powers():
    # Compute left side prime powers
    # 2^11 * 6^5 = 2^(11) * (2*3)^5 = 2^(11+5) * 3^5 = 2^16 * 3^5
    left_2 = 16
    left_3 = 5
    
    solutions = []
    # x must be positive and satisfy 2x = left_2 → x=8
    # y = left_3
    x = left_2 // 2
    y = left_3
    if 2*x == left_2 and y == left_3 and x > 0 and y > 0:
        print(f"x={x}, y={y}, sum={x + y}")
        solutions.append((x, y))

    # Since powers must match exactly, no other positive integer solutions exist
    # But to follow the requirement, brute force small samples (1 to left_2//2 +1)
    # to confirm no others
    for x_candidate in range(1, left_2+1):
        if 2*x_candidate == left_2:
            y_candidate = left_3
            if y_candidate > 0:
                print(f"x={x_candidate}, y={y_candidate}, sum={x_candidate + y_candidate}")

    # Print the value of omnimath2776_answer as the sum of x and y
    print(f"Answer (x + y) = {x + y}")
