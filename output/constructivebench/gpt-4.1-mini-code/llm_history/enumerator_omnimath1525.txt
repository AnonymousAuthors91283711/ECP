The problem involves summing terms: âˆ‘_{k=0}^n choose(n-k, k) * 2^k. We want to explore values of this sum for various n and conjecture the closed form (omnimath1525_answer).

```python
from math import comb

def omnimath1525_sum(n):
    # Compute sum_{k=0}^n choose(n-k, k)*2^k
    total = 0
    for k in range(n+1):
        c = comb(n - k, k)
        total += c * (2 ** k)
    return total

print("n", "sum", sep='\t')
for n in range(21):
    s = omnimath1525_sum(n)
    print(n, s, sep='\t')

# Try to guess a pattern in printed sums
# For example: 1,1,2,3,5,8,... looks like Fibonacci numbers starting offset?
# Additional check:
# Print sums alongside Fibonacci numbers for comparison
fib = [0,1]
for i in range(2, 25):
    fib.append(fib[-1] + fib[-2])
print("\nn", "sum", "fib(n+1)", sep='\t')
for n in range(21):
    s = omnimath1525_sum(n)
    print(n, s, fib[n+1], s==fib[n+1])
```
