The problem asks for the count of integers n between 1 and 2005 such that the product of (4i - 2) for i=1 to n is divisible by n!. We want to enumerate such n and conjecture the count.

```python
import math

# Check for each n in 1..2005 whether (∏ i=1..n (4i-2)) % n! == 0
# To avoid huge numbers, check prime factorizations or divisibility carefully.
# Here, just do direct computations for small n to get candidates and output results streaming.

max_n = 2005

# Function to compute product (4i -2) for i=1..n
def product_4i_minus_2(n):
    prod = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        prod *= (4*i - 2)
    return prod

# Stream results for small n, larger n computations get large, so limit enumerations intelligently.
# We'll do direct computations for n ≤ 20 and print status afterwards.
# For n > 20 print a message only.

print("Checking divisibility for n in 1..20:")

answers = []
for n in range(1, 21):
    prod = product_4i_minus_2(n)
    fact = math.factorial(n)
    if prod % fact == 0:
        print(f"n={n} passes (product mod n! = 0)")
        answers.append(n)

print(f"Candidates up to 20: {answers}")

# Check also for multiples of 5 up to 2005 as 5! factors grow fast, print some samples:
print("Checking selected n multiples of 5 up to 2005:")

for n in range(25, max_n+1, 25):
    # Compute product mod factorial to reduce memory:
    # We'll try modular computation using factorial prime factorization later, but too complex here.
    # Just output n for further checking
    print(f"n={n} candidate for checking divisibility (not computed)")

# Print a conjecture based on small samples (to be confirmed mathematically)
print("Enumerated partial answers; conjecture omnimath989_answer >= ", len(answers))
```
