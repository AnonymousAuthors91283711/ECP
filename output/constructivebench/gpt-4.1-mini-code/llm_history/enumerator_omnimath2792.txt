This problem seems to be about evaluating the expression \(2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1\) and examining potential values it can take for different parameters or bases, if any. We'll enumerate values of \(2^k\) for k in [1..3] and sum them, then print the exact sum.

```python
# Enumerate the sum of 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 explicitly

def main():
    # Powers to sum
    powers = [3, 2, 1]
    total = 0
    for p in powers:
        val = 2**p
        print(f"2^{p} = {val}")
        total += val
    print(f"Sum = {total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
