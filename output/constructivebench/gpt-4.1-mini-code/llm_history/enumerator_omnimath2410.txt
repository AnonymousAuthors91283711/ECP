The problem is about a trigonometric identity involving angles A, B, C of a triangle and side lengths AB, AC, BC with given ratio conditions relating sines and sides. The goal is to find the value of the expression 
\[
\frac{\sin^2 B + \sin^2 C - \sin^2 A}{\sin B \sin C}.
\]

We will pick sample triples \((A,B,C)\) summing to \(\pi\), compute sines and the expression, checking the given conditions to confirm parameters, and then print the results to conjecture the formula.

```python
import math

# Enumerate sample triangle angles (in radians) and corresponding sides respecting the constraints.
# Conditions:
# (sin B) / (sin C) = AC / AB
# (sin C) / (sin B) = AB / AC
# sin A / (sin B * sin C) = BC / (AC * AB)
# The second condition implies AB/AC = sin C / sin B, so it's reciprocal to the first.

# Thus from the first two,
# AC/AB = sin B/sin C
# AB/AC = sin C/sin B
# Both hold true only if (AC/AB) * (AB/AC) = 1, which is trivial.

# We parametrize triangle sides by the Law of Sines:
# AB / sin C = AC / sin B = BC / sin A = 2R (circumradius)
# So we choose AC = sin B, AB = sin C, then AC/AB = sin B/sin C, matches.
# Then BC = sin A.
# Check third condition:
# sin A / (sin B * sin C) = BC / (AC * AB) = sin A / (sin B * sin C) – always true.

# So the system constraints hold for any triangle. So we just explore expressions for various angles.

# Compute the expression for sample angles:
def expr(A, B, C):
    sB, sC, sA = math.sin(B), math.sin(C), math.sin(A)
    numerator = sB ** 2 + sC ** 2 - sA ** 2
    denominator = sB * sC
    return numerator / denominator

# Enumerate some triangles where A + B + C = pi
# We'll let A vary, then B vary, then C = pi - A - B
for A_deg in range(10, 80, 10):
    for B_deg in range(10, 180 - A_deg - 10, 10):
        C_deg = 180 - A_deg - B_deg
        if C_deg <= 0:
            continue
        A, B, C = map(math.radians, (A_deg, B_deg, C_deg))
        val = expr(A, B, C)
        print(f"A={A_deg}°, B={B_deg}°, C={C_deg}° -> value = {val:.6f}")
        
# From these we will conjecture the value or its form.
