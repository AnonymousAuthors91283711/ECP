. Enumerated answers: Checking integer c in [-50,50]:
c=-39 works with a=20, b=0, d=-1
c=-13 works with a=20, b=0, d=-3
c=-3 works with a=20, b=0, d=-13
c=-1 works with a=20, b=0, d=-39
c=1 works with a=20, b=0, d=39
c=3 works with a=20, b=0, d=13
c=13 works with a=20, b=0, d=3
c=39 works with a=20, b=0, d=1
Maximum c is 39. Expected Answer Type: ℤ
<<<39>>>
