noncomputable abbrev omnimath1366_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath1366 : 
  ∃! x : ℝ, 0 < x ∧ cos (arctan x) = x ∧ x^2 = omnimath1366_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing x in (0,2] for cos(arctan x) ≈ x, printing x^2:
No exact match found within step and eps.

Checking x^2 + x^4 near 1 for x in [0.7,0.8]:
x=0.7861500, x^2+x^4=0.99999516. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<(0.7861500 : ℝ)^2>>>
