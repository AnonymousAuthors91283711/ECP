The problem suggests finding a positive real number \( d \) such that

\[
\frac{\frac{d}{2}}{17} + \frac{\frac{d}{2}}{5} = \frac{44}{60}
\]

and rounding \(\frac{d}{2}\) to one decimal place matches the answer. The code below enumerates possible \( d/2 \) values with a fine step, calculates the left side, and checks when it equals the desired time 44/60 exactly or closely. It prints the exact and approximate values found, then deduces the rounded value to fulfill the final part (rounded value).

```python
# Enumerate candidates for d/2 and check equality condition
target = 44 / 60  # target sum of times
eps = 1e-9        # tolerance for floating comparisons

print(f"Target value (44/60): {target}")

# We'll try d_half values starting from a small positive number to a reasonable upper bound
# step is small for accuracy
step = 0.01
max_d_half = 20  # arbitrary upper bound

found_candidates = []

d_half = step
while d_half <= max_d_half:
    t1 = d_half / 17
    t2 = d_half / 5
    s = t1 + t2
    if abs(s - target) < eps:
        # Candidate found, d = 2 * d_half
        d = 2 * d_half
        rounded_half = round(d_half * 10) / 10
        print(f"d = {d:.10f}, sum = {s:.10f}, rounded (d/2) = {rounded_half}")
        found_candidates.append(rounded_half)
    d_half += step

if found_candidates:
    # minimal rounded value candidate
    answer = min(found_candidates)
    print(f"Minimal rounded (d/2) value consistent with constraints: {answer}")
else:
    print("No exact solution found within stepsize.")
```
