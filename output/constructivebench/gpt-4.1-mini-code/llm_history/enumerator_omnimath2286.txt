The problem involves summing over pairs \((x,y)\) where \(x,y \in \{1,\ldots,6\}\) (from Fin 6 with `x+1` and `y+1`), counting the number of pairs with \(x+1 + y+1 \geq 10\), then dividing by 36. The problem resembles finding the probability that the sum of two dice rolls is at least 10.

The Python program below enumerates all pairs \((x,y)\), calculates the sum \(x+y\), counts how many satisfy \(x+y \geq 10\), and prints each candidate pair and the running total. At the end, it prints the fraction as a reduced fraction and decimal.

```python
from math import gcd

def reduced_fraction(numer, denom):
    g = gcd(numer, denom)
    return numer // g, denom // g

def main():
    count = 0
    total = 6 * 6
    print("Enumerating pairs (x,y) in {1,...,6}^2 with x+y >= 10:")
    for x in range(1, 7):
        for y in range(1, 7):
            s = x + y
            if s >= 10:
                count += 1
                print(f"x={x}, y={y}, sum={s} >=10, count={count}")
    numer, denom = reduced_fraction(count, total)
    print(f"Count = {count}, Total = {total}")
    print(f"Reduced fraction = {numer}/{denom}")
    print(f"Decimal approximation = {count/total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
