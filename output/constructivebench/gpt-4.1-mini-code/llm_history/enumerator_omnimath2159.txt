The problem involves graph coloring on a 9-vertex cycle with adjacency defined by neighbors and their ±1 relations modulo 9, and additional triangle constraints based on residues modulo 3. We want to find the minimum number \( m \) of colors needed for a coloring that satisfies these conditions, and count how many such colorings exist for that \( m \).

I will write a Python program to:
- Set \( V = \{0, \dots, 8\} \).
- Define adjacency based on ±1 modulo 9.
- Define triangles as 3-element subsets of \( V \) where all differences mod 3 are equal.
- Enumerate colorings for small \( k \) (start from 3 upwards).
- For each \( k \), find all colorings \( c: V \to \{0,\dots,k-1\} \) that:
  - Different colors on adjacent vertices.
  - Injective on each triangle (all 3 vertices distinct colors).
- Output values for the minimum \( k \) that works and count colorings \( n \).
- Print the product \( m \times n \).

We limit \( k \) to small values (e.g., 3 to 5) due to the computational size. The code prints each found coloring count during checking and finally prints \( m, n, m \times n \).

```python
from itertools import product, combinations

V = list(range(9))

def adj(u,v):
    return (u== (v+1)%9) or (v== (u+1)%9)

# Triangles: 3-subsets of V with all pairwise (v-w)%3 equal
def is_triangle(tri):
    vs = sorted(tri)
    mods = [(vs[i]-vs[j])%3 for i in range(3) for j in range(i+1,3)]
    # all differences mod 3 must be equal mod 3 (including reverse)
    return len(set(mods))==1

triangles = [set(t) for t in combinations(V,3) if is_triangle(t)]

def valid_coloring(k):
    count = 0
    for c in product(range(k), repeat=9):
        # check adjacency constraint
        if any(c[u]==c[v] for u,v in combinations(V,2) if adj(u,v)):
            continue
        # check injection on each triangle (all distinct colors)
        if any(len({c[v] for v in tri})<3 for tri in triangles):
            continue
        count += 1
        print(f"Found coloring count +1 for k={k}, total={count}")
    return count

def main():
    for k in range(3,6):
        print(f"Checking colorings for k={k}")
        n = valid_coloring(k)
        if n>0:
            print(f"Minimum k with valid coloring: m={k}")
            print(f"Number of valid colorings n={n}")
            print(f"Product m*n={k*n}")
            break

if __name__=="__main__":
    main()
```
