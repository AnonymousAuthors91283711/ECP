The problem relates to real numbers \(a, b > 0\) with floor equalities involving expressions \(20 - a\), \(19 - b\), and \(a \cdot b\). We want to investigate values of \(a+b\) satisfying:

\[
\lfloor 20 - a \rfloor = \lfloor 19 - b \rfloor = \lfloor a b \rfloor
\]

We enumerate candidates for the floor value \(k = \lfloor 20 - a \rfloor\) and try to find corresponding \(a, b\) that satisfy the relations and print possible \(a + b\) values, to conjecture the supremum (least upper bound) of such sums.

```python
# Enumerate possible floor values k = floor(20 - a) = floor(19 - b) = floor(a*b)
# For k in a reasonable range, find intervals for a and b and check the product condition.

from math import floor, ceil

def approx_eq(x, y, eps=1e-9):
    return abs(x - y) < eps

print("Enumerating candidate sums a+b for given floor values k")

# Since 20 - a > k ≥ 20 - a -1, a in (20 - k -1, 20 - k]
# Similarly for b: 19 - b in [k, k+1), so b in (19 - k -1, 19 - k]

for k in range(10, 21):  # plausible floor values (observations from the problem)
    a_low = 20 - (k + 1)
    a_high = 20 - k
    b_low = 19 - (k + 1)
    b_high = 19 - k

    # a,b > 0 restrict intervals further
    if a_high <= 0 or b_high <= 0:
        continue
    a_low = max(a_low, 0)
    b_low = max(b_low, 0)

    results = set()

    # Sample within intervals (step small enough for precision)
    step = 0.01
    a = a_low + 0.001
    while a < a_high:
        # For given a, compute possible b from floor(ab) = k
        # ab in [k, k+1), so b in [k/a, (k+1)/a)

        b_floor_low = k / a
        b_floor_high = (k + 1) / a

        # Intersect with b interval
        low_b = max(b_low, b_floor_low)
        high_b = min(b_high, b_floor_high)

        if low_b < high_b:
            # a+b candidates in [a+low_b, a+high_b]
            # To print exact values, just print a+low_b and a+high_b approximations
            # or simply print a + low_b as a candidate (corresponds to b near low_b)
            sum_candidate = a + low_b
            # check floor(20 - a) == k and floor(19 - b) == k and floor(a*b) == k to verify
            if floor(20 - a) == k and floor(19 - low_b) == k and floor(a * low_b) == k:
                # Round sum_candidate nicely
                s = round(sum_candidate, 5)
                if s not in results:
                    print(f"For k={k}: a={a:.3f}, b={low_b:.3f}, a+b={s}")
                    results.add(s)
        a += step

# The orignal problem asks for IsLUB (least upper bound) of all such sums.
# By numeric exploration, we might conjecture the supremum.
print("\nConjectured supremum (largest observed a+b):")
print(f"Max a+b ≈ {max(results) if results else 'No results found'}")
