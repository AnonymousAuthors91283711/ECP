Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: ([1, 3, 2, -1, -3, -2] : List ℤ).get! ((2008 - 1) % 6)
<<<None>>>
Since the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's not provided), I cannot determine whether the proposed answer is equivalent to it. The proposed answer suggests a repeating pattern of 6 values, which might be correct based on the recurrence relation, but without knowing the actual ground truth answer, I can't confirm equivalence.
