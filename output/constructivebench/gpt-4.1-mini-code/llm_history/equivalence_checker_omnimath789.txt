Ground Truth Answer: 12
Proposed Answer: 120
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number n such that there exist natural numbers c and v where:
   - c + v = n
   - 2 * c * v * (c² + v²) = 4800

2. The ground truth answer is 12, which comes from:
   - c = 4 and v = 8 (or vice versa)
   - 4 + 8 = 12
   - 2*4*8*(16+64) = 64*80 = 5120 ≠ 4800 (Wait, this doesn't work)
   - Actually, c=5 and v=5 gives:
     - 5+5=10
     - 2*5*5*(25+25)=10*25*50=12500 (too big)
   - c=3 and v=9:
     - 3+9=12
     - 2*3*9*(9+81)=54*90=4860 (close but not 4800)
   - c=6 and v=6:
     - 6+6=12
     - 2*6*6*(36+36)=72*72=5184 (too big)

3. The proposed answer is 120, which seems too large as we can find smaller candidates.

4. After checking, the correct minimal solution is actually with c=4 and v=6:
   - 4+6=10
   - 2*4*6*(16+36)=48*52=2496 (still not 4800)
   
It appears neither answer satisfies the equation exactly, but 12 is closer to potential solutions than 120. The ground truth answer seems incorrect, but the proposed answer is definitely worse.
