The problem asks for the least natural number \( n \) such that we can find \( n \) rational-coefficient polynomials \( f_i \) satisfying the identity \( x^2 + 7 = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (f_i(x))^2 \) for all rational \( x \).

We want to enumerate possible values of \( n \) by trying to represent \( x^2 + 7 \) as a sum of \( n \) squared polynomials with rational coefficients. We will try \( n = 1, 2, 3, 4 \) with polynomials of degree up to 1 or 2 (since \( x^2+7 \) is degree 2). For each \( n \), we attempt to find polynomial tuples \(f_i\) with unknown coefficients to match the identity.

We should output every candidate \( n \) for which a representation is found, along with an example set \( f_i \). This helps conjecture the least \( n \).

```python
# Enumerate possible minimal n for representing x^2+7 as sum of squares of n rational polynomials
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Poly, Rational

x = symbols('x')

# Attempt to represent x^2 + 7 = sum (f_i(x))^2 for i in range n
# We restrict f_i to degree at most 1 for efficiency: f_i(x) = a_i x + b_i

# We'll try n from 1 up to 4
max_n = 4

target_poly = x**2 + 7

def try_n(n):
    # construct variables for coefficients: a_0, b_0, ..., a_{n-1}, b_{n-1}
    coeff_vars = []
    for i in range(n):
        coeff_vars.append(symbols(f'a{i} b{i}'))
    # sum of squares
    sum_squares = 0
    for (a_i, b_i) in coeff_vars:
        poly_i = a_i * x + b_i
        sum_squares += poly_i**2
    # equation to match target polynomial
    eq_poly = Poly(sum_squares - target_poly, x)
    # gather coefficients for x^2, x, and constant term
    coefs = eq_poly.all_coeffs()
    # coefs are ordered highest degree first: [coeff_x^2, coeff_x^1, coeff_const]
    eqs = [Eq(c, 0) for c in coefs]
    # Solve for all coeff vars
    sol = solve(eqs, sum(coeff_vars, ()), dict=True, rational=True)
    if sol:
        # Found one or more solutions
        for s in sol:
            # Print the solution nicely:
            polys = []
            for i in range(n):
                a_i = s.get(coeff_vars[i][0], 0)
                b_i = s.get(coeff_vars[i][1], 0)
                polys.append(f"({a_i})*x + ({b_i})")
            print(f"Representation for n={n}: sum of squares of polynomials {polys} equals x^2+7")
    else:
        print(f"No representation found for n={n}")

print("Trying representations for x^2+7 as sum of squares of n linear polynomials:")
for n in range(1, max_n+1):
    try_n(n)
