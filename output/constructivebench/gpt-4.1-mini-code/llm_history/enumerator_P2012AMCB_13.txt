The problem involves counting quadruples \(\omega = (a,b,c,d)\) with each coordinate in \(\{0,\ldots,5\}\) such that there exists an \(x\) satisfying 
\[x^2 + a x + b = x^2 + c x + d,\]
where the right side uses nested indexing but reduces to linear polynomial equality. Simplifying, this means finding all \(\omega = (a,b,c,d)\) with \(a,b,c,d \in \{0,\ldots,5\}\) such that there exists \(x\) with 
\[a x + b = c x + d.\]

We search for quadruples where the linear polynomials agree for some \(x \in \mathbb{Z}\) (or more generally), i.e., 
\[(a-c) x = d - b.\]

We enumerate the 6^4 = 1296 quadruples, checking if there's some integer \(x\) satisfying the above equation. When \(a=c\), the equation reduces to \(b=d\) for all \(x\), so any \(x\) works if \(b=d\), else no solution. When \(a \neq c\), solution exists if \(d - b\) is divisible by \(a - c\).

We print all found quadruples \(\omega\), count them, and output the fraction count/1296 as the answer.

```python
# Enumerate all omega = (a,b,c,d) with a,b,c,d in 0..5
# Condition: exists x integer with (a - c)*x = d - b
# If a == c: solution if and only if b == d (all x)
# Else: solution if (d - b) divisible by (a - c)

def has_solution(a,b,c,d):
    if a == c:
        return b == d
    diff = a - c
    diff_bd = d - b
    # Avoid division issues: check divisibility
    return diff_bd % diff == 0

def main():
    total = 6**4
    count = 0
    for a in range(6):
        for b in range(6):
            for c in range(6):
                for d in range(6):
                    if has_solution(a,b,c,d):
                        count += 1
                        print(f"omega=({a},{b},{c},{d}) has solution")
    print(f"Total valid quadruples: {count} / {total}")
    print(f"Fraction = {count}/{total} = {count/total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
