The problem seems to ask for the smallest number \(n = x + y\) such that there exist natural numbers \(x, y\) with \(x \cdot b = y \cdot a\), given fixed \(a=221\) and \(b=403\). This essentially describes the smallest positive integer multiple of both \(a\) and \(b\) expressed as a sum \(x+y\).

To enumerate candidates, we want to find \(x,y\) with \(x \cdot 403 = y \cdot 221\), meaning \(x/y = 221/403\). So \(x = 221k\) and \(y = 403k\) for some \(k\). Then \(n = x + y = (221 + 403)k = 624k\).

We want the smallest such \(n\), so probably for \(k=1\), \(n=624\).

I will write Python to enumerate \(k=1,2,\dots\) and print candidate \(n\). Also, to verify for other values of \(a,b\) nearby.

```python
# Enumerate n = x + y with x*b = y*a for given a,b.
# Since x/y = a/b, x = a*k, y = b*k for k >=1, so n = k*(a+b).
# We just print n for k=1..10 for (221,403) and some sample other pairs.

def enumerate_solutions(a, b, max_k=10):
    print(f"Enumerating for a={a}, b={b}:")
    for k in range(1, max_k+1):
        x = a * k
        y = b * k
        n = x + y
        # print exact values directly
        print(f"k={k}: x={x}, y={y}, n=x+y={n}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Given problem parameters
    enumerate_solutions(221, 403)
    print("---")
    # Sample other pairs for comparison
    enumerate_solutions(3, 5)
    print("---")
    enumerate_solutions(10, 15)
```

This verifies the pattern and prints candidates immediately which should assist in conjecturing the minimal value.
