The problem is to find coprime natural numbers \(r, s\) such that

\[
\frac{r}{s} = \frac{2(\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{10})}{5 \sqrt{3 + \sqrt{5}}}
\]

We want to enumerate likely candidates for \(r, s\) by generating values from simplified forms involving nested radicals, rationalizing denominators if needed, and checking equality. Since direct equality with floating-point is difficult, we'll try various rational approximations of the value with small denominators.

The program prints each candidate \(r, s\) fraction that matches the value within tight numeric precision and ensures coprimality.

```python
from math import gcd, sqrt, isclose

# Target value as floating point
root5 = sqrt(5)
val = 2 * (sqrt(2) + sqrt(10)) / (5 * sqrt(3 + root5))

def approx_fraction(x, max_den=50, tol=1e-9):
    # Generate fractions r/s with s <= max_den approximating x
    for s in range(1, max_den+1):
        r = round(x * s)
        if gcd(r, s) == 1 and isclose(r / s, x, abs_tol=tol):
            yield (r, s)

print("Enumerating candidates for (r,s) with denominator â‰¤ 50 representing the target value:\n")
for r, s in approx_fraction(val):
    print(f"r = {r}, s = {s}, r/s = {r}/{s} = {r/s}")
print("\nAmong these candidates, one is the minimal pair (r,s).")
```
