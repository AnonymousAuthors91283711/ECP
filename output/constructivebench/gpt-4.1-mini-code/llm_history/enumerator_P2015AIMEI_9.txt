The problem seems to be related to counting sequences \( s : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z} \) where the first three terms \( s(0), s(1), s(2) \) are between 1 and 10 inclusive, and there exists some \( n \geq 3 \) with \( s(n) = 0 \).

A natural interpretation is: How many sequences are there such that the first three terms each lie in \([1,10]\), and at some later index \( n \geq 3 \), the sequence hits zero?

However, the problem is underspecified without more context or constraints on \( s \), e.g., some recurrence or rule the sequence must obey.

Since this is from 2015 AIME #9, it likely involves counting triples \((a,b,c)\) with \(a,b,c \in \{1,\dots,10\}\) such that the sequence defined by a linear recurrence hits zero at some \(n\geq 3\).

As the prompt asks to write a Python program to enumerate answers for small parameter values, I'll assume that the sequence is defined by a linear recurrence:

\[
s_n = s_{n-1} + s_{n-2} + s_{n-3}
\]

with initial terms \(s_0, s_1, s_2 \in \{1, \ldots, 10\}\), and we want to count how many triples \((s_0,s_1,s_2)\) produce a sequence where for some \(n \geq 3\), \(s_n = 0\).

I'll write a Python program enumerating all triples \((a,b,c)\) with values in \([1,10]\), generating the sequence up to some \(N\) (say 20), and printing whenever zero appears at \(n \geq 3\).

I will print each \((a,b,c)\) producing such zero-term, and finally print the total count.

```python
# Enumerate triples (a,b,c) in [1,10]^3 for which the sequence
# s_n = s_{n-1} + s_{n-2} + s_{n-3} has s_n=0 for some n>=3.
# We'll generate up to n=20 and look for zeros at n>=3.

def main():
    max_val = 10
    max_terms = 20
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, max_val+1):
        for b in range(1, max_val+1):
            for c in range(1, max_val+1):
                s = [a,b,c]
                zero_found = False
                for n in range(3, max_terms):
                    next_term = s[n-1] + s[n-2] + s[n-3]
                    s.append(next_term)
                    if next_term == 0:
                        zero_found = True
                        print(f"Zero at term {n} for initial triple ({a},{b},{c})")
                        break
                if zero_found:
                    count += 1
    print(f"Total triples leading to zero at n>=3: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
