The problem involves enumerating all paths of length 20 in a 2x2 grid starting at (0,0) with adjacent moves, summing the grid values along the path to equal 20. We will:
- Represent the 2x2 grid with values 1 to 4.
- Enumerate all length-20 paths starting at (0,0) with adjacent steps.
- Calculate the sum of values on the path excluding the start (per path_sum definition).
- Print paths or sums that reach the target sum 20.
- Output the count of such paths (as omnimath1491_answer).

To keep within output token limits, we'll only print paths that meet sum=20 and the final count.

```python
# Enumerate length-20 adjacent paths in 2x2 grid starting at (0,0)
# Print sums and count those with path_sum=20

from collections import deque

# Grid values by coordinates
grid = {(0,0):1, (0,1):2, (1,0):3, (1,1):4}

# Adjacent moves in 2x2 grid (up, down, left, right if within bounds)
def neighbors(p):
    i,j = p
    for ni,nj in [(i-1,j),(i+1,j),(i,j-1),(i,j+1)]:
        if 0<=ni<=1 and 0<=nj<=1:
            yield (ni,nj)

start = (0,0)
target_length = 20
target_sum = 20

# Each state: (path as list of coords, sum excluding start)
# Initialize queue with path=[start], sum=0
queue = deque()
queue.append( ([start], 0) )

count = 0

while queue:
    path, s = queue.popleft()
    if len(path) == target_length:
        if s == target_sum:
            print(f"Path sum=20 found: {path}")
            count += 1
        continue
    last = path[-1]
    for nb in neighbors(last):
        # sum is sum of grid values excluding the first cell, so add grid[nb]
        new_sum = s + grid[nb]
        # Early pruning: sum can't exceed target_sum + max steps * max grid val but here prune if sum > target_sum
        if new_sum > target_sum:
            continue
        queue.append( (path + [nb], new_sum) )

print(f"Total number of paths with path_sum=20: {count}")
```
