The problem seems to involve the infinite sum of a geometric series with ratio 9/10 and initial term 1/10. We want to enumerate partial sums to conjecture the sum.

The series is ∑(n=0 to ∞) (9/10)^n * (1/10).
We will print partial sums for the first few n and then print the limit.

```python
# Enumerate partial sums of the infinite series Σ (9/10)^n * (1/10)

def main():
    ratio = 9/10
    first_term = 1/10
    partial_sum = 0
    print(f"Parameters: ratio={ratio}, first_term={first_term}")
    for n in range(20):
        term = first_term * (ratio ** n)
        partial_sum += term
        print(f"Partial sum up to n={n}: {partial_sum}")
    # Compute limit using formula for geometric series sum
    limit = first_term / (1 - ratio)
    print(f"Limit of the series (sum to infinity): {limit}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
