[write_program]
The problem involves a sequence \(x_n\) defined on the natural numbers with initial conditions \(x_0 = x_1 = x_2 = 1\) and a recursive formula for \(k > 2\):
\[
x_k = \frac{x_{k-1} + x_{k-2} + 1}{x_{k-3}}.
\]
We want to find or conjecture the value of \(x_{2013}\).

To assist, we will write a Python program that computes terms of this sequence iteratively for smaller indices, printing values as it goes. This might reveal a pattern or closed form and help identify the value at \(k=2013\).

```python
# Enumerate terms of the sequence x_k defined by:
# x_0 = x_1 = x_2 = 1
# x_k = (x_{k-1} + x_{k-2} + 1) / x_{k-3} for k > 2
# We print each term to observe patterns and conjecture x_2013.

def main():
    x = [1.0, 1.0, 1.0]  # initial values

    print(f"x_0 = {x[0]}")
    print(f"x_1 = {x[1]}")
    print(f"x_2 = {x[2]}")

    # We'll compute terms up to 30 for demonstration
    for k in range(3, 31):
        # Calculate next term by given recurrence
        val = (x[k-1] + x[k-2] + 1) / x[k-3]
        x.append(val)
        # Print exact integers or float with fraction if exact, else float approximation
        if abs(round(val) - val) < 1e-12:
            print(f"x_{k} = {int(round(val))}")
        else:
            print(f"x_{k} = {val:.6f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
