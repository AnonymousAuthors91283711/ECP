theorem omnimath701 :
  let outcomes := {1, 2, 3}
  let jerry_prob (j : ℕ) := if j ∈ outcomes then (1 : ℚ)/3 else 0
  let neil_prob (j : ℕ) (n : ℕ) := 
    if n ∈ outcomes ∧ n ≥ j then (1 : ℚ)/3 * ((2 : ℚ)/3)^(n - j) else 0
  (∑ j in outcomes, jerry_prob j * (∑ n in outcomes, if n = 3 then neil_prob j n else 0)) = omnimath701_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating terms for sum over j in {1,2,3} and n=3:
j=1, n=3: jerry_prob=1/3, neil_prob=4/27, term=4/81
j=2, n=3: jerry_prob=1/3, neil_prob=2/9, term=2/27
j=3, n=3: jerry_prob=1/3, neil_prob=1/3, term=1/9
Sum of all terms = 19/81. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
<<<19 / 81>>>
