Ground Truth Answer: 24
Proposed Answer: 969
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a 3-digit number (100-999) where:
   - It's a palindrome (d1 = d3)
   - When you add 32, it becomes a 4-digit palindrome (d1' = d4' and d2' = d3')
   - The sum of its digits equals the answer

2. Ground truth answer is 24 (sum of digits)
3. Proposed answer is 969 (the number itself)

Checking 969:
- It's a palindrome (9=9)
- 969 + 32 = 1001 (which is a palindrome: 1=1 and 0=0)
- Sum of digits: 9 + 6 + 9 = 24

The proposed answer (969) satisfies all conditions and its digit sum matches the ground truth answer (24). The answers are equivalent in that the proposed answer is the number that produces the ground truth answer when its digits are summed.
