The problem is to find the number of pairs \((a,b)\) of natural numbers with \(1 \leq a \leq b \leq 60\), such that \(a\) divides \(b\), and \(a+1\) divides \(b+1\).

This suggests enumerating all pairs \((a,b)\) in the specified range and checking the divisibility conditions.

```python
# Enumerate all (a,b) with 1 <= a <= b <= 60, 
# where b % a == 0 and (b+1) % (a+1) == 0.

def main():
    limit = 60
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, limit+1):
        for b in range(a, limit+1):
            if b % a == 0 and (b+1) % (a+1) == 0:
                print(f"(a={a}, b={b})")
                count += 1
    print("Total count:", count)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
