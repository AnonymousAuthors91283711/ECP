The problem is to count the number of 3-element subsets \( s \) of \( (Fin 8 \times Fin 8) \) so that for every pair of distinct elements \( q, q' \), the coordinates satisfy:

- They share the same row: \( q.1 = q'.1 \), or
- Share the same column: \( q.2 = q'.2 \), or
- Are on the same diagonal: \( |q.1 - q'.1| = |q.2 - q'.2| \).

This is reminiscent of a chess problem on an 8x8 board, counting triples where every pair of points aligns in row, column, or diagonal.

We'll write a Python program to enumerate all such triples and count them while printing each satisfying triple immediately.

```python
# Enumerate all 3-subsets of an 8x8 grid where every pair is in same row, same column, or same diagonal
from itertools import combinations

N = 8
points = [(r, c) for r in range(N) for c in range(N)]

def on_line(p1, p2):
    r1, c1 = p1
    r2, c2 = p2
    return (r1 == r2) or (c1 == c2) or (abs(r1 - r2) == abs(c1 - c2))

count = 0
# Iterate through all 3-combinations
for triple in combinations(points, 3):
    # Check all pairs in triple satisfy condition
    if all(on_line(triple[i], triple[j]) for i in range(3) for j in range(i+1,3)):
        print(triple)
        count += 1

print("Total count:", count)
```
