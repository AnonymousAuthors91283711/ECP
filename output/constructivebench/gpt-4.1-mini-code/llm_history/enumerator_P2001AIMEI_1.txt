The problem is to sum all two-digit numbers \( k \) from 10 to 99 where every nonzero digit divides \( k \). We'll enumerate all such numbers and print each one as we find it, then print their sum.

```python
# Enumerate all two-digit numbers k from 10 to 99 where every nonzero digit divides k.
# Print each such k as found, then print the sum.

def digits(n):
    return [int(d) for d in str(n)]

total = 0
print("Numbers satisfying the property:")
for k in range(10, 100):
    ds = digits(k)
    # all digits nonzero and divide k
    if all(d != 0 and k % d == 0 for d in ds):
        print(k)
        total += k

print("Sum of all such numbers:")
print(total)
```
