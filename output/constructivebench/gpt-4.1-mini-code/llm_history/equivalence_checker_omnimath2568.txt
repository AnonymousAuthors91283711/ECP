abbrev omnimath2568_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath2568 : 
  Infinite omnimath2568_answer ∧ ∀ a ∈ omnimath2568_answer, ∀ b ∈ omnimath2568_answer, a < b → Squarefree (a + b) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: sorry  -- The actual construction is non-trivial
Proposed Answer: {n * n + 1 | n : ℕ}
<<<False>>>
The proposed answer suggests using numbers of the form n²+1, but this construction fails to satisfy the second condition of the problem. For example, take a = 1²+1 = 2 and b = 2²+1 = 5. Then a + b = 7 which is squarefree, but if we take a = 2²+1 = 5 and b = 4²+1 = 17, then a + b = 22 which is not squarefree (since 22 = 2 × 11). Therefore, the proposed answer doesn't satisfy the condition that all pairwise sums must be squarefree.
