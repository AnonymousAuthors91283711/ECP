[write_program]
The problem statement is not fully given, but given the expression 2.4 * 10^8 * 2, the task seems to be to compute or verify that this equals some answer. To assist in conjecturing or verifying the true answer, I'll write a Python program that enumerates values of the form A * 10^B * C for small parameters A, B, C around these values (e.g., A around 2.4, B around 8, C around 2), then compute the products exactly and print them.

This will allow checking the exact product for 2.4 * 10^8 * 2 and nearby values to understand the behavior or pattern.

```python
# Enumerator for values close to 2.4 * 10^8 * 2

def float_to_fraction(x, max_denominator=1000):
    from fractions import Fraction
    return Fraction(x).limit_denominator(max_denominator)

def main():
    print("Enumerating products of A * 10^B * C with small parameter variations:")
    for A_num in range(23, 26):  # 2.3 to 2.5 in steps of 0.1
        A = A_num / 10
        for B in range(7, 10):   # 10^7 to 10^9
            for C in [1, 2, 3]:
                product = A * (10 ** B) * C
                frac = float_to_fraction(product)
                print(f"A={A}, B={B}, C={C} -> product = {product} ~ {frac} (fraction)")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
