The problem studies the probability that repeatedly breaking a piece into equal parts results in all pieces being equal after 7 breaks. The total break sequences count is 7! = 5040 (assuming the pieces are broken sequentially). The desired sequences count is 1, representing the unique way to get all equal pieces by breaking exactly in half each time (or a similar unique pattern depending on the problem).

We'll enumerate all possible sequences of breaks up to 7 steps, count those sequences yielding all equal-sized pieces, and calculate the ratio. The program will simulate break sequences for small cases to conjecture the answer.

```python
# Enumerate break sequences to check when all final pieces are equal-sized after 7 breaks.
# A break splits one piece into two; starting from one piece of size 1.
# We represent pieces as fractions of the original.

from fractions import Fraction
from collections import Counter

def break_pieces(pieces):
    # Generate all possible ways to break one piece into two equal halves
    # For simplicity, assume each break splits one existing piece exactly in half.
    new_states = []
    for i, p in enumerate(pieces):
        # skip pieces that can't be broken further (not divisible into two equal parts)
        # but since fractions can always be split into halves, all can be broken
        new_piece = p / 2
        new_pieces = list(pieces[:i]) + [new_piece, new_piece] + list(pieces[i+1:])
        new_pieces.sort()
        new_states.append(tuple(new_pieces))
    return new_states

def enumerate_sequences(steps):
    # Start with one piece of size 1
    states = { (Fraction(1),): 1 }  # state: count of sequences leading here
    for _ in range(steps):
        next_states = {}
        for pieces, cnt in states.items():
            for new_state in break_pieces(pieces):
                next_states[new_state] = next_states.get(new_state,0) + cnt
        states = next_states
    return states

def all_equal(pieces):
    return len(set(pieces)) == 1

def main():
    steps = 7
    states = enumerate_sequences(steps)
    total_sequences = 7*6*5*4*3*2*1  # 7! per problem statement
    desired_count = 0
    for pieces, cnt in states.items():
        if all_equal(pieces):
            print(f"Equal pieces: {pieces} sequences: {cnt}")
            desired_count += cnt
    print(f"Total sequences: {total_sequences}")
    print(f"Desired sequences: {desired_count}")
    prob = Fraction(desired_count, total_sequences)
    print(f"Probability (exact): {prob}")
    print(f"Probability (approx): {float(prob):.8f}")
