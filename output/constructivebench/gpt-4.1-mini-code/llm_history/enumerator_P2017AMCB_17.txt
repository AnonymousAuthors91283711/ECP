[write_program]
The problem involves evaluating expressions with fractional powers and exploring the difference \( p_A - p_B \) numerically to conjecture the exact algebraic expression of the answer. The program below computes values for given fractions and prints the exact symbolic forms and numerical approximations immediately.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Define fractions to test
parts = [(Fraction(2,3), Fraction(1,3))]

for a, b in parts:
    pA = a**3 + b**3
    pB = 2 * (a**2) * (b**2)
    diff = pA - pB

    # Print exact fractional powers using fractions
    print(f"a = {a}, b = {b}")
    print(f"pA = a^3 + b^3 = {a}^3 + {b}^3 = {pA}")
    print(f"pB = 2 * a^2 * b^2 = 2 * {a}^2 * {b}^2 = {pB}")
    print(f"Difference pA - pB = {diff}")
    print(f"Numerical approx = {float(diff):.6f}\n")
```
