The error arises because of precedence of ∧ and ∨ in the set builder notation. The expression as given mixes these without parentheses, Lean parses it incorrectly and tries to add a Prop to ℝ. Also, the intention was to describe the set of functions that are either constant zero or the quadratic t ↦ t².

From the enumerated answers and problem statement, the solution is the set of functions f: ℝ → ℝ such that either f = 0 or f(t) = t².

Hence, the corrected formalization is the set

{f | ∃ a b c : ℝ, f = fun t => a * t ^ 2 + b * t + c ∧ ((a = 0 ∧ b = 0 ∧ c = 0) ∨ (a = 1 ∧ b = 0 ∧ c = 0)) }

Adding these parentheses fixes the grouping, so Lean parses the disjunction of propositions properly.

This will compile because the function expressions then have type ℝ → ℝ and the propositions after ∧/∨ are grouped correctly.

The error arises because the conjunction ∧ is interpreted as a logical "and" between expressions inside the lambda, making the whole lambda body have type ℝ → Prop instead of ℝ → ℝ. The lambda must be purely numeric expression (real-valued function), so the part restricting the coefficients should be outside the lambda or combined differently. Also, the condition on the coefficients is a property of the triple (a,b,c), not of the function body for each t.

The correct approach is to define the set of functions f as those equal to a quadratic polynomial f(t) = a*t^2 + b*t + c, where either (a=0,b=0,c=0) or (a=1,b=0,c=0). This can be written as

{ f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ a b c : ℝ, ( (a=0 ∧ b=0 ∧ c=0) ∨ (a=1 ∧ b=0 ∧ c=0) ) ∧ f = fun t => a * t^2 + b * t + c }

Note that the condition on coefficients precedes the equality f = ..., keeping the lambda body pure numeric.

Hence, the fixed Lean expression is:

<<<{ f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ a b c : ℝ, ((a = 0 ∧ b = 0 ∧ c = 0) ∨ (a = 1 ∧ b = 0 ∧ c = 0)) ∧ f = fun t => a * t ^ 2 + b * t + c }>>>
