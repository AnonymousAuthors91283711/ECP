abbrev omnimath907_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath907 :
  let presses := 100
  let start := 3
  let X (k : ℕ) := k - 1  -- current floor after (k-1) presses (since first 2 presses take to floor 1)
  let Y (k : ℕ) := k - 1  -- total presses before current (k-th) press
  let p (k : ℕ) := (X k : ℝ) / (Y k : ℝ)  -- probability of success at k-th press
  let indicator (k : ℕ) := if k ≥ start + 1 then p (k-1) * p k else 0
  ∑ k in Finset.Icc start (presses - 1), indicator (k + 1) = omnimath907_answer := by sorry
