abbrev omnimath2306_answer : ℕ → ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath2306 (n : ℕ) (S : Set ℕ) (hS : S = Set.Icc 1 n) :
  Nat.card {t : Set ℕ × Set ℕ × Set ℕ | t.1 ⊆ t.2.1 ∧ t.1 ∪ t.2.1 ∪ t.2.2 = S} = omnimath2306_answer n := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n=1 count=5
n=2 count=25
n=3 count=125
n=4 count=625
n=5 count=3125
n=6 count=15625
n=7 count=78125
Minimum count for n=1..7: 5
Maximum count for n=1..7: 78125. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
The counts follow a clear geometric progression: 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, 15625, 78125, which is 5^n.

Hence the closed-form solution for omnimath2306_answer n is 5^n.

<<<fun n : ℕ => 5 ^ n>>>
