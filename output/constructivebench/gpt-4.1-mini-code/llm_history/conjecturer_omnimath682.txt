Largest n with 2^n divides 3^512 - 1 is 11. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The 2-adic valuation of 3^512 - 1 can be found using LTE lemma and properties of valuations. For 3^512 - 1, val_2(3-1) = 1, and 3+1=4 has val_2=2, so by LTE val_2(3^512-1) = val_2(3-1) + val_2(512) = 1 + 9 = 10, but since 512 is 2^9, and 3−1=2, sum is actually 1 + 9 = 10, yet enumerated answers show 11, so likely the valuation is 11. This suggests val_2(3^512 - 1) = 11, so the greatest n with 2^n dividing 3^512 - 1 is 11.
