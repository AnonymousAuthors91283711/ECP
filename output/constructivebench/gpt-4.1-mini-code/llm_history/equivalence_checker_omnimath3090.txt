Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: 4
Let me analyze this problem and the proposed answer.

The problem gives us:
1. An equation: 2 * n + 5 = 16
2. Asks us to find the value of 2 * n - 3

First, let's solve for n:
2 * n + 5 = 16
Subtract 5 from both sides: 2 * n = 11
Divide both sides by 2: n = 5.5

But n is defined as a natural number (ℕ), and 5.5 is not a natural number. This suggests there's no solution in natural numbers that satisfies the given equation.

The proposed answer is 4, but:
If we try to verify:
2 * n - 3 = 4 ⇒ 2 * n = 7 ⇒ n = 3.5
But 3.5 is not a natural number, and it doesn't satisfy the original equation (2*3.5 + 5 = 12 ≠ 16)

Therefore, the problem has no solution in natural numbers, and the proposed answer of 4 is incorrect.

<<<False>>>
