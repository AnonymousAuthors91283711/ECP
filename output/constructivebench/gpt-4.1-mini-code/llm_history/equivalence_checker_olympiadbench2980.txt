Ground Truth Answer: 41/5
Proposed Answer: 20 - 15
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the least upper bound (supremum) of the set of sums a + b under given conditions involving floor functions.

2. The ground truth answer is 41/5, which is 8.2 in decimal form.

3. The proposed answer is 20 - 15, which equals 5.

Comparing these:
- 8.2 (ground truth) is clearly different from 5 (proposed)
- The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the conditions given in the problem
- The proposed answer is significantly lower than the correct supremum

Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
