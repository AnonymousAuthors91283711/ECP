The problem defines a strictly increasing function f on natural numbers with f(1)=1 and a recursive relation involving f(2n) and f(2n+1). We aim to find f(137).

We can enumerate f(n) for small n using the recurrence if we assume f is integer-valued and strictly increasing. The relation allows computing f(2n+1) if f(2n) and f(n) are known. Similarly, from the relation:

f(2n) * f(2n+1) = 9*(f(n))^2 + 3*f(n)

Given the strict monotonicity and f(1)=1, we can start with n=1, f(1)=1, try to find f(2), f(3), etc. by guessing values that satisfy the relation, ensuring f is strictly increasing.

We will attempt to find f(n) for powers of two and intermediate points by iterating through n up to 137 (or smaller to stay within output limits). Enumerate candidate f values for f(2n) and f(2n+1) solving the formula (for integers).

We'll output f(n) as soon as determined and look for f(137) after computing the needed values.

```python
# Enumerate values of f satisfying the recurrence up to n=137.
# Using that f is strictly increasing, f(1)=1, and
# f(2n)*f(2n+1) = 9*(f(n))^2 + 3*f(n)
# We will store computed f(n) and try possible integer fits.

def main():
    f = {1: 1}  # Given
    max_n = 137

    # We will build f from 1 up to max_n by breadth-first approach on n
    # For each n, when f(n) is known, try to find possible f(2n), f(2n+1)
    # values that satisfy the identity f(2n)*f(2n+1) = 9*f(n)^2 + 3*f(n)
    # and are consistent with strict monotonicity

    # We need to guess f(2n). For given f(n), product = 9*f(n)^2 + 3*f(n)
    # f(2n) divides product, f(2n+1) = product // f(2n)
    # both must be greater than f(n), f strictly increasing
