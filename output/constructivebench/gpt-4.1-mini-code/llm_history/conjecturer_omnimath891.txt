. Enumerated answers: Total sequences found: 0. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
Explanation: The problem asks for the number of sequences \(a : Fin 10 \to \mathbb{Z}\) satisfying the Fibonacci recurrence \(a_{n+2} = a_{n+1} + a_n\) for \(n \in Fin 8\), with all terms positive and \(a_9 = 2002\). Given the linear recurrence, the entire sequence is determined by \(a_0\) and \(a_1\). Since all terms must be positive and \(a_9=2002\), we want pairs \((a_0,a_1)\) producing positive terms up to \(a_9=2002\). Enumerations found zero solutions. Therefore, no such sequences exist, so the answer is zero.
