The problem states that the six sums of pairs from four numbers \(a,b,c,d\) equal the set \(\{189, 234, 287, 320, x, y\}\), and we want to find the greatest possible value of \(x+y\) where \(x,y\) are the last two sums. We will enumerate candidate values for \(x\) and \(y\) from a reasonable range and check the feasibility of these sums forming such a set from four integers \(a,b,c,d\). By iterating over plausible pairs \((x,y)\) and checking if we can find \(a,b,c,d\) that realize exactly those six sums, we print candidate values and identify the maximum \(x+y\).

We'll brute force integer quadruples \((a,b,c,d)\) with limited ranges and map their sums to test the condition. This helps conjecture the true maximum sum \(x+y\).

```python
# Enumerate all quadruples (a,b,c,d) with a <= b <= c <= d in a suitable range,
# compute their 6 pairwise sums, and check if they match the known sums plus two unknowns x,y,
# with known sums 189,234,287,320 fixed and x,y varying.
# When a match found, print the candidate (x,y) and x+y.
# Finally print the maximum x+y found.

def pair_sums(a,b,c,d):
    return {a+b, a+c, a+d, b+c, b+d, c+d}

def possible_candidates():
    # The four numbers likely lie below 200 (since sums reach 320 max).
    max_val = 200
    known = {189,234,287,320}
    found = set()
    max_sum = 0

        for b in range(a, max_val):

                    sums = pair_sums(a,b,c,d)
                    if known.issubset(sums) and len(sums) == 6:
                        # The extra two sums:
                        extras = sums - known
                        if len(extras) == 2:
                            x, y = sorted(extras)

                            if (x,y) not in found:
                                found.add((x,y))
                                print(f"x={x}, y={y}, x+y={s}")
