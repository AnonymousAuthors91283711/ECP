The problem is to count 5-element subsets \( s \) of \(\{3,\ldots,99\}\) consisting of odd numbers, all greater than 2, such that the product of the elements in \( s \) equals a 5-digit number of the form \[10000a + 1000b + 0 + 10a + b\] where \(a, b\) are digits (indices in \(\text{Fin }10\)) with \( a \neq 0 \), \( a \neq b \).

This form means the number looks like:
\[
a\,b\,0\,a\,b
\]
with digits \(a,b\), \(a \neq 0\), \(a \neq b\).

We are to find all such 5-element sets \(s\) of odd numbers \(>2\) where the product matches this pattern.

To tackle this, the program will:
- Enumerate all 5-element subsets of the odd numbers in [3..99].
- For each, compute the product.
- Check if the product matches the pattern (5-digit, digits as above).
- Print the set and the matching number.

To keep the output manageable and efficient:
- Only 5 odd numbers between 3 and 99 -> there are \(\binom{49}{5} = 1,906,884\) subsets, too many to enumerate brute force.
- Instead, randomly sample or limit the search by primes or smaller subsets for demonstration (due to token limits).
- We'll try all 5-element subsets from a smaller set first, e.g. odd numbers from 3..25 to find examples.
- Print any found matches immediately.
- Print the pattern digits and product.

This will give useful data to conjecture the exact count or solution.

```python
# Enumerate 5-element subsets of odd numbers >2 up to 25, check product against pattern a b 0 a b
from itertools import combinations

def matches_pattern(p):
    # p should be a 5-digit number: a b 0 a b
    if p < 10000 or p > 99999:
        return False
    s = str(p)
    a, b, zero, a2, b2 = s
    return zero == '0' and a == a2 and b == b2 and a != '0' and a != b

odd_nums = [n for n in range(3, 26, 2)]  # odd numbers 3 to 25 inclusive

found = 0
for combo in combinations(odd_nums, 5):
    prod = 1
    for x in combo:
        prod *= x
        if prod > 99999:
            break  # product too large, no need to continue
    else:
        if matches_pattern(prod):
            found += 1
            print(f"Set: {combo}, Product: {prod}")
print(f"Total matches found in odd numbers 3..25: {found}")
```
