We want to explore real triples (p, q, r) with \(0 < p < q < r\) such that the cubic polynomial with roots p, q, r equals \(X^3 - aX^2 + bX - 48\). The product of the roots \(pqr = 48\).

We want to enumerate candidates for \(s = \frac{1}{p} + \frac{2}{q} + \frac{3}{r}\).

Approach:
- Fix \(p, q, r\) rational such that \(0 < p < q < r\) and \(pqr = 48\)
- Compute s and print all such s found
- Explore denominators and numerator in small ranges (like p=1..6, q>p, r=48/(p*q))
- Since roots are positive and ordered, filter accordingly
- We do not know if a,b must be real numbers or rational, just enforce root relations
- We employ small denominators for enumeration

```python
# Enumerate triples (p,q,r) positive with p<q<r and p*q*r=48, compute s = 1/p + 2/q + 3/r
# Since roots are positive reals, we sample rationals with denominator <=6 for quick enumeration
# Print s immediately when found

        for pn in range(1, target_product*pd+1):
            p = Fraction(pn, pd)
            if p <= 0:
                continue
            # q must be > p
