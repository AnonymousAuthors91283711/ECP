The problem involves finding the smallest integer \( n > 1 \) for which there exists a palindromic list \( s \) of length \( n \), containing every integer from 1 to \( n \) (in some order). This means the list is a permutation of \(\{1,2,\ldots,n\}\), is palindromic (same forwards and backwards), and includes each integer exactly once.

Key insight: A palindromic list that contains all numbers from 1 to \( n \) exactly once can only happen if \( n=1 \) or a situation that is impossible for \( n>2 \) because, in a palindrome, the elements are symmetric and the first and last elements match, the second and second-last match, etc. For an odd length palindrome, the middle element is unique, but for even length palindromes, pairs of elements appear twice. Hence, checking small \( n \) values will help conjecture the answer.

The code will enumerate \( n \) starting from 2, generate all permutations of \( \{1,\ldots,n\} \), check which ones are palindromic, and print them immediately.

```python
from itertools import permutations

def is_palindromic(lst):
    return lst == lst[::-1]

def main():
    # Check n from 2 up to 7 for feasibility
    for n in range(2, 8):
        print(f"n = {n}")
        found = False
        # Generate all permutations of [1..n]
        perm_gen = permutations(range(1, n+1))
        # Enumerate palindromic permutations
        for p in perm_gen:
            if is_palindromic(p):
                print(p)
                found = True
        if found:
            print(f"Found palindromic permutation(s) for n={n}\n")
        else:
            print(f"No palindromic permutation for n={n}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
