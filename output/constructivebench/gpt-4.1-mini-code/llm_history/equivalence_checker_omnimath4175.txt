Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ c : ℝ, (c = 0 ∨ c = 1 ∨ c = 2 ∨ c = -1) ∧ ∀ x : ℝ, f x = c * x}
<<<None>>>
Since the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's intentionally left undefined in Lean), we cannot verify whether the proposed answer is equivalent to it. The proposed answer suggests a specific form of solutions (linear functions with certain coefficients), but without knowing the actual ground truth, we cannot determine equivalence.
