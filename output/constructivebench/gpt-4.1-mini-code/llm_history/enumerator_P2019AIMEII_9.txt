The problem asks us to compute the sum 
\[
S = \sum_{n=1}^{2018} \text{if } d(n) = 20 \text{ and } 20 \mid n \text{ then } n \text{ else } 0,
\]
where \(d(n)\) is the number of divisors of \(n\). We want to find \(S/20\).

To help conjecture the answer, we'll:
- Enumerate \(n \leq 2018\) with exactly 20 divisors and divisible by 20.
- Print each such \(n\) immediately.
- Keep a running sum and print the final quotient \(S/20\).

We use divisor counting by prime factorization and exploit the divisor count formula:
\[
d(n) = (a_1+1)(a_2+1)\cdots(a_k+1)
\]
where \(n = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \cdots p_k^{a_k}\).

Since 20 factors as \(20 = 1 \times 20 = 2 \times 10 = 4 \times 5 = 5 \times 4 = 10 \times 2 = 20 \times 1\), we'll consider all divisor count patterns that multiply to 20.

Because we want the program to run quickly and output partials streaming, we'll avoid a full prime factorization for every number, but limit testing to numbers divisible by 20.

```python
import math

# Precompute primes up to 2018 for factorization
def sieve(n):
    sieve = [True]*(n+1)
    sieve[0]=sieve[1]=False
    for i in range(2,int(n**0.5)+1):
        if sieve[i]:
            for j in range(i*i,n+1,i):
                sieve[j]=False
    return [p for p in range(2,n+1) if sieve[p]]

primes = sieve(2018)

def prime_factors(n):
    factors = {}
    for p in primes:
        if p*p > n:
            break
        while n%p==0:
            factors[p] = factors.get(p,0)+1
            n //= p
    if n>1:
        factors[n] = factors.get(n,0)+1
    return factors

def divisor_count(n):
    fs = prime_factors(n)
    c = 1
    for e in fs.values():
        c *= (e+1)
    return c

S = 0
for n in range(20,2019,20):  # Must be divisible by 20
    d = divisor_count(n)
    if d == 20:
        print(n)  # print each qualifying number immediately
        S += n
print("Sum S =", S)
print("S/20 =", S//20)
```
