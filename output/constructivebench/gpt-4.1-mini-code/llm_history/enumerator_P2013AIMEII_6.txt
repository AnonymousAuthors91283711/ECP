The problem is to find the smallest positive integer \( N \) such that there is no integer \( k \) with \( k^2 \) belonging to every number in the interval \([1000N, 1000N + 999]\). In other words, no perfect square simultaneously equals all integers in that 1000-number interval, which is clearly impossible; more plausible is the problem asks for the smallest \( N \) so that no single \( k \) has \( k^2 \) inside the entire interval of length 1000 starting at \( 1000N \).

Since the problem is about the presence or absence of a perfect square in intervals of length 1000 starting at multiples of 1000, we can enumerate small \( N \) and find whether the interval \([1000N, 1000N+999]\) contains any perfect square. If yes, record that; else, we found the \(N\).

Because the integers are large and speed matters, we can compute the smallest \( k \) where \( k^2 \geq 1000N \) and check if \( k^2 \leq 1000N + 999 \).

We will enumerate \( N=1,2,\ldots \) printing which intervals contain a perfect square, and which don't. This should help conjecture answers like minimum or characterize such \( N \).

```python
# Enumerate N starting from 1, check if the interval [1000N,1000N+999] contains a perfect square

import math

def contains_perfect_square(start):
    # Smallest k with k^2 >= start
    k = math.isqrt(start)
    if k*k < start:
        k += 1
    # Check if k^2 is <= end of interval
    end = start + 999
    return k*k <= end

def main():
    for N in range(1, 101):  # Enumerate N from 1 to 100 for manageable output
        interval_start = 1000*N
        if contains_perfect_square(interval_start):
            print(f"N={N}: interval [{interval_start},{interval_start+999}] contains perfect square {math.isqrt(interval_start)**2 if math.isqrt(interval_start)**2 >= interval_start else (math.isqrt(interval_start)+1)**2}")
        else:
            print(f"N={N}: interval [{interval_start},{interval_start+999}] contains NO perfect square")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
