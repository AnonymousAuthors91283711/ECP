Ground Truth Answer: { (Nat.factorial k - 1, 1, 1) | k ∈ {n | 1 < n} } ∪ 
  { (1, Nat.factorial k - 1, 1) | k ∈ {n | 1 < n} } ∪ 
  { (1, 1, Nat.factorial k - 1) | k ∈ {n | 1 < n} }
Proposed Answer: {(1,1,1), (1,1,5), (1,5,1), (5,1,1)}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for all triples (a,b,c) of positive integers where:
   - a*b+1 is a factorial
   - b*c+1 is a factorial
   - c*a+1 is a factorial

2. The ground truth answer gives:
   - All triples where two elements are 1 and the third is (k!-1) for k>1
   - This includes (1,1,1) when k=2 (since 2!-1=1)
   - And infinitely many other solutions like (5,1,1) when k=3 (3!-1=5)

3. The proposed answer gives:
   - Only 4 specific triples
   - (1,1,1) is correct (matches k=2 case)
   - (5,1,1) and permutations are correct (match k=3 case)
   - But it's missing all other solutions like (23,1,1) (from 4!-1=23), etc.

The proposed answer is incomplete as it only lists some solutions but not all. The ground truth answer covers all possible solutions.
