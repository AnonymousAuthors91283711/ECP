The problem seems about analyzing multisets of 12 numbers, each number is either even or odd near twice an integer ≤11, whose sum is 132 = 11*12.
We want to find indices n in Fin 5 = {0,1,2,3,4} for which a predicate P2015AMCA_13_answer n is false, and this condition characterizes n=4 uniquely.

To assist, I will enumerate multisets of 12 integers between 0 and 23 (since 2*11+1=23), each a 2k or 2k+1 for k ≤ 11, summing to 132.
Since the search space is huge, I will generate random samples and look at sums mod 5 or other invariant patterns, and print candidate n values for which some tests failed/passed. This may help conjecture which n satisfies or not.

```python
import itertools

# We want 12 numbers s_i with s_i in {2k, 2k+1} for k = 0..11, sum s_i = 132
# Each s_i is from 0..23, integer, parity unrestricted but from pairs 2k or 2k+1.
# We'll enumerate combinations with repetition allowed.

# For feasibility, enumerate only combinations with fixed number of odd numbers from 0..12.
# Because sum parity depends on number of odd numbers.

def is_valid_score(s):
    # Check if s can be written as 2*k or 2*k+1 with k ≤11
    # That means s in [0..23]
    return 0 <= s <= 23 and (s % 2 == 0 or s % 2 == 1)

def generate_candidates():
    # All numbers s_i in 0..23
    # s_i = 2*k or 2*k+1 for k ≤ 11, so s_i in range 0..23 as above.
    # We look for 12-element multisets summing 132.
    # We try to speed up: number of odd numbers (odd_count) affects sum parity.
    # sum = 132 (even), so even number of odd numbers.

    # We'll try even odd_counts in 0..12
    max_s = 23
    target_sum = 132
    n_scores = 12

    # We generate candidates with odd_count odd elements, the rest even.
    for odd_count in range(0, n_scores + 1, 2):
        even_count = n_scores - odd_count

        # possible odd scores = odd numbers in [0..23], from 1 to 23 step 2
        odd_scores = list(range(1, 24, 2))
        # possible even scores = even numbers in [0..23], from 0 to 22 step 2
        even_scores = list(range(0, 24, 2))

        # We'll iterate over combinations with repetition for odd_count odd numbers and even_count even numbers.
        # To reduce search space, limit to sums near target_sum break quickly.
        # Using itertools.combinations_with_replacement with caching sums.

        # Because of large number of combinations, restrict max iteration per odd_count.
        max_iter = 100000

        # Generate all combinations of odd_count odd numbers with repetition
        odd_combs = itertools.combinations_with_replacement(odd_scores, odd_count) if odd_count > 0 else [()]

        for odd_tuple in odd_combs:
            sum_odd = sum(odd_tuple)
            # Similarly generate even combinations:
            # target_even_sum = target_sum - sum_odd
            target_even_sum = target_sum - sum_odd
            if target_even_sum < 0 or target_even_sum > even_count * max_s:
                continue

            # Generate even_count numbers sum to target_even_sum
            # For small even_count (<=12), enumerate partitions of target_even_sum into even_count parts with values in even_scores
            
            # To limit search, for small even_count, enumerate
            # We use helper function:

                # Generate k-element tuples of numbers (in even_scores) summing to n, with each ≤ max_val
                # Do a recursive generator

                max_val = min(max_val, n)
                for val in even_scores:
                    if val > max_val:
