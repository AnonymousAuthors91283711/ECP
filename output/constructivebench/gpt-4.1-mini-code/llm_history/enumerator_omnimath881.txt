[write_program]
The problem involves finding a set of distinct positive integers summing to 2021, maximizing their product, and then examining the 2-adic valuation (the exponent of 2 in the prime factorization of that product). Since the problem is quite involved, let's write a Python program that enumerates candidate sets for small values of n and looks for high-product sets summing to 2021.

We'll:
- Try a small number of summands n (e.g., 2 to 6).
- Enumerate partitions of 2021 into n distinct positive integers.
- Compute the product for each partition.
- Track the maximal product found and its 2-adic valuation.
- Immediately print candidates with better products.
- Finally print the maximal 2-adic valuation found.

This will help conjecture the answer for the 2-adic valuation of the maximum product.

```python
from math import prod
from collections import defaultdict

def v2(x):
    # 2-adic valuation: exponent of 2 in prime factorization
    count = 0
    while x % 2 == 0 and x > 0:
        x //= 2
        count += 1
    return count

def partitions_sum_n(n, total, start=1, prefix=[]):
    # Generate strictly increasing partitions of total into n parts
    if n == 0:
        if total == 0:
            yield prefix
        return
    for x in range(start, total - n + 2):
        # minimal sum for remaining parts: sum of next n-1 numbers strictly increasing
        # minimal sum for increasing sequence starting at x would be sum(x+i for i in range(n))
        # However, to keep it simple, just ensure sum stays possible.
        if x > total:
            break
        yield from partitions_sum_n(n - 1, total - x, x + 1, prefix + [x])

def main():
    total = 2021
    max_product = 0
    max_v2 = -1
    # Limit n to small values due to combinatorial explosion
    for n in range(2, 7):
        print(f"Trying n={n}")
        for part in partitions_sum_n(n, total):
            p = prod(part)
            if p > max_product:
                max_product = p
                val2 = v2(p)
                max_v2 = val2
                print(f"New max product: {p} with parts {part}, v2={val2}")
            elif p == max_product:
                val2 = v2(p)
                print(f"Equal max product: {p} with parts {part}, v2={val2}")

    print(f"Max product found: {max_product}")
    print(f"Corresponding 2-adic valuation (v2): {max_v2}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
