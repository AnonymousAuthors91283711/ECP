Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: ‚àë' n : ‚Ñï, (1 / ( (‚Üë(n + 3) : ‚Ñù)^4 - (‚Üë(n + 3) : ‚Ñù)^2 )) / 3^n
<<<None>>>
Since the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's intentionally left unspecified in the problem statement), and the proposed answer presents a specific infinite series, we cannot determine their equivalence. The problem asks to prove convergence to some unspecified limit, while the proposed answer suggests a particular form for this limit. Without knowing the intended ground truth, we can't verify equivalence.
