The problem is to find the smallest positive integer \( k = m + n \) for positive integers \( m,n \) satisfying \( 3 m^3 = 5 n^5 \).

To explore, we'll enumerate positive \( m,n \) pairs with moderate bounds, check the condition exactly, and print solutions with their sums \( k \). Then we track the minimal \( k \).

```python
# Enumerate positive integers m,n to find solutions to 3*m^3 = 5*n^5
# Print each (m,n,k) solution as soon as found, and track minimal k

def main():
    max_n = 50  # upper bound for n to limit runtime
    minimal_k = None

    for n in range(1, max_n+1):
        left = 5 * n**5
        # m^3 = (5*n^5)/3, so (5*n^5) must be divisible by 3
        if left % 3 != 0:
            continue
        m_cubed = left // 3

        # Check if m_cubed is a perfect cube
        m = round(m_cubed ** (1/3))
        # Due to rounding, test nearby ints
        for candidate in [m-1, m, m+1]:
            if candidate > 0 and candidate**3 == m_cubed:
                k = candidate + n
                print(f"m={candidate}, n={n}, k={k} satisfies 3*m^3=5*n^5")
                if minimal_k is None or k < minimal_k:
                    minimal_k = k
                break

    if minimal_k is not None:
        print(f"Minimal k found: {minimal_k}")
    else:
        print("No solutions found with given bounds.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
