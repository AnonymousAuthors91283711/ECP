Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: { x : ℝ | (Real.sin x = 1/2) ∨ (Real.sin x = -1/2) ∨ (Real.sin x = Real.sqrt 3/2) ∨ (Real.sin x = -Real.sqrt 3/2) }
Let me analyze the problem and proposed answer:

The problem asks for the set of real numbers x where f(x) = 0, with f defined as:
f(x) = sin⁶x + cos⁶x - 0.7(sin⁴x + cos⁴x)

The proposed answer suggests that the zeros occur when sin(x) = ±1/2 or ±√3/2.

Let's verify this:

1. First, simplify the expression:
   sin⁶x + cos⁶x = (sin²x + cos²x)(sin⁴x - sin²xcos²x + cos⁴x)
                 = 1 · (sin⁴x + cos⁴x - sin²xcos²x)
                 = (sin²x + cos²x)² - 2sin²xcos²x - sin²xcos²x
                 = 1 - 3sin²xcos²x

2. Similarly:
   sin⁴x + cos⁴x = (sin²x + cos²x)² - 2sin²xcos²x = 1 - 2sin²xcos²x

3. So f(x) becomes:
   1 - 3sin²xcos²x - 0.7(1 - 2sin²xcos²x) = 0.3 - 1.6sin²xcos²x = 0

4. Solving:
   sin²xcos²x = 0.3/1.6 = 3/16
   (sinx cosx)² = 3/16
   sin(2x)² = 3/4 (since 2sinx cosx = sin(2x))
   sin(2x) = ±√3/2

5. Therefore:
   2x = π/3 + kπ or 2π/3 + kπ for any integer k
   x = π/6 + kπ/2 or π/3 + kπ/2

6. The proposed answer gives sin(x) = ±1/2 or ±√3/2, which corresponds to:
   x = π/6 + 2kπ, 5π/6 + 2kπ, π/3 + 2kπ, 2π/3 + 2kπ, etc.

The proposed answer captures all solutions where sin(x) has these values, but misses the periodicity (it should include all x = solution + kπ/2, not just the principal solutions). Therefore, it's mostly correct but incomplete.
