The problem asks for the number of subsets of natural numbers less than 23 (and none prime) whose sum is 23. We want to enumerate subsets of non-prime numbers less than 23 that sum to 23, and count how many there are.

Non-primes less than 23 are: 1 and all composites less than 23.
Primes less than 23: 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19

Non-primes less than 23: 1,4,6,8,9,10,12,14,15,16,18,20,21,22

We enumerate all subsets of these that sum to 23.

```python
from itertools import chain, combinations

# Non-prime numbers < 23
non_primes = [1,4,6,8,9,10,12,14,15,16,18,20,21,22]

def powerset(iterable):
    s = list(iterable)
    # all subsets
    return chain.from_iterable(combinations(s, r) for r in range(len(s)+1))

count = 0
print("Enumerating subsets of non-primes <23 summing to 23:")
for subset in powerset(non_primes):
    if sum(subset) == 23:
        count += 1
        print(subset)

print("omnimath2502_answer =", count)
```
