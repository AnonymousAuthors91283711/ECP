This problem asks to find all triples \((a,b,p)\) of positive integers with \(p\) prime such that:
\[
a^p = b! + p.
\]
We'll enumerate over small primes \(p\), positive integers \(a,b\), print every \((a,b,p)\) where equality holds to support further analysis.

```python
from math import factorial, isqrt
from sympy import primerange

# Enumerate for small primes p and find (a,b) with a^p = b! + p
max_p = 20      # upper bound for prime p to check
max_b = 50      # upper bound for factorial argument b
print("Enumerating (a, b, p) with a^p = b! + p:")

primes = list(primerange(2, max_p+1))
# For each prime p:
for p in primes:
    for b in range(1, max_b+1):
        val = factorial(b) + p
        # Check if val is a perfect p-th power
        # Compute integer p-th root candidates around int(val**(1/p))
        root = int(round(val ** (1/p)))
        # Check root and neighbors because of rounding errors
        for a in [root-1, root, root+1]:
            if a > 0 and a ** p == val:
                print(f"a={a}, b={b}, p={p}, {a}^{p} = {b}! + {p} = {val}")
```
