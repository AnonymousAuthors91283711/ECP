The problem asks for integer-valued functions \( f: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z} \) satisfying the functional equation
\[ f(4x+3y) = f(3x+y) + f(x+2y) \quad \forall x,y \in \mathbb{Z}. \]

We want to enumerate some plausible functions \( f \). A natural attempt is to try linear functions (e.g., \( f(n) = an \)) or simple polynomial forms to see which satisfy the equation exactly. Also, try zero or constant functions.

The following Python program:

- Enumerates candidate functions \( f(n) = a n + b \) with small integer coefficients \( a,b \) in a fixed small range.
- Verifies the functional equation on a small grid of \( (x,y) \).
- Prints candidates \( (a,b) \) that satisfy the condition on the tested inputs.
- Prints results immediately.

This can help conjecture the form of \( f \).

```python
# Enumerate functions f(n) = a*n + b for integer a,b in [-2,2]
# and test on grid x,y in [-3,3] whether f(4x+3y) == f(3x+y) + f(x+2y)

def test_linear(a, b):
    for x in range(-3,4):
        for y in range(-3,4):
            left = a*(4*x + 3*y) + b
            right = a*(3*x + y) + b + a*(x + 2*y) + b
            if left != right:
                return False
    return True

print("Testing linear functions f(n)=a*n + b with a,b in [-2,2]:")
for a in range(-2, 3):
    for b in range(-2, 3):
        if test_linear(a,b):
            print(f"Function f(n) = {a}*n + {b} satisfies the equation on tested points.")
```
This will output candidate linear functions consistent with the given condition on chosen sample points. This helps in conjecturing the solution form \(f\).
