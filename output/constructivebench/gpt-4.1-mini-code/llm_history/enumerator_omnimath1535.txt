Given the problem involves summations over n and k with a function Ω(n,k) defined in terms of prime factors of n, and the goal is to approximate or conjecture the value of the infinite double sum:

\[
\sum_{n=0}^\infty \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\Omega(n+1, k+1)}{3^{n+k-6}},
\]

where Ω(n, k) counts the number of prime factors of n with multiplicity at least k.

We will:

- Enumerate partial sums for small n, k up to some cutoff, e.g., n, k ≤ 20.
- Compute Ω(n, k) = count of prime factors of n with exponent ≥ k.
- Print the partial sums as we proceed to see convergence trends.
- Since the sum involves infinite terms decreasing as powers of 1/3, truncating should give good approximations.

We use sympy for factorization.

```python
# enumerator.py
from sympy import factorint
from collections import Counter

def omega(n, k):
    """Count prime factors of n with exponent at least k (k>=1)."""
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    factors = factorint(n)
    count = sum(1 for exp in factors.values() if exp >= k)
    return count

def main():
    # Summation over n,k>=0 of Ω(n+1,k+1)/3^(n+k-6)
    # We'll use n,k up to 20 to get partial sums.
    max_n, max_k = 20, 20
    total_sum = 0.0
    print("Enumerating partial sums for n,k ≤ 20")
    for n in range(max_n+1):
        for k in range(max_k+1):
            om = omega(n+1, k+1)
            # term = Ω(n+1,k+1) / 3^(n+k-6)
            # 3^(n+k-6) = 3**(n+k-6)
            # to avoid division by 3^{-6}, we multiply numerator by 3^6
            denom = 3**(n+k-6)
            term = om / denom
            total_sum += term
            print(f"n={n}, k={k}, Ω={om}, term={term:.8f}, partial_sum={total_sum:.8f}")

    print(f"Partial sum over n,k ≤ 20: {total_sum:.8f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
