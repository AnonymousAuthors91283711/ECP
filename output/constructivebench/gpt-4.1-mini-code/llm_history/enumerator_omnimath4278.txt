The problem involves a family of subsets \(S_i \subseteq \mathbb{Z}\) for \(i=1,\ldots,100\), with two conditions:

1. For every nonempty subset \(T\) of indices, the intersection \(\bigcap_{s \in T} S_s\) is nonempty.
2. The size of the intersection divides the size of \(T\).

We want to find the minimum cardinality of the subset of indices for which there exists an integer \(x\) belonging to at least that many \(S_i\).

To explore this, we will:

- Enumerate small cases of sets \(S_i\) on a smaller domain (like 10 or fewer subsets).
- Generate random or structured sets satisfying the divisibility and nonempty intersection conditions.
- For each integer \(x\), find how many sets \(S_i\) contain \(x\).
- Print candidates for the minimum number \(n\).

We will try subsets of size 10 (for speed), demonstrate the conditions, and print all encountered values for the maximum number of sets containing some \(x\).

```python
import itertools

# We test smaller versions: n=5 to 10 sets of integers 0..9
# Generate structured sets that satisfy:
# For every nonempty T, intersection nonempty and size divides |T|.
# We'll try sets with elements chosen so all intersections have same size = 1 or 2 dividing |T|.
# To simplify, we try sets all containing a common element -> intersection size = number of sets in T (always divides |T|).

def test_family(n):
    universe = list(range(10))  # domain elements
    # Build sets S_i each containing element i, plus a common element 0 to ensure intersection nonempty
    S = []
    for i in range(n):
        # Let's have every set contain 0 plus i+1
        s = {0, (i+1)%10}
        S.append(s)
    # Verify conditions: For any T, intersection nonempty (at least {0}), and |intersection| divides |T|
    # Intersection always at least {0} ⇒ size ≥ 1
    # But e.g., intersection of two sets is at least {0}, size 1 which divides 2, ok
    # Intersection of k sets = {0}, size 1 divides k
    # So conditions hold.
    # Now find max number of sets containing x
    # Elements are from 0..9
    counts = [0]*10
    for x in range(10):
        cnt = sum(1 for s in S if x in s)
        counts[x] = cnt
    max_count = max(counts)
    # Print all counts
    for x in range(10):
        if counts[x] >= n//2:
            print(f"x={x} is in {counts[x]} sets out of {n}")
    print(f"Max count for n={n} is {max_count}\n")

# Test for n=5 to n=10
for n in range(5,11):
    print(f"Testing family with n={n} sets:")
    test_family(n)
```
