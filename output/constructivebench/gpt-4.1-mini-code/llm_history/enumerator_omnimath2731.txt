The problem involves a system of linear equations, and we need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies all three equalities simultaneously:

\[
\frac{5 + x}{2} = 7, \quad \frac{x + 9}{2} = 12, \quad \frac{5 + 9}{2} = 10.
\]

We will enumerate values of \( x \) in a reasonable range and check these equations, printing candidates that satisfy them exactly.

```python
# Enumerate possible values of x to solve the system:
# (5 + x)/2 = 7 and (x + 9)/2 = 12 and (5 + 9)/2 = 10

# Last equality (5+9)/2=10 is always true because 14/2=7, so it's false as given.
# But the input asks to check all conditions.
# We'll consider that maybe it's meant that all are checked for x.

# For x integers near the expected value, print x satisfying the first two equations exactly.

for x in range(-10, 20):
    eq1 = (5 + x)/2
    eq2 = (x + 9)/2
    eq3 = (5 + 9)/2
    if eq1 == 7 and eq2 == 12 and eq3 == 10:
        print(f"x = {x}")

# Now also check conditions where the third one might be treated as separate,
# as this equation is a constant 7 == 10 which is false,
# so no x will satisfy all three.
# Instead, output the values related to each individually.

print("Checking partial satisfactions:")
for x in range(-10, 20):
    eq1 = (5 + x)/2
    eq2 = (x + 9)/2
    eq3 = (5 + 9)/2
    print(f"x={x}: eq1={eq1}, eq2={eq2}, eq3={eq3}, eq1=7:{eq1==7}, eq2=12:{eq2==12}, eq3=10:{eq3==10}")
```
