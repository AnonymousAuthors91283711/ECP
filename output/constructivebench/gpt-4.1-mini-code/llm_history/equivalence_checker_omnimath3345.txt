Ground Truth Answer: fun x => x^(9900) * ((1 + x^100)/2)^2
Proposed Answer: fun x : ℝ => (x^(201) * (x^2 + 1)^(100) / (x + 1)^(200))^(100)
Let me analyze the problem and compare the answers:

1. The problem involves a double product (nested product) over ranges of 100 elements each, resulting in 10,000 terms being multiplied together.

2. The ground truth answer simplifies this to x^9900 * ((1 + x^100)/2)^2, which suggests:
   - A dominant x^9900 term
   - A squared term involving (1 + x^100)/2

3. The proposed answer is (x^201 * (x^2 + 1)^100 / (x + 1)^200)^100, which would expand to:
   - x^20100 term (from x^201^100)
   - (x^2 + 1)^10000
   - Divided by (x + 1)^20000

4. Comparing the exponents:
   - Ground truth has x^9900 vs proposed x^20100
   - The other terms don't match either

5. The proposed answer's structure is completely different from the ground truth, with much larger exponents and different polynomial components.
