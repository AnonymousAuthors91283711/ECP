[write_program]
The problem defines sequences and sets related to prime numbers, supremums, and squares. We want to find integers m such that some term a_i equals m², given a recursive definition for a_i and a function l(n) defined as the supremum of primes ≤ n.

We'll enumerate values for i and compute a_i and check if a_i is a perfect square (a_i = m²). We'll print any such m immediately and track candidates up to a reasonable limit to conjecture the set omnimath3980_answer.

```python
import math

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    if n % 2 == 0 and n > 2:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def largest_prime_leq(n):
    # Find the largest prime p ≤ n
    for x in range(n, 1, -1):
        if is_prime(x):
            return x
    return 0

def is_perfect_square(x):
    r = math.isqrt(x)
    return r * r == x, r

def main():
    print("Enumerating m with a_i = m^2 for i up to 30")
    a = [0] * 31
    a[1] = 2  # from ha1
    for i in range(1, 30):
        l_val = largest_prime_leq(a[i])
        a[i + 1] = a[i] + l_val
        perfect, m = is_perfect_square(a[i + 1])
        if perfect:
            print(f"i={i+1}, a[i]={a[i+1]} = {m}^2, m={m}")
