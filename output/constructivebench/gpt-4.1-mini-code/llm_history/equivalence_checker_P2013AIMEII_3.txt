theorem P2013AIMEII_3 :
  let totalTime := ∑ k in Finset.range 119, 10 * (k + 1)
  let halfTime := totalTime / 2
  let heightAtHalfTime := 119 - (Finset.card {k ∈ Finset.range 119 | ∑ i in Finset.range k, 10 * (i + 1) ≤ halfTime})
  10 * heightAtHalfTime = P2013AIMEII_3_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 35
Proposed Answer: 350
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves calculating a height at half time of a process where each step takes 10*(k+1) time units for k from 0 to 118 (range 119).

2. The ground truth answer is 35, which would be the height (number of steps completed) at half time.

3. The proposed answer is 350, which is exactly 10 times the ground truth answer (35 * 10 = 350).

4. Looking at the theorem statement, we can see the final comparison is `10 * heightAtHalfTime = P2013AIMEII_3_answer`. This means the correct answer should indeed be 10 times the height value.

5. Therefore, if the correct height is 35, then the correct answer to the theorem should be 350 (10 * 35).

The proposed answer (350) matches exactly what we would expect from the theorem statement given that the ground truth height is 35.
