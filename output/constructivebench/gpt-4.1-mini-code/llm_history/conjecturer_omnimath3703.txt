. Enumerated answers: Testing candidate a for existence of f satisfying inequality
a=-2.00 holds for f(t)=-1*t+1
a=-1.00 holds for f=-id
a=0.00 holds for f(t)=1*t+1
a=0.50 holds for f(t)=1*t+1
a=1.00 holds for f=id
Candidates for a: [-2, -1, 0, 0.5, 1]. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
<<<{a | -1 ≤ a ∧ a ≤ 1}>>>
