Ground Truth Answer: 6
Proposed Answer: 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the smallest natural number b such that there exists a set of numbers (defined by P(n) = n² + n + 1) in some interval [a, a+b] where each element is not coprime with the product of the others in the set.

2. The ground truth answer is 6, which means the smallest such interval length is 6.

3. The proposed answer is 2, suggesting a much smaller interval would work.

Key observations:
- For b=2, we'd need two consecutive P(n) values that are not coprime. However, P(n) and P(n+1) are always coprime (they satisfy P(n+1) - P(n) = 2n + 2, and gcd considerations show they must be coprime).
- The smallest b where this works is indeed 6, as shown by the example {P(1)=3, P(2)=7, P(3)=13, P(5)=31, P(6)=43, P(7)=57} where 57 is divisible by 3 and all other products are divisible by 3×7×13×31×43 which shares factors with each element.

The proposed answer of 2 is incorrect because no two consecutive P(n) values satisfy the condition.
