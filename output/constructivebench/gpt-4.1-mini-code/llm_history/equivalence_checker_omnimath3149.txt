Ground Truth Answer: fun (a, b) (c, d) => a * c + b * d
Proposed Answer: fun p q => p.1 * q.1 + p.2 * q.2
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. Both answers define a function that takes two pairs of natural numbers and returns the sum of the products of their corresponding components. The proposed answer uses pattern matching with `p.1` and `p.2` to access the components, while the ground truth answer uses direct pattern matching with `(a, b)` and `(c, d)`. The functionality is identical, just expressed with slightly different syntax. Both would return 14 when applied to (3,1) and (4,2) (3*4 + 1*2 = 14).
