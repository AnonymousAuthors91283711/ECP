[write_program]
The problem is to find all real numbers \( r \) such that there exists a real number \( d \) satisfying the system:
\[
\begin{cases}
4 + d = 4r \\
4r + d = 4r^2
\end{cases}
\]

We want to enumerate candidate values for \( r \) that satisfy these equations and identify the solution set with a program.

```python
# Solve system for r, d in real numbers:
# 4 + d = 4r
# 4r + d = 4r^2

print("Enumerating values of r that satisfy the system:")

import sympy as sp

r, d = sp.symbols('r d', real=True)

# From the first equation: d = 4r - 4
d_eq = 4*r - 4

# Substitute into the second equation: 4r + d = 4r^2
eq = sp.Eq(4*r + d_eq, 4*r**2)

# Solve for r
solutions = sp.solve(eq, r)

for sol in solutions:
    # Compute corresponding d
    d_val = d_eq.subs(r, sol)
    print(f"r = {sol.evalf()}, d = {d_val.evalf()}")
    
print("Exact solutions for r:")
for sol in solutions:
    print(sol)
```
This enumerates and prints all exact solutions for \( r \), along with the corresponding \( d \), helping to conjecture the answer set.
