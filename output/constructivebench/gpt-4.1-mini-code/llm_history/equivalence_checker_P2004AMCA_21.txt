Ground Truth Answer: fun θ => 3/5
Proposed Answer: fun θ : ℝ => 2 * (4 / 5) - 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives an infinite geometric series sum of (cos θ)^(2n) equals 5.

2. The sum of an infinite geometric series ∑ r^n = 1/(1-r) when |r| < 1.

3. Applying this to our problem: 1/(1 - (cos θ)^2) = 5
   => 1 - (cos θ)^2 = 1/5
   => (cos θ)^2 = 4/5

4. We need to find cos(2θ). Using the double angle formula:
   cos(2θ) = 2(cos θ)^2 - 1 = 2*(4/5) - 1 = 8/5 - 1 = 3/5

Now comparing the answers:
- Ground truth: 3/5
- Proposed: 2*(4/5) - 1 = 3/5

The proposed answer is exactly equal to the ground truth answer when simplified, just written in a different form.
