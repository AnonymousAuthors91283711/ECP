This problem defines a sequence \(a_n\) on natural numbers with real values given by:
\[
a_0 = \sqrt{2}, \quad a_1 = 2, \quad a_{n+1} = a_n \cdot (a_{n-1})^2.
\]
We want to find the smallest positive integer \(p\) such that, for some large \(N\), the sequence \(\lfloor a_m \rfloor \bmod 2014\) becomes periodic with period \(p\) for all \(m \geq N\).

Given the rapid growth of \(a_n\), direct floating-point calculations and modulo operations on \(\lfloor a_n \rfloor\) are tricky. Instead, we will work with the logarithms of \(a_n\) to avoid overflow:

\[
\log a_0 = \frac{1}{2} \log 2, \quad \log a_1 = \log 2, \quad \log a_{n+1} = \log a_n + 2\log a_{n-1}.
\]

Then:
\[
a_n = \exp(\log a_n).
\]

We can compute \(\log a_n\) modulo \(\log 2014\) (or keep track of fractional parts) to check the fractional part of \(\log a_n / \log 2014\), because:
\[
a_n \mod 2014 \approx \exp(\log a_n) \mod 2014,
\]
but modular arithmetic of \(a_n\) is complicated. So instead, we directly compute \(a_n\) approximately with high precision, then floor and mod by 2014 to check periodicity.

We will:
- Compute \(a_n\) for \(n\) up to some max (like 100),
- For \(p\) from 1 to 20, check if for all \(m\) from some \(N\) (like 20) to max -
  \[
  \lfloor a_m \rfloor \bmod 2014 = \lfloor a_{m+p} \rfloor \bmod 2014,
  \]
- Print all candidate \(p\) and finally print the minimal such \(p\).

To keep outputs short, we print a few candidates as we find them.

    # Instead, since modulo is 2014, just compute a_n mod 2014 using fractional exponent part:
    # We'll compute fractional part: x = logs[n]/log(mod)
    # a_n = mod^x = mod^{int_part + frac_part} = (mod^{int_part})*(mod^{frac_part}) â‰¡ (mod^{frac_part}) mod mod
    # since mod^{int_part} mod mod = 0 unless int_part=0. So approximation:
    # We extract fractional exponent part and approximate mod^{frac_part}
    # Finally floor(mod^{frac_part}) mod mod gives some info.
