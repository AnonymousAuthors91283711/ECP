Ground Truth Answer: 4 * sqrt 5
Proposed Answer: Real.sqrt (12^2 - 4 * 16)
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem gives two positive real numbers x₁ and x₂ with:
   - Sum of base-2 logs equals 4 (which implies x₁ * x₂ = 2^4 = 16)
   - Sum of the numbers equals 12

2. The ground truth answer is 4√5, which equals √(16*5) = √80

3. The proposed answer is √(12² - 4*16) = √(144 - 64) = √80

The proposed answer correctly calculates the difference using the identity:
|x₁ - x₂| = √((x₁ + x₂)² - 4x₁x₂) = √(12² - 4*16) = √80 = 4√5

<<<True>>>
