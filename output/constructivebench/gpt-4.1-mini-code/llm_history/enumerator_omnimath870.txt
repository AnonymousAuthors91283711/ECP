The problem seems to involve counting outcomes with dice rolls, with total outcomes \(6^4\) and favorable outcomes given by \(4^4 - 3^4 - (5^4 - 4^4)\). To assist in conjecturing and proving the result, let's enumerate and compute these values exactly using Python:

```python
# Enumerate and print the relevant values to understand the ratio

total_outcomes = 6**4
favorable_outcomes = 4**4 - 3**4 - (5**4 - 4**4)

print("Total outcomes:", total_outcomes)
print("Favorable outcomes:", favorable_outcomes)
print("Ratio (favorable / total):", favorable_outcomes, "/", total_outcomes)
print("Ratio (decimal approx):", favorable_outcomes / total_outcomes)
```

This will print the exact values and approximate ratio, supporting conjecturing the answer.
