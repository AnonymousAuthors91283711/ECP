Ground Truth Answer: 1225 / 16384
Proposed Answer: (1225 : ℚ) / (4^8 : ℚ)
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer (1225 : ℚ) / (4^8 : ℚ) is mathematically equivalent to the ground truth answer 1225 / 16384 because 4^8 equals 16384. Both expressions represent the same rational number, just written in different forms (one with exponentiation and one with the evaluated denominator). The type annotation : ℚ ensures both are treated as rational numbers in the same way.
