The problem involves characterizing the volume of a set \( P \subseteq \mathbb{R}^3 \) defined by constraints on a triple \( (f_0, f_1, f_2) \) with each coordinate in \([-1,1]\) and satisfying a given equality involving absolute values of linear combinations. We want to enumerate points \((f_0, f_1, f_2)\) in a discrete grid inside \([-1,1]^3\) that satisfy or nearly satisfy the condition:

\[
|f_0| + |f_1| + |f_2| + |f_0 + f_1 + f_2| = |f_0 + f_1| + |f_1 + f_2| + |f_2 + f_0|
\]

By sampling and printing these points, we may conjecture the volume structure. The code will:

- Enumerate \(f_i\) from -1 to 1 in steps of 0.2 (for efficiency).
- Check the equality within a tolerance \(10^{-10}\) (to handle floating-point).
- Print the satisfying tuples immediately.
- Summarize count to conjecture measure scaling.

```python
# Enumerate triples (f0,f1,f2) in [-1,1]^3 at granularity 0.2
# Print those approximately satisfying the key equality.

def approx_eq(a,b,eps=1e-10):
    return abs(a - b) < eps

def absval(x):
    return abs(x)

step = 0.2
vals = [round(-1 + i*step, 8) for i in range(int(2/step)+1)]  # from -1 to 1

count = 0
print("Enumerating points (f0,f1,f2) with step 0.2 satisfying the equality condition:")

for f0 in vals:
    for f1 in vals:
        for f2 in vals:
            lhs = absval(f0)+absval(f1)+absval(f2)+absval(f0+f1+f2)
            rhs = absval(f0+f1)+absval(f1+f2)+absval(f2+f0)
            if approx_eq(lhs,rhs):
                print(f"f=({f0},{f1},{f2}), lhs={lhs}, rhs={rhs}")
                count += 1

print(f"Total satisfying points at step {step}: {count}")
```
