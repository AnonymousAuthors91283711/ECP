abbrev omnimath3403_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath3403 : 
  (X - C (4 : ℚ)) * (X - C (2 : ℚ)) + (X - C (2 : ℚ)) * (X - C (6 : ℚ)) = 0 ↔ 
  (roots ((X - C (4 : ℚ)) * (X - C (2 : ℚ)) + (X - C (2 : ℚ)) * (X - C (6 : ℚ)))).prod = omnimath3403_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Polynomial ((X - 4)(X - 2) + (X - 2)(X - 6)) = 2*(X - 5)*(X - 2)
Roots (with multiplicity):

2 multiplicity 1
Product of roots: 10

Polynomial ((X - 1)(X - 2) + (X - 2)(X - 3)) = 2*(X - 2)**2
Roots (with multiplicity):
2 multiplicity 2
Product of roots: 4

Polynomial ((X - 0)(X - 1) + (X - 1)(X - 2)) = 2*(X - 1)**2
Roots (with multiplicity):
1 multiplicity 2
Product of roots: 1

Polynomial ((X - 2)(X - 3) + (X - 3)(X - 5)) = (X - 3)*(2*X - 7)
