[write_program]
The problem is somewhat abstract, indicating a set of natural numbers k where their real embedding is less than "a 8" and asking for the greatest element of that set.

As we lack exact definitions for `a 8` or the set itself, to assist in conjecturing, I'll write a Python program to enumerate values of k and check the inequality `k < a(8)` for some candidate functions `a(n)`. Since the problem is inspired by real embeddings, I'll try functions like `a(n) = n + fractional part` or similar. Given the abstraction, I will try some sample functions for `a(8)` and enumerate k to find the maximal k < a(8).

This will help identify possible answers for the greatest integer k less than a(8).

```python
# Enumerate possible values of k such that k < a(8).
# Here, we test a few sample functions a(n):
# 1) a(n) = n + 0.7
# 2) a(n) = n + 0.3
# 3) a(n) = n exactly
# 4) a(n) from a more complicated function

def test_cases():
    funcs = [
        ("a(n) = n + 0.7", lambda n: n + 0.7),
        ("a(n) = n + 0.3", lambda n: n + 0.3),
        ("a(n) = n", lambda n: n),
        ("a(n) = n + 1/sqrt(2)", lambda n: n + 1/1.414213562),
    ]
    n = 8
    for desc, a in funcs:
        bound = a(n)
        print(f"Testing {desc} with n={n}, a({n})={bound}")
        # Enumerate possible k in natural numbers up to bound + 5
        max_k = -1
        for k in range(int(bound)+5):
            if k < bound:
                print(f"k={k} < a({n})={bound}")
                if k > max_k:
                    max_k = k
        print(f"Greatest k < a({n}) = {max_k}")
        print("")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_cases()
