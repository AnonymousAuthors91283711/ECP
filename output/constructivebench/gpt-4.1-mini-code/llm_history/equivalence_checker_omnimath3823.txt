Ground Truth Answer: {(5, 3)}
Proposed Answer: {(m,n) | m = 2*n - 1 ∧ n ≥ 3}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding pairs (m,n) where there are infinitely many positive integers 'a' satisfying the given equation.

2. The ground truth answer claims that only (5,3) satisfies this condition.

3. The proposed answer suggests that all pairs where m = 2n-1 and n ≥ 3 satisfy the condition.

The proposed answer is much broader than the ground truth. While (5,3) does satisfy m = 2n-1 (since 5=2*3-1), the ground truth claims this is the only solution, while the proposed answer claims there are infinitely many solutions.

Testing with n=4 (m=7): It's not immediately obvious that (7,4) would satisfy the original condition, and the ground truth suggests it doesn't.

Therefore, the proposed answer is incorrect as it includes many pairs that shouldn't be solutions according to the ground truth.
