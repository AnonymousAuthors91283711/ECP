The problem describes a sequence of real numbers \(P, Q, R, S\) with consecutive differences related by given multipliers: \(Q - P = 1\), \(R - Q = 2(Q - P) = 2\), and \(S - R = 3(R - Q) = 6\). The goal is to find the value \(S - P\).

We can compute \(S - P = (Q - P) + (R - Q) + (S - R)\) using the given relations for sample values, then print these results directly.

```python
# Enumerate values of P starting from 0 with Q-P =1 fixed to simplify
# and compute and print S-P as sum of differences.
def main():
    # Given:
    # Q - P = 1
    # R - Q = 2 * (Q - P) = 2 * 1 = 2
    # S - R = 3 * (R - Q) = 3 * 2 = 6
    # So, S - P = (Q - P) + (R - Q) + (S - R) = 1 + 2 + 6 = 9
    
    for P in range(3):  # sample P values
        Q = P + 1
        R = Q + 2 * (Q - P)  # R = Q + 2*1 = Q + 2 = P + 3
        S = R + 3 * (R - Q)  # S = R + 3*2 = R + 6 = P + 9
        S_minus_P = S - P  # should be 9 always
        print(f"P={P}, Q={Q}, R={R}, S={S}, S-P={S_minus_P}")
    print("Conjectured omnimath3134_answer = 9")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
