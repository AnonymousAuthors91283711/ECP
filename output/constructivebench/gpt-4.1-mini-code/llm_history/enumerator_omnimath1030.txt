The problem defines a sequence \(a_n\) with \(a_1 = 3\) and the recursion: 
\[ a_{n+1} = (n+1) a_n - n. \]
We seek the least integer \(m \geq 2005\) such that \((a_{m+1}-1) \mid (a_m^2 - 1)\).

We will:
- Generate \(a_n\) for \(n\) from 1 up to a bit beyond 2005.
- Check divisibility condition.
- Print candidates found.
- Print the minimal \(m\) found.

Since \(a_n\) grows fast, we will use Python's arbitrary precision integers, and test only a small range above 2005 for efficiency and clarity.

```python
def main():
    a = {1: 3}
    max_n = 2025  # check a bit beyond 2005
    # Compute a_n using the recursion a_{n+1}=(n+1)*a_n - n
    for n in range(1, max_n+1):
        if n > 1:
            a[n] = n * a[n-1] - (n-1)
    # Check divisibility condition for m≥2005
    candidates = []
    for m in range(2005, max_n):
        lhs = a[m+1] - 1
        rhs = a[m]**2 - 1
        if rhs % lhs == 0:
            print(f"Candidate m={m}: (a[m+1]-1)={lhs} divides (a[m]^2-1)={rhs}.")
            candidates.append(m)
    if candidates:
        answer = min(candidates)
        print(f"Minimal m≥2005 satisfying condition: {answer}")
    else:
        print("No candidates found up to", max_n)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
[refine_program]
The provided program attempts to calculate the sequence values a_n using the recursion and then find all m ≥ 2005 such that (a_{m+1} - 1) divides (a_m^2 - 1). 

Judgement:
- The program correctly implements the recursion.
- It checks the divisibility condition exactly as stated.
- It prints candidates immediately and also reports minimal m at the end.
- However, the problem is that the sequence a_n grows very quickly (factorially-like), and the program uses Python integers without optimization or modular arithmetic but still should handle large integers—this is acceptable.
- The main problem is the indexing in the recursion and divisibility checks. The recursion is defined as a_(n+1) = (n+1)*a_n - n for n≥1 with a_1=3.
- In the program, for n from 1 to max_n+1 it assigns a[n] = n*a[n-1] - (n-1) for n>1, which matches the recursion perfectly.
- The divisibility check uses lhs = a[m+1] - 1 and rhs = a[m]^2 - 1.
- The iteration for candidate checking goes from m=2005 to max_n. Here max_n=2025.
- The program reports no candidates found, hence no output except the "No candidates found..." message.
- Given the problem and reasoning, the minimal m≥2005 satisfying the divisibility can exist but is likely larger than 2025.
- The program's cutoff at 2025 might be too low, thus no candidates found.
- To improve, increase max_n to a larger number (e.g., 2050 or 2100).
- Also, to avoid memory overhead, we can use only last two computed values a_n and a_{n+1} rather than storing all.
- Printing candidates immediately is preserved.
- Limit tokens output by not printing all candidates beyond a number.
- Since the problem requests enumeration up to some threshold and then the minimal m, we comply.
- Hence, the program is logically correct but fails practical enumeration due to too small search range.

Conclusion: The original program is rejected due to an insufficient search range leading to no candidates found, and inefficient storage.

[refine_program]
The provided problem is a formal theorem statement in Lean mathlib style, outlining a recurrence relation and a divisibility condition, and it asks for the least natural number \( m \geq 2005 \) satisfying a certain divisibility condition. However, there is no actual Python program provided — the "Program" field is None, and the enumerated answers are "Error: Program is empty."

Since there's no program to evaluate for correctness or completeness, the original submission cannot be accepted.

I will therefore reject the original submission and provide a Python program that attempts to enumerate \( m \geq 2005 \) where the divisibility condition holds, based on the given recurrence, and print all such candidates (or at least enough candidates), streaming outputs immediately. The code will compute the sequence \( a(n) \) from \( n=1 \) upward, then for each \( m \geq 2005 \), check whether \( (a(m+1) - 1) \mid (a(m)^2-1) \).

Because the problem likely involves very large numbers, I will only go up to some reasonable limit (e.g., \( m=2020 \)) to keep outputs short and computation feasible, printing candidates as they're found. Then print the minimal such \( m \).
