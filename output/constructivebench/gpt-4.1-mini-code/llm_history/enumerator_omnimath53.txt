The problem involves finding the smallest \( n \) such that for any family of \( n \) subsets of a 100-element set, there exist three indexed subsets \( A_i, A_j, A_k \) with \( i < j < k \) forming a "chain" of subset relations either ascending or descending. This relates to order theory and combinatorics on sets.

To explore this, we'll enumerate values of \( n \) starting from small integers, and for each \( n \), try to construct families of sets without such chains. If none exist, then \( n \) is at least the minimal size showing the property.

We will:
- Fix the size of the universe \( |X| = 5 \) (smaller for computational feasibility).
- Enumerate families of subsets indexed by \( n \) (up to a reasonable upper bound).
- For each family, verify if a triple \( i < j < k \) exists with chains as defined.
- Print candidate \( n \) values if families exist without chains (showing property fails).
- Print explicit confirmation for some \( n \) if no such family exists (property holds).

The small universe size means the results are exploratory heuristics towards the real problem with 100. We output directly streaming these results.

```python
from itertools import combinations, chain, product
from sys import stdout

def powerset(s):
    # Return list of all subsets of s
    s = list(s)
    return chain.from_iterable(combinations(s, r) for r in range(len(s)+1))

def is_chain(a, b, c):
    # a,b,c are sets, check if a⊆b⊆c or c⊆b⊆a
    return (a <= b and b <= c) or (c <= b and b <= a)

def has_chain(family):
    n = len(family)
    # check triples i<j<k for chains
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            for k in range(j+1, n):
                if is_chain(family[i], family[j], family[k]):
                    return True
    return False

def main():
    universe = set(range(5))
    subsets = list(map(set, powerset(universe)))
    max_n = 7  # upper bound for speed
    print(f"Universe size: {len(universe)}; total subsets: {len(subsets)}")
    print("Testing values of n with attempts to find families without required chains...")
    # For each n, try some samples to find a family with NO chain - if none found after tries, print no
    for n in range(3, max_n+1):
        print(f"\nn = {n}")
        found_no_chain = False
        # Instead of full search (too big), try random samples of families
        # But to keep determinate, try subsets of first len(subsets) choose n greedily
        # To reduce complexity, try only subsets in lex order, sample first 1000 combinations max
        from itertools import islice
        attempt_count = 0
        limit_attempts = 1000
        for family_indices in islice(combinations(range(len(subsets)), n), limit_attempts):
            family = [subsets[i] for i in family_indices]
            if not has_chain(family):
                # Found family of size n with no required chain
                print("No chain family found:", family)
                found_no_chain = True
                break
            attempt_count += 1
        if not found_no_chain:
            print(f"All tested families of size {n} contain required chain.")
            print(f"Suggest minimal n satisfies n ≤ {n}")
            # We expect minimal n ≥3, so print minimal found up to now and break
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This program enumerates subsets for a small universe \( |X|=5 \), tests small \( n \) values for families failing the chain condition, printing positive samples or confirmation of coverage. It is a heuristic tool aiding conjecture towards the problem's minimal answer.
