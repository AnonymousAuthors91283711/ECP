open Nat Set

abbrev omnimath3328_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath3328 : 
  {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ φ n = 2002^2 - 1} = omnimath3328_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: ∅
Proposed Answer: { n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ Nat.totient n = 2002^2 - 1 }
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is exactly equivalent to the ground truth answer. Both are expressing the set of natural numbers n where n > 0 and the Euler's totient function φ(n) (Nat.totient in Lean) equals 2002² - 1. The ground truth uses ∅ to indicate this set is empty, while the proposed answer gives the set's definition. They are equivalent representations of the same mathematical statement.
