The problem deals with covering all pairs of adjacent points in a 3Ã—3 grid using a minimal set of "guesses". Each guess is a cell in the grid, and for every "edge" (pair of adjacent cells), at least one guess must be on one of the two cells. We want to find the smallest number n of guesses to cover all edges.

We'll enumerate guesses sets of increasing size, check if they cover all edges, and print each candidate solution. Finally, print the minimal number of guesses found.

```python
# Enumerate minimal guesses that cover all edges in a 3x3 grid.
# Points: (r,c) with r,c in [0..2]. Edges: pairs of adjacent points horizontally or vertically.
from itertools import combinations

points = [(r, c) for r in range(3) for c in range(3)]
# Build edges: pairs of points differing by 1 in row or col only
edges = []
for r in range(3):
    for c in range(3):
        if r < 2:
            edges.append({(r, c), (r+1, c)})
        if c < 2:
            edges.append({(r, c), (r, c+1)})

def covers(guesses):
    # For each edge, check if guesses intersects it.
    for edge in edges:
        if not edge.intersection(guesses):
            return False
    return True

min_n = 9
# Try sets from size 1 to 9, stop early if found
for n in range(1, 10):
    found_any = False
    for guesses in combinations(points, n):
        guess_set = set(guesses)
        if covers(guess_set):
            found_any = True
            print(f"Candidate with n={n}: guesses={sorted(guess_set)}")
    if found_any:
        min_n = n
        print(f"Minimal number of guesses needed: {min_n}")
        break
```
