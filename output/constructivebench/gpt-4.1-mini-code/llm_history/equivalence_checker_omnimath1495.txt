Ground Truth Answer: fun a b => a ^ (logb 2 a) * 2 ^ (b ^ 2)
Proposed Answer: fun a b => a * b * (a ^ b) * 8
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives us two equations:
   - a * 2^b = 8
   - a^b = 2

2. The ground truth answer expresses the solution in terms of logarithms, which makes sense since we have exponential relationships.

3. The proposed answer suggests a much simpler expression: a * b * (a^b) * 8

Let's test with specific values that satisfy the given conditions:
- Let b = 1, then from a^1 = 2 we get a = 2
- Check first equation: 2 * 2^1 = 4 ≠ 8 → invalid
- Let b = 2, then a^2 = 2 ⇒ a = √2
- Check first equation: √2 * 2^2 = 4√2 ≈ 5.656 ≠ 8 → invalid
- Let b = 3, then a^3 = 2 ⇒ a = 2^(1/3)
- Check first equation: 2^(1/3) * 2^3 = 2^(1/3 + 3) ≈ 8.74 ≠ 8 → invalid

This suggests there might be no real solutions that satisfy both equations, making the problem ill-posed. However, the ground truth answer is at least mathematically consistent with the problem's structure, while the proposed answer doesn't seem to relate correctly to the given equations.
