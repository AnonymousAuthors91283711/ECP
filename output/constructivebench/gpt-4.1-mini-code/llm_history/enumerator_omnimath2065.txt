The problem is: find the smallest sum \(a+b+c+d\) of positive integers \(a,b,c,d\) such that
- \(\gcd(a,c) = 1\),
- \(\gcd(b,d) = 1\),
- \(\gcd(a,b) \neq 1\),
- \(\gcd(b,c) \neq 1\),
- \(\gcd(c,d) \neq 1\),
- \(\gcd(d,a) \neq 1\).

We enumerate tuples \((a,b,c,d)\) with all positive integers, check the conditions, and print tuples and sums as found, to detect the minimal sum. We'll try small values up to a reasonable limit like 20 to keep output constrained.

```python
from math import gcd

def conditions(a,b,c,d):
    return (a>0 and b>0 and c>0 and d>0 and
            gcd(a,c)==1 and gcd(b,d)==1 and
            gcd(a,b)>1 and gcd(b,c)>1 and gcd(c,d)>1 and gcd(d,a)>1)

max_val = 20
found = []
print("Enumerating tuples (a,b,c,d) with 1 ≤ a,b,c,d ≤ 20:")
for s in range(4, 4*max_val+1):  # minimal sum 4, maximal 80
    for a in range(1, min(s, max_val)+1):
        for b in range(1, min(s - a, max_val)+1):
            for c in range(1, min(s - a - b, max_val)+1):
                d = s - a - b - c
                if d <= 0 or d > max_val:
                    continue
                if conditions(a,b,c,d):
                    print(f"Found: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}, sum={s}")
                    found.append(s)
    if found:
        least = min(found)
        print(f"Minimal sum found: {least}")
        break
```
This will output all tuples meeting the conditions with minimal sum and print the minimal sum found as the answer candidate.
