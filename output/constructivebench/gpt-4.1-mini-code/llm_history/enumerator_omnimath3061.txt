[write_program]
The problem asks to find the greatest integer \( n \) that can be expressed as the product of three distinct elements \( a, b, c \) from the set \( S = \{-6, -4, -2, 0, 1, 3, 5, 7\} \), with all three elements distinct and each being in \( S \).

The program below will:
- Enumerate all triples (a, b, c) with distinct values from S.
- Compute the product \( a \times b \times c \).
- Print each product immediately when found.
- Track and print the maximum product found at the end.

This allows exploration and conjecture about the maximum product from three distinct elements of S.

```python
# Enumerate all products of three distinct elements from S and track max product.

S = [-6, -4, -2, 0, 1, 3, 5, 7]

max_product = None

for i in range(len(S)):
    a = S[i]
    for j in range(len(S)):
        if j == i:
            continue
        b = S[j]
        for k in range(len(S)):
            if k == i or k == j:
                continue
            c = S[k]
            product = a * b * c
            print(product)  # Streaming intermediate results
            if max_product is None or product > max_product:
                max_product = product

print("Maximum product:", max_product)
```
