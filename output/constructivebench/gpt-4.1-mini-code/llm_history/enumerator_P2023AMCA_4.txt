[write_program]
The problem involves analyzing the number of digits (in base 10) of the number 8^5 * 5^10 * 15^2. Let's write a Python program to compute this product, then count and print the digits length. We'll also print the number itself for verification.

```python
# Compute 8^5 * 5^10 * 15^2 and print its digit length and value
def main():
    val = (8 ** 5) * (5 ** 10) * (15 ** 2)
    digits = str(val)
    print("Value:", val)
    print("Number of digits:", len(digits))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
