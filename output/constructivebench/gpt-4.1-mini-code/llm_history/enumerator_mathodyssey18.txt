The problem involves two two-digit numbers a and b (both between 10 and 99), such that 100a + b and 201a + b are both perfect squares. We want to find all such pairs (a, b) and conjecture the sum a + b.

We will enumerate all possible a, b in the specified range, check if 100a + b and 201a + b are perfect squares, print any pairs found, and finally print their sums.

```python
import math

def is_square(x):
    r = int(math.isqrt(x))
    return r*r == x

def main():
    print("Searching for (a,b) with 10 ≤ a,b ≤ 99,")
    print("such that 100a + b and 201a + b are perfect squares...")
    found = []
    for a in range(10, 100):
        for b in range(10, 100):
            x = 100*a + b
            y = 201*a + b
            if is_square(x) and is_square(y):
                print(f"a={a}, b={b}, 100a+b={x} (={int(math.isqrt(x))}^2), 201a+b={y} (={int(math.isqrt(y))}^2)")
                found.append((a,b))
    print("Candidate sums a+b:")
    sums = [a+b for (a,b) in found]
    for s in sorted(set(sums)):
        print(s)
    if sums:
        print("Minimum a+b:", min(sums))
        print("Maximum a+b:", max(sums))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
