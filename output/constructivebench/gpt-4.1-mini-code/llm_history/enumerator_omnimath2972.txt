The problem seems to be about verifying or conjecturing the value of (4 * x) / 360 given the equation 4 * x + 20 + 140 = 360 with 0 < x < 180.

Let's:
- Solve for x using the equation
- Then compute (4 * x) / 360 exactly
- Print values immediately

We'll do some verification with sampled values, but since the equation fixes x, it's actually a direct computation.

```python
# Python program to enumerate possible answers for (4*x)/360 given 4*x + 20 + 140 = 360, 0 < x < 180

def main():
    # Given equation: 4*x + 20 + 140 = 360
    # Solve for x:
    # 4*x + 160 = 360 => 4*x = 200 => x = 50
    x = 50
    print(f"x = {x}")
    
    # Check 0 < x < 180
    if x <= 0 or x >= 180:
        print("No valid x found in (0,180)")
        return
    
    # Compute (4*x)/360 exactly
    numerator = 4 * x  # 200
    denominator = 360
    # Simplify fraction 200/360
    from math import gcd
    g = gcd(numerator, denominator)
    numerator_simpl = numerator // g
    denominator_simpl = denominator // g
    print(f"(4*x)/360 = {numerator_simpl}/{denominator_simpl}")
    
    # Also print decimal approximation
    approx = numerator / denominator
    print(f"Decimal approximation: {approx}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
