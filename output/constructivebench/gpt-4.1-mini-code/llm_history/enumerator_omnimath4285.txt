This problem involves lists of natural numbers with length at least 2, chained by the relation: consecutive elements satisfy a = 2b or a = 5b or b = 2a or b = 5a, and their sum equals 2023. We want to characterize such lists (the "omnimath4285_answer").

To explore, we enumerate lists of length 2 to 4 with elements up to a certain bound, checking the chain condition and summing to 2023. This will help to conjecture properties of these lists.

```python
# Enumerate lists l of length 2 to 4 with elements > 0, sum 2023,
# and each consecutive pair satisfies the chain condition:
# a=2b or a=5b or b=2a or b=5a.

def chain_condition(a, b):
    return a == 2*b or a == 5*b or b == 2*a or b == 5*a

def check_chain(lst):
    return all(chain_condition(lst[i], lst[i+1]) for i in range(len(lst)-1))

max_elem = 2023  # max element not exceeding sum
target = 2023

print("Enumerating candidate lists...")

# We restrict length to 2, 3, 4 for brevity.
# For length 2: a,b in [1..2022], a+b=2023, chain condition holds.
for a in range(1, target):
    b = target - a
    if chain_condition(a, b):
        print(f"Length=2: {a}, {b}")

# For length 3: a,b,c positive, a+b+c=2023
# Enumerate a,b, compute c=2023 - a - b if valid.
for a in range(1, target-1):
    for b in range(1, target - a):
        c = target - a - b
        if c < 1:
            continue
        if chain_condition(a,b) and chain_condition(b,c):
            print(f"Length=3: {a}, {b}, {c}")

# For length 4: a,b,c,d positive, a+b+c+d=2023
# Enumerate a,b,c, compute d
for a in range(1, target-2):
    for b in range(1, target - a -1):
        for c in range(1, target - a - b):
            d = target - a - b - c
            if d < 1:
                continue
            if chain_condition(a,b) and chain_condition(b,c) and chain_condition(c,d):
                print(f"Length=4: {a}, {b}, {c}, {d}")
```
