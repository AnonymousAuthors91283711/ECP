The problem involves evaluating \(\sqrt{105^3 - 104^3}\) and finding an integer answer. I will enumerate squares of integers near the approximate value to check if the expression is a perfect square and print candidates.

```python
# Enumerate integer values near sqrt(105^3 - 104^3)
def main():
    val = 105**3 - 104**3
    print(f"Value inside sqrt: {val}")
    approx = int(val**0.5)
    print(f"Approximate sqrt: {approx}")

    # Check values in a small range near approx if square equals val
    for x in range(max(0, approx - 5), approx + 6):
        sq = x*x
        if sq == val:
            print(f"Perfect square found: {x}")
        else:
            # Print approximate matches with difference under 10
            diff = abs(sq - val)
            if diff < 10:
                print(f"Close square: {x}^2 = {sq}, difference = {diff}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
