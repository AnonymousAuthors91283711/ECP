abbrev omnimath1122_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath1122 : 
  (choose 6 4) * (2/3)^5 * (1/3)^2 + (choose 6 4) * (1/3)^5 * (2/3)^2 = omnimath1122_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: choose(6,4) = 15
(2/3)^5 = 32/243
(1/3)^2 = 1/9
Term 1 = C(6,4)*(2/3)^5*(1/3)^2 = 160/729
(1/3)^5 = 1/243
(2/3)^2 = 4/9
Term 2 = C(6,4)*(1/3)^5*(2/3)^2 = 20/729
Sum = Term 1 + Term 2 = 20/81. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
<<<(20 : ℚ) / 81>>>
