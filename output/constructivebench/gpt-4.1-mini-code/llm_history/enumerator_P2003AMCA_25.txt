The problem involves finding the number of real numbers \( a \) for which there exists a positive \( b \) such that the set \(\{x \mid a x^2 + b x \geq 0\}\) equals the range of \(\sqrt{a x^2 + b x}\). Intuitively, we want pairs \((a,b)\) with \(b>0\) where the subset of \(\mathbb{R}\) defined by the quadratic inequality matches the range of the square root expression, which is nonnegative by definition.

To explore this problem numerically, I will:

- Fix \(b\) to some positive values (e.g. 1, 2).
- For many candidate integer \(a\) values (say from -5 to 5), examine the set \(\{x \mid a x^2 + b x \geq 0\}\) and the range of \(y = \sqrt{a x^2 + b x}\).
- Check if those two sets are equal as subsets of \(\mathbb{R}\).
- Print \(a,b\) pairs where equality holds.

This code prints all such \(a\) for sample \(b\) values and the potential answer to the cardinality.

```python
# Enumerate possible 'a' for sample positive 'b' and check the set equality condition.
# We approximate set equality numerically by testing enough points.

import math

def quadratic_expr(a, b, x):
    return a * x * x + b * x

def set_condition(a, b):
    # Check if {x | a x^2 + b x >= 0} equals range(sqrt(a x^2 + b x))
    # The set side is subsets of x in real numbers
    # The range side is all y = sqrt(a x^2 + b x) for x in domain

    # Since range(sqrt(..)) is nonnegative real outputs,
    # {x | a x^2 + b x >= 0} is a set of x-values, so we must clarify
    # The problem actually says these two sets equal: 
    # The set {x | condition} equals the range of the sqrt function.
    # Since sqrt returns values, and the left set is of x values, these sets can't be equal literally.
    # But in the problem statement, {x | ...} equals range(sqrt(...)). This must mean:
    # The set {x | a x^2 + b x >= 0} equals the set of values y that sqrt returns.
    # It's natural if the set is the set of values of quadratic, i.e.,
    # The problem likely means the set of outputs of the function a x^2 + b x for x with a x^2+b x >=0 equals
    # the range of sqrt(a x^2 + b x): these two sets equal on the y-values.

    # Therefore the set {a x^2 + b x | x in R, a x^2 + b x >= 0} equals { sqrt(a x^2 + b x) | x in R }.

    # Since sqrt(a x^2 + b x) >= 0, the RHS is a subset of nonnegative reals.
    # The LHS is all nonnegative values taken by the quadratic on the corresponding domain.

    # Let's check if the range of the quadratic on the domain where quadratic >=0 equals the set of values of sqrt.

    # Key idea: The set {a x^2 + b x | a x^2 + b x >=0} is [0, max] or something else.
    # The set {sqrt(a x^2 + b x)} is [0, sqrt(max)].

    # They can't be equal sets since the LHS set may contain bigger numbers than RHS.

    # Hence, the problem wants values a,b such that 
    # {x | a x^2 + b x >= 0} = range( sqrt(a x^2 + b x) )
    # Maybe it means sets of real x where the f(x) >= 0 equals the range of the function y = sqrt(f(x)) for x in R.

    # We'll interpret it literally: sets of x values equal to sets of y values can't hold.
    # Probably the problem wants values a,b such that:
    # The set of x with f(x)>=0 equals the set of y values of sqrt(f(x)) as a subset of R.

    # Which can only happen if these sets coincide as sets on real line.

    # So let's just find pairs a,b where this equality is plausible:
    # We'll check whether the set of x with f(x)>=0 equals the range of sqrt(f(x)).

    # Since sqrt(f(x)) is always >= 0,
    # set of y values is subset of [0, +âˆž),
    # the set of x values is a subset of R.

    # The only way equality can hold is if both are intervals like [0, c] or R.

    # Let's check concrete a,b, sample x values, and compare the sets numerically.

    # Sample x range, dense enough:
    xs = [i*0.1 for i in range(-100, 101)] # from -10 to 10

    set_x = set()
    for x in xs:
        val = quadratic_expr(a,b,x)
        if val >= 0:
            set_x.add(round(x,2))

    set_y = set()
    for x in xs:
        val = quadratic_expr(a,b,x)
        if val >= 0:
            y = math.sqrt(val)
            set_y.add(round(y,2))

    # Now check if set_x and set_y are equal as sets of reals rounded to 2 decimals
    # but sets with elements in different domains: x values vs y values
    # So equality is only if these two sets coincide numerically

    # So check intersection and symmetric difference
    diff = set_x.symmetric_difference(set_y)

    return len(diff)==0
