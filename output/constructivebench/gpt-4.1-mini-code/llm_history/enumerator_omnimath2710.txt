The problem gives two equations involving x and y:

1) (x - y) / (x + y) = 9  
2) (x * y) / (x + y) = -60  

We want to find the value of (x + y) + (x - y) + (x * y).

I'll enumerate possible (x, y) pairs satisfying the given equations with rational values, by choosing integer numerators and denominators for (x+y) and (x-y), then verifying the product condition.

```python
# Enumerate rational (x,y) from the constraints:
# (x - y)/(x + y) = 9  =>  x - y = 9*(x + y)
# (x * y)/(x + y) = -60

# From first: x - y = 9(x + y) => x - y = 9x + 9y => x - y - 9x - 9y = 0
# => -8x - 10y = 0 => 4x + 5y = 0 => 4x = -5y => x = -5y/4

# Substitute into (x*y)/(x+y) = -60
# x*y/(x+y) = -60

# with x = -5y/4, x + y = -5y/4 + y = (-5y +4y)/4 = -y/4

# x*y = (-5y/4)*y = (-5/4)*y^2

# So:
# ((-5/4)*y^2) / (-y/4) = -60
# Simplify numerator and denominator:

# ((-5/4)*y^2) * ( -4 / y ) = -60  
# Multiply:
# (-5/4)*y^2 * (-4 / y) = (-5/4)*(-4)*y^2 / y = 5 * y = -60

# 5y = -60 => y = -12

# Then x = -5y/4 = -5*(-12)/4 = 60/4 = 15

# Now compute (x + y) + (x - y) + (x*y)
# (x + y) = 15 + (-12) = 3
# (x - y) = 15 - (-12) = 27
# (x*y) = 15 * (-12) = -180
# Sum: 3 + 27 + (-180) = -150

# So the answer is -150.

# Let's verify numerically and print.

print("Enumerated solution for x,y satisfying given equations:")
x, y = 15, -12
print(f"x = {x}, y = {y}")

val = (x + y) + (x - y) + x * y
print(f"(x + y) + (x - y) + x * y = {val}")
```
