The problem involves finding natural numbers \( n \) with \( 0 < n < 2017 \) such that 720 divides the integer expression
\[
1 + n + \sum_{i=1}^6 \frac{n^i}{i!}.
\]
Since \( i! \) grows quickly, the sum resembles a partial sum of the exponential series. The program below enumerates all such \( n \) in \(1 \ldots 2016\), computes the sum as integer numerators divided by factorial denominators, checks divisibility by 720, and prints solutions immediately.

```python
from math import factorial

# 720 divides (1 + n + sum_{i=1}^6 n^i / i!)
# We'll compute numerator = 1*LCM + n*LCM + sum n^i * (LCM / i!)
# where LCM = 720 (since the denominator factorials divide 720).

LCM = 720

for n in range(1, 2017):
    total_num = LCM  # 1 * LCM
    total_num += n * LCM  # n * LCM
    # sum from 1 to 6 of n^i * (LCM / i!)
    for i in range(1, 7):
        total_num += (n ** i) * (LCM // factorial(i))
    if total_num % LCM == 0:
        print(n)
```
