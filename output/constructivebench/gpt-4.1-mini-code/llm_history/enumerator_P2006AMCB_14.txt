The problem appears to involve finding all triples \((B, J, N)\) of natural numbers, with constraints \(B > 0, J > 0, N > 1\), such that the equation:

\[
\frac{4BN + 5JN}{100} = \frac{253}{100}
\]

holds. Simplifying, this means

\[
4 B N + 5 J N = 253
\]

Given that \(B, J, N\) are positive integers with \(N > 1\), we want to enumerate all possible triples \((B, J, N)\) satisfying this linear Diophantine equation. Then presumably, we also want to compute or conjecture the value of \(P2006AMCB_14\_answer(B, J, N)\) and see which triples yield the target value \(165/100\).

Since the original code is incomplete (marked with `sorry`), we'll just enumerate solutions of the Diophantine equation and print them. We pick small \(N > 1\) and iterate over reasonable ranges of \(B\) and \(J\).

We want the enumeration to be efficient and to print results immediately.

```python
# Enumerate all positive integers B, J, N with N>1 such that 4*B*N + 5*J*N = 253.

def main():
    target = 253
    results = []
    print("Enumerating (B,J,N) with 4*B*N + 5*J*N = 253, B>0, J>0, N>1")
    for N in range(2, 20):  # Sample N values
        # For each N, 4BN + 5JN = 253 => N(4B + 5J) = 253
        # so 4B + 5J = 253 // N if divisible
        if target % N == 0:
            m = target // N
            # 4B + 5J = m
            # For J>0, B>0, enumerate J
            for J in range(1, m):  # J must be less than m to keep B positive
                diff = m - 5*J
                if diff <= 0:
                    break
                if diff % 4 == 0:
                    B = diff // 4
                    if B > 0:
                        print(f"(B,J,N) = ({B},{J},{N}) satisfies 4*B*N + 5*J*N = {target}")
                        # Here we could also print P2006AMCB_14_answer if we had its definition

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
