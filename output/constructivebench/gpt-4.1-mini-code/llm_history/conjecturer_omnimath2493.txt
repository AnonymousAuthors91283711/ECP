abbrev omnimath2493_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath2493 : 
  card {s : Fin 10 → Fin 9 | 
    ∃ (t : Finset (Fin 9)), card t ≤ 3 ∧ 
    ∀ (i j : Fin 10), i ≤ j → s i ≤ s j} = omnimath2493_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Parameters: domain size=10, codomain size=9, max image size=3

Image size = 1, number of subsets = 9
Total functions with image size = 1: 9
Image size = 2, number of subsets = 36
Total functions with image size = 2: 396
Image size = 3, number of subsets = 84
Total functions with image size = 3: 5544

Total number of weakly increasing functions with image size ≤ 3: 5949. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<5949>>>
