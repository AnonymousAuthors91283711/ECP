We are interested in counting integers \( N \) between 1 and 999 inclusive such that there exists a real number \( x \) with \( x^{\lfloor x \rfloor} = N \).

Key insight:
- For integer \( k = \lfloor x \rfloor \), we want \( x^k = N \).
- Since \( x \) is real, and \( k \) is integer, \( x = \sqrt[k]{N} \).
- To have \( \lfloor x \rfloor = k \), then \( k \leq x < k+1\).
- So \( k \leq \sqrt[k]{N} < k+1 \).
- Raising all parts to \( k \)-th power (positive \( k \)), inequality becomes:
  
  \( k^k \leq N < (k+1)^k \).
  
- For each \( k \geq 1 \), \( N \) runs over integers in \([k^k, (k+1)^k)\).
  
We enumerate such intervals for \( k \) until \( k^k > 999 \).

For each valid \( k \), we list all integers \( N \) in \([k^k, \min((k+1)^k - 1, 999)]\).

At the end, extract the unique \( N \)'s and count them.

```python
# Enumerate integers N with 1 <= N < 1000 such that exists real x with floor(x)^x = N

max_N = 999
found = set()

k = 1
while True:
    low = k**k
    if low > max_N:
        break
    high = (k+1)**k - 1  # upper bound exclusive in inequality above; so inclusive here is -1
    if high > max_N:
        high = max_N
    # all integers N in [low, high] satisfy condition for some x with floor(x)=k
    for N in range(low, high+1):
        found.add(N)
        print(N)  # Streaming each found N immediately

    k += 1

print(f"Count of such N in [1..999]: {len(found)}")
```
