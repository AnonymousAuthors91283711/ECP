[write_program]
The given problem seems to involve computing the difference between a given sum and a fixed amount (20), then expressing the relative "change" as a percentage, and minimizing the absolute difference from some answer p. Your task is to find likely values for p by enumerating.

I will interpret the problem as: Given prices 7.99, 4.99, 2.99, 1.99, 0.99, compute the actual change = 20 - sum(prices). Then compute p = |(change / 20 * 100) - x| for some candidate x. The goal is to find all possible p values or candidates x.

Since the problem involves decimals, I will enumerate possible "change" amounts close to the computed change with small rounding adjustments (e.g., up to 1 cent up or down) to see possible p values.

The program will basically:
- compute the sum
- compute change = 20 - sum
- enumerate nearby values of change in cents, compute p = abs((change/20 * 100) - candidate)
- print candidate p values.

This should help conjecture the minimal absolute difference.

```python
# Enumerate possible percentage change discrepancies for given prices and fixed total 20
def main():
    prices = [7.99, 4.99, 2.99, 1.99, 0.99]
    total = 20.0
    sum_prices = sum(prices)
    change_exact = total - sum_prices  # exact change in dollars

    # For cents rounding errors, enumerate possible changes from change_exact -0.01 to +0.01 step 0.001
    # to find possible p = |(change/20 *100) - candidate_answer|
    # We'll just print p for candidates near (change_exact / 20 * 100)

    change_candidates = [change_exact + delta/1000 for delta in range(-10, 11)]  # Â±0.01 step 0.001
    percentage_changes = [(c/20)*100 for c in change_candidates]

    # As p = |percentage_change - x| = distance from some candidate answer x
    # Let's just print all percentage changes as possible p candidates (since p is measuring that difference)
    print(f"Sum prices: {sum_prices:.3f}, Exact change: {change_exact:.5f}")
    print("Enumerating percentage changes close to exact change /20 *100:")
    for pc in percentage_changes:
        print(f"{pc:.6f}")

if __name__=="__main__":
    main()
```
This prints precise percentage changes near the exact value, helping decode the minimal absolute difference p.
