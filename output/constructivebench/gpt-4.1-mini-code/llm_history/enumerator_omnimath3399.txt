[write_program]
The problem gives a set {19, 21, 23, 25, 27} from which we select variables a,b,c,d,q. We want to find q and assignments so that the sums:
a+b+q, c+d+q, a+c+17, b+d+17, a+d+13, b+c+13
are all equal to the same s.

The program enumerates all permutations of the 5 numbers assigned to a,b,c,d,q and checks if the equations hold.

```python
import itertools

vals = [19,21,23,25,27]

# Check if for given a,b,c,d,q the six expressions are equal
def check(a,b,c,d,q):
    s1 = a + b + q
    s2 = c + d + q
    s3 = a + c + 17
    s4 = b + d + 17
    s5 = a + d + 13
    s6 = b + c + 13
    return s1 == s2 == s3 == s4 == s5 == s6

print("Using set:", vals)
found_q = set()
for perm in itertools.permutations(vals):
    a,b,c,d,q = perm
    if check(a,b,c,d,q):
        print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}, q={q}")
        found_q.add(q)

if found_q:
    min_q = min(found_q)
    print("Minimum q found:", min_q)
else:
    print("No q found satisfying conditions.")
```
