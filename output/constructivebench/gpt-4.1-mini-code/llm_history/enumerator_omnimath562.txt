This problem asks to find all natural numbers n with 0 < n < 1000 such that the number of proper divisors of n except n itself is exactly 29. That means n has exactly 30 divisors including 1 and n.

We will enumerate n from 1 to 999, count the number of divisors, and print n if the number of proper divisors (excluding n) is 29, i.e., total divisors is 30. Finally, we print the answer set.

```python
# Enumerate n with exactly 30 divisors (so 29 proper divisors) for 1 < n < 1000.
def count_divisors(n):
    # Count number of divisors of n efficiently.
    count = 0
    i = 1
    while i*i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            count += 1 if i*i == n else 2
        i += 1
    return count

answers = []
for n in range(2, 1000):
    div_count = count_divisors(n)
    if div_count == 30:
        print(n)
        answers.append(n)

print("Candidates with 29 proper divisors (30 total):")
print(answers)
```
