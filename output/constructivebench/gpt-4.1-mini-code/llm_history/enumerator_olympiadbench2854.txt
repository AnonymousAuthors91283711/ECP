The given equation is:

6 * arctan(x) + 4 * arctan(3x) = π.

We want to find x such that this holds and then report x^2.

To assist, we can numerically enumerate values of x around a range and check when the left side approximates π, then print x^2 for those approximate solutions. Since arctan is involved, try rational values near likely solutions (like simple fractions) or values near 0.

Since the problem strongly involves arctan sums, candidates for x are likely small real numbers; we print exact squares when x is rational (fraction), otherwise float approximations.

We sample x over a small range and print results with values of left side near π (within some small epsilon).

```python
import math
from fractions import Fraction

def arctan(x):
    return math.atan(x)

def lhs(x):
    return 6*arctan(x) + 4*arctan(3*x)

epsilon = 1e-8
found = []

# Check for rational x with small denominators in range -1 to 1
print("Enumerating rational x in [-1,1] with denominators up to 10:")
for denom in range(1, 11):
    for numer in range(-denom, denom+1):
        x = Fraction(numer, denom)
        val = lhs(float(x))
        diff = abs(val - math.pi)
        if diff < 1e-6:
            x2 = x*x  # fraction squared
            print(f"x = {x}, lhs = {val:.8f}, difference = {diff:.2e}")
            print(f"x^2 = {x2} (exact)")
            found.append((float(x2), x2))

print("\nEnumerating floats x in [-1.5,1.5] with step 0.01:")
x = -1.5
while x <= 1.5:
    val = lhs(x)
    diff = abs(val - math.pi)
    if diff < 1e-5:
        print(f"x = {x:.3f}, lhs = {val:.8f}, difference = {diff:.2e}")
        print(f"x^2 = {x*x:.8f} (approx)")
        found.append((x*x, None))
    x += 0.01

if found:
    min_x2 = min(found, key=lambda t: t[0])
    print(f"\nMinimal x^2 found approximately: {min_x2[0]:.8f}")
else:
    print("No solutions found near pi.")
```
