Let's enumerate the sum \(\sum_{n=0}^{15} 2^n (-1)^{s(n)}\) where \(s(n)\) is the count of 1's in the binary representation of \(n\), then multiply by \(1/255\). We'll output each term's contribution and accumulate the sum exactly.

```python
def s(n):
    # Count number of 1s in binary representation of n
    return bin(n).count('1')

total = 0
print("n  s(n)  term = 2^n * (-1)^s(n)")
for n in range(16):
    sign = -1 if s(n) % 2 else 1
    term = sign * (2 ** n)
    total += term
    print(f"{n:2}  {s(n):2}   {term}")

# Multiply by 1/255 and print exact rational
from fractions import Fraction
result = Fraction(total, 255)
print(f"Sum = {total}")
print(f"(1/255) * Sum = {result} â‰ˆ {float(result)}")
```
