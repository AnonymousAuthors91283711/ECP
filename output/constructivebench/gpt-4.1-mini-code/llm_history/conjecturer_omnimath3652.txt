The error message indicates that the issue comes from the way the set and function equality are expressed, and from mixing propositions inside function definitions. In particular, the expression

```
f = fun x => a * x^2 + b * x + c ∧ a = 0 ∧ b = 0 ∧ c = 0 ∨ (a = 1 ∧ b = 0 ∧ c = 0)
```

is parsed incorrectly as `(f = (fun x => a * x^2 + b * x + c ∧ ...))`, which means `fun x => (something with ∧)` has type `ℝ → Prop` not `ℝ → ℝ`, causing type error.

We need to properly group the disjunction and conjunction so that the formula is:

`∃ a b c : ℝ, f = (fun x => a * x^2 + b * x + c) ∧ ((a=0 ∧ b=0 ∧ c=0) ∨ (a=1 ∧ b=0 ∧ c=0))`

This demands parentheses around conjunction/disjunction separately from `f = ...`.

Also, use parentheses carefully, and since `Set (ℝ → ℝ)` is `{f | ...}`, this works.

Hence, we can fix as:

```lean
{f | ∃ a b c : ℝ, f = fun x => a * x^2 + b * x + c ∧ ((a = 0 ∧ b = 0 ∧ c = 0) ∨ (a = 1 ∧ b = 0 ∧ c = 0))}
```

which is exactly the corrected syntax.

This set matches your enumerated answers: only the zero function, and the function f(x)=x².

The error arises because in the current proposed answer, the function is given by `fun x => a * x^2 + b * x + c ∧ ...` which is a function returning a Prop (the ∧ expression is a proposition), but the codomain should be ℝ.

To fix this, separate the definition of the function `fun x => a * x^2 + b * x + c` from the property it must satisfy on the coefficients `a, b, c`. So the set should be defined as:

{ f | ∃ a b c : ℝ, f = (fun x => a * x^2 + b * x + c) ∧ ((a = 0 ∧ b = 0 ∧ c = 0) ∨ (a = 1 ∧ b = 0 ∧ c = 0)) }

Written in Lean syntax, be careful with parentheses and the overall structure.

Hence the final answer is:

<<<
{ f : ℝ → ℝ |
  ∃ a b c : ℝ,
    f = (fun x => a * x^2 + b * x + c) ∧
    ((a = 0 ∧ b = 0 ∧ c = 0) ∨ (a = 1 ∧ b = 0 ∧ c = 0))
}
>>>
