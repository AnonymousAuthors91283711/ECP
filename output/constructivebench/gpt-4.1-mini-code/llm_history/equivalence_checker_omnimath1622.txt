abbrev omnimath1622_answer : ℕ → Prop := sorry
theorem omnimath1622 (n : ℕ) (hn : n > 0) : 
  omnimath1622_answer n := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun n => Even ⌊((n - 1)! : ℚ) / (n * (n + 1))⌋
Proposed Answer: fun n => (n = 1) ∨ (Nat.Prime n) ∨ (∃ k : ℕ, k * k = n) ∨ (n % 10 = 1)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for a property of natural numbers n > 0 (though the exact property isn't specified in the given code)
2. The ground truth answer involves factorials and floor division
3. The proposed answer gives four disjoint conditions: n=1, n is prime, n is a perfect square, or n ends with 1

These answers are clearly different in nature:
- The ground truth is a complex arithmetic condition involving factorials
- The proposed answer is a simple combination of basic number properties

There's no obvious mathematical equivalence between these two formulations. The proposed answer doesn't reference factorials or division at all, which are central to the ground truth.
