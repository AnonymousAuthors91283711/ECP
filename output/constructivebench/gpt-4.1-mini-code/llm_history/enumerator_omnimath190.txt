The problem involves finding an 11-element strictly increasing set \( A \subseteq \mathbb{N} \) such that every number from 1 to 1500 can be represented as a sum of some subset of \( A \). Among all such sets, we want the least 10th element \( a_{10} \).

To explore this, I'll enumerate 11-element strictly increasing sets where the 10th element ranges over a manageable domain. Then I will check if the sums of subsets cover 1 to 1500. Due to combinatorial explosion, I will simplify by using small ranges and print partial results to conjecture plausible minimal values for the 10th element.

```python
# Enumerate 11-element strictly increasing sets A (list) with 1 â‰¤ A[0] < ... < A[10]
# Among candidates with sum-subsets covering [1..1500], output the 10th element A[9] values.
# To keep feasible, limit search domains and print possible 10th elements found.

from itertools import combinations

def covers_range(A, n=1500):
    # Check if all sums from 1 to n are achievable from subsets of A using DP
    max_sum = sum(A)
    if max_sum < n:
        return False
    can = [False] * (n + 1)
    can[0] = True
    for x in A:
        for s in range(n, x - 1, -1):
            if can[s - x]:
                can[s] = True
    return all(can[1:])

def main():
    # To limit search, fix a max element high enough and min small enough
    min_start = 1
    max_end = 200
    card = 11

    # We try 11-element increasing sets with elements in range [1..max_end]
    # Filter those with a 10th element in a certain range and coverage of sums.

    # For performance, enumerate sets by combinations(range(1, max_end+1), 11)
    for A in combinations(range(min_start, max_end + 1), card):
        # Quickly skip if 10th element (index 9) out of certain range (e.g., <50 or >150) for experimentation
        a10 = A[9]
        if a10 < 40 or a10 > 150:
            continue
        # Check coverage
        if covers_range(A):
            print(f"Found set with a10={a10}:", A)
            # We print all for a while to conjecture
            # Stop if found a very small 10th element candidate
            if a10 <= 45:
                print("Smallest 10th element found <= 45, can conjecture minimum.")
                break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
