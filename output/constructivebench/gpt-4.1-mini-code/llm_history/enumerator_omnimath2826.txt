[write_program]
The problem involves evaluating an expression with real numbers and exponents, then identifying the answer. To assist, I'll write a Python program that calculates the expression for a range of input values, immediately printing results to observe patterns. Here, the expression is:

2 * (2)^2 + 3 * (2)^2

I will generalize this to explore expressions of the form:

2 * (x)^2 + 3 * (x)^2

for small integer values of x, printing each result immediately.

```python
# Evaluate and print values of the expression 2*x^2 + 3*x^2 for x in [1 .. 5]

def expression(x):
    return 2 * (x ** 2) + 3 * (x ** 2)

def main():
    for x in range(1, 6):
        val = expression(x)
        print(f"x = {x}, 2*x^2 + 3*x^2 = {val}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
