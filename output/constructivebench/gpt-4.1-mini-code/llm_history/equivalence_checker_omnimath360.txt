Ground Truth Answer: fun n => choose n 2
Proposed Answer: fun n => n * (n - 1) / 2
<<<True>>>

Explanation: The ground truth answer `choose n 2` represents the binomial coefficient "n choose 2", which calculates the number of ways to choose 2 elements from a set of n elements. The proposed answer `n * (n - 1) / 2` is exactly equal to `choose n 2` since the binomial coefficient can be expanded as n!/(2!(n-2)!) = n(n-1)/2. Therefore, the two answers are mathematically equivalent.
