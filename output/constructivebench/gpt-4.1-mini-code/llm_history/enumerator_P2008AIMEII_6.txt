The problem defines sequences \(a_n\) and \(b_n\) with initial values and recurrence relations, and asks for the value of \(\frac{b_{32}}{a_{32}}\). To explore the behavior and guess the exact value, we'll compute \(a_n, b_n\) for \(n=1\) to 32 as rational numbers and print the ratio \(\frac{b_n}{a_n}\) at each step.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Initial values
a = [None, Fraction(1)]
b = [None, Fraction(1)]

print("n a_n b_n b_n/a_n")
for n in range(2, 33):
    a_n = a[n-1] + 2 * b[n-1]
    b_n = -a[n-1] + 4 * b[n-1]
    a.append(a_n)
    b.append(b_n)
    ratio = b_n / a_n
    print(f"{n} {a_n} {b_n} {ratio}")

print("\nAnswer: b_32 / a_32 =", b[32] / a[32])
```
