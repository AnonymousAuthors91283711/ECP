The problem asks for the greatest prime divisor of the number \( K = (20^{21} \times 23^{21}) \), where \( K \) is factored and its prime divisors are considered. To assist in conjecturing the answer, the program below will:
- Compute the prime factors of \( 20^{21} \) and \( 23^{21} \).
- Combine their prime factors.
- Print all prime divisors of \( K \).
- Finally, print the maximum prime divisor found.

```python
# Enumerate prime divisors of (20^21 * 23^21)
# and print each prime divisor immediately.
# Then print the greatest prime divisor.

def prime_factors(n):
    # Return the set of prime factors of n
    i = 2
    factors = set()
    while i * i <= n:
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.add(i)
            n //= i
        i += 1
    if n > 1:
        factors.add(n)
    return factors

def main():
    T = 21
    # Factor bases
    base1 = 20
    base2 = 23

    # Get prime factors of bases
    pf1 = prime_factors(base1)
    pf2 = prime_factors(base2)
    # Prime divisors of K = primes dividing base1^T * base2^T
    primes = pf1.union(pf2)
    for p in sorted(primes):
        print(f"Prime divisor: {p}")
    max_p = max(primes)
    print(f"Greatest prime divisor: {max_p}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
