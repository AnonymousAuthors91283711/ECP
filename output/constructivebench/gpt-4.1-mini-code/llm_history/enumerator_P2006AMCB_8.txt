[write_program]
The problem relates a and b by the system: 
1 = (1/4)(2 + a) and 2 = (1/4)(1 + b). 
We want to find the value of a + b satisfying these equations.

To assist, I'll write a Python program that solves these linear equations symbolically and prints a, b, and a+b immediately on finding them.

```python
# Solve given linear system and print results
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

a, b = symbols('a b', real=True)

# System of equations:
# 1 = (1/4)(2 + a)  =>  4 = 2 + a  =>  a = 2
# 2 = (1/4)(1 + b)  =>  8 = 1 + b  =>  b = 7

eq1 = Eq(1, (1/4)*(2 + a))
eq2 = Eq(2, (1/4)*(1 + b))

sol = solve((eq1, eq2), (a, b))

for sol_a, sol_b in [sol]:
    print(f"a = {sol_a}")
    print(f"b = {sol_b}")
    print(f"a + b = {sol_a + sol_b}")
```
