This problem involves summing the reciprocals of binomial coefficients choose(n, 2009) for n â‰¥ 2009. We want to explore the sum for n in [2009..2009+k] for small k and observe how the partial sums behave.

We will:
- Compute choose(n, 2009) and sum the reciprocals for n = 2009..2019.
- Print exact fractions if possible.
- Print decimal approximations for clarity.
- Observe convergence behavior.

```python
from math import comb
from fractions import Fraction

def main():
    k_max = 10  # explore terms from n=2009 to 2009+10
    total = Fraction(0, 1)
    n_start = 2009
    print(f"Summing 1/choose(n,2009) for n={n_start} to n={n_start+k_max}:")
    for k in range(k_max+1):
        n = n_start + k
        c = comb(n, 2009)
        term = Fraction(1, c)
        total += term
        # print exact fraction and decimal approximation
        print(f"n={n}, choose={c}, term=1/{c}={term} ~= {float(term):.5e}, partial sum={float(total):.15f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
