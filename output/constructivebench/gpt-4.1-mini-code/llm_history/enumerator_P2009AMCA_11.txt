The problem defines a sequence F with initial values F(0)=1, F(1)=1, F(2)=5 and a recurrence for nâ‰¥0:  
F(n+3) = F(n+2) + 4*(n+2)  
We want to guess a closed form for F(n). Let's enumerate F(n) for n = 0 to 20 and print them to look for a pattern.

```python
def F(n):
    if n == 0: return 1
    if n == 1: return 1
    if n == 2: return 5
    # use bottom-up computation for efficiency
    vals = [1, 1, 5]
    for i in range(3, n+1):
        vals.append(vals[-1] + 4*(i-1))
    return vals[n]

print("n F(n)")
for n in range(21):
    val = F(n)
    print(n, val)
```
This will print the sequence values to help us conjecture the closed form.
