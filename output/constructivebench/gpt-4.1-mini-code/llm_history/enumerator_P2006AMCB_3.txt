The problem is about finding a natural number \( c \) and another natural number (here called \( P2006AMCB_3\_answer \)) that satisfy the system:
\[
c + x = 34
\]
\[
c - x = 14
\]
where \( x = P2006AMCB_3\_answer \).

From these equations, solving for \( c \) and \( x \):
\[
c + x = 34 \quad (1)
\]
\[
c - x = 14 \quad (2)
\]

Adding (1) and (2):
\[
2c = 48 \implies c = 24
\]

Subtracting (2) from (1):
\[
2x = 20 \implies x = 10
\]

So the answer here seems to be \( x=10 \). But the problem statement suggests enumerating candidates programmatically, so we willEnumerate all pairs \( (c, x) \) of natural numbers (0 <= c, x <= 34) that satisfy the equations, print each such candidate, and finally output the solution.

```python
# Enumerate candidates for c and x with constraints:
# c + x = 34 and c - x = 14.
# We search integers c,x in range 0..34.

for c in range(35):
    for x in range(35):
        if c + x == 34 and c - x == 14:
            print(f"Found solution: c={c}, x={x}")
```
