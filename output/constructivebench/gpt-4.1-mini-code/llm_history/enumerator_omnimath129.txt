The problem involves characterizing all real functions \( f \) satisfying a multiset equality involving its values at linear expressions and nested compositions. To gain insight, we will enumerate possible candidates by testing functions on sample inputs. Since the problem is symmetric and involves \( f(f(x)) \), polynomial or simple elementary functions (e.g., linear, identity, constant) are good starting guesses.

We will:
- Test candidate functions \( f \) on a few sample \( x,y \) pairs.
- Print the sample function clearly.
- Check if the multiset condition holds approximately (using numeric approximations).
- Print candidate functions that satisfy the condition at these sample inputs.

This enumeration might help conjecture the full answer set.

import math

# Define sample test points
test_points = [(0,0), (1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (2,3), (-2,-3)]

# Candidate functions in form of lambdas with a name
candidates = [
    ("identity", lambda x: x),
    ("constant_0", lambda x: 0),
    ("constant_1", lambda x: 1),
    ("negation", lambda x: -x),
    ("square", lambda x: x**2),
    ("cube", lambda x: x**3),
    ("linear_pos", lambda x: 2*x+1),
    ("linear_neg", lambda x: -3*x+2),
    ("abs", abs),
    ("reciprocal_plus1", lambda x: 1/(x+1) if x != -1 else float('inf')),
