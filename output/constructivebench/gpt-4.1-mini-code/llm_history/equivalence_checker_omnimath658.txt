Ground Truth Answer: 1
Proposed Answer: fib 2003 ^ 2 - fib 2002 * fib 2004
Let's analyze the problem and the answers carefully.

1. The problem involves Fibonacci numbers and asks about a rational expression r = (f2003/f2002 - f2004/f2003).

2. Simplifying r:
   r = (f2003² - f2002*f2004)/(f2002*f2003)

3. The ground truth answer is 1, meaning the numerator simplifies to ±1.

4. The proposed answer gives the numerator expression: fib 2003 ^ 2 - fib 2002 * fib 2004.

5. For Fibonacci numbers, there's a known identity:
   f_{n+1}^2 - f_n*f_{n+2} = (-1)^n (Cassini's identity)

6. For n=2001 (since f2002 corresponds to f_{n+1} when n=2001), this becomes:
   f2002² - f2001*f2003 = (-1)^2001 = -1

But the proposed answer is f2003² - f2002*f2004, which by the same identity with n=2002 would be:
f2003² - f2002*f2004 = (-1)^2002 = 1

This matches exactly with the ground truth answer of 1 (the numerator's absolute value).
