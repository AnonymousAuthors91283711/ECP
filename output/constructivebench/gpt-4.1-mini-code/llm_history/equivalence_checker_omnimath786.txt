Ground Truth Answer: ∅
Proposed Answer: {x : ℝ | x = 1}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the set of real numbers x that satisfy both:
   - exp(x*log2) + exp(x³*log2) = 2*exp(x²*log2)
   - Either exp(x*log2) ≠ exp(x²*log2) or exp(x²*log2) ≠ exp(x³*log2)

2. We can simplify the expressions using the fact that exp(a*log2) = 2^a:
   - The equation becomes: 2^x + 2^(x³) = 2*2^(x²)
   - Which simplifies to: 2^(x-1) + 2^(x³-1) = 2^(x²-1)

3. Testing x = 1:
   - 2^0 + 2^0 = 2^0 → 1 + 1 = 1 → 2 = 1 (false)
   - So x=1 is not actually a solution

4. The ground truth answer is the empty set (∅), meaning there are no real numbers satisfying both conditions.

5. The proposed answer suggests x=1 is the solution, but as shown above, it doesn't satisfy the equation.
