The problem translates to: given real numbers x, y, z with \((x - y)/(z - y) = -10\), find \((x - z)/(y - z)\).

By algebraic manipulation, we can express \((x - z)/(y - z)\) in terms of known ratios and check for patterns by enumerating example triples \((x,y,z)\).

Below is a Python program that tries small integer triples satisfying the ratio, then computes the target ratio.

```python
# Enumerate triples (x,y,z) with small integer values, 
# compute (x-y)/(z-y) and check when it equals -10,
# then print (x-z)/(y-z)

def ration(x, y):
    # Calculate ratio (x - y)
    return x - y

def safe_div(a, b):
    # Return None if division by zero
    if b == 0:
        return None
    return a / b

# We want (x - y)/(z - y) = -10
# Enumerate integer triples with small range for y and z, 
# then compute x from ratio condition and check (x-z)/(y-z)

print("Enumerating solutions (x, y, z) with (x - y)/(z - y) = -10:")

max_abs = 10
for y in range(-max_abs, max_abs + 1):
    for z in range(-max_abs, max_abs + 1):
        if z == y:
            continue  # avoid division by zero
        # (x - y) / (z - y) = -10 => x - y = -10*(z - y) => x = y - 10*(z - y)
        x = y - 10 * (z - y)
        # Compute (x - z)/(y - z)
        numerator = x - z
        denominator = y - z
        if denominator == 0:
            continue
        val = numerator / denominator
        print(f"x={x}, y={y}, z={z}, (x-z)/(y-z) = {val}")

# We see that all printed values are the same, so conjecture that
# (x - z) / (y - z) = 11
print("Conjectured omnimath3274_answer = 11")
```
