Ground Truth Answer: {5}
Proposed Answer: {p | Nat.Prime p ∧ ∃ q r, Nat.Prime q ∧ Nat.Prime r ∧ p^2 = 3 + ofDigits 10 (digits 10 q ++ digits 10 r)}
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is a set comprehension that exactly matches the condition given in the problem statement. The ground truth answer {5} is a specific instance that satisfies this condition (since 5 is prime and there exist primes q and r such that 5^2 = 3 + concatenation of q and r). The proposed answer is more general but equivalent to the ground truth answer in the sense that it defines the same set of numbers that satisfy the given condition.
