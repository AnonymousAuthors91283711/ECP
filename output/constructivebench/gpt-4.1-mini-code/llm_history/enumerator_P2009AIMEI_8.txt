The problem involves powers of 2 up to \(2^{10}\), taking all pairs \((a,b)\) with \(a > b\), and summing the differences \(a - b\). We want the sum modulo 1000.

We can enumerate all pairs \((a,b)\) with \(a,b \in \{2^0, 2^1, ..., 2^{10}\}\), \(a>b\), then sum \(a-b\) and find the result modulo 1000.

```python
# Enumerate all pairs of powers of 2 up to 2^10 with a > b,
# sum the differences (a-b), and print the total modulo 1000.
# Print each difference as it's found to observe partial sums.

def main():
    powers = [2**n for n in range(11)]  # 2^0 to 2^10
    total = 0
    for i, a in enumerate(powers):
        for b in powers[:i]:  # b < a, because i > index_b
            diff = a - b
            print(f"Difference: {diff}")
            total += diff
    print(f"Sum modulo 1000: {total % 1000}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
