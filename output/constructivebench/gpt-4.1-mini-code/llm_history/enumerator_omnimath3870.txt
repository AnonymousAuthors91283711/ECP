The problem asks for the smallest size \( n \) of a subset \( S \) of \(\{1,2,\dots,2004\}\) such that any subset \( S \) of size \( n \) contains two distinct elements \( a,b \) with \( 2004 \mid a^2 - b^2 \).

We want to find or approximate this minimal \( n \). This is a Ramsey-type problem involving modular arithmetic and quadratic residues. To assist, I'll enumerate subsets and check for pairs with the required divisibility in a smaller range to get insight. We can't brute force all subsets for 2004 elements, so I'll do it for smaller moduli, e.g. up to 20, and print candidates and insights.

```python
# Enumerate for smaller N to conjecture the minimal n for the original problem N=2004.
# For each n, find if there exists a subset of {1,...,N} of size n with no pair (a,b), a!=b, 
# satisfying N | a^2 - b^2. We'll output minimal n for which this is impossible.
# Due to complexity, do small N and small n, print interesting subsets and minimal n found.

N_values = [10, 12, 15, 20]  # sample moduli (instead of 2004)
import itertools

def has_diff_square_divisible(S, N):
    # Check if there exist distinct a,b in S with N divides a^2 - b^2
    squares_mod = {x: (x*x) % N for x in S}
    values = [squares_mod[x] for x in S]
    seen = {}
    for x in S:
        sq = squares_mod[x]
        # We want a,b with (a^2 - b^2) % N = 0  => a^2 ≡ b^2 mod N
        if sq in seen and seen[sq] != x:
            return True
        seen[sq] = x
    return False

for N in N_values:
    print(f'N={N}')
    maxn = N
    found = 1  # minimal size where property breaks
    # Try increasing subset sizes n
    for n in range(1, maxn+1):
        # Check if there exists a subset of size n with no two sq mod N equal
        # i.e. no pair a,b with a^2 ≡ b^2 mod N.
        # We'll check existence by searching for at least one subset of size n with all distinct a^2 mod N.
        
        # We want to find subset S of size n with all distinct (a^2 mod N).
        squares = [ (x, (x*x)%N) for x in range(1, N+1)]
        # Group by square_mod
        square_classes = {}
        for x, sq in squares:
            square_classes.setdefault(sq, []).append(x)
        # Maximum subset size with no two elements sharing a^2 mod N
        max_distinct = len(square_classes)
        if n <= max_distinct:
            # Exists subset with no pair a^2 ≡ b^2 mod N, since we can pick one element from n distinct square classes.
            print(f'  n={n} no a^2≡b^2 mod {N} subset exists')
        else:
            # For n > max_distinct, impossible to avoid pairs with equal squares mod N
            # So every subset S of size n has pair with a^2 ≡ b^2 mod N, so  N divides a^2 - b^2
            print(f'  n={n} every subset has a^2≡b^2 mod {N}, minimal n = {n}')
            found = n
            break
    print(f'Minimal n for N={N}: {found}\n')
