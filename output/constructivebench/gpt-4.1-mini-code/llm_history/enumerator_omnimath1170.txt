[write_program]
The problem involves evaluating an expression with powers of logarithms and then exponentiating. To assist in conjecturing the exact value, I will write a program to compute the inside of the power for small numerical approximations and print stepwise values for insight.

```python
import math

# Define the logarithm base conversion helper
def log_base(x, base):
    return math.log(x) / math.log(base)

# Compute the expression inside the power of 2
def inner_expression():
    lb2 = 2
    terms = [
        (log_base(3, lb2), 1),
        (log_base(6, lb2), -1),
        (log_base(12, lb2), -1),
        (log_base(24, lb2), 1)
    ]
    # Compute sum of cubes with signs
    val = 0.0
    for (log_val, sign) in terms:
        val += sign * (log_val**3)
    val *= 1/6
    return val

def main():
    val = inner_expression()
    print(f"Inner exponent value (exact float): {val:.12f}")
    # Compute 2 to the power of val
    ans = 2 ** val
    print(f"2 ^ (inner exponent) = {ans:.12f}")
    
    # Also attempt to detect if ans is close to a simple fraction or integer
    eps = 1e-9
    candidates = [1, 2, 3, 1/2, 1/3, 3/2, 2/3]
    for c in candidates:
        if abs(ans - c) < eps:
            print(f"Answer is close to the rational number {c}")
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
