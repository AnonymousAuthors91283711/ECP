The problem involves a multinomial probability calculation with parameters \( p_A = \frac{1}{2} \), \( p_M = \frac{2(1-p_A)}{3} \), \( p_C = \frac{1-p_A}{3} \), and counts \(k = [3, 2, 1]\) where \(n=6\).  
The goal: compute the exact value of  
\[
\frac{6!}{3!2!1!} \times p_A^3 \times p_M^2 \times p_C^1
\]  
using exact fractions rather than floats to conjecture the precise answer. The Python program enumerates the values, prints intermediate exact fractions, and finalizes with the exact simplified result.

```python
from math import factorial
from fractions import Fraction

# Parameters
p_A = Fraction(1, 2)
p_M = Fraction(2 * (1 - p_A), 3)  # 2 * (1 - 1/2)/3 = 2*(1/2)/3 = 1/3
p_C = Fraction((1 - p_A), 3)      # (1 - 1/2)/3 = (1/2)/3 = 1/6

n = 6
k = [3, 2, 1]
p = [p_A, p_M, p_C]

# Multinomial coefficient
def multinomial_coeff(n, ks):
    result = factorial(n)
    for x in ks:
        result //= factorial(x)
    return result

coeff = multinomial_coeff(n, k)
print(f"Multinomial coefficient: {coeff}")

p_powers = []
for i in range(len(k)):
    val = p[i] ** k[i]
    p_powers.append(val)
    print(f"p[{i}]^{k[i]} = {val}")

# Multiply all p powers
prod_p = Fraction(1,1)
for val in p_powers:
    prod_p *= val
print(f"Product of p_i^k_i: {prod_p}")

answer = Fraction(coeff) * prod_p
print(f"Answer (exact fraction): {answer}")

# Also print decimal approximation for reference
print(f"Answer (approx): {float(answer):.8f}")
```
