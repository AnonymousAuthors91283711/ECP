The problem involves six nonnegative real numbers \(x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_5\) that sum to 1, with a constraint on the sum of products \(x_0 x_2 x_4 + x_1 x_3 x_5 \geq \frac{1}{540}\). We want to find the greatest possible value of the sum of triple products \(x_0 x_1 x_2 + x_1 x_2 x_3 + \cdots + x_5 x_0 x_1\).

We will enumerate combinations of \(x_i\) with rational values in increments of 0.1 (for simplicity and speed), check the constraints, and print valid values of \(m\). Since the sum is fixed at 1, we can pick values for \(x_0, x_1, \ldots, x_4\) and determine \(x_5 = 1 - \sum_{i=0}^4 x_i\), ensuring non-negativity. This enumeration will be coarse but might reveal candidate maxima.

```python
from itertools import product

# We'll iterate over x0..x4 in increments of 0.1, x5 = 1 - sum of first five
# To keep output limited, increments are 0.2, so values from 0 to 1 with step 0.2: [0,0.2,...,1]
# This gives manageable loops while sampling the space.

step = 0.2
vals = [i * step for i in range(int(1/step)+1)]

best_m = -1
candidates = set()

print("Enumerating x_i in increments of", step)
for x0, x1, x2, x3, x4 in product(vals, repeat=5):
    s = x0 + x1 + x2 + x3 + x4
    x5 = 1 - s
    if x5 < 0:
        continue
    # Nonnegativity holds: all >= 0
    # Check constraint
    c = x0*x2*x4 + x1*x3*x5
    if c < 1/540:  # approximately 0.00185185185
        continue
    # Compute m
    m = (x0*x1*x2 + x1*x2*x3 + x2*x3*x4 +
         x3*x4*x5 + x4*x5*x0 + x5*x0*x1)
    # Print each valid m fraction as float to 6 decimals
    print(f"m = {m:.6f}; x = [{x0:.1f},{x1:.1f},{x2:.1f},{x3:.1f},{x4:.1f},{x5:.1f}]")
    if m > best_m:
        best_m = m

print("Best m found approximately =", best_m)
```
