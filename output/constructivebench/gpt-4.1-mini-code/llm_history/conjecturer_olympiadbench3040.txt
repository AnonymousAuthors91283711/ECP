(hfrac : (∑ i in Finset.Icc 1 n, 3 * i) / (∑ i in Finset.Icc 1 n, 5 * i) = 4 / 11)
: (∑ i in Finset.Icc 1 n, 2 * i) / (∑ i in Finset.Icc 1 n, 4 * i) = olympiadbench3040_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Error: Program outputs empty result. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
<<<(4 : ℚ)>>>
Explanation: The ratio of sums involving linear sequences and constants cancels out, yielding the constant rational 4.
