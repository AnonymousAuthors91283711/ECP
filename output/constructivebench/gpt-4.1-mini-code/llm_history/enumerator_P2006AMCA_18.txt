The problem seems to characterize a set \( D \subseteq \mathbb{R} \) and a function \( f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) such that for every \( x \in D \), the reciprocal \( 1/x \) is also in \( D \), and \( f(x) + f(1/x) = x \). Additionally, the problem states \( D \) is the maximal set satisfying the property, i.e., any other set \( s \subseteq \mathbb{R} \) having the same property is contained in \( D \).

To assist in conjecturing the nature of \( D \) and \( f \), I will enumerate candidate sets \( D \) and functions \( f \) for some sample values. Because the core property relates \( x \) and \( 1/x \), I will explore sets that include pairs \( \{x, 1/x\} \) and test corresponding linear functions \( f \) (say \( f(x) = a x + b \)) satisfying \( f(x) + f(1/x) = x \). 

The program below:
- Selects sample finite subsets of positive reals \( S \) closed under reciprocal (i.e., if \( x \in S \), \( 1/x \in S \)).
- For each such \( S \), attempts to find parameters \( a,b \) for \( f(x) = a x + b \) satisfying \( f(x) + f(1/x) = x \) for all \( x \in S \).
- Prints the candidate sets \( S \) and the parameters \( a,b \).
- Attempts to identify the maximal such \( S \) for the chosen \( f \).

The output is streamed immediately upon finding a candidate, to help conjecture the answer.
