The problem involves enumerating sequences of length 144 on a 12×12 grid representing clock positions (0 to 11), starting and ending at (0,0). Each step moves either one step forward in the first coordinate or the second coordinate (like moving right or up in a grid), and the path visits every position exactly once (a Hamiltonian path on the grid with restricted moves). The sequences correspond to lattice paths that go from (0,0) to (11,11) using exactly 143 moves (total moves = n+m = 22, but here sequence length is 144, meaning 143 moves), but with the added twist that the path must be a cycle returning to (0,0). Also, the condition is that from (0,0) to (0,0) in 143 steps (144 positions) with each step moving forward either in the first or second coordinate, wrapping around modulo 12.

Wait, the problem states `Fin 12 × Fin 12` and that valid moves are either increment first coordinate or second coordinate by 1 (modulo 12), but since `Fin 12` is modulo 12, moving from 11+1 = 0 wraps around. So moving from (11,11) to (0,11) or (11,0) is valid as well.

The condition that f(0)=initial_pos=(0,0), f(143)=initial_pos=(0,0), and ∀i<143, valid_move(f i, f (i+1)) means the path is a closed path on the 12×12 torus grid, moving only one step right (in the first coordinate) or one step up (in the second coordinate) modulo 12, visiting all 144 unique positions exactly once.

So the problem is to find the number of Hamiltonian cycles on the 12×12 grid torus generated by the moves +1 in first coordinate or +1 in the second coordinate.

This is equivalent to counting the number of permutations of 144 positions arranged in the valid lattice path from (0,0) back to (0,0), moving right or up on the torus, visiting each node once.

Observe that moving 143 steps forward with +1 in x or +1 in y and starting at (0,0) wrapping around modulo 12 must visit every node exactly once, and come back to (0,0).

This corresponds to the number of "necklace" permutations or number of decompositions of 143 moves into steps right and up, taken modulo 12.

Since each move is either in the first or second coordinate, number of moves in first coordinate must be k and moves in second coordinate = 143 - k, and because of wrapping, total moves modulo 12 in coordinate 1 and coordinate 2 must be 0. So:

k ≡ 0 mod 12

143-k ≡ 0 mod 12

Given that 143 mod 12 = 11

So k ≡ 0 mod 12

(143 - k) ≡ 0 mod 12 => 11 - k ≡ 0 mod 12 => k ≡ 11 mod 12

Contradiction. No k satisfies both k ≡ 0 mod 12 and k ≡ 11 mod 12. So no sequences possible.

But since problem asks for number of such sequences, maybe wrapping is not interpreted as modulo, or maybe in problem we don't wrap modulo but the Fin type means positions 0..11 but no wrap for moves (valid_move defined with q.1 = p.1 + 1, not modulo).

Looking again:

valid_move (p q) = (q.1 = p.1 + 1 ∧ q.2 = p.2) ∨ (q.1 = p.1 ∧ q.2 = p.2 + 1).

If p.1 is 11, p.1+1 = 12 – which is not in Fin 12 (max elem is 11). So By the logic of Fin n, 12 ≡ 0 mod 12, so values cycle around.

Hence, the path is a classical lattice path on a torus.

Thus the sequence is a Hamiltonian cycle on a grid 12×12 with edges to right and up neighbors mod 12.

Problem is to count number of such Hamiltonian cycles starting and ending at (0,0) moving either right or up.

This problem is very complex.

One way to enumerate candidates is to consider sequences of moves: a sequence of length 143 composed of 72 moves right and 71 moves up (or vice versa), but since need to end at (0,0), the sum of right moves mod 12 and up moves mod 12 must be 0; so:

number of right moves mod 12 ≡ 0

number of up moves mod 12 ≡ 0

Total moves = 143

Let r be right moves, u be up moves

r + u =143

Also r mod 12 =0

u mod 12=0

Since 143 mod 12 = 11, and r mod 12=0, u mod 12=0, sum mod 12 == r + u mod 12 == 0 + 0 =0 !=11, so no sequences possible.

Therefore, zero sequences satisfy.

Hence the answer is 0 mod 1000.

Alternatively, try small grids to confirm.

Let me write enumerator for smaller n,m grid to count sequences of length n*m with moves +1 mod n or +1 mod m, visiting all positions exactly once, starting and ending at (0,0).

Try 2x2, 3x3, with brute force enumeration.

Implement efficient enumeration for small cases, print counts, and conjecture answer for 12x12.

Code will enumerate sequences on small grids and print candidates.

```python
# Enumerate Hamiltonian cycles on small toroidal grids with moves right/up by 1 in modulo arithmetic.

from collections import deque

def count_cycles(n, m):
    total = n * m
    start = (0, 0)
    moves = [(1, 0), (0, 1)]  # move right or up mod n,m

    # State: current position, visited positions set, path length
    # Use backtracking with pruning

    count = 0
    visited_all = (1 << total) - 1

    pos_to_bit = lambda x, y: x * m + y

    def backtrack(pos, visited, length):
        nonlocal count
        if length == total:
            # Check if can return to start by valid move
            x, y = pos
            for dx, dy in moves:
                nx = (x + dx) % n
                ny = (y + dy) % m
                if (nx, ny) == start:
                    count += 1
                    print(f"Found cycle starting at {start} on {n}x{m} grid")
            return
        x, y = pos
        for dx, dy in moves:
            nx = (x + dx) % n
            ny = (y + dy) % m
            bit = pos_to_bit(nx, ny)
            if not (visited & (1 << bit)):
                backtrack((nx, ny), visited | (1 << bit), length + 1)

    start_bit = pos_to_bit(*start)
    backtrack(start, 1 << start_bit, 1)
    return count

def main():
    for size in [(2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4)]:
        n, m = size
        print(f"Counting cycles on {n}x{m} grid torus")
        c = count_cycles(n, m)
        print(f"Number of cycles on {n}x{m}: {c}")
    # Larger grids are too big for brute force
    # So conjecture for 12x12 from small outputs

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This will try small grids and print cycles found. The counts for small grids give insight if cycles exist and their number mod 1000. For 12x12 grid, answer is probably 0.
