The problem looks at rational numbers q = (abcd)/9999 with digits a,b,c,d in 0..9, not all zero, reduced fraction with numerator coprime to denominator, and wants to find the number of distinct numerators after reduction, modulo 1000.

To assist conjecturing, we will:
- Enumerate all 4-digit combos (including leading zeros but not all zero).
- Compute q = (abcd)/9999.
- Simplify fraction and record numerator.
- Print numerators as found.
- Track set of numerators for final length modulo 1000.

We will print all numerators found, then print the count modulo 1000.

```python
from math import gcd

def simplified_num_den(n, d):
    g = gcd(n, d)
    return n // g, d // g

def main():
    denom = 9999
    numerators_found = set()
    count_printed = 0
    for a in range(10):
        for b in range(10):
            for c in range(10):
                for d in range(10):
                    if a == b == c == d == 0:
                        continue
                    num = 1000*a + 100*b + 10*c + d
                    sn, sd = simplified_num_den(num, denom)
                    # Check coprimality of numerator and denominator after simplification (always true)
                    # We'll just record numerator sn
                    if sn not in numerators_found:
                        numerators_found.add(sn)
                        print(f"Numerator found: {sn}")
                        count_printed +=1
                        if count_printed >= 50:
                            # limit output to 50 to remain brief
                            break
                else:
                    continue
                break
            else:
                continue
            break
        else:
            continue
        break

    print(f"Total distinct numerators (mod 1000): {total % 1000}")
