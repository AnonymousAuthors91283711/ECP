abbrev P2018AMCB_2_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2018AMCB_2 :
  let total_distance := 96
  let first_distance := 60 * (30 / 60)
  let second_distance := 65 * (30 / 60)
  let third_distance := total_distance - first_distance - second_distance
  third_distance / (30 / 60) = P2018AMCB_2_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: First distance: 30.0 km
Second distance: 32.5 km
Third distance: 33.5 km
Third speed: 67.0 km/h. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
