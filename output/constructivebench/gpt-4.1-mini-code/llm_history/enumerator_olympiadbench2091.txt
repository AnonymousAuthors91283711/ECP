The problem asks us to find the maximum size \( N \) of a collection of triples \((a,b,c)\) of natural numbers summing to \( n \), where all \( a \)'s are distinct, all \( b \)'s are distinct, and all \( c \)'s are distinct.

We want to enumerate such sets for small \( n \) to guess the maximum \( N \) for each \( n \geq 2 \).

The Python program below:
- Tries all triples \((a,b,c)\) with \(a+b+c=n\), \(a,b,c \geq 0\),
- Enumerates subsets with distinct \(a\), distinct \(b\), distinct \(c\),
- Finds the maximum subset size,
- Prints intermediate maximal sizes for each \(n\) from 2 to 6.

The search space is small for these values, so the program will run quickly and show examples to conjecture the formula for max \(N\).

```python
from itertools import combinations

def triples_summing_to(n):
    # Generate all triples (a,b,c) with a+b+c=n, a,b,c>=0
    return [(a,b,c) for a in range(n+1) for b in range(n+1) 
            for c in range(n+1) if a + b + c == n]

def has_distinct_coords(triples):
    # Check distinctness in each coordinate
    a_set = set()
    b_set = set()
    c_set = set()
    for (a,b,c) in triples:
        if a in a_set or b in b_set or c in c_set:
            return False
        a_set.add(a)
        b_set.add(b)
        c_set.add(c)
    return True

def max_distinct_triples(n):
    triples = triples_summing_to(n)
    max_size = 0
    # Check subsets from biggest to smallest for early stopping
    for size in range(len(triples), 0, -1):
        found = False
        for comb in combinations(triples, size):
            if has_distinct_coords(comb):
                print(f"n={n}, max subset of size {size}: {sorted(comb)}")
                max_size = size
                found = True
                break
        if found:
            break
    return max_size

if __name__ == "__main__":
    for n in range(2, 7):  # small n to keep output limited
        print(f"=== n={n} ===")
        maxN = max_distinct_triples(n)
        print(f"Maximum N for n={n} is {maxN}")
```
This program enumerates all solutions, prints each largest found subset with distinct coordinates for several small values of \( n \), and reports the maximum size, helping to conjecture the answer function olympiadbench2091_answer(n).
