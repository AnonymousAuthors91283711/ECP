This problem involves summing a sequence with a ratio of terms involving a function a(k). Without the explicit form of a(k), let's try simple sequences a(k) = k, or a(k) = k+c, or a(k) = k^2, and enumerate values of the sum for small ranges to notice patterns or guess the closed-form. We'll print partial sums for k in 0..10 initially, then scale up if patterns emerge.

```python
# Enumerate sums of a(k+4)/a(k+5) for sample sequences a(k) over ranges,
# to guess the sum formula or limits.
def compute_sum(a, n):
    s = 0
    for k in range(n):
        numerator = a(k + 4)
        denominator = a(k + 5)
        if denominator == 0:
            # Avoid division by zero
            continue
        s += numerator / denominator
        print(f"k={k}, term={numerator}/{denominator}={numerator/denominator:.6f}, partial sum={s:.6f}")
    print(f"Sum for n={n}: {s}\n")
    return s

def main():
    # sample a(k) = k+1 to avoid zero
    print("Sequence a(k) = k+1")
    compute_sum(lambda k: k+1, 11)

    # a(k)=k+2
    print("Sequence a(k)=k+2")
    compute_sum(lambda k: k+2, 11)

    # a(k)=k^2 +1
    print("Sequence a(k) = k^2 + 1")
    compute_sum(lambda k: k*k+1, 11)

    # a(k)=2k+1
    print("Sequence a(k) = 2k+1")
    compute_sum(lambda k: 2*k+1, 11)

if __name__=="__main__":
    main()
```
