[write_program]
The problem seems to involve finding a natural number answer equal to 3*5 + 2*8. To assist in conjecturing the answer, I'll write a Python program to enumerate combinations of nonnegative integers (a,b) for small values, computing 3a + 2b, and print these values. Since 3*5 + 2*8 = 15 + 16 = 31, our program will help verify or find sums that equal 31.

```python
# Enumerate small combinations of (a,b) to find values of 3a + 2b, print when equals 31

def main():
    target = 31
    max_a = target // 3 + 1
    max_b = target // 2 + 1

    print("Searching for a,b with 3*a + 2*b = 31")
    for a in range(max_a):
        for b in range(max_b):
            val = 3*a + 2*b
            if val == target:
                print(f"a={a}, b={b}, 3*a+2*b={val}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
