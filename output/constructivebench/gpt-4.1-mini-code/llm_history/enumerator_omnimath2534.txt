The problem involves real variables \(h, a, r, v, m, i, t, d\) related by some product equalities:
- \(h \cdot a \cdot r \cdot v \cdot a \cdot r \cdot d = 100\),
- \(m \cdot i \cdot t = 100\),
- \(h \cdot m \cdot m \cdot t = 100\).

We want to find or enumerate possible values of \((r \cdot a \cdot d) \times (t \cdot r \cdot i \cdot v \cdot i \cdot a)\), which simplifies to \((r a d) \times (t r i v i a)\).

Since \(d\) is only involved in the first product, and we have 3 equations with many variables, let's try enumerating small positive integers (or rational numbers) for \(h,a,r,v,m,i,t,d\) consistent with the given equations to find candidate values for the expression.

We'll restrict to positive integers \(\leq 5\) for simplicity and iterate to satisfy the constraints approximately (we can relax exact to within a small epsilon for floating points). Then print the computed value.

```python
# Enumerate possible integer values 1-5 for variables h,a,r,v,m,i,t,d meeting given constraints and print value
epsilon = 1e-6
max_val = 5

print("Searching solutions with h,a,r,v,m,i,t,d in [1..5]")

for h in range(1, max_val+1):
    for a in range(1, max_val+1):
        for r in range(1, max_val+1):
            for v in range(1, max_val+1):
                for d in range(1, max_val+1):
                    prod1 = h * a * r * v * a * r * d  # h * a * r * v * a * r * d
                    if abs(prod1 - 100) > epsilon:
                        continue
                    for m in range(1, max_val+1):
                        for i in range(1, max_val+1):
                            for t in range(1, max_val+1):
                                prod2 = m * i * t
                                prod3 = h * m * m * t
                                if abs(prod2 - 100) > epsilon:
                                    continue
                                if abs(prod3 - 100) > epsilon:
                                    continue
                                val = (r * a * d) * (t * r * i * v * i * a)
                                print(f"h={h},a={a},r={r},v={v},d={d},m={m},i={i},t={t} => value={val}")
```
This will print all candidate solutions found with their computed values, helping to conjecture the answer.
