abbrev omnimath3861_answer : Set (ℕ → ℕ) := sorry
theorem omnimath3861 (f : ℕ → ℕ) :
  (∀ a b, 0 < a → 0 < b → a + b > 2019 → (a + f b) ∣ (a^2 + b * f a)) ↔ f ∈ omnimath3861_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing constant functions f(n)=c for c=1..10
Testing f(n) = n (identity)
f(n) = n satisfies condition
Testing linear functions f(n) = c*n for c=2..5
f(n) = 2*n satisfies condition
f(n) = 3*n satisfies condition
f(n) = 4*n satisfies condition
f(n) = 5*n satisfies condition. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ → ℕ)
<<<{f | ∃ c : ℕ, c > 0 ∧ (∀ n, f n = c * n)}>>>
