The problem involves finding the smallest number \(m\) of subsets ("trips"), each of size \(n\), chosen from a set of size \(2n\), such that every pair of distinct elements in the \(2n\)-element set appears together in at least one subset. We want to investigate the minimal \(m\) for small values of \(n \geq 2\).

This can be seen as a covering problem:
- We have \(2n\) elements.
- Each "trip" is a subset of size \(n\).
- Every pair of distinct elements (there are \(\binom{2n}{2}\) such pairs) must appear in at least one "trip".
- We seek the minimal \(m\) such that there exist \(m\) such subsets covering all pairs.

The program below enumerates all possible subsets of size \(n\) of \(\{0,1,\dots,2n-1\}\), then searches through combinations of these to find the minimum number \(m\) of such subsets covering all pairs. Due to combinatorial explosion, it only tries small \(n\) (2,3,4) up to a reasonable time limit / maximum \(m\).

The program prints discovered solutions as soon as they appear, printing the parameters \(n\), the current \(m\), and the subsets covering all pairs. This assists in conjecturing the minimal number \(m\) and pattern of such collection of subsets.

from itertools import combinations

def pairs_from_set(s):

    return set(tuple(sorted(p)) for p in combinations(s, 2))

    # All pairs of elements from [0..2n-1]
    return set(combinations(range(2*n), 2))

def check_cover(subsets, all_pairs_set):
    # Check if union of pairs from subsets covers all_pairs_set
    covered = set()
    for s in subsets:
        covered |= pairs_from_set(s)
    return covered == all_pairs_set

        # Use some pruning: number of pairs covered by m subsets max = m * C(n,2)
        max_pairs_covered = m * (n*(n-1)//2)
        if max_pairs_covered < len(all_pairs_set):
            continue  # impossible to cover all pairs with m subsets

                break
        if found:

            break
