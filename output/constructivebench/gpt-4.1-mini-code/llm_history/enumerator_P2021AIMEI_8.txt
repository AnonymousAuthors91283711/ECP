The problem concerns counting integers \( c \) such that the quartic equation 
\[ x^4 - 2 c x^2 + (c + 1) = 0 \]
has exactly 12 real roots total, when considering all solutions \( x \) for that \( c \).

Since the polynomial is quartic in \( x \), the maximum number of real roots per equation is 4. The form suggests symmetry and varying the integer \( c \) may yield different numbers of real roots. The problem likely wants the count of such integers \( c \) where the equation has exactly 12 real roots counted over some range or parameter.

However, the original problem is from a formal proof assistant script and uses advanced mathlib constructs. For enumeration and conjecture, let's:

- Interpret: For each integer \( c \), solve the quartic and count real roots,
- Then find \( c \) where the total number of **distinct solutions over some domain** is 12.

Since a quartic polynomial has only 4 roots, 12 roots would imply something different (perhaps summing roots over multiple intervals or multiple values of \( c \)). Without domain context, normally a quartic cannot have 12 roots.

An alternative view: maybe the problem is about the total number of roots of a system or consideration over multiple equations or parameters. The use of `Nat.card` (set cardinality) suggests counting the number of distinct roots collectively over some set parameterized by \( c \).

To assist, let's write code to:

- For integers \( c \) in a small range (e.g. -10 to 10),
- Solve \( x^4 - 2 c x^2 + (c + 1) = 0 \),
- Count the number of distinct real roots,
- Collect for which \( c \) the number of real roots is 4, 2, 0, etc.
- Print \( c \) and its count of real roots,
- Then print all \( c \) where the number of real roots is exactly 4 (max).

The polynomial can be rewritten as:
\[ x^4 - 2 c x^2 + (c + 1) = 0 \]
or equivalently:
\[ (x^2)^2 - 2 c x^2 + (c + 1) = 0 \]
Make substitution:
\[ y = x^2 \geq 0 \]
and solve:
\[ y^2 - 2 c y + (c + 1) = 0 \]

Then roots \( y_1, y_2 \) are found from this quadratic in \( y \). For each positive root \( y_i \), we get two real roots \( x = \pm \sqrt{y_i} \). For zero roots \( y_i = 0 \), one root \( x=0 \).

Hence the number of real roots for the quartic is \( 2k \) where \( k \) is the number of positive roots \( y_i \), plus possibly one if zero is a root, up to max 4 roots.

Thus the total number of real roots per \( c \) can be 0, 2 or 4.

For \textbf{12 real roots} for a single quartic is impossible; so the problem likely concerns the cardinality of the set:
\[
\{ c \in \mathbb{Z} : \text{number of real roots of } x^4 - 2cx^2 + c + 1=0 \text{ is } 12 \}
\]
where the "{x: ...}=0" is the set of solutions \( x \) for fixed \( c \). The problem statement is a bit ambiguous. Since there cannot be 12 roots from a quartic, likely the problem comes from the original AIME solution referring to a different scenario.

Given this uncertainty, I will write code to:

- Enumerate \( c \in [-10,10] \),
- Solve for \( y \) the quadratic \( y^2 - 2 c y + c + 1=0 \),
- For each root \( y \geq 0 \), count roots \( x = \pm \sqrt{y} \),
- Sum number of real roots for each \( c \),
- Print \( c \) and the number of roots,
- Finally print all \( c \) where the number of real roots is e.g. 4 (the maximum),
- Possibly conjecture from this data.

This will generate immediate output for conjecture.

```python
import math

def real_roots_count(c):
    # Solve y^2 - 2 c y + c + 1 = 0
    # y = x^2, so y >= 0 for real x
    a, b, d = 1, -2*c, c+1
    discriminant = b*b - 4*a*d
    if discriminant < 0:
        return 0
    sqrt_d = math.sqrt(discriminant)
    y1 = (2*c + sqrt_d)/2
    y2 = (2*c - sqrt_d)/2
    count = 0
    for y in [y1, y2]:
        if y > 0:
            count += 2  # x = Â± sqrt(y)
        elif abs(y) < 1e-14:
            count += 1  # x=0 root
    return count

def main():
    print("c  real_roots_count")
    for c in range(-10, 11):
        roots = real_roots_count(c)
        print(f"{c:2d} {roots}")
    print("c values with 4 real roots:")
    max_roots = 4
    for c in range(-10, 11):
        if real_roots_count(c) == max_roots:
            print(c)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This output may help conjecture the set of integers \( c \) that yield a certain number of real roots. Adjust the range or thresholds as needed.
