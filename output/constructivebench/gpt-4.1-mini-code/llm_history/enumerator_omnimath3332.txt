The problem involves comparing and sorting large exponential numbers: 5^56, 10^51, 17^35, and 31^28. We want to enumerate these values exactly or by their logarithms to determine their order efficiently, then print the sorted list. The program will print each value immediately, then output the sorted list explicitly.

```python
# Enumerate and compare large exponentials by their logarithms to avoid huge computations.
import math

# Define the numbers as (base, exponent) pairs
numbers = [(5,56), (10,51), (17,35), (31,28)]

print("Enumerated numbers with their approximate values:")

# Compute and print approximate values and their logarithms
vals = []
for base, exp in numbers:
    val_float = base ** exp  # Exact in Python if small enough, but better use log for comparison
    val_log = exp * math.log(base)
    print(f"{base}^{exp} ≈ {val_float:.5e}, log ≈ {val_log:.5f}")
    vals.append((base, exp, val_float, val_log))

# Sort by log value to get ordering
sorted_vals = sorted(vals, key=lambda x: x[3])

print("\nSorted by numerical value (ascending):")
sorted_list = [f"{b}^{e}" for b, e, _, _ in sorted_vals]
for s in sorted_list:
    print(s)

print(f"\nSorted list as required:\n{sorted_list}")
```
