Ground Truth Answer: fun _ => 1
Proposed Answer: fun x => 1
<<<True>>>

The proposed answer `fun x => 1` is equivalent to the ground truth answer `fun _ => 1` because both are constant functions that return 1 for any input. The underscore `_` in the ground truth is just a placeholder for an unused parameter, which is equivalent to naming it `x` as in the proposed answer. Both implementations satisfy the functional equation in the problem statement by always returning 1 regardless of input.
