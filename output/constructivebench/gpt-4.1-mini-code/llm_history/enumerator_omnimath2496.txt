The problem seems to be: find natural numbers \( p, q, r \) all prime such that 

\[
2p + 3q = 6r \quad\text{and}\quad p + q + r = S
\]

and determine possible values of \( S \).

We will enumerate small primes for \( p, q, r \), check the equation, and print each triple and corresponding sum \( S \).

Then we can conjecture which sums \( S \) are possible.

```python
import sympy

# Generate primes up to a limit for enumeration
LIMIT = 50
primes = list(sympy.primerange(2, LIMIT))

# Enumerate triples (p,q,r) of primes satisfying 2p + 3q = 6r
for p in primes:
    for q in primes:
        # 2p + 3q must be divisible by 6 for r to be an integer
        val = 2*p + 3*q
        if val % 6 != 0:
            continue
        r = val // 6
        if r in primes:
            S = p + q + r
            print(f"p={p}, q={q}, r={r}, sum={S}")
```
