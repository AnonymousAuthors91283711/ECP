Ground Truth Answer: 1
Proposed Answer: 3
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the minimal number of even numbers in a set {a,b,c,d,e,f} that satisfies three given sum constraints:
   - a + b = 26
   - a + b + c + d = 41 ⇒ c + d = 15
   - a + b + c + d + e + f = 57 ⇒ e + f = 16

2. The ground truth answer is 1, which suggests there exists a solution with only 1 even number among the six variables.

3. The proposed answer is 3, which would mean at least 3 even numbers are needed.

4. Let's find a concrete solution with only 1 even number:
   - Let a = 25 (odd), b = 1 (odd) → satisfies a + b = 26
   - Let c = 14 (even), d = 1 (odd) → satisfies c + d = 15
   - Let e = 15 (odd), f = 1 (odd) → satisfies e + f = 16
   - This gives exactly 1 even number (c), proving the minimum can be 1.

Since we've found a solution with only 1 even number, the proposed answer of 3 is incorrect. The ground truth answer of 1 is correct.
