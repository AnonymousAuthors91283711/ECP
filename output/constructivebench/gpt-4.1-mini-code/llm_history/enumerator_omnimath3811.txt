The problem is to find the number of natural numbers \( n > 1 \) such that \( n \) divides \( x^{13} - x \) for all integers \( x > 0 \).

This is a classic problem related to modular arithmetic and number theory, where we want to find all positive integers \( n > 1 \) dividing \( x^{13} - x \) for all \( x \in \mathbb{Z}^+ \).

Given the difficulty, we can approach it by enumerating possible divisors \( n \), testing the divisibility condition for multiple values of \( x \), and using the fact that the divisibility must hold for all \( x \). 

Since \( n \) divides \( x^{13} - x \) for all \( x \) implies \( n \) divides \( x^{13} - x \) in modular arithmetic, these \( n \) are divisors of the so-called universal exponent expression.

One can use that \( x^{13} \equiv x \pmod n \) for all \( x \). Such \( n \) are divisors of the fixed polynomial that vanishes on all residues mod \( n \), often related to the fact that the polynomial \( x^{13} - x \) factorizes into linear factors over finite fields of characteristic \( p \).

We'll enumerate possible \( n \) up to a certain bound, check the condition using small values of \( x \), and then attempt to find candidates.

```python
# Enumerate natural numbers n>1 such that n divides x^13 - x for all x>0.

# Since checking for all x is impossible, test many x in a sample to conjecture.
# Also, from number theory: such n must divide the product of primes p where p-1 divides 13, or p=13.

# We'll test n up to 200 for efficiency.

def divides_all_x(n, max_x=20):
    # Check if n divides x^13 - x for all x in 1..max_x
    for x in range(1, max_x+1):
        val = pow(x, 13, n) - x
        if val % n != 0:
            return False
    return True

def prime_factors(n):
    i = 2
    factors = set()
    while i*i <= n:
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.add(i)
            n //= i
        i += 1
    if n > 1:
        factors.add(n)
    return factors

def lcm(a, b):
    from math import gcd
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

# By Fermat's little theorem and properties of the polynomial,
# all prime divisors p of such n must satisfy p | 13 or p-1 divides 13.

# 13 is prime. Divisors of 13 are 1 and 13.

# So p = 13 or p-1 divides 13 => p-1 in {1,13} => p in {2,14} (14 not prime)
# So primes p are 2 or 13.

# Since 2 and 13 are prime factors, candidates are products of powers of 2 and 13.

# Let's test powers of 2 and 13 up to 200

powers_2 = [2**i for i in range(1, 8) if 2**i <= 200]
powers_13 = [13**i for i in range(1, 3) if 13**i <= 200]

# Now combine powers of 2 and 13 within 200
candidates = set()
for p2 in powers_2:
    candidates.add(p2)
for p13 in powers_13:
    candidates.add(p13)
for p2 in powers_2:
    for p13 in powers_13:
        val = p2 * p13
        if val <= 200:
            candidates.add(val)

candidates = sorted(candidates)

print("Candidates n where n divides x^13 - x for many x:")
for n in candidates:
    if divides_all_x(n, max_x=20):
        print(n)

# Output the total count of such n up to 200
valid = [n for n in candidates if divides_all_x(n, max_x=20)]
print("Total valid n up to 200:", len(valid))

# The minimal such n > 1 is likely 2 (since 2 divides x^13 - x for all x)
# The maximal such n up to 200 (from candidates) will be the largest in valid list
if valid:
    print("Minimal valid n:", min(valid))
    print("Maximal valid n:", max(valid))
