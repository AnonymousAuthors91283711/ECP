Ground Truth Answer: ∅
Proposed Answer: {(0, 0), (-2, 2), (2, -2)}
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The equation is m⁵ - n⁵ = 16mn
2. The ground truth says there are no integer solutions (empty set)
3. The proposed answer suggests three solutions: (0,0), (-2,2), and (2,-2)

Let's test the proposed solutions:
- For (0,0): 0⁵ - 0⁵ = 0 = 16*0*0 → valid
- For (-2,2): (-2)⁵ - 2⁵ = -32 - 32 = -64 vs 16*(-2)*2 = -64 → valid
- For (2,-2): 2⁵ - (-2)⁵ = 32 - (-32) = 64 vs 16*2*(-2) = -64 → invalid

Only two of the three proposed solutions actually work. The pair (2,-2) doesn't satisfy the equation. Also, the ground truth claims there are no solutions at all, which contradicts the valid solutions we found.

Therefore:
<<<False>>>
