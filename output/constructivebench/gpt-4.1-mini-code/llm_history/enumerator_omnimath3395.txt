The problem is about finding the value of \( k \in \mathbb{R} \) such that the slope of the line through the points \( p_1 = (3, 2k+1) \) and \( p_2 = (8, 4k-5) \) is zero.

From the slope formula:
\[
\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = 0
\]
\[
\Rightarrow y_2 - y_1 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad (4k - 5) - (2k + 1) = 0
\]

So the problem reduces to solving:
\[
4k - 5 = 2k + 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2k = 6 \quad \Rightarrow \quad k=3
\]

The program below will enumerate for \( k \) in a small range to find candidates making the slope zero.

```python
# Enumerate k values to find when the slope between given points is zero

def slope_zero_candidates():
    for k in [i * 0.5 for i in range(-10, 11)]:  # k in -5 to 5, step 0.5
        y1 = 2 * k + 1
        y2 = 4 * k - 5
        slope = (y2 - y1) / (8 - 3)  # x2 - x1 = 5
        if slope == 0:
            print(f"k = {k} yields slope zero")
            # Since exact values, print exactly and break early
            return k

print("Enumerating possible k values:")
k_zero = slope_zero_candidates()
if k_zero is not None:
    print(f"The value of k making the slope zero is {k_zero}")
else:
    print("No k in the sample range makes the slope zero.")
```
