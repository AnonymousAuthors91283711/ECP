The problem involves counting how many elements in a dataset fall outside a specific range determined by the interquartile range (IQR). The dataset and quartiles are given, and we want to enumerate how many data points lie outside the bounds defined by Q1 - 1.5*IQR and Q3 + 1.5*IQR.

We'll:
- Define the dataset, Q1, Q3.
- Compute IQR, lowerBound, upperBound.
- Check each data point to see if it is less than lowerBound or greater than upperBound.
- Print each point that is an outlier (outside bounds).
- Print the total count of such points.

```python
# Enumerate outliers in the dataset using the 1.5*IQR rule

def main():
    data = [6, 19, 33, 33, 39, 41, 41, 43, 51, 57]
    Q1 = 33
    Q3 = 43
    IQR = Q3 - Q1
    lower_bound = Q1 - (3 * IQR / 2)  # 1.5 * IQR
    upper_bound = Q3 + (3 * IQR / 2)
    print(f"Q1={Q1}, Q3={Q3}, IQR={IQR}")
    print(f"Lower bound = {lower_bound}, Upper bound = {upper_bound}")
    count = 0
    for x in data:
        if x < lower_bound or x > upper_bound:
            print(f"Outlier: {x}")
            count += 1
    print(f"Total outliers: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
