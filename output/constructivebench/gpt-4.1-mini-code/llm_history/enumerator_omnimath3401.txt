[write_program]
The problem states that for a real number p between 0 and 100, there's a set of q such that q = 100 - p and q lies also between 0 and 100. The goal is to identify the function omnimath3401_answer(p) = q = 100 - p in ‚Ñù.

I'll write a Python program that enumerates sample p values between 0 and 100 (say integer values), then computes q = 100 - p and prints both values. This will help confirm the function and the range.

```python
# Enumerate values of p in [0, 100] integers, compute q = 100 - p,
# and print to observe the set of values satisfying the conditions.

def omnimath3401_answer(p):
    return 100 - p

def main():
    print("p, q = 100 - p")
    for p in range(0, 101, 10):  # step by 10 for brevity
        q = omnimath3401_answer(p)
        if 0 <= q <= 100:
            print(f"p = {p}, q = {q}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
