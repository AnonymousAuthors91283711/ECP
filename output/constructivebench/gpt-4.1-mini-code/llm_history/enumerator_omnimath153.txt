The problem considers integers \(k\) such that there exists an infinite set \(s \subseteq \mathbb{N}\) where for every \(n \in s\), \(n + k\) does not divide \(\binom{2n}{n}\). To explore this, we can try small values of \(k\) and small \(n\), checking divisibility conditions and gathering evidence about which \(k\) might allow infinitely many such \(n\).

We'll enumerate values of \(k\) from \(-10\) to \(10\), and for each, check \(n\) from \(1\) to \(100\). If \((n+k) \mid \binom{2n}{n}\), we note it; if not, we consider that \(n\) might be part of such an infinite set for that \(k\). We print each candidate \(k, n\) pair where divisibility fails, helping identify patterns.

```python
from math import comb

def main():
    # Search k from -10 to 10 (excluding k that makes n+k <=0)
    for k in range(-10, 11):
        print(f"Checking k={k}")
        nondivisible_ns = []
        for n in range(1, 101):
            d = n + k
            if d <= 0:
                # divisor must be positive
                continue
            c = comb(2*n, n)
            if c % d != 0:
                nondivisible_ns.append(n)
                print(f"  n={n} : {d} does NOT divide C(2n,n)={c}")
        # Summarize results for k
        if len(nondivisible_ns) > 50:
            print(f"  => Many n with (n+k) not dividing C(2n,n), possibly infinite for k={k}")
        else:
            print(f"  => Few n found, possibly finite or none for k={k}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
