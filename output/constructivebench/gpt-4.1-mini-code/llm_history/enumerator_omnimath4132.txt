[write_program]
We want to explore triples \((a,b,c)\) of positive real numbers with \(abc = \frac{1}{8}\), and examine the value of 
\[ S = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + a^2 b^2 + b^2 c^2 + c^2 a^2. \]

The conjecture is that 
\[ S \ge \frac{15}{16}, \]
with equality attained for some special triple \((a,b,c)\).

We will enumerate triples with \(abc = 1/8\) approximately (due to continuous nature), using rational approximations for \(a,b\), and compute \(c = \frac{1}{8ab}\). Check positivity and print values of \(S\). We will prioritize triples near equality and print each found candidate immediately. Finally, we print the minimal observed value approximating \(15/16=0.9375\).

```python
# Enumerate triples (a,b,c) with a,b in some rational grid >0,
# c = 1/(8*a*b), and print S = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + a^2 b^2 + b^2 c^2 + c^2 a^2

import math

def main():
    target_product = 1/8
    # We'll try a,b from 0.1 to 1.0 in steps to keep computation short
    # Avoid zero or negative a,b
    step = 0.1
    n_steps = 10
    min_S = None
    min_triple = None

    for i in range(1, n_steps+1):
        a = round(i*step, 5)
        for j in range(1, n_steps+1):
            b = round(j*step, 5)
            # c = 1/(8*a*b)
            denom = 8*a*b
            if denom == 0:
                continue
            c = 1/denom
            if c <= 0:
                continue
            # Compute S
            a2 = a*a
            b2 = b*b
            c2 = c*c
            S = a2 + b2 + c2 + a2*b2 + b2*c2 + c2*a2
            # Print each candidate found immediately
            print(f"a={a:.5f}, b={b:.5f}, c={c:.5f}, S={S:.7f}")
            if (min_S is None) or (S < min_S):
                min_S = S
                min_triple = (a,b,c)

    print(f"\nMinimal S found: {min_S:.7f} for (a,b,c) = ({min_triple[0]:.5f}, {min_triple[1]:.5f}, {min_triple[2]:.5f})")
    print(f"15/16 = {15/16:.7f}")

if __name__=="__main__":
    main()
