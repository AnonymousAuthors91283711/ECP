The problem asks for the volume of the set of points \((x,y)\) in \([0,1]^2\) where the floor rounding satisfies \(\text{round}(x+y) = \text{round}(x) + \text{round}(y)\). Since \(\text{round}\) here presumably rounds to the nearest integer, we need to find the measure of the set satisfying this equality.

Since \(x,y \in [0,1]\), the values \(\text{round}(x)\) and \(\text{round}(y)\) are either 0 (if \(x<0.5\)) or 1 (if \(x \ge 0.5\)).

We will enumerate a grid over \([0,1]^2\), check the equality, and sum the areas where it holds. Because the rounding switches at 0.5, divide [0,1] into intervals of length 0.01 for enumeration. The program prints discovered points and the accumulating summed area to conjecture the final volume.

```python
# Enumerate points (x,y) in [0,1]^2 at 0.01 steps
# Check round(x+y) == round(x) + round(y)
# Sum area of such points (each cell area = 0.0001)
# Print partial results when conditions hold

def r(z):
    # rounding to nearest integer
    return round(z)

step = 0.01
count = 0
total_points = 0
for i in range(101):
    x = i * step
    for j in range(101):
        y = j * step
        # Check condition
        if r(x + y) == r(x) + r(y):
            count += 1
            print(f"Valid point: x={x:.2f}, y={y:.2f}, r(x+y)={r(x+y)}, r(x)+r(y)={r(x)+r(y)}")
        total_points += 1

area_per_point = step * step
volume = count * area_per_point
print(f"\nApproximated volume: {volume:.4f}")
```
