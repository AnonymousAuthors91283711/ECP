The problem concerns finding pairs of primes \( p \) and \( q \) such that \( p \times q \) divides \( 5^p + 5^q \). This is a challenging divisibility and number theory problem, so we enumerate primes and check the condition for small values to identify candidate pairs.

```python
from sympy import primerange, isprime

# We pick primes up to 100 for efficiency
max_prime = 100
primes = list(primerange(2, max_prime+1))

print("Enumerating (p,q) with p,q prime and p*q | 5^p + 5^q")

for i, p in enumerate(primes):
    for q in primes[i:]:  # avoid repeats, p<=q
        val = 5**p + 5**q
        prod = p * q
        if val % prod == 0:
            print(f"Found: p={p}, q={q} divides 5^{p}+5^{q} by {prod}")

# After enumeration, we can note patterns or candidates for omnimath78_answer
```
Running this will print each pair as found, helping conjecture the solution set.
