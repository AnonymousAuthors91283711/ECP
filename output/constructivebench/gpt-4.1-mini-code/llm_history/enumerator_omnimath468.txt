The problem essentially asks to solve the equation:

\[ x^3 - 8 = 16 (x + 1)^{1/3} \]

over the real numbers.

To investigate solutions numerically, we'll try values of \( x \) in some range, compute both sides, and check equality (or near equality) by comparing exact cubes to cube roots.

Because the equation involves cube roots, negative values of \( x+1 \) are valid.

We will:

- Enumerate \( x \) from -10 to 10 in steps 0.1 to find approximate solutions.

- For any approximate root found (equality within a tolerance), print \( x \) and the cube root value exactly when possible.

- Also test some likely candidates, e.g., \( x=1 \), \( x=3 \), etc.

Use sympy for exact cube roots (rationals) where possible.

```python
# Enumerate real x values to find solutions to: x^3 - 8 = 16 * (x+1)^{1/3}
# We print x and the value of left and right sides when close enough.

from sympy import symbols, Rational, cbrt, Eq, N, simplify

x = symbols('x')

def approx_equal(a, b, tol=1e-6):
    return abs(a - b) < tol

print("Enumerating approximate solutions for x in [-10,10]:")

found = set()
step = 0.1
for i in range(-100, 101):
    xv = i * step
    try:
        lhs = xv**3 - 8
        rhs = 16 * (xv + 1)**(1/3)
        if approx_equal(lhs, rhs):
            # Try to find exact cube roots for rational xv+1
            val = Rational(xv).limit_denominator(100)
            cbrt_val = cbrt(val + 1)
            # Only print if not duplicate
            if xv not in found:
                print(f"x â‰ˆ {xv:.2f}: x^3-8 = {lhs:.6f}, 16*(x+1)^(1/3) = {rhs:.6f}")
                found.add(xv)
    except Exception:
        pass

# Test some integer candidates exactly
print("Testing integer candidates:")

for xv in range(-3,5):
    lhs = xv**3 - 8
    # exact cube root using sympy
    rhs = 16 * cbrt(xv + 1)
    if simplify(lhs - rhs) == 0:
        print(f"Exact solution: x = {xv}, both sides = {lhs}")
    else:
        # Also print if approx equal
        lhs_val = float(lhs)
        rhs_val = float(rhs)
        if approx_equal(lhs_val, rhs_val):
            print(f"Near exact at x={xv}: lhs={lhs_val}, rhs={rhs_val}")
```
