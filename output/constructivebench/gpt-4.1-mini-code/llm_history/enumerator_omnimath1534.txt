[write_program]
The problem involves logarithms with various bases applied to \( x > 1 \) and the logs of logs. To explore the expressions and find possible values for the expression on the right side of the theorem, I'll write a Python program that:

- Iterates over sample values of \( x > 1 \) (e.g., powers of 2 and other values).
- Computes the left side of the first equation and checks if it approximately equals 0.
- If so, computes the second expression and prints the result.
- Prints the sample \( x \) values used and the resulting value for conjecture.

Since exact evaluation of nested logarithms with arbitrary bases can be expressed via natural logs, I will implement these base changes explicitly.

```python
# enumerator.py
import math

def logb(base, val):
    """Compute log base 'base' of val."""
    return math.log(val) / math.log(base)

# Check for values x > 1
# We will test powers of 2 and some other values between 1 and 10
# for which the first equation is close to 0 within a small epsilon

eps = 1e-10
test_values = [1.1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 4, 8, 16, 20, 32, 64, 128]

print("Testing values of x > 1 for the given equation:")

for x in test_values:
    try:
        L1 = logb(2, logb(4, x))
        L2 = logb(4, logb(16, x))
        L3 = logb(16, logb(2, x))
        left_sum = L1 + L2 + L3

        if abs(left_sum) < eps:
            # Condition satisfied, print x and evaluate the second expression
            R1 = logb(2, logb(16, x))
            R2 = logb(16, logb(4, x))
            R3 = logb(4, logb(2, x))
            right_sum = R1 + R2 + R3
            print(f"x={x} satisfies first eq. => second sum = {right_sum}")
    except ValueError:
        # Ignore if log arg <= 0
        continue
```
