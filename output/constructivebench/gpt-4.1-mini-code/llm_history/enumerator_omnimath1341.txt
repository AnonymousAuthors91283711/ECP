The problem considers quadruples of distinct positive integers \(a,b,c,d\) where \(a+b=c+d\), the least common multiple (LCM) of all four is less than 1000, and asks to find the greatest possible sum \(s=a+b\) under these conditions. We'll enumerate all such quadruples with \(a,b,c,d \leq 1000\) (LCM bounded by 1000) and check the conditions, then output all sums found and the maximum sum.

```python
import math

max_sum = 0

# Iterate over possible sums up to 1000 (since LCM < 1000)
for s in range(4, 1000):  # minimal sum is 1+2=3 but distinct positive integers require at least 1+2=3, start from 4
    # Enumerate a,b for the sum s with a < b to avoid duplicates
    for a in range(1, s//2 + 1):
        b = s - a
        if a >= b:  # distinct positive integers require a < b
            continue
        # Similarly enumerate c,d with c < d and c + d = s, all distinct from a,b
        for c in range(1, s//2 + 1):
            d = s - c
            if c >= d:
                continue
            # Check all are distinct
            vals = {a,b,c,d}
            if len(vals) != 4:
                continue
            # Check LCM condition
            lcm_ab = a * b // math.gcd(a,b)
            lcm_cd = c * d // math.gcd(c,d)
            l = lcm_ab * lcm_cd // math.gcd(lcm_ab, lcm_cd)
            if l >= 1000:
                continue
            print(f"s={s} with quadruple (a,b,c,d)=({a},{b},{c},{d}), LCM={l}")
            if s > max_sum:
                max_sum = s

print(f"Maximum sum s found: {max_sum}")
```
