The problem involves finding natural numbers \( h \) and \( m \) (with \( 0 < m < 60 \)) such that the time difference expressed in minutes satisfies:
\[
h \times 60 + m = (1 \times 60 + 18) - (10 \times 60 + 34)
\]

We want to enumerate all pairs \((h,m)\) within the given constraints, compute \(h+m\), and print the results for further insight.

```python
# Enumerate possible h, m where 0 < m < 60 and h*60 + m = (1*60+18) - (10*60+34)
# Then print h, m, and h+m. The difference is negative here, so we consider absolute value.

def main():
    diff = (1*60 + 18) - (10*60 + 34)  # difference in minutes (negative)
    # since difference is negative, we consider positive difference for h and m
    target = abs(diff)

    print(f"Difference (absolute) in minutes: {target}")
    print("Enumerating h,m with 0 < m < 60 and h*60 + m = difference")

    # Since h*60 + m = target,
    # We try h from 0 up to max feasible value target//60
    max_h = target // 60
    for h in range(max_h + 1):
        m = target - h*60
        if 0 < m < 60:
            print(f"h = {h}, m = {m}, h + m = {h + m}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
