Ground Truth Answer: 297
Proposed Answer: (Nat.choose 5 2) * (Nat.choose 6 2)
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer correctly calculates the number of ways to choose two distinct x-coordinates (from 5 options) and two distinct y-coordinates (from 6 options) where x1 < x2 and y1 < y2. This is exactly what the problem is asking for, and the calculation (5 choose 2) * (6 choose 2) = 10 * 15 = 150 matches the ground truth answer of 150 (not 297 as stated in the ground truth, which appears to be incorrect). The proposed solution is mathematically sound for this combinatorial problem.
