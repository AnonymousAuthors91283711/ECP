The problem defines a binary operation \(\otimes\) on \(\mathbb{R}\) given by \(a \otimes b = \frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{a}\). It asks to evaluate \(4 \otimes 8\) under this operation.

To assist in understanding this and potentially conjecturing properties or patterns, the Python program below enumerates \(\otimes\) values for small positive integer pairs \((a,b)\) with \(1 \leq a,b \leq 10\). It immediately prints the exact rational expression values (as floats are acceptable approximation here since no strict rational datatype). Also, it prints the specific value of \(4 \otimes 8\).

```python
# Enumerate a âŠ— b = a/b + b/a for small positive integers a,b
def otimes(a, b):
    return a / b + b / a

print("Enumerating otimes(a,b) for a,b in [1..10]:")
for a in range(1, 11):
    for b in range(1, 11):
        val = otimes(a, b)
        print(f"otimes({a},{b}) = {val}")

val_4_8 = otimes(4, 8)
print(f"\nSpecific value otimes(4,8) = {val_4_8}")
```
This will aid in conjecturing properties like symmetry and magnitude patterns, and verify directly the \(4 \otimes 8\) value.
