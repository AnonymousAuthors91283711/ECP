The equation involves a functional equation with real inputs and outputs. We will enumerate candidates for f at various points by trying simple functions (like polynomials) and then verify against the equation for some sample values x, y.

```python
# Enumerate candidate polynomials f(x) = a*x^2 + b*x + c satisfying
# f(x) + f(2x + y) + 5*x*y = f(3x - y) + 2*x^2 + 1
# We test integer coefficients a,b,c in a small range for feasibility.

def f(a,b,c,x):
    return a*x*x + b*x + c

def check_eq(a,b,c,x,y):
    return f(a,b,c,x) + f(a,b,c,2*x + y) + 5*x*y == f(a,b,c,3*x - y) + 2*x*x + 1

# We'll try all a,b,c in range(-5,6)
# check equation for a sample of (x,y) values
samples = [(0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1), (2,-1), (-1,2)]

for a in range(-5,6):
    for b in range(-5,6):
        for c in range(-5,6):
            if all(check_eq(a,b,c,x,y) for (x,y) in samples):
                print(f"Candidate polynomial: f(x) = {a}*x^2 + {b}*x + {c}")

# From candidates, compute f(10)
for a in range(-5,6):
    for b in range(-5,6):
        for c in range(-5,6):
            if all(check_eq(a,b,c,x,y) for (x,y) in samples):
                val = f(a,b,c,10)
                print(f"f(10) = {val} for f(x) = {a}x^2 + {b}x + {c}")

The original program attempts to solve the functional equation by testing quadratic polynomials with integer coefficients in a limited range and checking on a small set of sample points. However:

- The equation involves multiple variables and quadratic terms. Checking only a few sample points will generally not guarantee the polynomial satisfies the identity for all real x, y.
- The range (-5, 5) is arbitrary and may miss valid solutions with coefficients outside that range or non-integers.
- The approach is brute force and incomplete.
- The program outputs are empty because no triple (a, b, c) in the range satisfies the equation on the samples exactly.
- The problem requires calculating f(10) for the function f defined by the equation, not enumerating candidates.
- A standard approach to such functional equations is to assume a general quadratic polynomial and substitute into the equation, then equate coefficients to solve for a, b, c symbolically.
- Then the value f(10) can be computed exactly from the solution coefficients.

Therefore, the program should be replaced with a symbolic solver approach using sympy. This will yield the exact polynomial satisfying the functional equation and compute the exact f(10).

```python
from sympy import symbols, simplify, Eq, solve

# Define polynomial coefficients and variables
a, b, c, x, y = symbols('a b c x y')

# Define polynomial f(x) = a*x^2 + b*x + c
def f(expr):
    return a*expr**2 + b*expr + c

# Functional equation:
# f(x) + f(2x + y) + 5*x*y = f(3x - y) + 2*x^2 + 1 for all real x,y
# Substitute f:
eq = Eq(f(x) + f(2*x + y) + 5*x*y, f(3*x - y) + 2*x**2 + 1)

# Expand and simplify both sides
lhs = simplify(f(x) + f(2*x + y) + 5*x*y)
rhs = simplify(f(3*x - y) + 2*x**2 + 1)

# Rearrange equation to lhs - rhs = 0
equation = simplify(lhs - rhs)

# Collect the equation as a polynomial in x,y
# It should be identically zero for all x,y so coefficients must be zero
# Collect terms

The original submission provides a formal statement of the problem in Lean-like syntax but no Python program to enumerate the answers or verify them. The requirements explicitly ask for a Python program that enumerates solutions and prints intermediate steps, which is absent. Therefore, the original solution is unacceptable.

Since the problem is a functional equation involving f: ℝ → ℝ and is likely to have a polynomial form solution, I'll provide a Python program that tries to find polynomial coefficients for f(x) assuming f is quadratic or linear, uses the functional equation to form constraints, and solves for them. This enumeration will print candidate functions fitting the equation for sample values, and finally print the candidate function value at x=10.

This approach satisfies the problem requirements by enumerating possible function candidates and printing their evaluation at 10.

# We try to solve for f: R->R satisfying
# f(x) + f(2x + y) + 5xy = f(3x - y) + 2x^2 + 1
# Assuming f is quadratic: f(x) = a x^2 + b x + c
# We form equations for sample (x,y) and solve for a,b,c.

import numpy as np

# We test the functional equation for symbolic form:
# f(x) = a x^2 + b x + c
# Substitute and rearrange:
# f(x) + f(2x + y) + 5 x y = f(3x - y) + 2 x^2 + 1
# a x^2 + b x + c + a (2x + y)^2 + b (2x + y) + c + 5 x y
# = a (3x - y)^2 + b (3x - y) + c + 2 x^2 + 1

# Let's pick 3 pairs (x,y) and solve the resulting linear system for a,b,c

pairs = [(0,0), (1,0), (0,1)]

A = []
B = []

for x,y in pairs:
    left = [x**2, x, 1]  # f(x) = a x^2 + b x + c
    left2 = [(2*x + y)**2, (2*x + y), 1]
