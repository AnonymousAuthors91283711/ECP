[write_program]
The problem involves finding a 6-tuple of natural numbers such that the gcd of every distinct pair belongs to the set of primes ≤ 26, and conversely, every such prime appears as the gcd of some pair. We want to explore such tuples, enumerate candidates, and check these gcd conditions.

The program below works as follows:
- Defines the prime set S = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23} (primes ≤ 26).
- Enumerates 6-tuples of natural numbers with small values (up to 100).
- Checks gcd conditions: each pair’s gcd is in S, and every prime in S appears as a gcd of some pair.
- Prints tuples fulfilling the conditions immediately.
- After enumeration ends, prints the total found.

This aids conjecturing the answer by supplying explicit examples.

```python
from math import gcd
from itertools import combinations, product

# Primes ≤ 26
S = [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23]

def all_gcds_in_S(a):
    pairs = combinations(range(6),2)
    gcds = set()
    for i,j in pairs:
        g = gcd(a[i], a[j])
        if g not in S:
            return False, None
        gcds.add(g)
    return True, gcds

def main():
    limit = 100  # Search numbers from 1 to limit
    found = 0

    # Enumerate increasing 6-tuples with values in [1..limit]
    # Using ascending order to avoid duplicates with permutations
    for a in product(range(1,limit+1), repeat=6):
        # Quick filter: all within small range and ascending to avoid repetition
        if sorted(a) != list(a):
            continue
        valid, gcd_set = all_gcds_in_S(a)
        if not valid:
            continue
        # All primes must appear in gcd_set
        if all(p in gcd_set for p in S):
            found += 1
            print(f"Tuple #{found}: {a} with gcd set {sorted(gcd_set)}")

    print(f"Total tuples found: {found}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
