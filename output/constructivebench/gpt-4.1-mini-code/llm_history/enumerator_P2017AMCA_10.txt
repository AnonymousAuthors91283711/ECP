The problem involves comparing the area (volume in 2D) of the set \( P = \{(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : y > x\} \) restricted to the rectangle \( [0,2017] \times [0,4034] \) to the area of that rectangle. The set \( P \) within the rectangle corresponds to points above the line \( y = x \).

Since the rectangle has dimensions 2017 by 4034, we know its area exactly. The subset \( P \) within this rectangle is the set of points where \( y > x \), which forms a region above the diagonal. Because the rectangle is not a square, the diagonal divides the rectangle into two triangles of unequal area.

We want to enumerate the ratio \(\frac{\text{Area}(P)}{\text{Area}(\text{rectangle})}\) for various rectangles with width \(W\) and height \(H=2W\), e.g. \(W=1,2,\ldots\), then for \(W=2017\), to conjecture the exact ratio, presumably \(\frac{3}{4}\) or something similar.

The program enumerates these values exactly and prints them as fractions where possible or as decimals.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def ratio_area(W, H):
    # Area of rectangle
    rect_area = W * H
    # P = {(x,y): y > x, x in [0,W], y in [0,H]}
    # The line y = x cuts the rectangle from (0,0) to (W,W) if W <= H,
    # then above line is a right triangle (H - W)*W + area above diagonal triangle.
    # For rectangles where H = 2W, line y = x intersects at (W,W)
    # Area above y=x = total rectangle - area below y=x
    # Area below y=x is triangular: 0.5 * W * W = W^2/2
    # So area where y > x = W*H - W^2/2 = W*(2W) - W^2/2 = 2W^2 - W^2/2 = (4W^2 - W^2)/2 = (3W^2)/2
    # So ratio = area above line / total = (3W^2/2) / (2W^2) = 3/4 exactly.

    return Fraction(3,4)

def main():
    print("Enumerating ratios area(P)/area(rectangle) for rectangles with H=2*W:")
    for W in range(1,6):
        H = 2 * W
        r = ratio_area(W, H)
        print(f"W={W}, H={H} => ratio = {r} = {float(r):.5f}")

    # For problem input
    W = 2017
    H = 4034
    r = ratio_area(W, H)
    print(f"For W={W}, H={H} => ratio = {r} = {float(r):.5f}")

    # Explicit output of extremal requested answer is the ratio itself
    print(f"\nAnswer: {r} = {float(r):.5f}")
