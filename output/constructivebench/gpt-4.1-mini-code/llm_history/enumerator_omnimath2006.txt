[write_program]
The problem relates to counting elements in a set defined by divisibility conditions on permutations of a range, and finding the maximum such count. We will try small-size permutations (length n=3..6) to gather data for conjecture about the maximum count of indices n with π(n) divides π(n+1). The program enumerates all permutations, counts valid k for each π, prints them, and prints the max found.

```python
import math
from itertools import permutations

def count_divides(p):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(p) - 1):
        if p[i+1] % p[i] == 0:
            count += 1
    return count

def try_n(n):
    print(f"n = {n}")
    max_count = -1
    for p in permutations(range(1, n+1)):
        c = count_divides(p)
        print(f"Permutation: {p}, count: {c}")
        if c > max_count:
            max_count = c
    print(f"Max count for n={n}: {max_count}\n")

def main():
    for n in range(3, 7):  # small sample sizes, increasing complexity
        try_n(n)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
