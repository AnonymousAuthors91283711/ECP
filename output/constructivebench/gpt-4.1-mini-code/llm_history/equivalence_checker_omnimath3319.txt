noncomputable abbrev omnimath3319_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3319 : 
  ∏ k ∈ Finset.range 2004, sin (2 * π * (k + 1) / 4009) = omnimath3319_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: Real.sqrt 4009 / 2 ^ 2004
Proposed Answer: sin (π * 2004 / 4009) / (2 ^ 2004)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the product of sine terms from k=0 to 2003 of sin(2π(k+1)/4009).

2. The ground truth answer is √4009 / 2²⁰⁰⁴.

3. The proposed answer is sin(π*2004/4009)/2²⁰⁰⁴.

Comparing these:
- Both answers have the denominator 2²⁰⁰⁴, which matches.
- The numerators differ: √4009 vs sin(π*2004/4009).
- Numerically evaluating sin(π*2004/4009) ≈ 0.9999, while √4009 ≈ 63.31, so they're clearly different.

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
1. It doesn't match the ground truth numerically
2. The sine term in the proposed answer doesn't properly account for the product of all 2004 sine terms

<<<False>>>
