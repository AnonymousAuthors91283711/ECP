abbrev omnimath3823_answer : Set (ℕ × ℕ) := sorry
theorem omnimath3823 (m n : ℕ) (hm : 3 ≤ m) (hn : 3 ≤ n) :
  Infinite {a : ℕ | 0 < a ∧ ∃ k : ℕ, (a^m + a - 1) = k * (a^n + a^2 - 1)} ↔ (m, n) ∈ omnimath3823_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Checking pairs (m,n) with 3 <= m,n <=7 and a upto 100
m=5, n=3, a=2 | 33 divisible by 11
m=5, n=3, a=3 | 245 divisible by 35
m=5, n=3, a=4 | 1027 divisible by 79
m=5, n=3, a=5 | 3129 divisible by 149
m=5, n=3, a=6 | 7781 divisible by 251
Many solutions for (m,n)=(5,3), example a's: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ)
<<<{(m,n) | m = 2*n - 1 ∧ n ≥ 3}>>>
