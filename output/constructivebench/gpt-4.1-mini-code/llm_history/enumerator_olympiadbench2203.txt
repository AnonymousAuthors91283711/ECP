The problem involves finding all triples (a, b, c) in ℝ³ satisfying the system:
1. a*b + b*c + c*a = 1
2. a²*b + c = b²*c + a
3. b²*c + a = c²*a + b

Let's enumerate rational triples (a, b, c) with small numerators and denominators, checking these equations exactly where possible. This approach can help conjecture the solution set.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def check_conditions(a, b, c):
    # Using Fraction to keep exact values
    lhs1 = a*b + b*c + c*a
    eq1 = (lhs1 == 1)
    lhs2 = a**2*b + c
    rhs2 = b**2*c + a
    eq2 = (lhs2 == rhs2)
    lhs3 = rhs2
    rhs3 = c**2*a + b
    eq3 = (lhs3 == rhs3)
    return eq1 and eq2 and eq3

# Enumerate small fractions between -3 and 3 (inclusive) with denominator <= 3
values = []
range_num = range(-3, 4)
denoms = [1,2,3]

print("Enumerating triples (a,b,c) with numerator in [-3,3] and denominator in [1,2,3]:")

# Keep track to limit total output tokens
found = []
max_found = 20

for an in range_num:
    for ad in denoms:
        a = Fraction(an, ad)
        for bn in range_num:
            for bd in denoms:
                b = Fraction(bn, bd)
                for cn in range_num:
                    for cd in denoms:
                        c = Fraction(cn, cd)
                        if check_conditions(a,b,c):
                            print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}")
                            found.append((a,b,c))
                            if len(found) >= max_found:
                                break
                    if len(found) >= max_found:
                        break
                if len(found) >= max_found:
                    break
            if len(found) >= max_found:
                break
        if len(found) >= max_found:
            break
    if len(found) >= max_found:
        break
if not found:
    print("No solutions found in this range.")
```
