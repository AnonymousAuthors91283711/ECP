Problem: Find a 3x3 matrix M with entries from 1 to 9, all distinct, such that any two entries differing by 1 are adjacent cells (neighbors either horizontally or vertically), the sum of the four corners is 18, and find the center value.

We want to enumerate all such matrices and print any that satisfy the constraints, along with their P2016AMCB_12_answer = M(1,1).

Approach:
- Use permutations of 1..9 as matrix entries.
- Check distinctness (always true for permutations).
- Check adjacent difference=1 implies adjacency in grid.
- Check sum corners = 18.
- Print each such M and the center value.
- Since 9! is large (362,880), pruning is important.
- For each permutation, can arrange as 3x3 and check constraints efficiently.
- Will minimize output by printing only valid matrices and their center entries.

We will print the matrix as a list of lists, and the center value.

```python
from itertools import permutations

def neighbors(i, j):
    return [(i+di, j+dj) for di,dj in [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)] if 0<=i+di<3 and 0<=j+dj<3]

# Map 1D idx to 2D (i,j)
def idx_to_ij(idx):
    return divmod(idx,3)

values = range(1,10)
count = 0

for perm in permutations(values):
    M = [list(perm[i*3:(i+1)*3]) for i in range(3)]
    # sum corners =18
    s = M[0][0]+M[0][2]+M[2][0]+M[2][2]
    if s!=18:
        continue
    # check "difference of 1 implies adjacency"
    valid = True
    pos = {}
    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(3):
            pos[M[i][j]] = (i,j)
    for a in range(1,10):
        for b in range(a+1,10):
            if abs(a-b)==1:
                (i1,j1) = pos[a]
                (i2,j2) = pos[b]
                if abs(i1 - i2) + abs(j1 - j2)!=1:
                    valid=False
                    break
        if not valid:
            break
    if not valid:
        continue
    # If passed all checks, print matrix and center value.
    count += 1
    print(f"Valid matrix #{count}:")
    for row in M:
        print(row)
    print("Center value (M[1][1]) =", M[1][1])
    print()
```
This program stops after enumerating all such valid matrices and prints the center values.
