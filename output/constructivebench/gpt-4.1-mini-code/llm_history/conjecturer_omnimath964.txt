  omnimath964_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n = 1 does not cover all residues mod 100
n = 2 does not cover all residues mod 100
n = 3 does not cover all residues mod 100
n = 4 does not cover all residues mod 100
n = 5 does not cover all residues mod 100
n = 6 does not cover all residues mod 100
n = 7 does not cover all residues mod 100
n = 8 does not cover all residues mod 100
n = 9 does not cover all residues mod 100
n = 10 does not cover all residues mod 100
n = 11 does not cover all residues mod 100
n = 12 does not cover all residues mod 100
n = 13 does not cover all residues mod 100
n = 14 does not cover all residues mod 100
n = 15 does not cover all residues mod 100
n = 16 does not cover all residues mod 100
n = 17 covers all residues mod 100
Minimal n seems to be 17
