abbrev omnimath3372_answer : ℕ → Rat := sorry
theorem omnimath3372 (n : ℕ) (hn : n ≠ 0) : 
  (1 / n) = omnimath3372_answer n := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (1 / (2 * n)) + (1 / (3 * n)) + (1 / (6 * n))
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => 1 / n
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find a function omnimath3372_answer such that for all non-zero natural numbers n, 1/n equals this function applied to n.

2. The ground truth answer shows that:
   1/n = 1/(2n) + 1/(3n) + 1/(6n)
   This is correct because:
   1/(2n) + 1/(3n) + 1/(6n) = (3 + 2 + 1)/(6n) = 6/(6n) = 1/n

3. The proposed answer simply returns 1/n, which is exactly what we're trying to prove equals some expression. This doesn't provide any decomposition or alternative expression for 1/n.

The proposed answer is just restating the left side of the equation rather than providing a meaningful right side expression. Therefore, it's not equivalent to the ground truth answer.
