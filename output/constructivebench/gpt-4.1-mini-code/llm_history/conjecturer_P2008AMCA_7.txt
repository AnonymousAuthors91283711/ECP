  IsLeast {r : ℝ | 0 ≤ r ∧ 
    let t := 1/4  -- time to shore in hours (1 mile / 4 mph)
    let t' := t * 60  -- convert to minutes
    (10 - r) * t' ≤ 30}  -- net water intake must be ≤ 30 gallons

<<<8>>> 
-- Explanation: From (10 - r)*15 ≤ 30, minimal r satisfies (10 - r) ≤ 2, so r ≥ 8. The least such r is 8.
