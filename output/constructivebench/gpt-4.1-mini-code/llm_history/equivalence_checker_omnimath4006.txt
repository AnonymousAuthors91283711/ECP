Ground Truth Answer: {1, 13, 43, 91, 157}
Proposed Answer: { n | ∃ s : ℕ, s > 0 ∧ n = s * (s - 1) + 1 }
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for natural numbers n > 0 where the digit sum s satisfies s*(s-1) = n-1.

2. The ground truth gives specific numbers {1, 13, 43, 91, 157} that satisfy this condition.

3. The proposed answer gives a set builder notation {n | ∃ s > 0, n = s*(s-1)+1}.

4. Let's test the proposed answer against the ground truth:
   - For s=1: n=1*(0)+1=1 (matches)
   - For s=4: n=4*3+1=13 (matches)
   - For s=7: n=7*6+1=43 (matches)
   - For s=10: n=10*9+1=91 (matches)
   - For s=13: n=13*12+1=157 (matches)

5. The proposed answer correctly captures the relationship between s (digit sum) and n, and generates exactly the same numbers as the ground truth when s takes the values that make n satisfy the original condition.
