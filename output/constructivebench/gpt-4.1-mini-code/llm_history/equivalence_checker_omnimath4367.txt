Ground Truth Answer: fun N => ∃ a b : ℕ, N = 2^a * 3^b
Proposed Answer: fun N => N = 1 ∨ N = 2 ∨ N = 3 ∨ N = 4 ∨ N = 8 ∨ N = 12 ∨ N = 16 ∨ N = 32 ∨ N = 36

The proposed answer lists specific values of N that satisfy the condition, but the ground truth answer provides a general form (N = 2^a * 3^b) that covers all possible values of N that satisfy the condition. The proposed answer is correct for the values it lists, but incomplete since it doesn't capture all possible values (e.g., N=6,9,18,24,27, etc. would also satisfy the general form but aren't listed). Therefore, the answers are not fully equivalent.
