theorem omnimath1306 : 
  ∃ (a b c : ℤ) (f : ℤ[X]), 
    f = X^4 + C a * X^2 + C b * X + C c ∧ 
    (2 : ℤ) ∈ f.roots ∧ (-3 : ℤ) ∈ f.roots ∧ (5 : ℤ) ∈ f.roots ∧ 
    a + b + c = omnimath1306_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Known roots fixed: [2, -3, 5]
Trying possible integer 4th roots in range -10 to 10 (excluding known roots)...
4th root: -4, polynomial: X^4 + -27*X^2 + -14*X + 120, sum a+b+c = 79. Expected Answer Type: ℤ
<<<79>>>
