abbrev omnimath4233_answer : Set (ℝ[X]) := sorry
theorem omnimath4233 (f : ℝ[X]) :
  (∀ x : ℝ, eval x f * eval (2 * x^2) f = eval (2 * x^3 + x) f) ↔ f ∈ omnimath4233_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Satisfies condition: f(x) = 1
Satisfies condition: f(x) = x^2+1. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ[X])
<<<{f | f = 1 ∨ f = X^2 + 1}>>>
