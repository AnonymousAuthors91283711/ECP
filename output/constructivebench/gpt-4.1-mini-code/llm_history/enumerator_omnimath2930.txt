[write_program]
The problem seems to involve verifying or exploring the value of the expression \(\frac{1 + 3 \times 5}{2}\). We will write a Python program to enumerate possible values based on variants of this expression, such as changing the multiplier or different combinations, and print the results. This may help conjecture if the given answer matches these variants.

```python
# Enumerate expressions of the form (1 + 3 * k) / 2 for k in a small range
# Print exact fractions when possible

from fractions import Fraction

print("Enumerating values of (1 + 3 * k) / 2 for k=0 to 10:")
for k in range(11):
    val = Fraction(1 + 3 * k, 2)
    print(f"k={k}: (1 + 3*{k})/2 = {val} = {float(val)}")

print("\nEnumerating variations: (a + b * c)/d for small integers a,b,c,d:")
for a in range(0,4):
    for b in range(0,6):
        for c in range(0,6):
            for d in range(1,5):
                val = Fraction(a + b * c, d)
                print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}: ({a}+{b}*{c})/{d} = {val} = {float(val)}")
                # Limit output tokens by break conditions if massive output would occur

# As a summary, print the specific value from the problem:
val = Fraction(1 + 3 * 5, 2)
print(f"\nGiven expression (1 + 3*5)/2 = {val} = {float(val)}")
```
