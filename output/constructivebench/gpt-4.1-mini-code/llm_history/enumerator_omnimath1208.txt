The problem counts numbers \( n \) between 1 and 2002 whose binary representation has the same number of 1's as \( n+1 \) in binary. The code below enumerates such \( n \) and prints each. After checking all, it prints the total count.

```python
# Enumerate n in [1, 2002] where binary 1's count of n equals that of n+1
def bitcount(x):
    return bin(x).count('1')

count = 0
for n in range(1, 2003):
    c_n = bitcount(n)
    c_np1 = bitcount(n+1)
    if c_n == c_np1:
        print(f"n={n}, 1-bits count={c_n}")
        count += 1
print("Total count =", count)
```
