This problem involves finding the unique real number \( b \) that satisfies the equation \( 0 = 2 \times (-4) + b \). To assist in conjecturing the answer, I will enumerate values of \( b \) near the expected exact value.

```python
# Enumerate integer values of b near -2*(-4) = 8 to find the one satisfying 0 = 2*(-4) + b
# Since 2*(-4) = -8, the equation is 0 = -8 + b => b = 8
# We check values near 8 to confirm

target_value = 0
multiplier = 2
operand = -4

for b in range(5, 12):  # check integers near 8
    left_side = multiplier * operand + b
    print(f"b = {b}, left_side = {left_side}")
    if left_side == target_value:
        print(f"Candidate b satisfying 0 = 2*(-4) + b: {b}")
        break
```
