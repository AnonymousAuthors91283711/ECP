Ground Truth Answer: 35
Proposed Answer: 41 - Nat.sqrt 41
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer.

The problem is asking for the count of numbers b (from 1 to 41) where:
1. b > 1
2. b^1 ≤ 41 (which is always true for b ≤ 41)
3. 41 < b^2 (which means b > √41)

So essentially, we're looking for numbers b where:
√41 < b ≤ 41 and b > 1

Since √41 ≈ 6.403, the smallest integer satisfying this is 7.

The count would be from 7 to 41, inclusive, which is 41 - 7 + 1 = 35 numbers.

The proposed answer is 41 - Nat.sqrt 41. Since Nat.sqrt 41 = 6 (integer square root), this gives 41 - 6 = 35.
