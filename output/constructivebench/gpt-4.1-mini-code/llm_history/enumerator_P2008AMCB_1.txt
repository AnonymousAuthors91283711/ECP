The problem describes the set of totals of the form 2*(5-k) + 3*k for k from 0 to 5. We want to enumerate all such totals and count how many distinct values appear.

```python
# Enumerate all values total = 2*(5-k) + 3*k for k in [0..5],
# print each unique total immediately when found, then print the count.

def main():
    totals = set()
    print("Computing totals for k in [0..5]: total = 2*(5 - k) + 3*k")
    for k in range(6):
        total = 2*(5 - k) + 3*k
        if total not in totals:
            totals.add(total)
            print(f"Found total: {total}")
    print(f"Number of distinct totals: {len(totals)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
