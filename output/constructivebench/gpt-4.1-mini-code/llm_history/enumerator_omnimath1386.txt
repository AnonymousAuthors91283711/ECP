We want to compute the product over n from 2 to 6 of ((n^3 - 1)/(n^3 + 1)) as a rational number and print the steps. This will help conjecture the closed form.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Compute product for n in [2..6] of ((n^3 - 1)/(n^3 + 1))
numer = 1
denom = 1

print("n, term (fraction)")
for n in range(2, 7):
    term = Fraction(n**3 - 1, n**3 + 1)
    print(f"{n}, {term}")
    numer *= term.numerator
    denom *= term.denominator

result = Fraction(numer, denom)
print("\nProduct (exact):", result)
print("Product (approx):", float(result))
```
