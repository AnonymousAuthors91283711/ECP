The problem involves enumerating the number of uphill paths in Nordic squares of size n×n. Nordic squares are bijections from a grid to {0,...,n²-1}. We want to find the minimal number \(k\) of uphill paths over all Nordic squares.  
To assist, we'll generate all Nordic squares for small n (e.g., n=2), enumerate all uphill paths for each, and print counts. This helps conjecture the minimal number of uphill paths.

```python
from itertools import permutations

# Small test size n=2
n = 2
N = n*n
print(f"n={n}")

# Positions in the grid
positions = [(i,j) for i in range(n) for j in range(n)]

def adj(c, d):
    (x1,y1), (x2,y2) = c, d
    return (x1 == x2 and abs(y1 - y2) == 1) or (y1 == y2 and abs(x1 - x2) == 1)

def uphill_paths(f):
    # Map from position to value 
    val = {(i,j):f[i*n+j] for i in range(n) for j in range(n)}

    paths = []

    def is_valley(i,j):
        # f(i,j) < f of all adjacent
        for (x,y) in positions:
            if adj((i,j),(x,y)) and val[(x,y)] <= val[(i,j)]:
                return False
        return True

    def extend_path(path):
        last = path[-1]
        extended = False
        for nbr in positions:
            if adj(last,nbr) and val[nbr] > val[last] and nbr not in path:
                extended = True
                extend_path(path+[nbr])
        if not extended:
            paths.append(path)

    # Start at valleys
    for pos in positions:
        if is_valley(*pos):
            extend_path([pos])
    return len(paths)

count_paths = {}
for perm in permutations(range(N)):
    f = perm # f(i,j) = perm[i*n+j]
    k = uphill_paths(f)
    if k not in count_paths:
        print(f"Uphill paths count: {k}")
        count_paths[k] = 1
    else:
        count_paths[k] += 1

min_k = min(count_paths)
print(f"Minimal uphill paths: {min_k}")
```
