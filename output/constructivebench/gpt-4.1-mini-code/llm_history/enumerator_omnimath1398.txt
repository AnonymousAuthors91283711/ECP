We want to investigate the infinite sum S = ∑ (2n choose n) * (1/5)^n for n=0 to ∞, and conjecture the exact closed-form value. The central binomial coefficient (2n choose n) often appears in generating functions related to 1/√(1 - 4x). We will numerically approximate partial sums for increasing n and look for a recognizable pattern or rational value.

```python
from math import comb

def approx_sum(max_n):
    total = 0.0
    for n in range(max_n+1):
        c = comb(2*n, n)
        term = c * (1/5)**n
        total += term
        print(f"n={n}, term={c}*(1/5)^{n}={term:.10f}, partial sum={total:.10f}")
    return total

print("Enumerate partial sums of sum_{n>=0} C(2n,n)*(1/5)^n")
max_terms = 20
approx_sum(max_terms)
```
