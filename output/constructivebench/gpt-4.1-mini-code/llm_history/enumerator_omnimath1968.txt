[write_program]
The problem considers subsets \( S \) of natural numbers that are intervals (closed under taking all numbers between any two elements), contain no elements whose digit sum is divisible by 11, and have maximum possible size \( k \). We want to find and enumerate such maximal sizes \( k \) for small intervals.

To assist in conjecturing the maximum cardinality, this program will:
- Check all intervals [a,b] with \( 0 \leq a \leq b \leq N \) for small \( N \) (e.g., 20).
- Check if the sum of digits of any number in the interval is divisible by 11.
- If not, output the size of the interval (b - a + 1) and the interval itself.
- Track and print the maximum size found.

This enumerates candidate answers with their corresponding intervals.

```python
# Enumerate intervals [a,b] within 0..20 where no number has digit sum divisible by 11
def digit_sum(n):
    s = 0
    while n > 0:
        s += n % 10
        n //=10
    return s

def main():
    N = 20
    max_size = 0
    print(f"Checking intervals within [0..{N}] where digit sums mod 11 != 0 for all elements.")
    for a in range(N+1):
        for b in range(a, N+1):
            # Check sum of digits mod 11 for all in [a,b]
            if all((digit_sum(x) % 11) != 0 for x in range(a,b+1)):
                size = b - a + 1
                print(f"Interval [{a},{b}] size {size} valid")
                if size > max_size:
                    max_size = size
    print(f"Maximum valid interval size found: {max_size}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
