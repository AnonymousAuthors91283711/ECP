The problem counts paths of length 6 in a 5-dimensional hypercube starting and ending at the zero vertex, with the constraint that each step flips exactly 2 bits. We want to find the number of such paths. To gain insight, we enumerate parameters and count valid sequences step-by-step. Each vertex can be represented by a 5-bit binary string. Each move flips exactly 2 bits. The path starts and ends at 00000. Steps: path0=00000, path5=00000, each move changes exactly 2 bits.

We enumerate all 6-step paths (with vertices v0..v5) satisfying the conditions:
- v0 = 0 (all bits = 0)
- v5 = 0
- for each step i, Hamming distance between v(i) and v(i+1) is exactly 2

To reduce complexity:
- Number of vertices: 2^5=32
- Moves are edges connecting vertices differing in 2 bits.
- We count number of 5-step walks from vertex 0 to vertex 0 in the graph where edges connect differing by 2 bits.

This is counting the (0,0)-entry of the 5-step power of the adjacency matrix of the graph defined by edges between vertices differing in 2 bits.

We implement this via adjacency matrix exponentiation for N=5 steps starting and ending at 0.

```python
# Count number of length-5 walks in 5-hypercube graph where edges connect vertices differing in exactly 2 bits.
# Vertices: 0..31 (5-bit integers)
# Edges: between vertices with Hamming distance exactly 2

def hamming_distance(a, b):
    return bin(a ^ b).count('1')

def neighbors(v):
    # neighbors differ by exactly 2 bits
    res = []
    for w in range(32):
        if hamming_distance(v, w) == 2:
            res.append(w)
    return res

def mat_mult(A, B):
    n = len(A)
    res = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        Ai = A[i]
        for j in range(n):
            s = 0
            for k in range(n):
                s += Ai[k]*B[k][j]
            res[i][j] = s
    return res

def mat_pow(M, power):
    n = len(M)
    # initialize result as identity
    R = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n): R[i][i] = 1
    base = M
    p = power
    while p > 0:
        if p & 1:
            R = mat_mult(R, base)
        base = mat_mult(base, base)
        p >>= 1
    return R

    n = 32
    # build adjacency matrix A
    A = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]
    for v in range(n):
        for w in neighbors(v):
            A[v][w] = 1
    # We count walks of length 5 from 0 to 0
    A5 = mat_pow(A, 5)
    answer = A5[0][0]
    print("Number of 6-vertex paths in 5-hypercube flipping 2 bits each step, starting and ending at 0:")
    print(answer)
