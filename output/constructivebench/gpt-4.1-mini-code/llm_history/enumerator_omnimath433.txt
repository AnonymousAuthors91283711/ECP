The problem involves a quartic polynomial \(P(x) = x^4 + a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d\) with real roots \(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4\), subject to the constraint \(b - d \geq 5\). We want to analyze the product \(\prod (x_i^2 + 1)\) over the roots \(x_i\), and find its minimum, or at least enumerate possible values for it under these constraints.

To proceed computationally:

- Roots and coefficients satisfy the relations:
  - sum of roots = \(-a\)
  - sum of product of roots two at a time = \(b\)
  - sum of product of roots three at a time = \(-c\)
  - product of roots = \(d\)

- The main constraint is \(b - d \geq 5\).

We can enumerate integer or rational roots (or floats) in a small range, generate combinations of roots, compute polynomial coefficients from roots, check the inequality constraint, then compute the product \(\prod (x_i^2 + 1)\) and print results.

The program:

- Will enumerate quadruples of roots (integers from -3 to 3 to keep the search small).
- For each, compute \(b\) and \(d\).
- Check \(b - d \ge 5\).
- Calculate the product of roots squared plus one.
- Print results immediately when found.

This will give some candidate values for the product and help observe patterns or guess the minimum.

```python
# Enumerate integer quartic roots in range -3..3 to explore values of prod (x_i^2+1)
# under constraint b - d >= 5, where b = sum of x_i x_j (2 at a time), d = product of roots.

from itertools import product
from math import prod

def sum_two(roots):
    s = 0
    for i in range(4):
        for j in range(i+1,4):
            s += roots[i]*roots[j]
    return s

def product_roots(roots):
    p = 1
    for r in roots:
        p *= r
    return p

def main():
    # enumerate roots (x1,x2,x3,x4) integer in [-3..3], allow repeats
    R = range(-3,4)
    found = set()
    for roots in product(R, repeat=4):
        b = sum_two(roots)
        d = product_roots(roots)
        if b - d >= 5:
            val = prod(x*x+1 for x in roots)
            # print unique values only
            if val not in found:
                found.add(val)
                print(f"roots={roots} b={b} d={d} product={val}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
