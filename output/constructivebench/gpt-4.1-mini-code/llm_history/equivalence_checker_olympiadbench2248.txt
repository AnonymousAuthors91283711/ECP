Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: -84
<<<True>>>
The problem gives us two equations:
1. f(x) + g(x) = 3x + 5
2. f(x) - g(x) = 5x + 7

We can solve for f(x) and g(x) by adding and subtracting these equations:
Adding: 2f(x) = 8x + 12 → f(x) = 4x + 6
Subtracting: 2g(x) = -2x - 2 → g(x) = -x - 1

Now calculate f(2) = 4*2 + 6 = 14
g(2) = -2 - 1 = -3

Then 2 * f(2) * g(2) = 2 * 14 * (-3) = -84

The proposed answer matches this calculation exactly.
