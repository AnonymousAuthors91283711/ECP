The problem involves real numbers \( p, q \) satisfying certain equations, related to sums and squared sums involving fractions. We want to explore solutions \( (p,q) \) meeting:

\[
q \leq p
\]
\[
p + q + \frac{1}{6} = 1
\]
\[
p^2 + q^2 + \left(\frac{1}{6}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}
\]

We can enumerate possible rational approximations to \( p, q \) given the constraints and check if there's any exact or close solution. Since \( r = \frac{1}{6} \) is fixed, we rewrite:

\[
p + q = 1 - \frac{1}{6} = \frac{5}{6}
\]
\[
p^2 + q^2 = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{36} = \frac{17}{36}
\]

We try to find rational numbers \( p, q \) with denominators up to some small limit satisfying these equations, and \( q \leq p \).

```python
# Enumerate rational numbers p,q with denominator up to 12 (to include sixths),
# check the constraints
from fractions import Fraction

max_den = 12
r = Fraction(1,6)
target_sum = Fraction(5,6)
target_sum_sq = Fraction(17,36)

print("Enumerating candidate (p,q) with denominators ≤", max_den)
for dp in range(1, max_den+1):
    for np in range(dp+1):  # p in [0,1]
        p = Fraction(np, dp)
        q = target_sum - p
        # Check q has denominator within limit and q ≤ p
        if q < 0 or q > 1:
            continue
        # Ensure denominator of q at most max_den by approximate denominators test
        # Instead try all denominator of q <= max_den exactly:
        # We'll check q as fraction simplified and if denominator ≤ max_den
        q_frac = q.limit_denominator(max_den)
        if q_frac != q or q_frac.denominator > max_den:
            continue
        if q > p:
            continue
        # Check sum of squares
        if p*p + q*q == target_sum_sq:
            print(f"Found exact solution p={p}, q={q}")
# Try some approximate floats as well with small step around fractions
import math
eps = 1e-10

def approx_eq(a,b):
    return abs(a - b) < eps

for dp in range(1, max_den+1):
    for np in range(dp+1):
        p = np / dp
        q = float(target_sum) - p
        if q < 0 or q > 1 or q > p:
            continue
        sum_sq = p*p + q*q
        if abs(sum_sq - float(target_sum_sq)) < 1e-8:
            print(f"Approximate float solution p={p:.6f}, q={q:.6f}, sum_sq={sum_sq:.6f}")
```
