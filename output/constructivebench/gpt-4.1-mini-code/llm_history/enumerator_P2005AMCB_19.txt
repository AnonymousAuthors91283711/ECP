The problem involves two two-digit integers \( x \) and \( y \) where \( y \) is the reverse of \( x \). We want to find triples \((x,y,m)\) such that \( x^2 - y^2 = m^2 \), \( m > 0 \), and to find the sum \( x + y + m \).

The plan:
- Iterate over \( x \) in [10,99].
- Compute \( y \) as the reversal of \( x \).
- Check if \( x^2 - y^2 = m^2 \) for some \( m > 0 \).
- Print all such triples and their sums.
- Also print the minimal possible sum found.

```python
# Enumerate all two-digit x, compute y as reversal, check if difference of squares is a perfect square m^2

def reverse_num(n):
    return (n % 10) * 10 + (n // 10)

def is_perfect_square(n):
    r = int(n**0.5)
    return r*r == n

candidates = []
min_sum = None

for x in range(10, 100):
    y = reverse_num(x)
    diff = x*x - y*y
    # We only consider positive diff (since m>0)
    if diff <= 0:
        continue
    if is_perfect_square(diff):
        m = int(diff**0.5)
        s = x + y + m
        candidates.append((s, x, y, m))
        print(f"x={x}, y={y}, m={m}, sum={s}")

if candidates:
    min_sum = min(c[0] for c in candidates)
    print(f"Minimal sum x+y+m = {min_sum}")
else:
    print("No solutions found.")
```
