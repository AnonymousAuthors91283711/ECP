The problem involves three positive real numbers \(x, y, z\) with \(xyz = 10^{81}\) and a logarithmic relation on these variables. We want to find the value of \(\sqrt{(\log x)^2 + (\log y)^2 + (\log z)^2}\).

It's natural to consider the logs of \(x,y,z\) to simplify multiplicative relations into additive ones:

Let \(a = \log x\), \(b = \log y\), and \(c = \log z\).

Given:
- \(a + b + c = \log(10^{81}) = 81\).
- The relation: \(a \cdot \log(y z) + b \cdot \log z = 468\).
  Since \(\log y + \log z = b + c\), the relation becomes:
  \(a(b+c) + b c = 468\).

We want to find \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}\).

The code below enumerates possible integer triples \((a,b,c)\) satisfying these conditions for small ranges, prints them out immediately, and attempts to find the smallest corresponding \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}\). It uses integer values for \(a,b,c\) as logarithms are often integers or rational in contest problems like this.

```python
import math

# We know a + b + c = 81 and a*(b+c) + b*c = 468
# Let's try integer triples (a,b,c) with a,b,c positive and sum 81
# We'll print all triples that satisfy the second condition exactly

print("Checking integer triples (a, b, c) with a+b+c=81 and a*(b+c)+b*c=468:")

min_norm = None
best_triple = None

for a in range(1, 80):  # a from 1 to 79
    for b in range(1, 81 - a):  # b from 1 to 80 - a
        c = 81 - a - b
        if c <= 0:
            continue
        lhs = a*(b+c) + b*c
        if lhs == 468:
            norm = math.sqrt(a*a + b*b + c*c)
            print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, norm=sqrt({a*a}+{b*b}+{c*c})={norm:.4f}")
            if min_norm is None or norm < min_norm:
                min_norm = norm
                best_triple = (a, b, c)

if best_triple is not None:
    a,b,c = best_triple
    norm_exact = math.sqrt(a*a + b*b + c*c)
    print(f"\nMinimum norm found: sqrt({a}^2 + {b}^2 + {c}^2) = {norm_exact:.4f}")
else:
    print("No integer triples found that satisfy the conditions.")
```
