The problem concerns finding integer matrices \(A, B\) of size \(n \times n\) with \(n\) odd and positive, such that \(B\) is invertible with \(\det B=1\), \(A\) and \(B\) commute, and satisfy the matrix equation:
\[
A^4 + 4 A^2 B^2 + 16 B^4 = 2019 \cdot I_n.
\]

We want to enumerate small odd values of \(n\) and construct candidate integer matrices \(A,B\) commuting with \(B\) invertible and determinant 1, checking if the equation holds. Since \(n\) odd is requested and 2019 is a scalar, a natural approach might be to try \(n=1,3,5\) and sample diagonal \(B\) matrices with \(\det B=1\) (so product of diagonal entries =1), \(A\) diagonal as well to ensure commutativity, then check the matrix equation.

Key points for efficiency:
- Use diagonal matrices \(A, B\) (commute automatically)
- Try small integer values in \([-3,3]\) for entries to limit search space
- Since \(B\) diagonal and \(\det B=1\), product of diagonal entries =1

We will enumerate:

- For \(n = 1,3\) (limit length for brevity)
- For all diagonal \(B\) with integer entries in \([-3,3]\) such that product =1
- For all diagonal \(A\) with integer entries in \([-3,3]\)
- Check if equation holds for these matrices entrywise: \(a_i^4 + 4 a_i^2 b_i^2 + 16 b_i^4 = 2019\) for each diagonal entry \(i\)

If any such tuple satisfies for all \(i\), print \(n, A, B\).

```python
# Enumerate candidate odd n, diagonal integer matrices A, B with det(B)=1, and check equation
def matrix_eq_val(a, b):
    # computes a^4 + 4 a^2 b^2 + 16 b^4
    return a**4 + 4*(a**2)*(b**2) + 16*(b**4)

def product(lst):
    p = 1
    for x in lst:
        p *= x
    return p

def enum_matrices():
    from itertools import product as iterprod

    print("Enumerating possible solutions to A^4+4A^2B^2+16B^4=2019 * I_n with n odd")
    for n in [1,3]:
        print(f"Trying dimension n={n}")
        # Generate all length n integer tuples for diagonal B with entries in -3..3 (excluding 0)
        candidates_b = [b for b in iterprod(range(-3,4), repeat=n) if 0 not in b and product(b) == 1]
        # Candidates for diagonal A in same range
        candidates_a = [a for a in iterprod(range(-3,4), repeat=n)]
        for B_diag in candidates_b:
            for A_diag in candidates_a:
                # check equation entrywise
                if all(matrix_eq_val(a, b) == 2019 for a,b in zip(A_diag, B_diag)):
                    print(f"Found solution n={n}")
                    print(f"A diagonal:{A_diag}")
                    print(f"B diagonal:{B_diag}")

enum_matrices()
```
