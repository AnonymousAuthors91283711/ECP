The problem involves finding the greatest power of 2 dividing numbers of the form \(10^{k+2} + 64\) for positive integers \(k\). We enumerate \(k\) values to find the 2-adic valuation (highest exponent of 2 dividing the number) of \(10^{k+2} + 64\), print results as found, and identify the maximum valuation observed up to a small range.

```python
# Enumerate 2-adic valuations of numbers of the form 10^(k+2) + 64 for k in small range.
# Print valuations immediately, then print the maximum valuation found.

def v2(n):
    """Return the exponent of the highest power of 2 dividing n."""
    count = 0
    while n % 2 == 0 and n > 0:
        n //= 2
        count += 1
    return count

max_val = -1
print("k | 10^(k+2)+64 | v2(10^(k+2)+64)")
for k in range(1, 21):
    n = 10**(k+2) + 64
    val = v2(n)
    print(f"{k} | {n} | {val}")
    if val > max_val:
        max_val = val

print("Maximum v2 value found:", max_val)
```
