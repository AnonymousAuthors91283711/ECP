The problem is to find a digit \( d < 10 \) such that for every perfect square \( n \) between 100 and 400 inclusive, the digit \( d \) does not appear in the decimal representation of \( n \). We want to enumerate all digits \( d \) from 0 to 9, check all squares in [100, 400], and print those digits that never appear in the decimal expansions of the squares.

We will:
- First find all squares \( n = k^2 \) with \( 100 \le n \le 400 \).
- For each digit \( d \), check if \( d \) is absent from all these squares.
- Print each candidate \( d \) when found.
- At the end, print the unique answer (if only one such \( d \)) or all candidates.

```python
# Enumerate digits d < 10 such that d does not appear in any square n with 100 <= n <= 400.
# Squares in this range have integer roots from 10 to 20 (since 10^2=100 and 20^2=400).

def digits_in_number(n):
    return set(str(n))

def main():
    squares = [k*k for k in range(10, 21)]
    print(f"Squares between 100 and 400: {squares}")

    candidates = []
    for d in range(10):
        d_char = str(d)
        # Check if d_char appears in any square's decimal digits
        appears = any(d_char in digits_in_number(sq) for sq in squares)
        if not appears:
            print(f"Candidate digit not in any square: {d}")
            candidates.append(d)

    # Print final answer if unique candidate found
    if len(candidates) == 1:
        print(f"Olympiad answer digit: {candidates[0]}")
    else:
        print(f"Possible digits: {candidates}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
