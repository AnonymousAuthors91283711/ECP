The problem revolves around enumerating certain graphs on \(n=1982\) vertices with a specific adjacency property: every 4-subset contains a vertex connected to all others in the subset. We want to find smallest cardinality \(k\) of the set of vertices connected to all others. Due to large \(n\), we test smaller versions and print \(k\) for each to conjecture formula or pattern.

```python
from itertools import combinations

def is_vertex_adjacent_to_all(graph_adj, v, subset):
    return all((w != v and (w in graph_adj[v])) for w in subset)

def check_property(n, edges):
    # Build adjacency dict
    graph_adj = {i: set() for i in range(n)}
    for u,v in edges:
        graph_adj[u].add(v)
        graph_adj[v].add(u)
    # Check every 4-subset has a dominating vertex
    for quad in combinations(range(n),4):
        if not any(is_vertex_adjacent_to_all(graph_adj, v, quad) for v in quad):
            return False
    return True

def count_universal_vertices(n, edges):
    graph_adj = {i: set() for i in range(n)}
    for u,v in edges:
        graph_adj[u].add(v)
        graph_adj[v].add(u)
    count = 0
    for v in range(n):
        if all((w == v or w in graph_adj[v]) for w in range(n)):
            count += 1
    return count

def enum_graphs_small(n):
    # Enumerate graphs on n vertices and find those satisfying property
    from itertools import combinations
    vertices = list(range(n))
    edges_all = list(combinations(vertices,2))
    best_k = n+1
    # Only test graphs with few edges (for feasibility)
    # Limit to graphs with up to n edges to reduce runtime
    max_edges = min(n, len(edges_all))
    # Enumerate all edge subsets of size max_edges (1 graph only)
    import random
    for _ in range(5): # sample few random graphs
        chosen_edges = set()
        while len(chosen_edges) < max_edges:
            e = edges_all[int(len(edges_all)*random.random())]
            chosen_edges.add(e)
        edges = list(chosen_edges)
        if check_property(n, edges):
            k = count_universal_vertices(n, edges)
            print(f"n={n}, edges={len(edges)}, universal_count={k}")
            if k < best_k:
                best_k = k
    print(f"Prime candidate minimal k for n={n}: {best_k}")

def main():
    for n in [4,5,6]:
        print(f"Enumerating for n={n}")
        enum_graphs_small(n)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
