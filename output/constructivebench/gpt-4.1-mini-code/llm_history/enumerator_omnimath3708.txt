The problem asks for the greatest natural number \(x > 0\) such that \(23^{6+x}\) divides \(2000!\). To solve this, we find the exponent of 23 in the prime factorization of \(2000!\).

The exponent of a prime \(p\) in \(n!\) is given by:
\[
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^k} \right\rfloor
\]

We want the maximum \(x > 0\) with:
\[
6 + x \leq \text{exponent of } 23 \text{ in } 2000!
\]

Enumerate the exponent and print answers accordingly.

```python
def exponent_in_factorial(n, p):
    # Compute the exponent of prime p in n!
    exp = 0
    power = p
    while power <= n:
        exp += n // power
        power *= p
    return exp

def main():
    n = 2000
    p = 23
    exp_23 = exponent_in_factorial(n, p)
    print(f"Exponent of {p} in {n}! is {exp_23}")
    
    # We want max x > 0 such that 6 + x <= exp_23
    # So x <= exp_23 - 6
    max_x = exp_23 - 6
    if max_x <= 0:
        print("No x > 0 satisfies 23^(6+x) divides 2000!")
        return
    
    # Enumerate all x > 0 up to max_x
    for x in range(1, max_x + 1):
        print(f"x = {x} works because 23^{6 + x} divides 2000!")
        
    # Output the maximum x explicitly
    print(f"Maximum x > 0 such that 23^(6+x) divides 2000! is {max_x}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
