The problem is about the polynomial \( f(x) = x^4 + 14x^3 + 52x^2 + 56x + 16 \) and the quantity of interest is the minimum over permutations \(\sigma\) of the absolute value of the sum \( |z_{\sigma(0)} z_{\sigma(1)} + z_{\sigma(2)} z_{\sigma(3)}| \) where \(z_i\) are the roots of \(f\).

This is a root configuration and combinational optimization problem. To explore this computationally and help conjecture the minimum value, we will:

- Compute roots numerically (since exact symbolic roots are complicated).
- Enumerate all permutations \(\sigma\) of 4 elements.
- Compute the absolute value of \(z_{\sigma(0)} z_{\sigma(1)} + z_{\sigma(2)} z_{\sigma(3)}\).
- Print every value found.
- Print the minimum value at the end.

This enumeration can guide conjecture about the minimum and potentially the exact value.

```python
import itertools
import cmath

def main():
    # Coefficients of f: x^4 + 14 x^3 + 52 x^2 + 56 x + 16
    coeffs = [1, 14, 52, 56, 16]

    # Compute roots (numerically)
    # numpy.roots returns roots of polynomial with highest degree first
    # but we avoid numpy to minimize imports; use numpy if allowed:
    import numpy as np
    roots = np.roots(coeffs)

    # Convert to complex (should be complex anyway)
    roots = [complex(r) for r in roots]

    # Print roots for reference
    print("Roots:")
    for i, r in enumerate(roots):
        print(f"z[{i}] = {r}")

    # Enumerate permutations of indices [0,1,2,3]
    perms = itertools.permutations(range(4))

    values = []

    print("\nValues of |z_{σ(0)}*z_{σ(1)} + z_{σ(2)}*z_{σ(3)}| for all permutations σ:")

    for sigma in perms:
        val = abs(roots[sigma[0]]*roots[sigma[1]] + roots[sigma[2]]*roots[sigma[3]])
        values.append(val)
        print(f"σ = {sigma}, value = {val:.10f}")

    # Find minimum
    min_val = min(values)
    print(f"\nMinimum value found: {min_val:.10f}")
