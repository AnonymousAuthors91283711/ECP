[write_program]
The problem appears to be about checking lists of rational pairs \((x, y)\) and verifying if there exists a pair in the list such that the average of fixed numbers 73, 82, 85, and the pair's components is less than 80. I'll write a Python program that generates candidate pairs \((x, y)\) with small integer numerators and denominators, adds them to the fixed values, computes the average, and prints those pairs where the condition holds.

We'll enumerate rational pairs with numerators and denominators between -10 and 10 (excluding zero denominators), then compute the average and check the inequality.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Fixed numbers
fixed = [73, 82, 85]

# Function to generate fractions from small integer ranges
def gen_fractions(min_num=-10, max_num=10):
    fractions = set()
    for num in range(min_num, max_num + 1):
        for den in range(1, max_num + 1):
            # Positive fraction
            frac = Fraction(num, den)
            fractions.add(frac)
            # Negative fraction if numerator is positive
            if num != 0:
                fractions.add(-frac)
    return fractions

def main():
    fractions = list(gen_fractions(-10, 10))
    print("Enumerating candidate pairs (x, y) with numerators and denominators -10..10 (excluding zero denom)")
    threshold = 80
    count = 0
    for x in fractions:
        for y in fractions:
            avg = (sum(fixed) + x + y) / 5
            if avg < threshold:
                # Print exact fractions and average as Fraction
                print(f"x = {x}, y = {y}, average = {avg}")
                count += 1
                if count > 50:  # Limit output length
                    print("... output truncated after 50 results ...")
                    return

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
