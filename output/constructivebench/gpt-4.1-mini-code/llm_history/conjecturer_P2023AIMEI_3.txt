theorem P2023AIMEI_3 :
  let n := 40
  let t3 := 3
  let t4 := 4
  let t5 := 5
  let t6 := 6
  let t2 := (choose n 2) - (3 * choose t3 2 + 4 * choose t4 2 + 5 * choose t5 2 + 6 * choose t6 2)
  t2 = P2023AIMEI_3_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: C(40, 2) = 780
3 * C(3, 2) = 3 * 3 = 9
4 * C(4, 2) = 4 * 6 = 24
5 * C(5, 2) = 5 * 10 = 50
6 * C(6, 2) = 6 * 15 = 90
t2 = C(40, 2) - sum = 780 - 173 = 607. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<choose 40 2 - (3 * choose 3 2 + 4 * choose 4 2 + 5 * choose 5 2 + 6 * choose 6 2)>>>
