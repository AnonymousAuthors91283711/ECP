[write_program]
We want to examine the expression:  
\[ 9901 \times 101 - 99 \times 10101 \]  
and find the exact value.

The program below computes and prints it immediately.

```python
# Enumerate the exact value of the expression 9901*101 - 99*10101
def main():
    a = 9901
    b = 101
    c = 99
    d = 10101
    
    part1 = a * b
    print(f"{a} * {b} = {part1}")
    
    part2 = c * d
    print(f"{c} * {d} = {part2}")
    
    result = part1 - part2
    print(f"{a} * {b} - {c} * {d} = {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
