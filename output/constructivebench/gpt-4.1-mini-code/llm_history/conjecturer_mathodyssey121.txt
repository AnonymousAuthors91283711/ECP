  IsLeast {n : ℕ | ∃ k : ℕ, 7 * n ≡ 0 [MOD 52] ∧ n ≡ 0 [MOD 2]} mathodyssey121_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Checking n from 1 to 200 for conditions:
n = 52 satisfies 7*n ≡ 0 (mod 52) and n ≡ 0 (mod 2)
n = 104 satisfies 7*n ≡ 0 (mod 52) and n ≡ 0 (mod 2)
n = 156 satisfies 7*n ≡ 0 (mod 52) and n ≡ 0 (mod 2)
Conjecture: minimal such n is 52. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<52>>>
