The problem is about finding the smallest natural number \( n \geq 5 \) such that there exists an injective function from \( \text{Fin}\ n \) to pairs of integers modulo 4, satisfying a closure condition under addition modulo 4. The function maps indices to pairs \((x,y)\) with \(1 \leq x,y \leq 4\). We want to find the minimal size of such a set with closure under pairwise addition modulo 4.

I'll write a Python program to enumerate possible sets of size \(n\) for \(n=5,6,7,8\) using pairs \((x,y)\) where \(x,y \in \{1,2,3,4\}\), and check whether the closure condition holds:

- For all \(i,j\), there must exist \(k\) with 
  \[
  (x_i + x_j - x_k) \equiv 0 \pmod{4}
  \]
  and
  \[
  (y_i + y_j - y_k) \equiv 0 \pmod{4}.
  \]

This means \( x_k \equiv x_i + x_j \pmod{4} \), \( y_k \equiv y_i + y_j \pmod{4} \).

We'll generate candidate sets of size \(n\) without repetition and check the property, printing any that satisfy it immediately.

Since the total number of pairs is 16 and \( \binom{16}{n} \) can be large, we test only up to \(n=8\) to keep the output short, and stop after some results or finding minimum \(n\).

```python
# Enumerate minimal n >=5 for which exists an injective mapping Fin n â†’ pairs (x,y) with x,y in [1..4]
# satisfying closure under addition modulo 4 in each coordinate.
# i.e. set P of pairs satisfies: for all a,b in P, (a+b) mod 4 is in P (mod 4 coordinates).
# We print sets found for n=5..8 and print minimal such n.

from itertools import combinations

MOD = 4

# All pairs (x,y) with 1 <= x,y <=4
all_pairs = [(x,y) for x in range(1,5) for y in range(1,5)]

def mod4_pair_sum(a,b):
    # Compute (a+b) mod 4, keeping result in {1,2,3,4}
    return ((a[0]+b[0]-1) % MOD + 1, (a[1]+b[1]-1) % MOD + 1)

def is_closed(pairs):
    s = set(pairs)
    for a in pairs:
        for b in pairs:
            c = mod4_pair_sum(a,b)
            if c not in s:
                return False
    return True

min_n = None

for n in range(5,9):
    print(f"Trying sets of size n={n}")
    found = 0
    # Enumerate combinations of pairs of size n
    for combo in combinations(all_pairs, n):
        if is_closed(combo):
            print("Found closed set:", combo)
            found += 1
            if min_n is None or n < min_n:
                min_n = n
            if found >= 5:
                # Print up to 5 examples to avoid flooding
                break
    if found > 0:
        print(f"Minimal n found so far: {n}")
        # We can stop at first found minimal n
        break
if min_n is not None:
    print("Minimal n with required property:", min_n)
else:
    print("No closed sets found for n in [5..8]")
```
