The problem involves finding the largest finite subset \( S \subseteq \mathbb{Z} \) such that for any two distinct elements \( p, q \in S \), there is a quadratic polynomial \( a x^2 + b x + c \) (with coefficients from \( S \), and \( a \neq 0 \)) that has both \( p \) and \( q \) as roots.

To explore this, the program below tries small finite subsets \( S \subseteq \mathbb{Z} \) of increasing size and checks if \( P(S) \) holds by verifying the polynomial condition for every pair \( (p, q) \in S \). We use small sets centered around 0 for manageability and enumerate possible triples \( (a,b,c) \in S^3 \) with \( a \neq 0 \).

This approach may yield maximal \( n \) values or patterns that help conjecture the true answer. We print every \( n \) for which such a set \( S \) is found.

```python
# Enumerate subsets of integers with property P:
# For every distinct p,q in S, exists quadratic polynomial with coefficients in S and a!=0, vanishing at p,q.
# We'll try small sets: subsets of [-m..m], m small, increasing.
# For each candidate set of size n, check condition P.
# Print tuples (n, S) as they satisfy P.

    return a*x*x + b*x + c

def has_poly_with_roots(p, q, S):
    # Find (a,b,c) in S^3, a!=0, s.t. eval_poly(p)=eval_poly(q)=0
    # Since p,q are roots: a p^2 + b p + c = 0 and a q^2 + b q + c = 0.
    # For fixed p,q and a in S\{0}, solve for b,c in S if possible (from linear system).
    # But b,c must be in S, so try all a,b,c in S^3 with a!=0 and test.
    # To reduce work: fix a,b,c in S, test condition.
    # This is small since sets small.
