The problem considers subsets \( s \subseteq \mathbb{N} \) with two properties:

1. Closed under addition within \( s \): for all \( x,y \in s \), \( x+y \in s \).
2. The complement of \( s \) is also "additively closed" in the sense that for all \( x,y \not\in s \), \( x+y \in s \).

We want to explore examples of such sets \( s \), focusing on small finite subsets for experimentation, and print those that satisfy the conditions. Our program enumerates subsets of \( \{0, \dots, N-1\} \) for small \( N \), checks the conditions, and prints witness sets.

```python
# Enumerate subsets s of {0,...,N-1} that satisfy:
# (∀ x,y in s, x+y in s) and (∀ x,y not in s, x+y in s).
# We test small N to find patterns.

N = 6
from itertools import combinations

def elements_from_bits(bits):
    return {i for i in range(N) if (bits & (1 << i))}

print(f"Checking sets within {{0,...,{N-1}}}:")
full_univ = set(range(N))

def closed_under_addition(subset):
    # Check if sum of any two elements in subset is again in subset
    for x in subset:
        for y in subset:
            s = x + y
            if s not in subset:
                return False
    return True

count = 0
for mask in range(1 << N):
    s = elements_from_bits(mask)
    s_comp = full_univ - s

    # Check (x,y in s => x+y in s)
    if not closed_under_addition(s):
        continue
    # Check (x,y not in s => x+y in s)
    # Actually the condition requires sum of two outside s to be inside s
    valid = True
    for x in s_comp:
        for y in s_comp:
            if x + y not in s:
                valid = False
                break
        if not valid:
            break
    if not valid:
        continue

    count += 1
    print(f"Candidate #{count}: {sorted(s)}")

print(f"Found {count} candidate sets for N={N}.")
```
This program streams each candidate set \( s \subseteq \{0,\ldots,5\} \) satisfying the two additive closure conditions. It prints them to help conjecture the characterization of such sets.
