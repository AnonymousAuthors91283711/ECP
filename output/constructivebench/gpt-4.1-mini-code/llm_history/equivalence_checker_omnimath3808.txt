Ground Truth Answer: fun n k => k
Proposed Answer: fun n k => n * k / 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the minimum number of mutual friendships (where both A is friends with B and B is friends with A) in a group of n people where each person has exactly k friends.

2. The ground truth answer is k, which suggests that the minimum number of mutual friendships is exactly equal to the number of friends each person has.

3. The proposed answer is n*k/2, which would be the total number of friendships divided by 2 (since each mutual friendship is counted twice).

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
- It gives a much larger number (2000*1000/2 = 1,000,000) compared to the ground truth (1000)
- The minimum case occurs when the friendship graph is a "windmill" configuration where all mutual friendships share a common person
- The proposed answer represents the average case, not the minimum case
