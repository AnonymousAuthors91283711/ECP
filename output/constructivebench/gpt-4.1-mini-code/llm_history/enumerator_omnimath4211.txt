The problem involves sequences defined by sums of powers and gcd computations. Let's enumerate the values of S(n) = sum_{p=1}^n (p^5 + p^7) for small n and print gcd(S(n), S(3n)) to gather data and conjecture omnimath4211_answer(n).

We will print gcd values for n from 1 to 20 as sample values.

```python
# Enumerate gcd(S(n), S(3n)) where S(n) = sum_{p=1}^n (p^5 + p^7)
# We compute exact sums using integer arithmetic and print results streaming.

def S(n):
    # Compute sum of p^5 + p^7 for p=1..n
    # Use direct summation since n is small
    return sum(p**5 + p**7 for p in range(1, n+1))

def gcd(a, b):
    # Euclidean algorithm
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

print("n, gcd(S(n), S(3n))")
for n in range(1, 21):
    Sn = S(n)
    S3n = S(3*n)
    g = gcd(Sn, S3n)
    print(f"{n}, {g}")
```
