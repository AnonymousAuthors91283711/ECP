The problem is about finding the average miles per gallon (mpg) for a trip where half the distance is driven by a car and the other half by an SUV, given their individual mpg values and the distances.

I will write a Python program to compute the average mpg for various combinations of car and SUV mpg values, confirming the weighted harmonic mean formula for fuel efficiency. The program will print each average mpg calculated, showing the parameters used.

```python
# Enumerate average mpg for distances split evenly between car and SUV with given mpgs
def average_mpg(distance, car_mpg, suv_mpg):
    # total gallons = (distance / car_mpg) + (distance / suv_mpg)
    total_distance = 2 * distance
    total_gallons = distance / car_mpg + distance / suv_mpg
    avg = total_distance / total_gallons
    return avg

print("distance = 120 miles fixed; testing various car and SUV mpg values:")

distance = 120
for car_mpg in [20, 25, 30]:
    for suv_mpg in [15, 20, 25]:
        avg = average_mpg(distance, car_mpg, suv_mpg)
        print(f"car_mpg={car_mpg}, suv_mpg={suv_mpg}, average_mpg={avg:.6f}")
```
