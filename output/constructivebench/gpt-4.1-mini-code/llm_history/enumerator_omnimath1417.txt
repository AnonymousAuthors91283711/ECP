The problem seeks complex numbers \( k \) for which there exist nonzero complex numbers \( a,b,c,d \) satisfying both
\[
a k^3 + b k^2 + c k + d = 0
\]
and
\[
b k^3 + c k^2 + d k + a = 0.
\]
We enumerate possibilities for \(k\) as roots of these polynomials for small integer choices of \(a,b,c,d\) normalized to avoid zeroes, and print candidates \(k\) satisfying both equalities approximately, to gain insight.

```python
from itertools import product
import cmath

# Small nonzero integer coefficients to test
coeffs = [-2, -1, 1, 2]

def approx_equal(x, y, eps=1e-9):
    return abs(x - y) < eps

print("Enumerating candidates k with small integer a,b,c,d â‰ 0...")

for a, b, c, d in product(coeffs, repeat=4):
    if 0 in (a,b,c,d):
        continue
    # Define two polynomials:
    # P(k) = a k^3 + b k^2 + c k + d
    # Q(k) = b k^3 + c k^2 + d k + a
    # Find roots of P(k)
    # For speed, we process only real trial values by scanning unit circle approximately:
    # But better: solve cubic exactly: coeffs P = [a, b, c, d]
    p_roots = []
    # Coefficients in degree-descending order for numpy.roots
    import numpy as np
    p_coefs = [a, b, c, d]
    roots = np.roots(p_coefs)
    for k in roots:
        # Check Q(k) ~ 0
        val_q = b*k**3 + c*k**2 + d*k + a
        if approx_equal(val_q, 0):
            print(f"a={a},b={b},c={c},d={d} k={k}")
```
This enumerates candidate values \(k\) approximately satisfying the system for small integers \(a,b,c,d\), printing each match immediately. From these we conjecture about the set of all such \(k\).
