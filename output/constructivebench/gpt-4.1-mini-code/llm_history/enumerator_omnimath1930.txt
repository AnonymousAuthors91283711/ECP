The problem involves expressing the pointwise minimum of two linear functions as a specific form involving an absolute value. We want to find constants \(a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{R}\) such that for all \(x\),
\[
\min(20x + 19, 19x + 20) = (a x + b) - |c x + d|
\]
and then determine the value of \(a b + c d\).

To help conjecture the values of \(a, b, c, d\) and the resulting quantity \(a b + c d\), I will enumerate possible candidates by analyzing the problem:

- The minimum of two linear functions is a piecewise linear function, which can be represented as their average minus half the absolute difference.
- So likely,
  \[
  \min(f, g) = \frac{f + g}{2} - \frac{|f - g|}{2}
  \]

Applying this to \(f=20x + 19\) and \(g=19x + 20\), we have:
\[
a x + b = \frac{f + g}{2} = \frac{(20x + 19) + (19x + 20)}{2} = \frac{39x + 39}{2} = 19.5 x + 19.5
\]
and
\[
c x + d = \frac{f - g}{2} = \frac{(20x + 19) - (19x + 20)}{2} = \frac{x - 1}{2} = 0.5 x - 0.5
\]

So likely \(a=19.5\), \(b=19.5\), \(c=0.5\), \(d=-0.5\). Then,
\[
a b + c d = (19.5)(19.5) + (0.5)(-0.5) = 380.25 - 0.25 = 380
\]

I write a program to confirm this evaluation and to print intermediate computations.

```python
# Enumerate parameters to verify the form min(f,g) = (a x + b) - |c x + d| for f = 20x+19, g = 19x+20
# and compute a*b + c*d.

def main():
    # Given linear functions
    def f(x): return 20*x + 19
    def g(x): return 19*x + 20

    # Express min(f,g) as (a x + b) - |c x + d|
    # Based on known formula: min = mean - abs(diff)/2
    # mean = (f+g)/2, diff = (f-g)/2
    a = (20 + 19)/2  # 39/2 = 19.5
    b = (19 + 20)/2  # 39/2 = 19.5
    c = (20 - 19)/2  # 1/2 = 0.5
    d = (19 - 20)/2  # -1/2 = -0.5

    print(f"Computed parameters:")
    print(f"a = {a}, b = {b}, c = {c}, d = {d}")

    ab = a * b
    cd = c * d

    print(f"a * b = {ab}")
    print(f"c * d = {cd}")

    result = ab + cd

    print(f"a * b + c * d = {result}")

    # Additional check: Verify for sample x-values
    for x in [-2, -1, 0, 0.5, 1, 2]:
        lhs = min(f(x), g(x))
        rhs = (a * x + b) - abs(c * x + d)
        print(f"x={x}: min(f,g)={lhs}, (a x + b) - |c x + d|={rhs}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
