The problem appears to involve cubic polynomials with integer coefficients and at least one integer root. We consider polynomials of the form \( n^3 + b n^2 + c n + d \) with integers \(b,c,d\), having an integer root \(n\). We then evaluate the product of the polynomial at 2015 and 2016.

To understand the possible values of \((2015\text{th term}) \times (2016\text{th term})\), we will enumerate various integer roots \(r\), and corresponding coefficients \(b,c,d\), with constraints derived from the root condition, then compute the product \(P(2015) \times P(2016)\).

We'll vary the integer root \(r\) over a small range, choose arbitrary \(b,c\), deduce \(d\) from the root condition \(r^3 + b r^2 + c r + d = 0\), then compute the product and print it.

This enumeration assists in conjecturing the possible values or form of the product.

```python
# Enumerate possible products of P(2015)*P(2016) for cubic polynomials P(n) = n^3 + b n^2 + c n + d
# having an integer root r, with integer coefficients b,c,d.
# For fixed r, b, c, deduce d from root condition.

def P(n,b,c,d):
    return n**3 + b*n**2 + c*n + d

def main():
    # We fix ranges:
    # integer root r in [-5,5]
    # b and c in [-3,3]
    # d derived from root condition: d = - (r^3 + b r^2 + c r)
    rs = range(-5,6)
    bs = range(-3,4)
    cs = range(-3,4)

    seen = set()
    print("Enumerating products for P(2015)*P(2016) with integer root in [-5,5], b,c in [-3,3]:")
    for r in rs:
        for b in bs:
            for c in cs:
                d = -(r**3 + b*r**2 + c*r)
                val1 = P(2015,b,c,d)
                val2 = P(2016,b,c,d)
                prod = val1 * val2
                if prod not in seen:
                    seen.add(prod)
                    print(f"r={r}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d} => P(2015)*P(2016) = {prod}")
