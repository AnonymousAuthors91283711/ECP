The problem involves a sequence (a_n) defined recursively as:

a_{n+1} = 1 + 1/(1 + a_n)

for n = 0,1,2, with a given value a_2 = 41/29, and we want to find a_0.

We will enumerate possible rational values matching the recurrence backward starting from a_2 = 41/29, to find the exact a_0.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Given a_2
a2 = Fraction(41,29)

# The recurrence forward: a_{n+1} = 1 + 1/(1 + a_n)
# We want to find a_0 given a_2 and that a_n's are rationals.
# Equivalently, reverse recurrence:
# a_n = (1 / (a_{n+1} - 1)) - 1, provided a_{n+1} != 1

def reverse_step(a_next):
    # Avoid division by zero. a_next - 1 != 0
    denom = a_next - 1
    if denom == 0:
        return None
    return Fraction(1, denom) - 1

a1 = reverse_step(a2)
if a1 is not None:
    a0 = reverse_step(a1)
    if a0 is not None:
        print(f"a0 = {a0} = {float(a0)}")
```
