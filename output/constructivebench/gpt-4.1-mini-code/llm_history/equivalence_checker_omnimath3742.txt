Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ c : ℕ, f = fun n => 2 * n - 1} ∪ {f | ∀ n, f n = 1}
<<<None>>>
Since the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's intentionally left undefined in Lean), we cannot verify whether the proposed answer is equivalent to it. The proposed answer suggests two possible forms for the function f (either linear functions of the form f(n) = 2n-1 or the constant function f(n) = 1), but without knowing the ground truth, we cannot confirm their equivalence.
