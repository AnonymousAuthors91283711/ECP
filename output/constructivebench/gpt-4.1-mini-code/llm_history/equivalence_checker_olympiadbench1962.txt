Ground Truth Answer: {(2, 2, 2), (2, 2, 3), (2, 3, 2), (3, 2, 2), 
   (2, 6, 11), (2, 11, 6), (6, 2, 11), (6, 11, 2), (11, 2, 6), (11, 6, 2),
   (3, 5, 7), (3, 7, 5), (5, 3, 7), (5, 7, 3), (7, 3, 5), (7, 5, 3)}
Proposed Answer: {(2,2,2), (2,2,3), (2,3,2), (3,2,2),
 (2,6,11), (2,11,6), (6,2,11), (6,11,2),
 (3,5,7), (3,7,5), (5,3,7), (5,7,3),
 (7,3,5), (7,5,3), (11,2,6), (11,6,2)}
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer contains exactly the same tuples as the ground truth answer, just in a different order. The order of elements in a set doesn't matter in mathematics, so the two answers are equivalent. All the required permutations of each solution tuple are present in both answers.
