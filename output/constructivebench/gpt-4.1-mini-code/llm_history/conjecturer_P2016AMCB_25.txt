theorem P2016AMCB_25 :
  IsLeast {k : ℕ | 0 < k ∧ ∃ (m : ℤ), ∏ i ∈ Finset.range k, amc_sequence (i + 1) = (m : ℝ)} P2016AMCB_25_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Integer product found for k=17, total exponent sum=4599
Integer product found for k=18, total exponent sum=9198
Integer product found for k=35, total exponent sum=1205604855
Integer product found for k=36, total exponent sum=2411209710
Smallest k with integer product: 17. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
