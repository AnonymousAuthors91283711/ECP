Ground Truth Answer: 73/4
Proposed Answer: 18.25
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer (73/4) and the proposed answer (18.25):

1. Calculate 73/4:
   73 ÷ 4 = 18.25

2. The proposed answer is exactly 18.25

Since 73/4 is mathematically equal to 18.25, these answers are equivalent. The proposed answer is just the decimal representation of the exact fraction.
