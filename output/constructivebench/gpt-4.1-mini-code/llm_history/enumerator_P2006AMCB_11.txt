The problem involves Joe and JoAnn mixing and drinking cream in certain quantities, with given rational amounts. We want to explore the ratio of their final cream amounts after the operations, examining how it behaves with given initial conditions, drinks, and additions.

The code below enumerates small sample values for the parameters (initial, drink, add amounts), computes the resulting cream ratios exactly as rationals, and prints them immediately for inspection. This can give insights or conjectures about the answer.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Enumerate small values for initial amounts, drinks, adds (avoid zero to prevent div by zero)
values = [Fraction(n) for n in range(1, 6)]

print("Enumerating cream ratio = joeFinalCream / joAnnFinalCream for samples:")

for joeInitial in values:
    for joeDrink in values:
        if joeDrink > joeInitial:
            continue  # can't drink more than have
        for joeAdd in values:
            for joAnnInitial in values:
                for joAnnAdd in values:
                    for joAnnDrink in values:
                        if joAnnDrink > joAnnInitial + joAnnAdd:
                            continue  # can't drink more than have
                        # Compute Joe's final cream: amount added after drinking joeDrink from joeInitial
                        # Joe drinks joeDrink from initial, then adds joeAdd cream
                        joeCreamAfterDrink = joeInitial - joeDrink
                        joeFinalCream = joeAdd

                        # Compute JoAnn's final cream:
                        # She adds joAnnAdd cream to initial, drinks joAnnDrink from total,
                        # final cream remaining is joAnnAdd * (joAnnInitial / (joAnnInitial + joAnnAdd))
                        denom = joAnnInitial + joAnnAdd
                        if denom == 0:
                            continue
                        joAnnFinalCream = joAnnAdd * (joAnnInitial / denom)

                        if joAnnFinalCream == 0:
                            continue
                        
                        ratio = joeFinalCream / joAnnFinalCream

                        print(f"joeInitial={joeInitial}, joeDrink={joeDrink}, joeAdd={joeAdd}, "
                              f"joAnnInitial={joAnnInitial}, joAnnAdd={joAnnAdd}, joAnnDrink={joAnnDrink} "
                              f"=> ratio = {ratio}")
