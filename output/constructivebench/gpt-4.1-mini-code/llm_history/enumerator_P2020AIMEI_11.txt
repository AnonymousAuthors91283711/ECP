The problem involves triples \((a,b,c)\) with \(|a|,|b|,|c|\leq 10\), and the existence of an integer \(d\) such that if \(f(x) = x^2 + a x + b\) and \(g(x) = x^2 + c x + d\), then \(g(f(2))=0\) and \(g(f(4))=0\).

We want to enumerate all such triples and print them immediately. We'll search over \(a,b,c\) in \([-10,10]\), compute \(f(2)\) and \(f(4)\), then solve for \(d\) given that \(g\) has roots at \(f(2)\) and \(f(4)\). Since \(g(x) = x^2 + c x + d\) with roots \(r_1=f(2)\), \(r_2=f(4)\), we must have:

\(r_1 + r_2 = -c\) and \(r_1 r_2 = d\).

Therefore, \(d = r_1 r_2\).

We need \(d\) to be an integer. So we check if \(r_1 r_2\) is integer. If yes, print the triple \((a,b,c)\) and \(d\).

Finally, print the total count.

```python
# Enumerate triples (a,b,c) with |a|,|b|,|c| <= 10
# For each, check existence of integer d with given property
def main():
    count = 0
    for a in range(-10,11):
        for b in range(-10,11):
            # Precompute f(2) and f(4)
            f2 = 2**2 + a*2 + b
            f4 = 4**2 + a*4 + b
            for c in range(-10,11):
                # Given roots of g are f2, f4
                # sum of roots = -c => c = - (f2 + f4)
                # Check that given c matches current c
                if c != -(f2 + f4):
                    continue
                # d = product of roots
                d = f2 * f4
                # d must be integer, always true here
                # So condition holds
                print(f"(a,b,c,d) = ({a},{b},{c},{d})")
                count += 1
    print("Total solutions found:", count)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
