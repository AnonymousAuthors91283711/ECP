The problem is quite involved, dealing with triples (x,y,z) from a cycle graph of size 2006 with certain distance parity conditions and a directed edge set d. To get some insight, let's enumerate small cases for n (the cycle length) and subsets d and t that satisfy similar parity conditions.

We'll:
- Choose small n (e.g., 6, 8).
- Enumerate subsets d of edges with size n-3 (or smaller for speed).
- Enumerate triples t with constraints on edges and parity.
- Print candidate values of |t| to guess the maximum cardinality.

This enumerator will output candidate t.card values for various small n, which may help conjecture the final answer for n=2006.

```python
from itertools import combinations, product

def dist(n, a, b):
    diff = abs(b - a)
    return min(diff, n - diff)

def parity_conditions(n, x, y, z):
    s1 = min((y - x) % n, n - ((y - x) % n))
    s2 = min((z - y) % n, n - ((z - y) % n))
    s3 = min((x - z) % n, n - ((x - z) % n))
    conditions = ((s1 % 2 == 1 and s2 % 2 == 1) or
                  (s2 % 2 == 1 and s3 % 2 == 1) or
                  (s3 % 2 == 1 and s1 % 2 == 1))
    return conditions

def check_edges(n, d_set, triple):
    x, y, z = triple
    edges = {(x, y), (y, z), (z, x)}
    # Exactly one of these edges must be in d_set (from problem constraints: all edges from d or reversed edges absent)
    # But problem states for (x,y,z)∈t: (x,y)∈d or (y,z)∈d or (z,x)∈d
    return any(e in d_set for e in edges)

def is_valid_edge(n, d_set, edge):
    x, y = edge
    if x == y:
        return False
    if (y, x) in d_set:
        return False
    return True

def enumerate_for_n(n):
    points = list(range(n))
    max_k = 0
    # d size approx n-3, but for speed use smaller sets
    max_d_size = n - 3 if n >= 6 else n - 1
    all_possible_edges = [(x, y) for x in points for y in points if x != y and x < y]
    # We must direct edges; choose orientation for each edge: (x,y) or (y,x)
    # To limit complexity, pick a directed cycle removing 3 edges.
    # For simplicity, fix d as edges (0->1),(1->2),... excluding some edges to have size n-3
    d = set()
    for i in range(n):
        if i < n - 3:
            d.add((i, (i+1) % n))
    # Verify no reversed edges in d
    if any((y,x) in d for (x,y) in d):
        return # skip invalid d
    # Enumerate triples t satisfying all conditions
    t_candidates = []
    for triple in combinations(points, 3):
        xs = tuple(sorted(triple))
        # All permutations of triple to check edges and parity
        valid = False
        for perm in [(triple[0], triple[1], triple[2]),
                     (triple[0], triple[2], triple[1]),
                     (triple[1], triple[0], triple[2]),
                     (triple[1], triple[2], triple[0]),
                     (triple[2], triple[0], triple[1]),
                     (triple[2], triple[1], triple[0])]:
            if not parity_conditions(n, *perm):
                continue
            if check_edges(n, d, perm):
                valid = True
                break
        if valid:
            t_candidates.append(triple)
    k = len(t_candidates)
    print(f"n={n}, |d|={len(d)}, candidate k=|t|={k}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    for n in [6, 8, 10]:
        enumerate_for_n(n)
```

This program outputs candidate t sizes for small cycle sizes n to help conjecture the maximum size of t in the original problem setup.
