The problem involves finding all functions \( f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \) such that for all natural numbers \( m, n \),
\[
\gcd(f(m), n) + \operatorname{lcm}(m, f(n)) = \gcd(m, f(n)) + \operatorname{lcm}(f(m), n).
\]

We want to enumerate plausible candidates for \( f \) by testing small values and identifying patterns. The function is from naturals to naturals, so we test small functional values and check the identity for small inputs.

```python
from math import gcd
from math import lcm

# We'll test candidates of the form f(n) = a*n or f(n) = c for small integers
# and check the condition for small m,n.

def check_condition(f, limit=6):
    for m in range(1, limit):
        for n in range(1, limit):
            lhs = gcd(f(m), n) + lcm(m, f(n))
            rhs = gcd(m, f(n)) + lcm(f(m), n)
            if lhs != rhs:
                return False
    return True

# Try f(n) = n^k for k=1,2
def f_linear(n): return n
def f_square(n): return n*n
def f_constant_1(n): return 1
def f_constant_0(n): return 0

print("Testing candidates:")
candidates = [("f(n)=n", f_linear), ("f(n)=n^2", f_square), 
              ("f(n)=1", f_constant_1)]

for name, f in candidates:
    print(f"Checking {name}")
    if check_condition(f):
        print(f"Condition holds for {name}")

# Now try f(n)=n (identity), which should be checked carefully
# and f(n)=c*n for c in {0,1,2}
for c in range(3):
    def f(n, c=c): return c*n
    print(f"Checking f(n)={c}*n")
    if check_condition(f):
        print(f"Condition holds for f(n)={c}*n")

# Also try some simple piecewise or constant functions
def f_two(n): return 2
print("Checking f(n)=2")
if check_condition(f_two):
    print("Condition holds for f(n)=2")
```
This will enumerate several simple candidates and print which satisfy the equation for small inputs. From this experimentation, one can conjecture the form of \( f \).
