  omnimath2965_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n and example failing multisets (c0,c1,c2 counts):
n=1, fails on [(0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 0), (1, 0, 0)] ... total 3 failing multisets
n=2, fails on [(0, 0, 2), (0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 0)] ... total 6 failing multisets
n=3, fails on [(0, 1, 2), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2)] ... total 6 failing multisets
n=4, fails on [(0, 2, 2), (2, 0, 2), (2, 2, 0)] ... total 3 failing multisets
Condition always holds at n = 5. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The minimal n such that any multiset of 3 elements from Fin 3 with cardinality n contains either an element repeated at least 3 times or all three distinct elements, is 5.
