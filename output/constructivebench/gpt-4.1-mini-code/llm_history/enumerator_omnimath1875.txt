[write_program]
The problem appears to involve enumerating pairs of integers (c, p) with 0 ≤ c < 60 and 0 ≤ p < 60, subject to a condition involving concatenation of numbers and comparisons with 360. The goal is to count how many such pairs satisfy the condition and then compute the fraction of valid pairs out of all 3600 pairs.

To assist in conjecturing and proving the true answer, I will write a Python program to:
- Enumerate all pairs (c, p) with c and p in [0, 59].
- Check the given condition:
  - If p = 0, check if c < 360.
  - If p > 0, form the number obtained by concatenating c and p (like writing c followed by p) and check if it's less than 360.
- Print each valid pair when found.
- At the end, print the count and the fraction of valid pairs.

To form the concatenated number, I will convert p to a string and concatenate it to c converted to string, then convert back to int. This mirrors the "c * 10^(digits of p) + p" in the problem.

```python
# Enumerate pairs (c, p) with 0 ≤ c, p < 60
# Condition:
# if p == 0: c < 360
# else: int(str(c)+str(p)) < 360
# Print each valid pair immediately and at end print total and fraction.

def main():
    total_pairs = 60 * 60
    valid_count = 0
    for c in range(60):
        for p in range(60):
            if p == 0:
                if c < 360:
                    print(f"Valid pair: c={c}, p={p}")
                    valid_count += 1
            else:
                concat_num = int(f"{c}{p}")
                if concat_num < 360:
                    print(f"Valid pair: c={c}, p={p}")
                    valid_count += 1
    print("Total valid pairs:", valid_count)
    print("Fraction valid / total:", valid_count, "/", total_pairs, "=", valid_count / total_pairs)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
