The problem defines a function f(n) with some explicit cases for n=0,1,2,3 in terms of p=2/3 and q=1-p=1/3, all rational. It then requires finding f(3) exactly.

We will compute f(0), f(1), f(2), and f(3) using fractions in Python to get exact rational values. We print all results immediately.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

p = Fraction(2, 3)
q = 1 - p

def f(n):
    if n == 0:
        return Fraction(1)
    elif n == 1:
        return p
    elif n == 2:
        # p * (p + q * p) = p * (p + q p) = p * p*(1 + q) = p^2 * (1 + q)
        return p * (p + q * p)
    elif n == 3:
        # p * (p * (p + q * p) + q * p * (p + q * p))
        part = p + q * p
        return p * (p * part + q * p * part)
    else:
        return Fraction(0)

for n in range(4):
    val = f(n)
    print(f"f({n}) = {val} = {float(val)}")
```
This prints exact rationals and decimal approximations for n=0..3, aiding conjecture and proof.
