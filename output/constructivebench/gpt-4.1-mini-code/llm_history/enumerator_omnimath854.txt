The problem is asking for the count of integers \(n\) in the range \([1,2004]\) such that the 7-adic valuation of \(n!\) equals the 8-adic valuation of \(n!\). 
We can compute the \(p\)-adic valuation of \(n!\) using Legendre's formula: 
\[
v_p(n!) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^k} \right\rfloor
\]
We enumerate \(n\) from 1 to 2004, calculate both valuations, and print all values \(n\) for which the valuations are equal, and count them.

```python
def v_p_factorial(n, p):
    # Legendre's formula for p-adic valuation of n!
    count = 0
    power = p
    while power <= n:
        count += n // power
        power *= p
    return count

def main():
    p1, p2 = 7, 8
    count = 0
    print(f"Enumerating n from 1 to 2004 where v_{p1}(n!) = v_{p2}(n!)")
    for n in range(1, 2005):
        v7 = v_p_factorial(n, 7)
        v8 = v_p_factorial(n, 8)
        if v7 == v8:
            print(f"n={n}: v_7(n!)={v7}, v_8(n!)={v8}")
            count += 1
    print(f"Total count: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
