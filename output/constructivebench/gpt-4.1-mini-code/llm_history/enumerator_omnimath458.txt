The problem concerns finding digits A, B, C less than 10 such that:
- P = 100*A + 10*B + C is prime,
- 491 is prime,
- N = 100100*A + 10010*B + 1001*C equals 491 * P * 2.

We want to enumerate possible triples (A,B,C) fitting these conditions and print the found values.

```python
# Enumerate triples (A,B,C) to find those that satisfy:
# N = 100100*A + 10010*B + 1001*C = 2 * 491 * (100*A + 10*B + C)
# with 0 <= A,B,C < 10, and 100*A+10*B+C prime, 491 prime (always prime)

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    if n==2 or n==3:
        return True
    if n%2 == 0:
        return False
    r = int(n**0.5)
    for i in range(3, r+1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

prime_491 = 491  # known prime

for A in range(1,10):  # leading digit can't be zero for 3-digit prime
    for B in range(0,10):
        for C in range(0,10):
            P = 100*A + 10*B + C
            if is_prime(P):
                N = 100100*A + 10010*B + 1001*C
                if N == 2 * prime_491 * P:
                    print(f"A={A}, B={B}, C={C}, P={P}, N={N}")
```

The original program logically implements the given conditions and constraints correctly: it enumerates all digits A, B, C (with A from 1 to 9) and checks if the corresponding three-digit number P=100*A+10*B+C is prime, then checks the equation N = 2 * 491 * P where N is defined as 100100*A + 10010*B + 1001*C. The primality test seems correctly implemented and the loops cover all possible digits. The primality of 491 is given and fixed. If the program outputs nothing, that means no such triple satisfies the equation. The problem’s statement suggests such triple(s) exist by the theorem, so the empty output likely indicates a bug or numerical issue.

Reviewing the equation:
N = 100100*A + 10010*B + 1001*C
Right side = 2 * 491 * (100*A + 10*B + C)

Rewrite the equation as:
100100*A + 10010*B + 1001*C = 2 * 491 * (100*A + 10*B + C)

Note 2*491 = 982, so:
100100*A + 10010*B + 1001*C = 982 * (100*A + 10*B + C)

Check if the equation is consistent for digits A,B,C between 0 and 9 (A≥1).

Alternatively, let’s isolate:

Left - Right = 0

Calculate left - right:

100100*A - 982*100*A = (100100 - 98200)*A = 1900*A

10010*B - 982*10*B = (10010 - 9820)*B = 190*B

1001*C - 982*C = (1001 - 982)*C = 19*C

So the difference is:

1900*A + 190*B + 19*C = 0

But since A,B,C≥0, and A≥1 by definition, sum is positive, so no zero solution unless all zero, contradicting A≥1.

Hence the equation cannot hold for any positive digits.

Conclusion: No such triple exists!

Therefore, the program is correct and the empty output is the correct behavior.

Judgement: Accept original program.

The provided "program" is empty and doesn't attempt any solution or enumeration of the answers. The problem requires finding triple digits (A, B, C) less than 10 satisfying certain arithmetic and primality conditions. To comply with the requirements, the program must:

- Iterate over A, B, C in [0..9).
- Check primality of 100*A + 10*B + C.
- Check if the big number 100100*A + 10010*B + 1001*C equals 491 * (100*A + 10*B + C) * 2.
- Check that 491 is prime (this is a constant and true).
- Immediately print each satisfying triple.
- Since it's a small search space (10x10x10=1000), a simple brute force is efficient.

The empty program obviously does none of these, so it must be rejected. I will provide a corrected Python program implementing these steps. It prints all answers and the computed big number.
