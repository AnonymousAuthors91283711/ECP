. Enumerated answers: Enumerating (x - 3)^2 for x in range(-5, 5):
x = -5, (x - 3)^2 = 64
x = -4, (x - 3)^2 = 49
x = -3, (x - 3)^2 = 36
Answer for x = -3: (x - 3)^2 = 36
x = -2, (x - 3)^2 = 25
x = -1, (x - 3)^2 = 16
x = 0, (x - 3)^2 = 9
x = 1, (x - 3)^2 = 4
x = 2, (x - 3)^2 = 1
x = 3, (x - 3)^2 = 0
x = 4, (x - 3)^2 = 1. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<36>>>
