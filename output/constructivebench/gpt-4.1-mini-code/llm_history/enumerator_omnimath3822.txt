The problem describes a special "knight's move" on a 5x5 grid with unusual move lengths (1 and 3 steps instead of 1 and 2). We want to find the longest sequence of distinct positions where consecutive positions are related by these knight moves.

The program enumerates all paths on a 5x5 grid following the given knight move rules, printing sequences by length to conjecture the maximal sequence length.

```python
# Enumerate longest sequences of distinct positions on a 5x5 grid 
# where consecutive moves follow given knight-move rules:
# Moves are (±1, ±3) or (±3, ±1) in coordinates.

def knight_moves(x, y):
    candidates = [(x+1,y+3),(x+1,y-3),(x-1,y+3),(x-1,y-3),
                  (x+3,y+1),(x+3,y-1),(x-3,y+1),(x-3,y-1)]
    return [(nx, ny) for (nx, ny) in candidates if 0 <= nx < 5 and 0 <= ny < 5]

max_length = 0
best_paths = []

def dfs(path, visited):
    global max_length, best_paths
    last = path[-1]
    extended = False
    for nxt in knight_moves(*last):
        if nxt not in visited:
            dfs(path+[nxt], visited|{nxt})
            extended = True
    if not extended:
        length = len(path)
        if length > max_length:
            max_length = length
            best_paths = [path]
            print(f"New max length {max_length}: {path}")
        elif length == max_length:
            best_paths.append(path)
            print(f"Max length {max_length} also: {path}")

for start_x in range(5):
    for start_y in range(5):
        # Start DFS from each cell
        dfs([(start_x,start_y)], {(start_x,start_y)})

print(f"Max path length found: {max_length}")
```
This script will print longer sequences whenever they are found, allowing conjecture of the maximal length and representative paths.
