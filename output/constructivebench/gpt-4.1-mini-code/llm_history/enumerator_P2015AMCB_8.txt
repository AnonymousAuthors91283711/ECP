The problem asks to evaluate \((625^{\log_5 2015})^{\frac{1}{4}}\).

Rewrite step: \(625 = 5^4\), so:

\[
(625^{\log_5 2015})^{\frac{1}{4}} = (5^{4 \log_5 2015})^{\frac{1}{4}} = 5^{(\log_5 2015) \cdot 4 \cdot \frac{1}{4}} = 5^{\log_5 2015} = 2015.
\]

We'll write a Python program that demonstrates this computation for similar bases and exponents to support the conjecture and confirm the evaluation.

```python
# Enumerate values of the expression (b^{log_base x})^{1/n} for sample bases and x,
# showing that (b = base^n) simplifies nicely

import math

def logb(base, x):
    return math.log(x) / math.log(base)

samples = [
    (5, 4, 2015),   # base=5, n=4, x=2015 corresponds to the problem
    (2, 3, 8),
    (3, 2, 81),
    (10, 2, 1000),
]

print("Evaluations of (base^n)^{log_base x}^(1/n):")
for base, n, x in samples:
    b = base ** n
    val = (b ** logb(base, x)) ** (1 / n)
    # val should equal x if the simplification holds
    print(f"base={base}, n={n}, x={x}: value = {val} (exact x = {x})")
```
