[write_program]
The problem appears to involve rational numbers and inequalities, specifically finding rational candidates less than 1/20. I'll write a Python enumerator to print rational numbers less than 1/20 with small denominators, helping to conjecture the smallest such rational or to verify any pattern. The program enumerates rationals p/q with q up to 20 and p/q < 1/20, printing all such fractions in ascending order.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def main():
    limit = Fraction(1, 20)
    max_den = 20
    candidates = []
    print(f"Enumerating rationals p/q < {limit} with denominators up to {max_den}:")
    for q in range(1, max_den + 1):
        # For each denominator q, find all p < q*(1/20)
        max_p = (limit * q).numerator // (limit * q).denominator - 1
        # safer to just iterate p until p/q < limit
        for p in range(-max_den, max_den + 1):
            frac = Fraction(p, q)
            if frac < limit:
                candidates.append(frac)
                print(frac)

    # Deduplicate and sort
    candidates = sorted(set(candidates))
    print("\nAll candidates found:")
    for c in candidates:
        print(c)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
