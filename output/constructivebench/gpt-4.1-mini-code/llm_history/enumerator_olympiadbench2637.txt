The problem involves summing the reciprocals of all positive divisors of 24. We'll enumerate divisors of 24, compute reciprocals exactly as rationals, and print the partial sums. Finally, we'll output the exact sum.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def divisors(n):
    # Enumerate all positive divisors of n
    divs = set()
    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5)+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divs.add(i)
            divs.add(n//i)
    return sorted(divs)

def main():
    n = 24
    divs = divisors(n)
    print(f"Divisors of {n}: {divs}")
    total = Fraction(0,1)
    for d in divs:
        recip = Fraction(1, d)
        print(f"1/{d} = {recip}")
        total += recip
    print(f"Sum of reciprocals of divisors of {n} = {total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
