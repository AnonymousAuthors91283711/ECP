Ground Truth Answer: fun x y => 2 * x + y + 2015
Proposed Answer: fun x y => 2015 + x + 2 * y
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive sequence a(n) with base cases a(1)=x and a(3)=y, and a recurrence relation for n>1: a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n+1) - 1.

2. We need to find the sum of the first 2018 terms of this sequence (from a(1) to a(2018)).

3. The ground truth answer is 2x + y + 2015, while the proposed answer is 2015 + x + 2y.

The key difference is in the coefficients of x and y. The ground truth has 2x + y, while the proposed answer has x + 2y. These are clearly different unless x=y, which isn't generally true.

To verify, let's compute a few terms:
- a(1) = x
- a(2) = a(1) + a(3) - 1 = x + y - 1
- a(4) = a(3) + a(5) - 1 ⇒ but we can also express a(2) in terms of higher terms
The pattern suggests the ground truth is correct, as the x term gets more weight in the sum.
