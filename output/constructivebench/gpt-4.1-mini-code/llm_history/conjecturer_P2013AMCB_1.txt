abbrev P2013AMCB_1_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2013AMCB_1 :
  ∃! (low : ℝ), 
    let high := low + 16
    (high + low) / 2 = 3 ∧ low = P2013AMCB_1_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating possible values of low and checking condition (low + low + 16)/2 = 3:
Found candidate low = -5, high = 11, midpoint = 3.0
From the candidates, low = -5 satisfies the condition uniquely.. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<-5>>>
