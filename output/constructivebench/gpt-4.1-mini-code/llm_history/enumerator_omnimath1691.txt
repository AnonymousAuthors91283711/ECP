The problem is to find the number of integers \( b \) such that there exists a polynomial \( f \) with integer coefficients satisfying \( f(2) = 2010 \) and \( f(b) = 8 \).

Key insight: If \( f \) is a polynomial with integer coefficients, then \( f(x) - f(2) \) is divisible by \( x - 2 \) in the ring \( \mathbb{Z}[x] \), and setting \( f(2)=2010 \), we get \( 2010 - 8 = 2002 = (2 - b)g(b) \) for some integer-coefficient polynomial \( g \). This means \( (2 - b) \) divides \( 2010 - 8 = 2002 \). So \( b \) corresponds to integers where \( 2 - b \) divides 2002.

Therefore, to find the number of such integers \( b \), enumerate all integer divisors \( d \) of 2002, and for each divisor, set \( b = 2 - d \).

We will enumerate divisors of 2002 and output corresponding \( b \) values. Then count the total.

```python
# Enumerate all integer divisors of 2002 and corresponding b = 2 - divisor
def divisors(n):
    divs = set()
    for i in range(1, int(abs(n)**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divs.add(i)
            divs.add(n // i)
    return divs

N = 2002
divs = divisors(N)
count = 0
print("Divisors of 2002 and possible b values:")
for d in sorted(divs):
    for sign in [1, -1]:
        div_signed = d * sign
        b = 2 - div_signed
        print(f"Divisor: {div_signed}, b = {b}")
        count += 1
print(f"Total number of such integers b: {count}")
```
This program finds all integer values \( b \) for which a polynomial \( f \in \mathbb{Z}[x] \) has \( f(2) = 2010 \) and \( f(b) = 8 \).
