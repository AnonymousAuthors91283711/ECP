The problem involves rational numbers a, b, c > 0 and a property P2015AMCA_5_answer a b c relating to inequalities of the form (a'/b' - c') ≥ (a/b - c) under certain constraints on a', b', c'.

To explore this, I'll write a program that:
- Samples small positive rational triples (a, b, c) with denominator ≤ 5 and numerator 1 to 5.
- For each triple, tests all (a', b', c') with a' ≥ a, b' ≤ b, c' ≤ c within the sample set.
- Checks if (a'/b' - c') ≥ (a/b - c) always holds.
- Prints the triple (a,b,c) and whether the property seems to hold.
- Prints the triples where the property seems to hold, for conjecture.

We use fractions for exact rationals and avoid floating approximations.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Generate fractions > 0 with numerator, denominator in [1..5]
vals = [Fraction(n, d) for d in range(1,6) for n in range(1,6)]

def check_property(a,b,c):
    base = a/b - c
    for a_ in vals:
        if a_ < a:
            continue
        for b_ in vals:
            if b_ > b or b_ == 0:
                continue
            for c_ in vals:
                if c_ > c:
                    continue
                val = a_/b_ - c_
                if val < base:
                    return False
    return True

print("a,b,c where property holds:")
count = 0
for a in vals:
    for b in vals:
        for c in vals:
            # All positive, so no zero checks needed
            if check_property(a,b,c):
                print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c} | (a/b - c)={a/b - c}")
                count += 1
                if count >= 30:  # Limit output size
                    break
        if count >= 30:
            break
    if count >= 30:
        break
```
This enumerates candidate triples and prints those that satisfy the universal inequality condition, enabling conjectures.
