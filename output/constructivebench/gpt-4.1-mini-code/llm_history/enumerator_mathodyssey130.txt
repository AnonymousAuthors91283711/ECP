# The problem involves finding the greatest natural number n for which there exists an injective function f from Fin n to 4-tuples of Fin 9, with an additional combinatorial condition involving injective mappings g from Fin 4 to Fin n.
# We will enumerate values of n from 1 up to a certain threshold (say 20 for efficiency and token limit), and for each n, we attempt to find such an function f satisfying the conditions.
# Since the problem is complex and relates to combinatorial configurations, this approach will print candidate n values along with a boolean "possible" flag (True if such f exists for that n).
# We prioritize to print candidates as soon as found and then output the greatest n found.

```python
from itertools import product, combinations
from collections import defaultdict

# Fin9 = {0,...,8}
Fin9 = list(range(9))

# We want to find the largest n for which there exists an injective f: Fin n → (Fin9 x Fin9 x Fin9 x Fin9)
# satisfying certain constraints related to the injectivity and a forbidden configuration.

# Due to complexity, we enumerate possible tuples for small n and check the condition:
# The condition roughly says: there is no injective g: Fin4 → Fin n such that
# for some fixed a,b,c in Fin9, each f(g(i)) has first three coordinates (a,b,c), and
# for distinct i,j in Fin4, the fourth coordinate of f(g(i)) are distinct.
# In other words, no 4 distinct elements in domain mapped by f to tuples with same first 3 components but distinct 4th component.

# So: For candidate f (injective), the image tuples in Fin9^4,
# there must NOT exist any "fiber" over (a,b,c) with at least 4 distinct distinct last coords.

# We will try to construct such an f for increasing n.
# We'll try a simplification: pick f that covers tuples with unique first three coordinates combined with distinct enough last coords.
