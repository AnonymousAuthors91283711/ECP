theorem omnimath4271 : 
  (0 < omnimath4271_answer.1 ∧ 0 < omnimath4271_answer.2 ∧ 
   (1 / omnimath4271_answer.2^2 : Rat) - (3 / (2 * omnimath4271_answer.2^3)) = (1 / omnimath4271_answer.1^2)) ∧
  ∀ (m n : ℕ), 0 < m → 0 < n → (1 / n^2 : Rat) - (3 / (2 * n^3)) = (1 / m^2) → (m, n) = omnimath4271_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found solution: m=4, n=2, (1/n^2 - 3/(2 n^3)) = 1/m^2 = 1/16. Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ
