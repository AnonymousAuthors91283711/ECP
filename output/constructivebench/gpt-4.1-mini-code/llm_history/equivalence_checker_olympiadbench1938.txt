Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {f : ℤ → ℤ | ∃ c : ℤ, ∀ x : ℤ, f x = x + c ∧ c = -1 ∨ c = 1}
<<<None>>>
Since the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's intentionally left unspecified in the problem statement), we cannot determine whether the proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth. The proposed answer suggests solutions of the form f(x) = x + c where c is either -1 or 1, but without knowing the actual ground truth, we cannot verify its correctness.
