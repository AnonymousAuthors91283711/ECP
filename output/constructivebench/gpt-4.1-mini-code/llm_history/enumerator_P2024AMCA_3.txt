The problem is to find the smallest number \( k \) of two-digit numbers \( n \) summing to 2024.

This means: find the minimal size \( k \) of a multiset \( s \) of numbers with \( 10 \le n < 100 \), such that sum of \( s \) is 2024.

We will enumerate possible multisets using a greedy approach (testing sums with different numbers of addends) starting from a small number \( k \) (lower bound on the count) and going up until we find a valid sum.

Because the numbers are between 10 and 99, minimal sum with \( k \) addends is \( 10k \) and maximal sum with \( k \) addends is \( 99k \).

So \( k \) must satisfy \( 10k \le 2024 \le 99k \).

Let's enumerate for \( k \) in this range and check feasibility. We'll implement a simple method for each \( k \):

- The sum of all 99's is \( 99k \).
- If \( 99k < 2024 \), no solution for \( k \).
- Otherwise, consider \( k - 1 \) numbers of 99 and see if the last number fits between 10 and 99.

We'll print all \( k \) for which solution exists.

```python
# enumerator.py
def main():
    target = 2024
    min_digit = 10
    max_digit = 99

    # k must satisfy 10*k <= 2024 <= 99*k
    min_k = (target + max_digit - 1) // max_digit  # minimal k to have sum >= target
    max_k = target // min_digit                     # maximal k to have sum <= target

    print(f"Checking k in range [{min_k}, {max_k}] for sum={target}")

    found_candidates = []
    for k in range(min_k, max_k + 1):
        # Check feasibility:
        # sum_min = 10*k
        # sum_max = 99*k
        if 10 * k > target or 99 * k < target:
            # No possible sum for this k
            continue
        
        # Now test if there exists s with size k sum to target:
        # Try x numbers of 99, (k-x) numbers of 10 or between
        # Simplifying: check if (target - 10*k) <= (99-10)*k
        diff = target - 10 * k
        if diff <= (max_digit - min_digit) * k:
            # There exists a combination, print it.
            print(f"Possible k: {k}")

            # Construct one example combination to confirm:
            # Start with all 10's
            s = [min_digit] * k
            # Add 'diff' by incrementing elements by 1 until diff exhausted or 99 reached
            for i in range(k):
                increment = min(diff, max_digit - min_digit)
                s[i] += increment
                diff -= increment
                if diff == 0:
                    break
            print("Example multiset:", s)
            found_candidates.append(k)
    
    if found_candidates:
        answer = min(found_candidates)
        print(f"\nMinimum k with solution: {answer}")
    else:
        print("No solutions found")
