This problem involves finding values of \( p \) in \([0,1]\) such that the tail probabilities of two binomial distributions (with parameters \( (3, p) \) and \( (5, p) \)) at given thresholds are equal. We will enumerate sample \( p \) values in \([0,1]\), compute the sums exactly, and print values of \( p \) where the two sums are close (within a small tolerance), suggesting potential equality points.

```python
from math import comb

# Compare sums for given p
def binom_tail_sum(n, threshold, p):
    total = 0.0
    for k in range(n+1):
        if k > threshold:
            total += comb(n, k) * p**k * (1 - p)**(n - k)
    return total

print("Enumerating candidate p values in [0,1] where sums nearly equal")

# We choose a fine grid on [0, 1]
step = 0.01
threshold1 = 1.5  # k > 3/2 means k >= 2
threshold2 = 2.5  # k > 5/2 means k >= 3

prev_diff = None
candidate_ps = []

for i in range(101):
    p = i * step
    sum_left = binom_tail_sum(3, threshold1, p)
    sum_right = binom_tail_sum(5, threshold2, p)
    diff = sum_left - sum_right
    # Print sums for inspection
    print(f"p={p:.2f}, sum_left={sum_left:.5f}, sum_right={sum_right:.5f}, diff={diff:.5f}")
    # Check for approximate equality (difference near zero)
    if abs(diff) < 0.001:
        print(f"Candidate p with sums nearly equal: {p:.4f}")
        candidate_ps.append(p)

# If candidates found, print minimum and maximum candidate
if candidate_ps:
    print("Candidates found at p =", candidate_ps)
    print(f"Minimum candidate p: {min(candidate_ps):.4f}")
    print(f"Maximum candidate p: {max(candidate_ps):.4f}")
else:
    print("No candidates found with sums nearly equal within tolerance.")
```
