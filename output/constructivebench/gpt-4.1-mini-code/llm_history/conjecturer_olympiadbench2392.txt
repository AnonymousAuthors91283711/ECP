theorem olympiadbench2392 :
  {x : ℝ | 2 + Real.sqrt (x - 2) = x - 2} = olympiadbench2392_answer :=
sorry
. Enumerated answers: Enumerating candidates for x where 2 + sqrt(x-2) = x - 2:
x = 6.0 approximately satisfies the equation.
x = 6 exactly satisfies the equation.
Confirmed solution: x = 6
Quadratic roots: x = 3.0, x = 6.0
x = 6.0 exactly satisfies the equation.. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
<<<{6}>>>
