The problem is to find the unique pair of natural numbers \((p_1, p_2)\) with \(0 < p_1 \leq p_2\) such that their product is 24, their sum is 11, and the difference \(p_2 - p_1\) matches a certain value to be found. We enumerate all pairs \((p_1, p_2)\) satisfying these constraints and print each valid pair along with the difference.

```python
# Enumerate all pairs (p1, p2) of positive integers with p1 <= p2, product 24, sum 11
# Print each found pair and the difference p2 - p1

def main():
    target_product = 24
    target_sum = 11

    for p1 in range(1, target_sum):
        p2 = target_sum - p1
        if p1 <= p2 and p1 * p2 == target_product:
            diff = p2 - p1
            print(f"p1={p1}, p2={p2}, difference={diff}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
