The problem asks to find the number of complex numbers \( z \) on the unit circle (i.e., \( |z|=1 \)) satisfying the polynomial equation:
\[
1 + z^5 + z^{10} + z^{15} + z^{18} + z^{21} + z^{24} + z^{27} = 0.
\]
Since \( z \) lies on the unit circle, let \( z = e^{i\theta} \). The equation becomes
\[
1 + e^{5i\theta} + e^{10i\theta} + e^{15i\theta} + e^{18i\theta} + e^{21i\theta} + e^{24i\theta} + e^{27i\theta} = 0.
\]

We want to enumerate roots on the unit circle. By substituting \( z = e^{2\pi i \frac{k}{N}} \) for some adequately large \( N \) (like the least common multiple of the exponents or slightly larger), we can check for which \( k \) the sum is zero. We will try \( N=54 \) because 54 covers the exponents well (since 27 is max exponent and half circle steps are 54).

The code will test \( z = e^{2\pi i k / 54} \) for \( k=0,\ldots,53 \) and print the roots for which the polynomial value is (numerically) zero (with a tolerance).

```python
import math
import cmath

# Exponents given in the polynomial
exponents = [0,5,10,15,18,21,24,27]

def poly_at_root(k, N):
    angle = 2 * math.pi * k / N
    val = sum(cmath.exp(1j * angle * e) for e in exponents)
    return val

def main():
    N = 54  # Checking 54-th roots of unity
    tol = 1e-10
    roots = []
    print(f"Checking 54-th roots of unity for roots...")
    for k in range(N):
        val = poly_at_root(k, N)
        if abs(val) < tol:
            root = cmath.exp(2j * math.pi * k / N)
            roots.append(root)
            print(f"Root found at k = {k}, z = exp(2pi i * {k}/{N}), approx {root}")
    print(f"Total roots on unit circle found: {len(roots)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This program enumerates candidate roots on the unit circle and prints each root immediately once found, then prints the total count. Use this to conjecture the exact number of solutions.
