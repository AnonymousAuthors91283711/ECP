[write_program]
The problem involves a set of 5 players and a combinatorial expression to evaluate or verify. We want to investigate the value of \(3 \times \binom{5}{2}\). Let's write a program to compute values for small sets and verify the relation, printing exact values immediately.

```python
from math import comb

# Given players count = 5
players_card = 5

# Compute 3 * choose(players_card, 2)
value = 3 * comb(players_card, 2)

print(f"players.card = {players_card}")
print(f"3 * choose({players_card}, 2) = {value}")
```
