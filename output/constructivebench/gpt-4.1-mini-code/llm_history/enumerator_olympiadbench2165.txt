The problem investigates triples of natural numbers \((x,y,z)\) with \(x \leq y \leq z\) satisfying the equation
\[
x^3 (y^3 + z^3) = 2012(xyz + 2).
\]
We want to enumerate solutions \((x,y,z)\) in a reasonable search range to conjecture the set of all solutions.

The number 2012 factors as \(2012 = 4 \times 503\), which can be useful for checking divisibility or bounding variables.

Let's brute force over \(x,y,z\) with \(1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq N\) for some small \(N\), say 50, printing each \((x,y,z)\) that satisfy the equation exactly.

```python
# Enumerate solutions (x,y,z) in natural numbers with x <= y <= z
# satisfying x^3*(y^3+z^3) = 2012 * (x*y*z + 2).
# We'll test x,y,z up to 50 to find all small solutions.

def main():
    limit = 50
    print("Enumerating solutions (x,y,z) with 1 <= x <= y <= z <= 50")
    for x in range(1, limit + 1):
        x3 = x**3
        for y in range(x, limit + 1):
            y3 = y**3
            for z in range(y, limit + 1):
                z3 = z**3
                lhs = x3 * (y3 + z3)
                rhs = 2012 * (x*y*z + 2)
                if lhs == rhs:
                    print(f"Solution found: (x,y,z)=({x},{y},{z})")
                    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
