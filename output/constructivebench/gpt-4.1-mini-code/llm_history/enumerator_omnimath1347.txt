The problem is to find the exact value of the sum \(\sum_{i=0}^{13} \frac{2i+3}{i^2 (i+1)^2}\) in rational numbers. The program below enumerates partial sums symbolically as fractions, printing each partial sum while accumulating the numerator and denominator using Python's fractions module for exact rational arithmetic.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# We enumerate terms and partial sums exactly as Fractions.
total_sum = Fraction(0)
print("Partial sums of sum_{i=0}^{13} (2i+3)/(i^2 (i+1)^2), skipping i=0 due to zero denominator:")
for i in range(1, 14):
    numerator = 2*i + 3
    denominator = i**2 * (i + 1)**2
    term = Fraction(numerator, denominator)
    total_sum += term
    print(f"i={i}, term={term}, partial_sum={total_sum}")

print("\nFinal exact sum =", total_sum)
```
