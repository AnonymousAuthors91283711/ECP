Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {k | k = -1/2}
<<<None>>>
Since the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's not provided), we cannot verify whether the proposed answer {k | k = -1/2} is equivalent to it. The problem involves trigonometric identities and solving for k when f k c = 0, but without knowing the correct answer, we cannot determine equivalence.
