The problem is counting functions \( f: \{1,\ldots,101\} \to \{1,\ldots,101\} \) such that applying \(f\) 101 times to 1 yields 2. We want to find the cardinality of such functions mod 103.

To explore this, I'll:
- Enumerate all functions \(f: \{1,2\} \to \{1,2\}\) as a simple warm-up for \(n=2\) and apply \(f^{[2]}(1)=2\).
- Then extend to \(n=3\), enumerating \(f:\{1,2,3\} \to \{1,2,3\}\) and test for \(f^{[3]}(1) = 2\).
- Check patterns in enumerated results to conjecture on the general behavior.

The program prints each candidate function \(f\) as a tuple of images of 1 through n, when the condition holds.

```python
from itertools import product

def iterate_func(f, x, times):
    for _ in range(times):
        x = f[x-1]
    return x

def enumerate_functions(n, times, target):
    print(f"Parameters: n={n}, times={times}, target={target}")
    domain = range(1, n+1)
    count = 0
    # Enumerate all functions f: [1..n] -> [1..n]
    for fvals in product(domain, repeat=n):
        if iterate_func(fvals, 1, times) == target:
            count += 1
            print(f"Function: {fvals}")
    print(f"Total count for n={n}: {count}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Small sample 1: n=2, iterate 2 times, target=2
    enumerate_functions(2, 2, 2)
    # Small sample 2: n=3, iterate 3 times, target=2
    enumerate_functions(3, 3, 2)
```

This enumeration is clearly limited to small n due to exponential growth but may help guess a formula or pattern to prove for n=101.
