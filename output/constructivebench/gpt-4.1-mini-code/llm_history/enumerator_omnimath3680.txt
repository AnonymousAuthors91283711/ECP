The problem is to find all quadruples of primes \(p, q, r\) and a positive integer \(k\) such that
\[
p q + q r + r p = 12 k + 1.
\]

We will enumerate primes \(p, q, r\) up to a small bound (say 30) and positive integers \(k\) up to a certain bound, checking if the equation holds. We print every solution found to conjecture the structure of the set.

```python
import sympy

def primes_up_to(n):
    return list(sympy.primerange(2, n+1))

def main():
    max_prime = 30
    max_k = 10
    primes = primes_up_to(max_prime)
    found = set()
    
    for p in primes:
        for q in primes:
            for r in primes:
                val = p*q + q*r + r*p
                # we want val = 12*k + 1 for some k>0, so:
                if val > 1 and (val - 1) % 12 == 0:
                    k = (val - 1)//12
                    if 0 < k <= max_k:
                        # print as soon as found
                        ans = (p, q, r, k)
                        if ans not in found:
                            found.add(ans)
                            print(f"(p, q, r, k) = {ans} satisfies p*q + q*r + r*p = 12*{k} + 1")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
