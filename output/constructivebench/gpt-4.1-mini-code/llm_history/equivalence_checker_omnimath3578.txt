Ground Truth Answer: {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ ∀ p : ℕ, p.Prime → p ∣ n → p % 4 = 1}
Proposed Answer: {n | ∃ a b c : ℕ, 0 < a ∧ 0 < b ∧ 0 < c ∧ Nat.gcd (Nat.gcd a b) c = 1 ∧ n = a + b + c ∧ n = Nat.gcd (a * b + c) (a * c - b)}

The proposed answer is mostly correct in terms of expressing the conditions given in the problem statement, but it differs from the ground truth answer in a significant way. The ground truth answer characterizes the set by a number-theoretic property (all prime divisors are congruent to 1 mod 4), while the proposed answer simply restates the problem conditions without this deeper characterization. They are not equivalent because:
1. The proposed answer doesn't guarantee that all such n must have prime divisors ≡ 1 mod 4
2. The ground truth answer might include numbers that satisfy the prime condition but aren't expressible in the a,b,c form given in the problem
However, the proposed answer does correctly capture the problem's conditions, just without the deeper number-theoretic characterization.
