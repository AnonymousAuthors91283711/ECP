This problem involves counting quadratic polynomials \( p(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \) with real coefficients such that:
- \(\deg p = 2\),
- The roots of \(p\) are exactly \(\{r, s\}\) for some \(r,s \in \mathbb{R}\),
- The set of coefficients \(\{a,b,c\}\) equals the set of roots \(\{r,s\}\).

Since degree is 2, \(a \neq 0\). The roots are related to coefficients by Vieta's formulas: \(r+s = -b/a\), \(rs = c/a\).

We want to find all triples \((a,b,c)\) with \(a \neq 0\), real \(r,s\), satisfying:
- \( \{a,b,c\} = \{r,s\} \) as sets,
- roots are exactly \(\{r,s\}\),
- \(r,s\) roots of \(p\).

Because the roots are exactly \(\{r,s\}\), and the polynomial has degree 2, roots are either distinct or equal (a double root).

We can enumerate possible assignments of \(\{a,b,c\}\) equal to \(\{r,s\}\), including multiplicities, and for each, check if roots match \(\{r,s\}\).

I will write a program enumerating possible real triples (r,s), trying to find corresponding (a,b,c) with \(\{a,b,c\} = \{r,s\}\), and the polynomial has roots exactly \(r,s\). Since continuous enumeration impossible, I choose small integers in \([-3,3]\), trying all sets and coefficient permutations.

The program prints all found sets satisfying the conditions, to conjecture the count.

```python
# Enumerate roots r,s and coefficients a,b,c in small integer range [-3..3] with a != 0
# Check if roots of p(x)=a x^2 + b x + c are exactly {r,s},
# and if {a,b,c} as a set equals {r,s} as a set
