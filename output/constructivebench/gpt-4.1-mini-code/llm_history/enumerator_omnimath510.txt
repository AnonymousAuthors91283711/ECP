The problem involves three sets (Alice, Bob, Charlie) with elements and a sum over the union of their pairwise intersections. For each x in that union, a value is computed depending on membership conditions in the sets, multiplied by fractions.

To help explore the problem, the Python enumerator will:
- Define the sets as given.
- Construct the union of pairwise intersections.
- For each element in this union, compute each term conditionally.
- Print the value for each element immediately.
- Sum these values and print the final result.

This should assist in understanding and conjecturing the final rational value.

```python
# Enumerate and compute the sum as in the math problem to assist with conjecture

def main():
    alice = {1, 2, 3, 4}
    bob = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    charlie = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

    # Compute the union of pairwise intersections
    AintB = alice.intersection(bob)
    AintC = alice.intersection(charlie)
    BintC = bob.intersection(charlie)
    union = AintB.union(AintC).union(BintC)

    total = 0
    print("Elements in (Alice ∩ Bob) ∪ (Alice ∩ Charlie) ∪ (Bob ∩ Charlie):", sorted(union))
    for x in sorted(union):
        term1 = 1 if (x in alice and x in bob and x not in charlie) else 0
        term2 = 1 if (x in alice and x not in bob and x in charlie) else 0
        term3 = 1 if (x not in alice and x in bob and x in charlie) else 0

        val = term1 * (1/4) * (1/5) * (5/6) + \
              term2 * (1/4) * (4/5) * (1/6) + \
              term3 * (3/4) * (1/5) * (1/6)

        print(f"x={x}: term1={term1}, term2={term2}, term3={term3}, value={val}")
        total += val

    print("Sum:", total)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
