We want to find the greatest natural number \( n \) such that \( 2^n \) divides the product

\[
\prod_{a=1}^{20} \prod_{b=a+1}^{20} (b - a).
\]

Note that \(b - a\) ranges over all differences between pairs of integers from 1 to 20, with \(b > a\). The product is essentially over all positive differences between pairs in 1 to 20.

We want to find the highest power of 2 dividing the product.

Approach:
- Enumerate all pairs \((a,b)\) with \(1 \le a < b \le 20\).
- Calculate \(d = b - a\).
- Count the total number of factors of 2 in all such \(d\)'s multiplied together.
- Print intermediate counts for each factorization.

We can do this straightforwardly in Python using a function to count factors of 2.

```python
# Count the exponent of 2 in n
def v2(n):
    count = 0
    while n % 2 == 0 and n > 0:
        n //= 2
        count += 1
    return count

def main():
    total_v2 = 0
    for a in range(1, 21):
        for b in range(a+1, 21):
            d = b - a
            # Count factors of 2 in d
            val = v2(d)
            total_v2 += val
            print(f"Pair ({a},{b}): difference = {d}, v2 = {val}, total so far = {total_v2}")
    print(f"Maximum n with 2^n | product = {total_v2}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This program enumerates all the factors of 2 in the product, printing details and the final answer.
