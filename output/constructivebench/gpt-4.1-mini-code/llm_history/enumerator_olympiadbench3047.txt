The problem defines \( x > 0 \) with \(\log_{\sqrt{2}} x = 20\) and asks for \(\log_2(\sqrt{x})\).

We know \(\log_{\sqrt{2}} x = 20\) means \( x = (\sqrt{2})^{20} \).

We want to find \(\log_2(\sqrt{x})\), and the program will evaluate and print this exact value for the given \(x\). Since the problem aims for a closed form, we also print the derived formula.

```python
import math

# Given condition: log_base_sqrt2(x) = 20
# Recalling that sqrt(2) = 2^(1/2)
# So, x = (sqrt(2))^20 = (2^(1/2))^20 = 2^(20/2) = 2^10 = 1024

# We want to find log_base_2 (sqrt(x)).

def main():
    # Calculate exact x from the log condition:
    x = (2 ** 0.5) ** 20  # equals 2^10 = 1024
    print(f"x = (sqrt(2))^20 = {x} (should equal 2^10 = 1024)")

    # sqrt(x) = x^(1/2)
    sqrt_x = x ** 0.5
    print(f"sqrt(x) = {sqrt_x}")

    # log base 2 of sqrt(x)
    log2_sqrt_x = math.log2(sqrt_x)
    print(f"log2(sqrt(x)) = {log2_sqrt_x}")

    # For the record, this should be 20/2 = 10 because:
    # log2(sqrt(x)) = log2(x^{1/2}) = 1/2 * log2(x)
    # log_sqrt2(x) = 20 => by change of base:
    # log2(x) / log2(sqrt2) = 20
    # log2(sqrt2) = 1/2, so log2(x) = 20 * (1/2) = 10
    # => log2(sqrt(x)) = 1/2 * 10 = 5

    # Let's print final analytic results:
    log2_x = 20 * 0.5
    log2_sqrt_x_analytic = 0.5 * log2_x
    print(f"Analytic computation:")
    print(f"log2(x) = 20 * 1/2 = {log2_x}")
    print(f"log2(sqrt(x)) = 1/2 * log2(x) = {log2_sqrt_x_analytic}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
