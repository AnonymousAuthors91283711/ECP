The problem asks for the number of real solutions \(c\) such that applying the function \(f(x) = x^2 - 2x\) four times yields 3, i.e. \(f^{(4)}(c) = 3\).

To assist in conjecturing this count, here's a Python program approximating and printing all real values \(c\) that satisfy \(f^{(4)}(c) = 3\) within a certain range, using a root-finding approach with subdivision to isolate roots. The program enumerates candidates assuming \(c\) in \([-5,5]\) with some granularity, printing each found root.

```python
import math

# Define f(x) = x^2 - 2x
def f(x):
    return x**2 - 2*x

# Compute f applied n times
def f_iter(x, n):
    for _ in range(n):
        x = f(x)
    return x

# Function whose roots we seek: f^{(4)}(c) - 3 = 0
def g(x):
    return f_iter(x,4) - 3

# Use bisection to find roots in [a,b] if g(a)*g(b)<0
def find_root(a,b,eps=1e-7):
    ga, gb = g(a), g(b)
    if ga == 0:
        return a
    if gb == 0:
        return b
    if ga*gb > 0:
        return None
    for _ in range(100):
        mid = (a+b)/2
        gm = g(mid)
        if abs(gm) < eps:
            return mid
        if ga*gm < 0:
            b, gb = mid, gm
        else:
            a, ga = mid, gm
    return (a+b)/2

# Scan interval and subdivide to detect sign changes
def enumerate_roots(xmin,xmax,steps=1000):
    roots = set()
    xs = [xmin + i*(xmax - xmin)/steps for i in range(steps+1)]
    for i in range(steps):
        a,b = xs[i], xs[i+1]
        ra, rb = g(a), g(b)
        if ra*rb <= 0:
            r = find_root(a,b)
            if r is not None:
                # Round to 7 decimals to avoid duplicates
                r_rounded = round(r,7)
                if r_rounded not in roots:
                    roots.add(r_rounded)
                    print("Found root c =", r_rounded)
    print("Total roots (approx):", len(roots))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Enumerating roots c with f^{(4)}(c) = 3 for c in [-5,5]:")
    enumerate_roots(-5,5)
```
