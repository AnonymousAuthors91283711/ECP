The problem appears to relate to a minimal number \( k \) of Boolean matrices (operations) needed such that for every Boolean grid of size \( 2n \times 2n \) with exactly \( k \) ones, there exists a list of operations covering all ones at least once.

To assist with conjecturing \( \text{omnimath105_answer}(n) \), we will enumerate possible \( k \) values for small \( n \) and try to find minimal covering lists of operations for grids with exactly \( k \) ones.

Since the problem is quite abstract and involves sets of Boolean matrices, we'll consider:

- Small \( n \) (like \( n=1 \), so \( 2n=2 \))
- Enumerate grids with a fixed number of ones \( k' \).
- Attempt to cover all ones with a minimal collection of operations (also Boolean matrices).
- Print candidate \( k \) values and minimal covering sizes found.

This enumerator will:
- Work with \( n=1 \) (size \( 2\times 2 \))
- Enumerate all grids with \( k' \) ones, \( k' \) from 1 to 4.
- For each \( k' \), find minimal number of operations (Boolean matrices) covering all ones, where each operation is a matrix of the same size with some ones.
- Output the \( k' \) and corresponding minimal number of operations found.

We treat "operations" as subsets of positions to cover all ones.

The code will print minimal covering sizes for each \( k' \) and related grids, helping to conjecture the minimal \( k \) with given \( n \).

```python
import itertools

def print_grid(grid, n):
    for i in range(2*n):
        print(''.join('1' if grid[i*(2*n)+j] else '0' for j in range(2*n)))
    print()

def all_grids_with_k_ones(size, k):
    # All grids of length size with exactly k ones
    return itertools.combinations(range(size), k)

def covers(op, grid):
    # operation (set of indices) must cover all ones in grid
    return all((pos in op) if grid[pos] else True for pos in range(len(grid)))

def minimal_cover_ops(grid, size):
    ones_pos = [i for i, val in enumerate(grid) if val]
    # operations are any non-empty subsets of positions
    # We want minimal # of operations (sets) so that union covers all ones_pos
    # Due to complexity, only try operation subsets up to size max_ops
    max_ops = len(ones_pos)
    # all non-empty subsets of size <= max_ops; in practice max_ops <=4 for 2x2
    # We'll try all combinations of operations from subsets of ones_pos
    subsets = []
    for r in range(1, len(ones_pos)+1):
        subsets.extend(itertools.combinations(ones_pos, r))
    # Try increasing number of operations from 1 to max_ops:
    for ops_count in range(1, max_ops+1):
        for ops_tuple in itertools.combinations(subsets, ops_count):
            # check if union of ops covers all ones_pos
            union = set()
            for op in ops_tuple:
                union.update(op)
            if set(ones_pos).issubset(union):
                return ops_count
    return max_ops  # fallback

def main():
    n = 1
    size = 4  # (2n)^2
    print(f"n = {n}, grid size = {2*n}x{2*n} = {size}")
    for k in range(1, size+1):
        min_cover = size+1
        grids = list(all_grids_with_k_ones(size, k))
        # To keep output short, sample up to 5 grids:
        sample_grids = grids if len(grids) <= 5 else grids[:5]
        print(f"k' = {k}, #grids = {len(grids)}, sample minimal covers:")
        for c, pos_set in enumerate(sample_grids, 1):
            grid = [0]*size
            for p in pos_set: grid[p] = 1
            cover_ops = minimal_cover_ops(grid, size)
            print(f" grid #{c}: minimal ops to cover = {cover_ops}")
            if cover_ops < min_cover:
                min_cover = cover_ops
        print(f" minimal number of ops needed for some grid with {k} ones <= {min_cover}\n")
