Ground Truth Answer: fun r => π * r * sqrt 2
Proposed Answer: fun r => 2 * r * sqrt π
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the limit of a sequence involving trigonometric functions and square roots as n approaches infinity.

2. The key part is analyzing the behavior of n * sqrt(1 - cos(2π/n)) as n → ∞.

3. Using Taylor series approximation for cosine near 0:
   cos(x) ≈ 1 - x²/2 + O(x⁴)
   So 1 - cos(2π/n) ≈ (2π/n)²/2 = 2π²/n²
   Therefore, sqrt(1 - cos(2π/n)) ≈ sqrt(2) * π/n

4. Thus the expression becomes:
   n * r * sqrt(1 - cos(2π/n)) ≈ n * r * sqrt(2) * π/n = r * π * sqrt(2)

5. The ground truth answer correctly captures this behavior: π * r * sqrt(2)

6. The proposed answer (2 * r * sqrt(π)) is completely different in form and value.
