abbrev omnimath3610_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath3610 (n : ℕ) (h : 1 < n) :
    n ∈ omnimath3610_answer ↔
    let divisors := Nat.divisors n
    let sorted_divisors := divisors.sort (·≤·)
    List.sum (sorted_divisors.map (fun k => (Nat.divisors k).card)) = n := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating n with sum of divisors-of-divisors counts = n
n = 3, sum = 3
n = 18, sum = 18
n = 36, sum = 36
Min n = 3
Max n = 36. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
<<<{ n : ℕ | ∃ k : ℕ, n = 3 * k^2 }>>>
