The problem involves evaluating the fractional part of \((10^{2002} + 1)^{10/7}\) and then finding the first three digits of that fractional part. Direct symbolic computation is challenging, so we emulate the structure for smaller powers and extract patterns. We'll test with smaller exponents and bases to see the behavior of fractional parts for \((a+1)^{10/7}\) and analyze their first three decimal digits.

```python
# Enumerate fractional parts of (a+1)^(10/7) for small a, print first 3 digits of fractional part * 10^3

from math import floor

def first_three_digits_fractional(base, numerator=10, denominator=7):
    # Compute (base)^(numerator/denominator)
    val = pow(base, numerator/denominator)
    fractional_part = val - floor(val)
    digits = floor(fractional_part * 1000)
    return digits

print("a | first three digits of fractional part * 10^3 for (a+1)^(10/7)")
for a in range(1, 20):
    digits = first_three_digits_fractional(a+1, 10, 7)
    print(f"{a:2d} | {digits:03d}")

# Trying to see if a pattern emerges for increasing powers or bases,
# since direct calculation for 10^2002 is impossible here.
```
