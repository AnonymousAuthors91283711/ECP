noncomputable abbrev omnimath2464_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath2464 :
  (∫ t in Icc 0 2, (if t ≤ 0.25 then 50 else if t ≤ 0.5 then 50 - 60*(t - 0.25) else 0) * (1/2)) = omnimath2464_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Integral over [0.0 , 0.25] = 6.25 (Exact Fraction: 25/4)
Integral over [0.25 , 0.5] (symbolic) = 85/16 (Approx ~ 5.312500)
Total integral over [0,0.5] = 185/16 (Approx ~ 11.562500)
Integral over [0,2] same as above since f=0 beyond 0.5.
Final answer (approximate float): 11.562500. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<185/16>>>
