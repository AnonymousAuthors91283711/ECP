The problem asks us to find the least value of \( t = \frac{\operatorname{Im}(z)}{\operatorname{Re}(z)} \) for complex numbers \( z = x + yi \) with \( x, y \geq 0 \), subject to the condition
\[
|z^2 + 2| \leq |z|.
\]
In other words, we want to minimize \( t = y/x \) with \( x, y \geq 0 \) satisfying the inequality. The challenge is to enumerate candidate values \( t \) by checking many pairs \( (x,y) \) and filtering those satisfying the inequality, then output the corresponding \( t \). Finally, identify the infimum or minimum \( t \).

To do this efficiently, we:
- Loop over positive \( x \) (say from 0.01 to 10 in increments).
- For each \( x \), loop over \( y \geq 0 \) from 0 to (some upper bound related to x).
- Check the inequality \( |z^2 + 2| \leq |z| \).
- If true, print \( t = y/x \).
- Track the minimum found \( t \).
- At the end print the minimal \( t \).

Print floating values with some precision; zero denominators \(x=0\) lead to division by zero, so exclude \( x=0 \).

def abs_complex(re, im):
    return math.sqrt(re*re + im*im)

def check_condition(x, y):
    # z = x + iy
    # z^2 + 2 = (x+iy)^2 + 2 = (x^2 - y^2 + 2) + i(2xy)
    re = x*x - y*y + 2
    im = 2*x*y
    lhs = abs_complex(re, im)
    rhs = abs_complex(x, y)
    return lhs <= rhs

for xi in range(1, int(max_xy/step_x)+1):
    x = xi * step_x
    # For each x, y ranges from 0 up to max_xy or less to speed up
    max_y = max_xy
    for yi in range(0, int(max_y/step_y)+1):
        y = yi * step_y

                min_t = t

else:
    print("No values found satisfying condition.")
