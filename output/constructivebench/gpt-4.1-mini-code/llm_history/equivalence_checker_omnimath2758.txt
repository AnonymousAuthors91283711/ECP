Ground Truth Answer: fun k => 3 * k
Proposed Answer: fun (k : ℝ) => 6
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem is about solving for k when the area equals 80, and the answer should be a function of k.

2. The ground truth answer `fun k => 3 * k` shows the solution is linearly dependent on k.

3. The proposed answer `fun (k : ℝ) => 6` is a constant function that doesn't depend on k at all.

4. These cannot be equivalent because:
   - For k=2: ground truth gives 6, proposed gives 6 (matches)
   - For k=3: ground truth gives 9, proposed gives 6 (doesn't match)
   - The functions only coincide at one specific point (k=2)

5. The proposed answer would only be correct if the problem specified k=2, but it doesn't.
