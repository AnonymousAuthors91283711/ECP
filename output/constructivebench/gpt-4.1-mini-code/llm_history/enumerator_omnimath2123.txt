The problem asks for the least real number \( y \) for which there exists a quadratic function \( f(x) = a x^2 + b x + c \) satisfying:
- \( f(1) = 16 \)
- \( f(x) \geq (x+3)^2 \) for all real \( x \)
- \( f(x) \geq x^2 + 9 \) for all real \( x \)
- \( f(0) = y \)

We need to find the minimal value of \( y = c \) for such a quadratic \( f \).

A Python program enumerates candidate quadratics with rational coefficients and checks constraints approximately on a small sample grid to conjecture the minimal \( y \). Since the set of quadratics satisfying the inequalities is infinite, we discretize and check key points, especially at the intersection of the two lower bounds, to get candidates. The program will print candidates as found and finally the minimum.

```python
import math

def check_feasibility(a, b, c):
    # Check f(1)=a+b+c=16
    if not math.isclose(a + b + c, 16, rel_tol=1e-9):
        return False
    # Check f(x) >= (x+3)^2 and f(x) >= x^2+9 for x in sample points
    for x in [-5, -3, 0, 1, 2, 3]:
        f = a*x*x + b*x + c
        g1 = (x+3)**2
        g2 = x*x + 9
        if f < g1 - 1e-9 or f < g2 - 1e-9:
            return False
    return True

def main():
    candidates = []
    # From f(1)=16 => c=16 - a - b
    # We enumerate a,b in small steps to find feasible f
    step = 0.5
    for a_times_2 in range(-20, 21):  # a in -10 to 10 step 0.5
        a = a_times_2 * 0.5
        for b_times_2 in range(-20, 21):
            b = b_times_2 * 0.5
            c = 16 - a - b
            if check_feasibility(a, b, c):
                print(f"Found quadratic: a={a}, b={b}, c={c} => f(0)={c}")
                candidates.append(c)
                if len(candidates) > 20:  # limit output
                    break
        if len(candidates) > 20:
            break
    if candidates:
        min_c = min(candidates)
        print(f"Minimal f(0) found: {min_c}")
    else:
        print("No feasible quadratic found in the sample grid.")
