The given equation states that for all real x,
(x + a)(x + 8) = x^2 + b x + 24.

Expanding the left side:
x^2 + (a + 8) x + 8 a = x^2 + b x + 24.

Matching coefficients:
a + 8 = b,
8 a = 24.

From 8 a = 24, we get a = 3.
Then b = a + 8 = 3 + 8 = 11.
So a + b = 3 + 11 = 14.

The program will enumerate possible a and b from integer guesses around the expected values and verify the identity, printing solutions found.

```python
# Enumerate integer a in range and compute b from b = a + 8 based on matching coefficients.
# Check if 8 a == 24 to confirm solution.

for a in range(-10, 11):
    b = a + 8
    if 8 * a == 24:
        print(f"a = {a}, b = {b}, a + b = {a + b}")
```
