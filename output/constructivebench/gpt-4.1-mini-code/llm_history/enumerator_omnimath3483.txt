The problem is to find the unique natural number \( x \) such that:

\[
2(x + 7) - 4 = 28
\]

We can enumerate values of \( x \) to find all \( x \in \mathbb{N} \) satisfying this equation and confirm uniqueness. The program will check \( x \) from 0 up to a small threshold (e.g., 20) to find candidates.

```python
# Enumerate natural numbers x and check if 2*(x+7) - 4 == 28
# Print every candidate immediately; the problem suggests uniqueness.

for x in range(21):
    lhs = 2 * (x + 7) - 4
    if lhs == 28:
        print(f"x = {x} satisfies 2*(x+7)-4=28")

# Also print the unique answer explicitly
for x in range(21):
    if 2 * (x + 7) - 4 == 28:
        print(f"Unique x = {x}")
        break
```
