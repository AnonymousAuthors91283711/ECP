abbrev P2005AMCB_2_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2005AMCB_2 (x : ℝ) (hx : 0 < x) : 
    x / 100 * x = 4 ↔ x = P2005AMCB_2_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating x for (x/100)*x = 4 with 0 < x <= 30
x = 20.00000, (x/100)*x = 4.0000000000
Exact solution: x = 20.0, (x/100)*x = 4.0. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<20>>>
