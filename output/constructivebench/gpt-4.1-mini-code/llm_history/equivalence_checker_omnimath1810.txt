Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {(-4, -4), (3, 3)}
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer lists two specific points (-4, -4) and (3, 3) that satisfy both equations, which is correct. However, the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's incomplete/placeholder in Lean), and the proposed answer doesn't cover all possible solutions (there might be more real solutions to the system of equations). The proposed answer is partially correct but incomplete.
