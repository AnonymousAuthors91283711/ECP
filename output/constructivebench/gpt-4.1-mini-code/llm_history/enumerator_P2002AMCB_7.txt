[write_program]
The problem is to find natural numbers \( k > 0 \) such that 
\[
k(k+1)(k+2) = 8(k + (k+1) + (k+2)),
\]
and then compute the sum of squares \( k^2 + (k+1)^2 + (k+2)^2 \).

We will write a Python program to enumerate positive \( k \) values, test the condition, print the found \( k \) and the sum of squares, and finally print the answer(s).

```python
# Enumerate k > 0 to satisfy k(k+1)(k+2) = 8(k + (k+1) + (k+2))
# Print the sum of squares k² + (k+1)² + (k+2)² for each such k.

def main():
    # We'll try k from 1 up to 20 as a safe bound (since cubic grows faster than linear)
    for k in range(1, 21):
        left = k * (k + 1) * (k + 2)
        right = 8 * (k + (k + 1) + (k + 2))
        if left == right:
            sum_squares = k**2 + (k + 1)**2 + (k + 2)**2
            print(f"k = {k}: sum of squares = {sum_squares}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
