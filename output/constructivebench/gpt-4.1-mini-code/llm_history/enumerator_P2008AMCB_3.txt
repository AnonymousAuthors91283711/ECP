The problem seems to be about distributing amounts (teams' scores or values) to 21 teams, each at least 15000, total sum at most 700000, and finding the greatest possible value s that occurs among these teams. Let's write a Python program to enumerate possible values s with these constraints.

We can try to enumerate possible values of s ≥15000, check if there exists a team assignment with one team having value s, all teams ≥15000, sum ≤700000.

For efficiency, we note the minimum total for all teams is 21*15000=315000, so the leftover budget is 700000-315000=385000.

If one team has s, then the other 20 teams sum to ≤700000 - s.

They each at least 15000, so the minimum sum for other teams is 20*15000=300000, so s ≤ 700000 - 300000=400000.

Thus s max is at most 400000 (upper bound).

The program tries s from 15000 up to 400000 and checks feasibility.

Feasibility: can other 20 teams have values ≥15000 and sum ≤ 700000 - s.

Minimum sum for others is 300000, max sum allowed is 700000 - s.

So the condition is 300000 ≤700000 - s → s ≤400000, which is already checked.

So for s ≤400000, it's feasible.

But we want to output all s that satisfy the conditions and print when found, then output the maximum s found.

But given the bounds, s can be any integer from 15000 to 400000.

But we need to check if there is an integer solution where the other teams' values also satisfy constraints.

Because the others must be ≥15000, sum ≤700000 - s.

Since the minimal sum of other teams is 300000, s ≤400000.

So all s between 15000 and 400000 inclusive are possible.

However, the problem might be more subtle if we want integer values assigned to the other teams, not just the sum constraints.

We can just check integer feasibility by trying to assign minimal 15000 to others.

If leftover after assigning 15000 to others is big enough to allow for others.

Yes, so s from 15000 to 400000 are all feasible.

Thus the maximum possible s is 400000.

We can print s from 15000 to 400000 in steps (to limit output), or just print all s.

Due to output limit, let's print s in increments and finally print the maximum.

```python
# Enumerate possible s values (team values) with given constraints:
# 21 teams, each team ≥15000, sum of all ≤700000
# Check for s = value of one team, for s in range, trying to find feasible distributions.

MIN_TEAM = 15000
NUM_TEAMS = 21
MAX_TOTAL = 700000

min_total = NUM_TEAMS * MIN_TEAM  # 315000
max_s = MAX_TOTAL - (NUM_TEAMS -1) * MIN_TEAM  # max s = 700000 -20*15000 = 400000

max_found = 0

for s in range(MIN_TEAM, max_s+1, 5000):  # step by 5000 to limit output
    others_sum_min = (NUM_TEAMS -1) * MIN_TEAM  # 300000
    # sum of others ≤ MAX_TOTAL - s
    if others_sum_min <= MAX_TOTAL - s:
        print(f"s = {s} feasible")
        if s > max_found:
            max_found = s

# print max found
print(f"Maximum s found: {max_found}")
```

This enumerator prints feasible s in steps of 5000 (to limit output size), then prints the maximum s found.
