The problem appears to involve finding the smallest integer \( k \) such that for functions \( A,B : \{0,\ldots,9\} \to \mathbb{N} \) summing to 2019 and satisfying \( k \leq A(i), B(i) \) for all \( i \), reachability between \( A \) and \( B \) by repeated application of some "operation" is symmetric (if \( A \to B \) then \( B \to A \)). Then it counts the number of certain maximal finite reachable sets. 

Without the exact operation given, a direct solution is impossible; instead, we can explore small \( k \) values and arrays summing to 2019 with bounds \( k \), and check reachability symmetricity (using placeholders for operation and reachability). We'll enumerate possible \( k \) and sample vectors \( A, B \) to see when symmetricity might fail or hold. The search space is huge, but we can at least print \( k \) values and some "candidate" reachable sets.

The program below demonstrates sample enumerations of \( k \), and constructs partial sample vectors \( A, B \) with the sum 2019 and minimum \( k \), outputting these parameters and partial checking results (symbolically, because we lack "operation" implementation). This can assist conjecture about minimal \( k \).

```python
# We do not know 'operation' or 'Reachable', so we'll simulate minimal checks.
# Enumerate k values and sample vectors A, B with sum=2019 and A[i]>=k.

def partitions(n, length, minimum):
    # Generate all integer lists of length 'length' with sum n and each element >= minimum.
    # To keep output shorter, yield just a few partitions.
    from itertools import combinations
    total = n - minimum * length
    # placements between slots for dividing total into length parts
    if total < 0:
        return
    def gen_compositions(n, k):
        # compositions of n into k parts (including zero)
        if k == 1:
            yield [n]
            return
        for i in range(n + 1):
            for tail in gen_compositions(n - i, k - 1):
                yield [i] + tail

    for comp in gen_compositions(total, length):
        yield [c + minimum for c in comp]

def reachable_symmetric(k):
    # Placeholder: return True if the reachability is symmetric for given k by sampling.
    # We'll just print k and a few sample A,B to hint.
    print(f"Trying k={k}")
    samples = 3
    length = 10
    count = 0
    for A in partitions(2019, length, k):
        if count >= samples:
            break
        count += 1
        print(f"Sample A={A}")
        # For simplicity, B = A reversed (also sum=2019, A[i]>=k)
        B = A[::-1]
        print(f"Sample B={B}")
        # Placeholders for Reachable check:
        print(f"Assuming Reachable(A,B) and Reachable(B,A) symmetry holds for these samples.")
    print()

def main():
    print("Enumerating candidate k values and samples with sum=2019, each >= k")
    # Trying small k values up to 10 just to limit output size
    for k in range(1, 11):
        reachable_symmetric(k)    
    print("Candidates enumerated up to k=10.")
    print("Minimal k is conjectured by observing when the symmetry holds for all samples.")
