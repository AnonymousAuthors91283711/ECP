The problem is to find the ratio \( \frac{V_1}{V_2} \) given the equation \(\frac{5}{6}V_1 = \frac{3}{4}V_2 \), with both \(V_1\) and \(V_2\) positive rationals.

We want to solve for \( \frac{V_1}{V_2} \) which can be rearranged from the given equation as:
\[
\frac{5}{6} V_1 = \frac{3}{4} V_2 \implies V_1 = \frac{\frac{3}{4}}{\frac{5}{6}} V_2 = \frac{3/4}{5/6} V_2 = \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{6}{5} V_2 = \frac{18}{20} V_2 = \frac{9}{10} V_2,
\]
so
\[
\frac{V_1}{V_2} = \frac{9}{10}.
\]

To assist with conjecturing this exact ratio, I will write a Python program that checks a few rationals \( V_1, V_2 \) and tests the equation, printing the resulting \( \frac{V_1}{V_2} \) fractions exactly when the equation holds.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Enumerate small positive fractions V1, V2 to check the equation (5/6)*V1 = (3/4)*V2
# and print the ratio V1/V2 when it holds.
max_denom = 10

print("Enumerating V1, V2 with denominators up to", max_denom)
for d1 in range(1, max_denom + 1):
    for n1 in range(1, 10 * d1):  # sampling numerator up to 10 times denominator
        V1 = Fraction(n1, d1)
        for d2 in range(1, max_denom + 1):
            for n2 in range(1, 10 * d2):
                V2 = Fraction(n2, d2)
                lhs = Fraction(5,6)*V1
                rhs = Fraction(3,4)*V2
                if lhs == rhs:
                    ratio = V1 / V2
                    print(f"V1={V1}, V2={V2} satisfy (5/6)*V1=(3/4)*V2; V1/V2 = {ratio}")
```

This enumerator will print all such \( V_1, V_2 \) up to denominator 10 where the equation holds exactly, along with the resulting ratio \( V_1/V_2 \). This helps confirm and conjecture the answer rational number \( \frac{9}{10} \).
