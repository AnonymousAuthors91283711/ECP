[write_program]
The problem asks if there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that the number of divisors \( d \) of \( n \) satisfying \( \sqrt{n} < d < 2\sqrt{n} \) is exactly 2020. We want to explore this divisor-counting problem by enumerating \( n \) and counting such divisors.

To handle this, the program will:
- For sample \( n \) values, list divisors.
- Count divisors \( d \) with \( \sqrt{n} < d < 2\sqrt{n} \).
- Print \( n \) and counts for divisor counts up to a threshold (e.g., 10).
- This exploration might help see patterns or conjecture if 2020 is achievable or too large.

This satisfies the prompt to stream answers with exact counts (not approximations). It keeps searching for small values, as large values will be infeasible.

```python
import math

def divisors(n):
    # Return sorted list of divisors of n
    divs = []
    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divs.append(i)
            if i != n // i:
                divs.append(n // i)
    divs.sort()
    return divs

max_count = 10  # Threshold for printing counts to avoid too long output
max_n = 200000  # Limit to test up to some maximum n for performance

print("n, count_close_divisors (where close_divisor = d|n and sqrt(n)<d<2*sqrt(n))")
for n in range(1, max_n+1):
    root = math.sqrt(n)
    divs = divisors(n)
    count = sum(1 for d in divs if root < d < 2*root)
    print(f"{n}: {count}")
    if count == max_count:
        print(f"Reached threshold count {max_count} at n = {n}")
        # Could stop or continue, here we just continue

# The output enumerates counts for n and might assist in conjecturing
```
