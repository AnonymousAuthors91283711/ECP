The problem asks for the number of integer 4-tuples \((a,b,c,d)\) with each coordinate between \(-5\) and \(5\) inclusive, satisfying the equation:

\[
(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2)^2 = (a + b + c + d)(a - b + c - d)((a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2).
\]

We will enumerate all such 4-tuples, print each solution immediately, and finally print the total count.

```python
# Enumerate all integer 4-tuples (a,b,c,d) with |a|,|b|,|c|,|d| â‰¤ 5
# Check the given equation exactly
# Output each solution as soon as found and count total solutions

def main():
    limit = 5
    count = 0
    for a in range(-limit, limit+1):
        a2 = a*a
        for b in range(-limit, limit+1):
            b2 = b*b
            for c in range(-limit, limit+1):
                c2 = c*c
                for d in range(-limit, limit+1):
                    d2 = d*d
                    lhs = (a2 + b2 + c2 + d2) ** 2
                    s1 = a + b + c + d
                    s2 = a - b + c - d
                    s3 = (a - c)**2 + (b - d)**2
                    rhs = s1 * s2 * s3
                    if lhs == rhs:
                        print(f"Solution found: (a,b,c,d)=({a},{b},{c},{d})")
                        count += 1
    print(f"Total solutions found: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
