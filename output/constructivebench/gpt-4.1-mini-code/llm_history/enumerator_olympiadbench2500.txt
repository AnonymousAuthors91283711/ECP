The problem asks to find the value \( k \) (and the corresponding expression value) such that for all real \( x \),
\[
\sin^6 x + \cos^6 x + k (\sin^4 x + \cos^4 x) = \text{constant}.
\]
We want to enumerate possible values of this expression for several \( k \) and many \( x \) values to guess the \( k \) that makes this expression constant (independent of \( x \)).

We will try a range of \( k \) values (including some fractions), for each \( k \) evaluate the expression for many \( x \) in [0, π/2]. We print the \( k \) and the min/max difference of the expression values across the sampled \( x \). When the difference is close to zero, it means the expression is constant for this \( k \). This paves the way to conjecturing the exact \( k \).

```python
import math

# Sample k values near 0 with good coverage including fractions
k_values = [i/4 for i in range(-8, 9)]  # k from -2 to 2 in steps of 0.25
x_samples = [j * math.pi / 50 for j in range(51)]  # 0 to π in 51 steps

def expr(x, k):
    s = math.sin(x)
    c = math.cos(x)
    return s**6 + c**6 + k * (s**4 + c**4)

print("k, min_value, max_value, max-min")
threshold = 1e-9
for k in k_values:
    values = [expr(x, k) for x in x_samples]
    minv, maxv = min(values), max(values)
    diff = maxv - minv
    print(f"{k:.2f}, {minv:.9f}, {maxv:.9f}, {diff:.9f}")
    # Check near-constancy and print possible candidates
    if diff < threshold:
        print(f"Constant expression likely for k = {k:.2f} with value ≈ {minv:.9f}")
```
This enumerates potential \( k \) values for which the expression might be constant, printing immediate approximation info. One can refine near candidates later.
