It's a simple linear equation problem: solve \(2k + 1 = 4k - 5\) for \(k\). We'll enumerate \(k\) rationally to avoid floating-point errors and print the exact answer as a fraction and decimal.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Solve 2k + 1 = 4k - 5 => 1 + 5 = 4k - 2k => 6 = 2k => k = 3 exactly
numerator = 6
denominator = 2
k_fraction = Fraction(numerator, denominator)
print(f"Exact solution k = {k_fraction} (fraction)")
print(f"Approximate solution k = {float(k_fraction)} (decimal)")
```
