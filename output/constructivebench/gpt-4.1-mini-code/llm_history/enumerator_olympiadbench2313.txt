The problem appears to be finding all integer pairs \((a,b)\) such that for every integer \(x\),
\[
(a x + b)^2 - (a x + b) + 2 = 9 x^2 - 3 x + 2.
\]
We want to find all integer \((a,b)\) satisfying this functional equation.

The strategy is to expand and compare coefficients:
\[
(a x + b)^2 - (a x + b) + 2 = a^2 x^2 + 2 a b x + b^2 - a x - b + 2.
\]
Equate this to
\[
9 x^2 - 3 x + 2,
\]
and match coefficients for powers of \(x\):

- Coefficient of \(x^2\): \(a^2 = 9\)
- Coefficient of \(x\): \(2 a b - a = -3\)
- Constant term: \(b^2 - b + 2 = 2\)

From the constant term: \(b^2 - b = 0\), so \(b(b-1) = 0\), thus \(b=0\) or \(b=1\).

From the quadratic term: \(a^2=9\), \(a=\pm 3\).

From the linear term \(2 a b - a = -3\):
- If \(a=3\), \(2 * 3 * b - 3 = -3 \implies 6b = 0 \implies b=0\).
- If \(a=-3\), \(2 * (-3) * b - (-3) = -3 \implies -6 b + 3 = -3 \implies -6b = -6 \implies b=1\).

The valid pairs are \((3,0)\) and \((-3,1)\).

We'll write a Python program enumerating \(a\) and \(b\) near these values to confirm the matches.

```python
# Enumerate integer pairs (a,b) with small |a|,|b| to satisfy:
# For all x: (a x + b)^2 - (a x + b) + 2 == 9 x^2 -3 x + 2
# We'll test x in a small range and print candidates matching all tested x's exactly.

def poly_lhs(a,b,x):
    val = (a*x + b)**2 - (a*x + b) + 2
    return val

def poly_rhs(x):
    return 9*x**2 - 3*x + 2

# Search |a|,|b| <= 5 and test x in [-5..5]
for a in range(-5,6):
    for b in range(-5,6):
        # Test all x in [-5..5]
        valid = True
        for x in range(-5,6):
            if poly_lhs(a,b,x) != poly_rhs(x):
                valid = False
                break
        if valid:
            print(f"Possible (a,b) = ({a},{b})")
# After this enumeration, known candidates are the printed ones.
```
