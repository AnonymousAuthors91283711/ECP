Ground Truth Answer: 5 / 21
Proposed Answer: 5 / 7 * 3 / 5
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step.

1. The problem is about calculating a probability where:
   - There are 7 doors
   - 2 doors have prizes
   - You pick 1 door initially
   - The host opens some doors (the exact number isn't specified, but the combinatorics suggest 2)
   - We're calculating the probability that your initial choice didn't have a prize

2. The ground truth answer is 5/21, which comes from:
   - favorableCases = 5 * C(4,2) = 5 * 6 = 30
   - totalCases = 7 * C(5,2) = 7 * 10 = 70
   - Probability = 30/70 = 3/7 (simplified)

Wait, this contradicts the ground truth answer of 5/21. There seems to be a discrepancy here.

3. The proposed answer is 5/7 * 3/5 = 15/35 = 3/7

4. Comparing the two:
   - My calculation from the problem setup gives 3/7
   - The proposed answer simplifies to 3/7
   - But the ground truth answer is 5/21

This suggests either:
- I've misunderstood the problem setup
- There's an error in the ground truth answer
- The problem statement is incomplete/misleading

Given that both my calculation and the proposed answer agree on 3/7, but this differs from the ground truth, I'll have to conclude the proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth.
