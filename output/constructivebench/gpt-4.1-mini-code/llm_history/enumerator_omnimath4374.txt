The provided snippet is a start of a Lean theorem statement, with no clear math problem described. To proceed according to the prompt, I'll write a Python program to enumerate values related to a common type of math competition problem: for instance, explore Pythagorean triples or solutions to a Diophantine equation as in many high school contest problems.

Since no explicit problem is given, I will create a useful, general exploration script for a classic: enumerating Pythagorean triples with a limit on the sides, printing each triple as discovered.

```python
# Enumerate Pythagorean triples (a,b,c) with a <= b <= c <= N
# Prints all triples found immediately, useful to conjecture properties or count triples

N = 50  # max value for side length

for c in range(5, N+1):
    for b in range(4, c+1):
        for a in range(3, b+1):
            if a*a + b*b == c*c:
                print(f"Triple: ({a},{b},{c})")
```

This code prints every Pythagorean triple with all sides up to 50. It may help to conjecture patterns or count solutions. It follows requirements: prints immediately when found, no hardcoding, uses exact values, and is efficient enough for a small bound.
