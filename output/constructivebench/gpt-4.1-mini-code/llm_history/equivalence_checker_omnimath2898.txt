Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: 16
The problem is asking to find the maximum value among the results of the operations \(4^2\), \(4*2\), \(4-2\), \(4/2\), and \(4+2\). 

Let's evaluate each operation:
1. \(4^2 = 16\)
2. \(4*2 = 8\)
3. \(4-2 = 2\)
4. \(4/2 = 2\)
5. \(4+2 = 6\)

The maximum value among these is indeed 16, which is the proposed answer. The ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (a placeholder in Lean), but based on the problem statement and the proposed answer, they are equivalent.
