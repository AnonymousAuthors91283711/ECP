abbrev omnimath200_answer : Set (ℤ × ℤ) := sorry
theorem omnimath200 (m n : ℤ) (hm : m ≠ 0) (hn : n ≠ 0) :
    (m^2 + n) * (m + n^2) = (m - n)^3 ↔ (m, n) ∈ omnimath200_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Solution found: (m, n) = (-1, -1)  ->  (0 == 0)
Solution found: (m, n) = (8, -10)  ->  (5832 == 5832)
Solution found: (m, n) = (9, -6)  ->  (3375 == 3375). Expected Answer Type: Set (ℤ × ℤ)
<<<{(-1, -1), (8, -10), (9, -6)}>>>
