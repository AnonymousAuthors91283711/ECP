The problem asks to find all real \( x \) such that

\[
\frac{x}{2} < x^2 < x.
\]

Our goal is to enumerate values \( x \in \mathbb{R} \) satisfying this double inequality. We will test a range of rational values, print candidates satisfying the inequality exactly (symbolic inequality checking), and conjecture the set of such \( x \).

```python
# Enumerate real x (rational approximations) satisfying x/2 < x^2 < x
# Priority: Print candidates exactly satisfying inequalities
# Since x^2 < x, this constrains x; similarly x/2 < x^2.

def f(x):
    return (x/2 < x**2) and (x**2 < x)

# Check values in a reasonable range with small step sizes for numeric insight
# Exclude x=0 (no inequalities hold since 0^2=0)
# Also note domain considerations from the inequalities:
# - From x^2 < x, x must be > 0 or less than 1 but positive likely.
# - Also x/2 < x^2 says x/2 < x^2, for x near 0 positive it's small.

print("Testing samples x from -2 to 2 with step 0.05")

for i in range(-40, 41):
    x = i / 20  # -2 to 2 by 0.05
    if f(x):
        print(f"x={x}: {x/2} < {x}^2={x**2} < {x}")

print("Checking integers in range 0 to 5:")

for x in range(0, 6):
    if f(x):
        print(f"x={x}: {x/2} < {x}^2={x**2} < {x}")

print("Checking fractions around 0.5 and 1:")

for numerator in range(1, 10):
    for denominator in range(1, 10):
        x = numerator / denominator
        if f(x):
            print(f"x={x}: {x/2} < {x}^2={x**2} < {x}")
```
