The problem involves solving the equation sqrt(100 - x) = 9 for real x. We want to find all real x that satisfy the equation exactly. Since sqrt(100 - x) = 9, squaring both sides gives 100 - x = 81, so x = 19. This is the exact solution. We write a Python program to enumerate values of x over a sample range and print those that satisfy the equation exactly or approximately, highlighting the exact value found.

```python
import math

# Enumerate x values in the range [0, 30] to find all satisfying sqrt(100 - x) = 9
# Print both approximate matches and the exact match when it appears.

def is_close(a, b, tol=1e-12):
    return abs(a - b) < tol

print("Enumerating x values where sqrt(100 - x) = 9 ...")

for x in range(0, 31):
    val = math.sqrt(100 - x)
    if is_close(val, 9):
        print(f"x = {x}, sqrt(100 - x) = {val} (Exact or near-exact)")

# Confirm exact solution by algebraic manipulation
x_exact = 100 - 9**2
print(f"Exact solution from algebra: x = {x_exact}")
```
