The problem appears to involve finding a natural number that (1) is not divisible by 3, (2) is not a perfect square, and (3) the sum of its decimal digits is a prime number. The code will enumerate natural numbers starting from 1, check these conditions, and print those that satisfy all three. It will print results as soon as they are found.

```python
import math

def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1: return False
    if n <= 3: return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0: return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i+2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def digit_sum(n):
    s = 0
    while n > 0:
        s += n % 10
        n //=10
    return s

def is_square(n):
    r = int(math.isqrt(n))
    return r*r == n

print("Enumerating natural numbers satisfying:")
print("- not divisible by 3")
print("- not a square")
print("- digit sum is prime")

count = 0
for x in range(1, 1000):  # limit search to 1000 to keep output short
    if x % 3 == 0:
        continue
    if is_square(x):
        continue
    s = digit_sum(x)
    if is_prime(s):
        print(x)
        count += 1
        if count >= 10:
            break
```
