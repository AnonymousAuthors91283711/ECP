This problem asks us to find the value of f(12) - f(2) given that f is linear (f(x) = m*x + b), and f(6) - f(2) = 12. We'll enumerate possible slopes m and intercepts b consistent with f(6)-f(2) = 12, then compute f(12)-f(2).

Since f(6)-f(2) = m*6 + b - (m*2 + b) = 4m = 12, so m = 3 exactly. The intercept b can be any real number but does not affect f(12)-f(2). Next, f(12)-f(2) = m*12 + b - (m*2 + b) = 10m = 30.

To demonstrate this programmatically, we enumerate simple candidates for m (around 3) and intercept b, check the condition, and output f(12)-f(2).

```python
# Enumerate values of m and b to find those where f(6)-f(2)=12, then print f(12)-f(2)
# Since f(x) = m*x + b, f(6)-f(2) = 4m
# So m must be 3 exactly to satisfy f(6)-f(2) =12

def main():
    # We'll test m in a close range to show reasoning
    for m in [2.9, 3.0, 3.1]:
        # Check if f(6)-f(2) = 4*m == 12
        if abs(4*m - 12) < 1e-9:
            # m satisfies condition, try various b
            for b in [-10, 0, 10]:
                f6_f2 = m*6 + b - (m*2 + b)
                if abs(f6_f2 - 12) < 1e-9:
                    f12_f2 = m*12 + b - (m*2 + b)  # = 10*m
                    print(f"m={m}, b={b}, f(6)-f(2)={f6_f2}, f(12)-f(2)={f12_f2}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
