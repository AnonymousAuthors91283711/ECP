The problem involves minimizing (or finding the least element of) the set of sums \(h + k\) where \(h, k\) are centers of two circles satisfying specified distance conditions with a point \((x,y)\) on the unit circle. We want to enumerate possible sums \(h+k\) given the constraints:

- \((x,y)\) on unit circle: \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\)
- \((x,y)\) on circle centered at \((h,k)\) with radius 2: \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = 4\)
- We examine possible \(h+k\)

To help understand/guess the minimal \(h+k\), we enumerate over a grid of \((x,y,h,k)\) satisfying these constraints approximately (due to computational rounding). We prioritize exact checks for the geometric conditions and output found sums \(h+k\) meeting the constraints.

We use a fine grid over \((x,y)\) on the unit circle by sampling angle \(\theta\), and for each \(\theta\), solve for \(h,k\) satisfying both conditions. Due to the problem symmetric structure, we can try to compute \(h,k\) for each \((x,y)\) that satisfy the circle distance constraints and print the sums \(h+k\).

Let's write a program that samples \(\theta\) for the unit circle and attempts to find corresponding centers \((h,k)\) satisfying \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = 4\) and store the sums \(h + k\) for these pairs. We print results immediately.

```python
import math

# Enumerate possible (x,y) on unit circle, step by small angle to balance output length
n = 30
results = set()

print("# Sample (x,y,h,k) and h+k with constraints:")
for i in range(n + 1):
    theta = 2 * math.pi * i / n
    x = math.cos(theta)
    y = math.sin(theta)

    # The second condition: (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = 4
    # For fixed (x,y), the centers (h,k) lie on circle centered at (x,y) radius 2.

    # For simplicity, try a few sample angles phi for (h,k) on circle centered at (x,y) radius 2:
    # This gives samples of h,k for each (x,y)
    m = 6
    for j in range(m):
        phi = 2 * math.pi * j / m
        h = x + 2 * math.cos(phi)
        k = y + 2 * math.sin(phi)
        hk = h + k
        # Check constraint h+k = hk (always true here)
        # Actually, no explicit check needed as h,k computed.

        # We must print to enumerate answers
        if (round(x, 3), round(y,3), round(h,3), round(k,3), round(hk,3)) not in results:
            results.add((round(x, 3), round(y, 3), round(h, 3), round(k, 3), round(hk, 3)))
            print(f"x={x:.3f}, y={y:.3f}, h={h:.3f}, k={k:.3f}, h+k={hk:.3f}")

# Print minimal and maximal h+k found for conjecture
hk_values = [r[4] for r in results]
print("\n# Minimal h+k:", round(min(hk_values),3))
print("# Maximal h+k:", round(max(hk_values),3))
```

This code enumerates sample points on the unit circle and then sample centers \(h,k\) on the circle of radius 2 around \((x,y)\) and prints the sums \(h+k\). This enumeration can assist in conjecturing extremal values of \(h+k\).
