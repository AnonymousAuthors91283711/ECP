This problem involves solving the equation \(3^x \cdot 4^y = 2^{x+y} + 2^{2(x+y)-1}\) over nonnegative integers \(x,y\). We want to find pairs \((x,y)\) satisfying this equality.

We'll enumerate small values of \(x,y\) and check the equality exactly using integer arithmetic (no approximations). Then we'll print any solutions found, streaming them immediately. This will help conjecture a pattern or closed-form solution set.

The program will check \(x,y \in [0,30]\) for efficiency. If any solutions arise beyond this range, users can increase bounds or use reasoning to prove all solutions are found.

```python
# Enumerate (x,y) in range(0,31) and check if 3^x * 4^y = 2^(x+y) + 2^(2*(x+y)-1)
# Print each solution immediately
def main():
    print("Checking solutions to 3^x * 4^y = 2^(x+y) + 2^(2(x+y)-1) for x,y in [0..30]")
    for x in range(31):
        for y in range(31):
            lhs = pow(3, x) * pow(4, y)
            s = x + y
            rhs = pow(2, s) + pow(2, 2*s - 1) if s > 0 else 0  # handle s=0 case carefully
            # For s=0: rhs = 2^0 + 2^{-1} is not integer; no solution at s=0 unless confirm
            if s == 0:
                if lhs == rhs:
                    print(f"Solution found: x={x}, y={y}")
                continue
            if lhs == rhs:
                print(f"Solution found: x={x}, y={y}")
                
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
