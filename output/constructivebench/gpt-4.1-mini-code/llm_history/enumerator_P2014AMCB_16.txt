# Given a polynomial P with real coefficients, and real k with:
# P(0) = k, P(1) = 2k, P(-1) = 3k,
# We want to find the possible values of P(2) + P(-2).
# I'll enumerate some polynomials of small degree (0 to 3) that satisfy these
# conditions and print values of P(2)+P(-2), to identify a pattern or formula.
