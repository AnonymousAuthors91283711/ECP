The problem defines a function `omnimath3428_answer` such that `0.1 * s = t` if and only if `s = omnimath3428_answer t`. We want to enumerate some values of `t` and their corresponding `s`, testing the formula `s = t / 0.1`. Since this is a simple linear relation, we'll print pairs `(t, s)` for sample `t` values.

```python
# Enumerate sample t values and find s satisfying 0.1 * s = t
# So, s = t / 0.1 = 10 * t

def enumerate_omnimath_answers():
    ts = [-2, -1, 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3]
    for t in ts:
        s = 10 * t
        print(f"t = {t}, s = {s} (since 0.1 * s = t)")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    enumerate_omnimath_answers()
```
