The problem involves finding the greatest natural number \( n \) such that the sum of floor values of \(\log(k+1) + \log(n) / \log(10)\) for \( k = 0 \) to \( 99 \) is at most 300. This can be interpreted as:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{100} \left\lfloor \log_{10}(k) + \log_{10}(n) \right\rfloor \leq 300
\]

which simplifies as:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{100} \left\lfloor \log_{10}(nk) \right\rfloor \leq 300
\]

We want to find the maximum \( n \) satisfying this. To aid in conjecturing the true answer, I will write an enumerator that tries values of \( n \), computes the sum, and prints \( n \) if the sum is \(\leq 300\). This should be efficient by precomputing \(\log_{10}(k)\) and using binary search for the maximum \( n \). Since the problem is about maximizing \( n \), I will attempt values starting from 1 upwards until the sum exceeds 300, printing each valid \( n \).

```python
import math

def sum_floor_logs(n):
    log_n = math.log10(n)
    total = 0
    for k in range(1, 101):
        val = math.floor(math.log10(k) + log_n)
        total += val
    return total

def main():
    print("Enumerating n starting from 1, sum of floor logs <= 300:")
    n = 1
    max_n = 0

    while True:
        s = sum_floor_logs(n)
        if s <= 300:
            print(f"n={n}, sum={s}")
            max_n = n
            n += 1
        else:
            # exceeded limit; stop
            break

    print(f"Maximum n with sum <= 300 is {max_n}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This program enumerates \( n \) starting at 1 upwards, prints \( n \) with the sum of floors, and stops when the sum exceeds 300, outputting the maximum \( n \) found. This straightforward enumeration should reveal the solution quickly due to the problem scale.
