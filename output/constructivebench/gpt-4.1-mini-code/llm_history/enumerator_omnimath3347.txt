The problem involves a binary operation `op` on real numbers with specific algebraic properties: continuity, commutativity, distributivity over multiplication, and a special value `op 2 2 = 4`. The goal is to find an explicit form or characterization of `y` such that `op x y = x` for `x > 1`. To assist, we'll enumerate possible values of `y` for sample `x`, assuming `op` behaves like a function `f(a, b)` satisfying given properties. Since `op` is commutative and distributive over multiplication, it hints that `op(a,b)` might be `a^g(b)` or something similar. We'll try simple candidate forms like multiplication, powers, or exponentials to find `y` given `op x y = x`. The script prints `x`, the candidate `y`, and checks `op x y` for verification, focusing on small integer and fractional values.

```python
# Enumerate candidates for y given x and op, with op satisfying:
# commutativity, continuity, distributivity over multiplication, and op(2,2)=4.
# We'll test x in (1,4), since x>1, and propose candidate y in [0.1..3].
# Candidate ops to test: multiplication (a*b), power (a**b), addition (a+b), or a^y form.
# For each op, find y solving op(x,y)=x, print results for conjectures.

def main():
    xs = [1.5, 2, 3, 4]  # sample x > 1
    ys = [i/10 for i in range(1,31)]  # y in (0.1 to 3.0)
    
    print("Testing op(a,b) = a*b")
    for x in xs:
        for y in ys:
            val = x*y
            if abs(val - x) < 1e-9:
                print(f"x={x}, y={y}, op(x,y)={val}")

    print("\nTesting op(a,b) = a**b (a^b)")
    for x in xs:
        for y in ys:
            val = x**y
            if abs(val - x) < 1e-9:
                print(f"x={x}, y={y}, op(x,y)={val}")

    print("\nTesting op(a,b) = a + b")
    for x in xs:
        for y in ys:
            val = x + y
            if abs(val - x) < 1e-9:
                print(f"x={x}, y={y}, op(x,y)={val}")

    print("\nTesting op(a,b) = a**y * b**x (mixed powers)")
    # This does not respect commutativity explicitly, so let's skip this.

    # Given the special relation op(2,2)=4,
    # Let's check if op(a,b) = a**b fits: 2**2=4 correct.

    # From testing op(a,b)=a**b, we look for y such that x**y = x,
    # i.e. x**y = x => y=1.

    # So print candidate y=1 for all x:
    print("\nCandidate y=1 for all x as op(a,b)=a**b:")
    for x in xs:
        val = x**1
        print(f"x={x}, y=1, op(x,y)={val}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
