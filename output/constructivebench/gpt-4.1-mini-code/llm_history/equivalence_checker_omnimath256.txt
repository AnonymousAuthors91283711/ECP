Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {(a,b) : ℤ × ℤ | a = b ∨ a = -b}
<<<None>>>

Since the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's intentionally left undefined in Lean), we cannot verify whether the proposed answer {(a,b) : ℤ × ℤ | a = b ∨ a = -b} is equivalent to it. The problem appears to be about finding all integer pairs (a,b) where there exist functions f,g that satisfy the given functional equations, but without knowing the intended solution, we cannot confirm equivalence.
