The problem involves finding values \( t \in \mathbb{R} \) such that there exists an infinite set \( X \subseteq \mathbb{R} \) where for every triple \( (x,y,z) \in X^3 \), and every \( a,d \in \mathbb{R} \) with \( d > 0 \), the inequality 

\[
\max( |x - (a-d)|, |y - a|, |z - (a+d)| ) > t d
\]

holds. We want to enumerate candidates for such \( t \) by constructing example infinite sets \( X \) and testing the inequality for sample triples and \( (a,d) \).

Let's try sample values of \( t \in \{0.5, 0.6, 0.7, \ldots, 2\} \) and try simple infinite sets like arithmetic progressions or integer sets to find if the infimum of those max distances scaled by \( d \) is above the chosen \( t \). We will print values of \( t \) as candidates and show witness sets \( X \).

```python
# Enumerate candidates for t satisfying the problem's condition:
# For each t, try infinite sets X (like integers, even numbers, scaled integers),
# and test triples and intervals (a,d) to check if max distances > t*d.

def check_condition(X, t, samples=20):
    # We'll pick d from 1 to samples, a from sampling points near elements in X,
    # and test all triples of points from first 'samples' points of X.
    xs = sorted(list(X))[:samples]
    n = len(xs)
    for i in range(min(n, samples)):
        for j in range(min(n, samples)):
            for k in range(min(n, samples)):
                x, y, z = xs[i], xs[j], xs[k]
                for d in range(1, samples//2 + 1):
                    # We vary 'a' by walking through points in [min(xs), max(xs)]
                    mina = min(xs)-d
                    maxa = max(xs)+d
                    for a in [m * 0.5 for m in range(int(m + mina*2), int(m + maxa*2)+1)]:
                        maxdist = max(abs(x - (a - d)), abs(y - a), abs(z - (a + d)))
                        if maxdist <= t * d:

This program tries different infinite sets and values of \( t \) by sampling triples and \( (a,d) \) to check if the inequality is always trueâ€”thus enumerating possible \( t \) candidates. Outputs are streaming to guide further conjecture.
