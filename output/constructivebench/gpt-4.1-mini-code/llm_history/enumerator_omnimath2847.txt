The problem involves integers \(A < B < C < D\) satisfying two ratio conditions of differences:
\[
\frac{B-A}{C-A} = \frac{1}{5}, \quad \frac{C-B}{D-C} = 2.
\]
We want to find the ratio \(\frac{B-A}{D-C}\).

To help conjecture the answer, I'll enumerate candidates for the integers with small values. We'll try all increasing integer quadruples \(A < B < C < D\) with differences satisfying the given ratios, compute the ratio \(\frac{B-A}{D-C}\) exactly as a rational number, and print each. This will let us observe the pattern leading to a closed form.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Enumerate integer quadruples A < B < C < D with small differences,
# checking the given ratio conditions exactly and printing the target ratio.

max_delta = 20  # limit search space for efficiency

print("A B C D (B-A)/(D-C)")

for A in range(0, 5):  # small A
    for D in range(A + 6, A + max_delta):  # D must be greater than A, big enough for denominators
        total_diff = D - A
        # From (B - A)/(C - A) = 1/5:
        # Let C - A = x, then B - A = x/5
        # x must be integer multiple of 5
        for x in range(5, total_diff):
            if x >= total_diff:
                break
            if x * 5 != int(x * 5):  # x integer, so B-A = x/5 must be integer, so x divisible by 5
                continue
            if x % 5 != 0:
                continue
            B_minus_A = x // 5  # integer
            if B_minus_A == 0:
                continue
            # Then B = A + B_minus_A, C = A + x
            B = A + B_minus_A
            C = A + x
            if not (A < B < C < D):
                continue

            # Check (C - B)/(D - C) = 2/1 = 2
            left = C - B
            right = D - C
            if right == 0:
                continue
            ratio = Fraction(left, right)
            if ratio == 2:
                # Now compute (B - A)/(D - C)
                res = Fraction(B - A, D - C)
                print(f"{A} {B} {C} {D} {res}")
```
This enumerates examples and prints them immediately to observe the exact target ratio values.
