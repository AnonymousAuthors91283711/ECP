theorem P2004AMCB_12 (n : ℕ) (hn : n ≥ 3) :
  let rec f : ℕ → ℕ
    | 0 => 2001
    | 1 => 2002

Ground Truth Answer: fun n => if n % 6 = 0 then 0 else 2004 - (n % 6)
Proposed Answer: fun n => 2001 + n + 3 * (n / 2) + if n % 2 = 0 then 0 else 1
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive sequence with:
   - f(0) = 2001
   - f(1) = 2002
   - f(2) = 2003
   - f(k+3) = f(k+1) + f(k) - f(k+2)

2. The ground truth answer shows a periodic pattern with period 6:
   - When n%6=0: 0
   - Otherwise: 2004 - (n%6)

3. The proposed answer is a linear-looking formula with some conditional adjustments.

Let's test some values:
For n=3 (f(2)=2003):
- Ground truth: 2004-3=2001
- Proposed: 2001+3+4+1=2009 (incorrect)

For n=4 (f(3)=2001):
- Ground truth: 2004-4=2000
- Proposed: 2001+4+6+0=2011 (incorrect)

For n=6 (f(5)):
- Ground truth: 0
- Proposed: 2001+6+9+0=2016 (incorrect)

The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth for any n≥3. The recursive definition creates a periodic sequence that the proposed linear formula doesn't capture.
