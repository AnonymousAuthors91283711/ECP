The problem asks to find the least length \( n \) of a list \( s \) of elements in \( \{0, 1\} \) such that:
- The final count after folding over \( s \) with the given operation is at least 2018.
- Each occurrence of \( 1 \) in \( s \) has an earlier \( 0 \) preceding it.

We will enumerate possible sequences \( s \) of length \( n \) starting from small \( n \), implement the fold, check the condition on the ones being after zeros, and print candidates reaching count >= 2018.

Since \( s \) elements are from \( \{0, 1\} \), and length \( n \) can start small and go upwards. The fold behaves:
- If element 0: clipboard = count, count unchanged.
- If element 1: count += clipboard.
- Initial clipboard=0, count=1.

We want to find minimum \( n \) such that there exists such an \( s \).

```python
# Enumerate sequences s in {0,1}^n for increasing n,
# Fold as defined, check count>=2018 and each 1 has earlier 0.
# Print sequences found, then print minimal length.

def satisfies(s):
    clipboard, count = 0, 1
    for k in s:
        if k == 0:
            clipboard = count
        elif k == 1:
            count += clipboard
        # no other values to handle
    if count < 2018:
        return False
    # Check each 1 has prior 0
    for i, val in enumerate(s):
        if val == 1:
            if 0 not in s[:i]:
                return False
    return True

def sequence_repr(s):
    return ''.join(map(str, s))

def main():
    from itertools import product
    target = 2018
    max_length = 25  # A reasonable upper bound for search
    
    found_any = False
    for n in range(1, max_length+1):
        # Generate sequences length n starting with at least one 0 (to allow 1)
        # But no requirement to start with zero, just need to verify conditions
        count_found = 0
        for s in product((0,1), repeat=n):
            if satisfies(s):
                print(f"Length {n} sequence meeting count>=2018: {sequence_repr(s)}")
                count_found += 1
                # limit output for each length to avoid overflow
                if count_found >= 5:
                    break
        if count_found > 0:
            print(f"Minimal length with sequence meeting count>=2018 is at most {n}")
            found_any = True
            break
    if not found_any:
        print("No sequence found up to length", max_length)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
