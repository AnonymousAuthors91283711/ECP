[write_program]
The problem is to find the greatest natural number \( s \) such that there exist \( x, y \in \mathbb{N} \) and an injective function \( f: \{0, \dots, 8\} \to \{1,2,4,5,6,9,10,11,13\} \) satisfying certain additive relations among the values of \( f \).

To assist, I'll write a Python program that tries all injective assignments of \( f \) from the given set of 9 numbers to the indices 0 to 8, checks the constraints:
- \( f(0) = x \),
- \( f(8) = y \),
- \( f(1) = f(0) + f(2) \),
- \( f(3) = f(2) + f(4) \),
- \( f(5) = f(4) + f(6) \),
- \( f(7) = f(6) + f(8) \).

For each valid \( f \), we print \( s = f(7) \) (the number to maximize) immediately as found. To reduce the output, limit prints to unique \( s \) values, and at the end print the maximum \( s \).

```python
from itertools import permutations

# Given values for f(i)
values = [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 13]

def check(f):
    # f is a tuple of length 9: f[0], ..., f[8]
    # Check the additive constraints:
    try:
        if f[1] != f[0] + f[2]:
            return False
        if f[3] != f[2] + f[4]:
            return False
        if f[5] != f[4] + f[6]:
            return False
        if f[7] != f[6] + f[8]:
            return False
    except IndexError:
        return False
    return True

def main():
    found_s = set()
    max_s = None
    # Enumerate all injective functions f: indices 0..8 -> values, via permutations
    for f in permutations(values):
        if check(f):
            s = f[7]
            if s not in found_s:
                print(f"s = {s}, f = {f}")
                found_s.add(s)
                if max_s is None or s > max_s:
                    max_s = s
    if max_s is not None:
        print(f"Maximum s found: {max_s}")
    else:
        print("No valid f found.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
