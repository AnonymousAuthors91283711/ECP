This problem involves finding a rational number \(x = \frac{m}{n}\) such that applying the function \(f_1\) 1001 times to \(x\) equals \(x - 3\), with \(m\) and \(n\) coprime natural numbers. We want to find all such pairs \((m,n)\) with their sums, and eventually identify \(m+n\).

We don't attempt the full theoretical proof here, but we can try iterating the function \(f_1\) multiple times for some initial rational values and check when the condition \((f_1^{1001})(x) = x -3\) might hold. Given the complexity, we try small numerator and denominator candidates and print those close to the condition.

The program iterates over small coprime numerators and denominators, applies \(f_1\) 1001 times on \(x=\frac{m}{n}\), then compares with \(x-3\). If matched exactly, it prints the solution.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def f1(x: Fraction) -> Fraction:
    # f1(x) = 2/3 - 3/(3x+1)
    return Fraction(2,3) - Fraction(3, 3*x + 1)

def iterate_f1(x: Fraction, times: int) -> Fraction:
    for _ in range(times):
        x = f1(x)
    return x

def coprime(a: int, b: int) -> bool:
    from math import gcd
    return gcd(a,b) == 1

def main():
    times = 1001
    print("Searching rationals m/n with m+n <= 30; applying f1 1001 times to check if f1^{1001}(x) = x - 3")
    for m_plus_n in range(2, 31):
        for m in range(1, m_plus_n):
            n = m_plus_n - m
            if not coprime(m, n):
                continue
            x = Fraction(m, n)
            y = iterate_f1(x, times)
            if y == x - 3:
                print(f"Found solution: m={m}, n={n}, m+n={m_plus_n}, x={x}")
    print("Search complete.")

    main()
```
