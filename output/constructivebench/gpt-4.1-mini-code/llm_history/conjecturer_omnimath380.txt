theorem omnimath380 : 
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | ∃ (coloring : ℕ → ℕ), 
    ∀ (r₁ r₂ : ℕ), Adjacent r₁ r₂ → coloring r₁ ≠ coloring r₂} omnimath380_answer.1 ∧
  IsLeast {m : ℕ | ∃ (coloring : ℕ → ℕ), 
    ∀ (r₁ r₂ : ℕ), CornerAdjacent r₁ r₂ → coloring r₁ ≠ coloring r₂} omnimath380_answer.2 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing adjacency coloring
Colors=2 feasible coloring: (0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1)
Minimal Adjacent colors ≤ 2

Testing corner adjacency coloring
Colors=3 feasible coloring: (0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2)
Minimal CornerAdjacent colors ≤ 3. Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ
