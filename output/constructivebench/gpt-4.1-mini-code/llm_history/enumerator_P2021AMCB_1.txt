The problem is about counting the number of integers \( x \) such that \( |x| < 3\pi \). Since \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), \( 3\pi \approx 9.4247 \). We want to find all integers \( x \) with absolute value less than this number, i.e. integers \( x \) satisfying \(-9.4247 < x < 9.4247 \).

Hence the integers \( x \) are from \(-9\) up to \(9\).

The total count is therefore \(9 + 9 + 1 = 19\) integers (including zero).

We enumerate integers from \(-10\) to \(10\), check if \(|x| < 3\pi\), print those that satisfy it, then print the total count.

```python
import math

def main():
    threshold = 3 * math.pi
    count = 0
    print(f"Threshold (3*pi) â‰ˆ {threshold:.6f}")
    for x in range(-10, 11):
        if abs(x) < threshold:
            print(x)
            count += 1
    print("Count of integers x with |x| < 3*pi:", count)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
