The problem presents a functional equation involving sums of cubes and squares of partial sums of a sequence \(a_i\) for \(i = 0, \ldots, n-1\), with \(n=2017\). The condition is:

\[ 3\left(\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} a_i\right)^2 = \sum_{i=0}^{m-1} a_i^3 \quad \text{for all } 1 \le m \le n. \]

We want to identify the value of \(a_{1337}\).

Approach:
- Enumerate sequences \(a_i\) satisfying the relation for small \(n\) (e.g., up to \(n=10\)) to identify pattern(s).
- The relation is quite restrictive; try small integer values and check consistency.
- Because the problem is high-level, likely \(\{a_i\}\) are constant or follow a simple form.

The program below:
- Checks sequences of length \(n=10\) with small integer values (say \(1\) or \(2\)).
- Enumerates sequences and tests the property for all \(m\).
- Prints sequences satisfying the property.
- From the pattern of \(a_i\), conjectures a fixed value (or values), including \(a_{1337}\).

```python
# Enumerate sequences a_0,...,a_9 with values in {1,2}, checking:
# For all m: 3*(sum_{i<m} a_i)^2 == sum_{i<m} a_i^3
# Print sequences satisfying it, then note the value at index 7 (corresponds roughly to position near 1337 in length 2017)

def check_seq(seq):
    for m in range(1, len(seq)+1):
        s = sum(seq[:m])
        lhs = 3 * s * s
        rhs = sum(x**3 for x in seq[:m])
        if lhs != rhs:
            return False
    return True

def main():
    n = 10
    vals = [1, 2]
    # Since 2^10=1024 sequences, this is feasible
    from itertools import product
    print(f"Testing sequences of length {n} with values in {vals}:")
    for seq in product(vals, repeat=n):
        if check_seq(seq):
            print("Sequence passes:", seq, "=> a_7 =", seq[7])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
