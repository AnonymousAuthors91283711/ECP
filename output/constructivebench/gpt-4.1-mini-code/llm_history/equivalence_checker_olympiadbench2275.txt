abbrev olympiadbench2275_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem olympiadbench2275 : 
  (digits 10 ((10^3 + 1)^2)).sum = olympiadbench2275_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 1002001
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze this problem carefully:

1. The problem is asking for the sum of the digits of (10³ + 1)² when written in base 10.

2. First calculate (10³ + 1) = 1001
3. Then (1001)² = 1002001
4. The digits of 1002001 are 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1
5. The sum of these digits is 1 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 4

The ground truth answer shows the number itself (1002001), while the proposed answer shows the correct digit sum (4). These are different answers to different questions - one shows the number, the other shows its digit sum.
