The problem is to find natural numbers \(a_1, d_1, a_2, d_2\) such that:

\[
a_1 a_2 = 1440
\]
\[
(a_1 + d_1)(a_2 + d_2) = 1716
\]
\[
(a_1 + 2 d_1)(a_2 + 2 d_2) = 1848
\]

and then find the value of \((a_1 + 7 d_1)(a_2 + 7 d_2)\).

This type of problem suggests iterating over divisors of 1440 for \((a_1, a_2)\), then attempting to solve for \(d_1, d_2\) using the two other equations.

We'll enumerate possibilities for \(a_1, a_2\) with \(a_1 a_2 = 1440\), then solve for \(d_1, d_2\) from the second and third equations, check if those \(d_1, d_2\) are natural numbers, and finally print the candidate answers.

```python
# Enumerate all (a1,a2) with a1*a2=1440 and all (d1,d2) satisfying the two conditions,
# then compute (a1+7*d1)*(a2+7*d2).

def divisors(n):
    divs = []
    i = 1
    while i*i <= n:
        if n % i == 0:
            divs.append(i)
            if i*i != n:
                divs.append(n//i)
        i += 1
    return divs

def main():
    n = 1440
    target2 = 1716
    target3 = 1848
    divs = divisors(n)
    divs.sort()
    for a1 in divs:
        a2 = n // a1
        # From:
        # (a1 + d1)(a2 + d2) = 1716
        # (a1 + 2 d1)(a2 + 2 d2) = 1848
        #
        # Let x = d1, y = d2
        # Expanding:
        # (a1 a2) + a1 y + a2 x + x y = 1716
        # (a1 a2) + 2 a1 y + 2 a2 x + 4 x y = 1848
        #
        # Subtract first from second:
        # (2 a1 y + 2 a2 x + 4 x y) - (a1 y + a2 x + x y) = 1848 - 1716
        # a1 y + a2 x + 3 x y = 132
        #
        # From first:
        # a1 a2 + a1 y + a2 x + x y = 1716
        # So a1 y + a2 x + x y = 1716 - a1 a2 = 1716 - 1440 = 276
        #
        # So we have system:
        # a1 y + a2 x + x y = 276
        # a1 y + a2 x + 3 x y = 132
        #
        # Subtract first from second:
        # (a1 y + a2 x + 3 x y) - (a1 y + a2 x + x y) = 132 - 276
        # 2 x y = -144
        # x y = -72
        #
        # But x d1 and d2 are natural numbers, so x y negative is not possible.
        # So the system has no solution with both d1,d2 > 0.
        #
        # Try d1,d2 integers (allow negative)
        #
        # Using above:
        # x y = -72
        # and from first:
        # a1 y + a2 x + x y = 276
        # substitute x y = -72:
        # a1 y + a2 x = 276 + 72 = 348
        #
        # So system:
        # a1 y + a2 x = 348
        # x y = -72
        #
        # From x y = -72 => y = -72 / x.
        #
        # Substitute in first:
        # a1 * (-72 / x) + a2 x = 348
        # -72 a1 / x + a2 x = 348
        # Multiply both sides by x:
        # -72 a1 + a2 x^2 = 348 x
        # a2 x^2 - 348 x - 72 a1 = 0
        #
        # Quadratic in x:
        # a2 x^2 - 348 x -72 a1=0
        #
        # Solve for x as integer dividing 72* a1.

The problem is to find integers \(a_1, d_1, a_2, d_2\) satisfying:
\[
a_1 a_2 = 1440
\]
\[
(a_1 + d_1)(a_2 + d_2) = 1716
\]
\[
(a_1 + 2 d_1)(a_2 + 2 d_2) = 1848
\]
and then compute \((a_1 + 7 d_1)(a_2 + 7 d_2)\).

The original program tries to solve this by enumerating divisors (for \(a_1, a_2\)) and solving for \(d_1, d_2\), interpreting the two equations as a quadratic in \(d_1\) and then computing \(d_2\).

However, the program got stuck and outputs nothing because of incorrect algebraic handling and inconsistent assumptions about signs and integer solutions. It assumes \(d_1, d_2\) are integers but derives incorrect or impossible conditions leading to no solution.

The crucial insight is to treat the problem as a system of equations in \(d_1, d_2\) given \(a_1, a_2\). Instead of complicated quadratic substitution, one can:

- Use the three given equations and note all are quadratic expansions.
- Expand and rewrite the second and third equations in terms of \(d_1, d_2\):
\[
(a_1 + k d_1)(a_2 + k d_2) = a_1 a_2 + k (a_1 d_2 + a_2 d_1) + k^2 d_1 d_2
\]
Use these to find linear equations involving \(d_1 d_2\) and \(a_1 d_2 + a_2 d_1\).

Solving this linear system should allow the program to find integer solutions for \(d_1, d_2\) by enumerating possible divisor pairs of \(d_1 d_2\).

This approach fixes the logic error; the program should also check integer divisibility carefully.

Therefore, the original program should be rejected.

The problem is to find natural numbers a₁, d₁, a₂, d₂ satisfying three equations involving products of arithmetic progressions, and then to find the 8th term product (with n=7, since indices start at 0) (a₁ + 7*d₁)(a₂ + 7*d₂). The original submission provides no program, just the problem statement and a sketch of the theorem, so there's no program to accept.

Thus, the original program is empty and should be rejected.

I will provide a Python program that tries all reasonable values of a₁, a₂, d₁, d₂ (within some bounds) and prints all the tuples that satisfy the three equations exactly, then prints their final product (the final value requested). Since a₁ * a₂ = 1440, we can iterate over factor pairs of 1440. Then find d₁, d₂ such that the other conditions hold.

The main challenge is the system:

Given:

1) a₁ * a₂ = 1440
2) (a₁ + d₁)(a₂ + d₂) = 1716
3) (a₁ + 2d₁)(a₂ + 2d₂) = 1848

We want to find a₁,d₁,a₂,d₂ in natural numbers (natural numbers are positive integers including zero or not? The problem states ℕ, usually meaning positive integers, so d's may be zero or positive.)

Compute and print the final value (a₁ + 7d₁)(a₂ + 7d₂).

We proceed by enumerating factor pairs (a₁,a₂) of 1440, then for each candidate, try small d₁,d₂ in range (0..some reasonable max, e.g., 50).

Check the three equations exactly.

Print the found a₁,a₂,d₁,d₂ and the final product.

We also print parameters used and limit the search to keep output small.

This approach meets all requirements.
