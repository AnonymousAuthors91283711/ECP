theorem omnimath1626 (a b : ℕ) (ha : 0 < a) (hb : 0 < b) :
  (∑ i in Finset.range a, ∑ j in Finset.range b, (i * b + j + 1)) -

  omnimath1626_answer (a, b) = 21 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Found (a,b)=(5,16), difference=1200
Found (a,b)=(16,5), difference=1200
omnimath1626_answer for found pairs = 21. Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ → ℕ
<<<fun p : ℕ × ℕ => p.1 + p.2>>>
