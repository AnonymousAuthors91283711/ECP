The problem seems to be about finding all pairs of positive integers \((a,b)\) such that:
\[
(a^2 + b) \equiv 0 \pmod{b^2 - a} \quad \text{and} \quad (b^2 + a) \equiv 0 \pmod{a^2 - b}.
\]

We will enumerate pairs \((a,b)\) for small values, skipping invalid divisor cases, and print those satisfying the divisibility conditions.

```python
# Enumerate positive integers a,b with small values to find pairs where
# (a^2 + b) divisible by (b^2 - a) and (b^2 + a) divisible by (a^2 - b).
# Note: denominators must be positive to avoid zero division and negative mod bases.

MAX = 50  # search upper bound

for a in range(1, MAX + 1):
    for b in range(1, MAX + 1):
        denom1 = b*b - a
        denom2 = a*a - b
        # skip zero or negative denominators since modulus with nonpositive divisor is not standard here
        if denom1 <= 0 or denom2 <= 0:
            continue
        if (a*a + b) % denom1 == 0 and (b*b + a) % denom2 == 0:
            print(f"a={a}, b={b} satisfy conditions")
```
This code prints all such pairs for \(1 \leq a,b \leq 50\). You can increase MAX if needed but this should give enough data to conjecture the pattern or solution set.
