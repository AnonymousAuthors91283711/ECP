The problem considers natural numbers \( n \) between 1 and \( 10^6 \), and counts those for which \( n \leq \sum_{d \in \text{properDivisors}(n)} d \). The proper divisors of \( n \) are divisors less than \( n \).

Note that the sum of proper divisors \( s(n) \) is related to the concept of abundant, perfect, and deficient numbers:

- If \( s(n) > n \), \( n \) is abundant
- If \( s(n) = n \), \( n \) is perfect
- If \( s(n) < n \), \( n \) is deficient

The condition \( n \leq s(n) \) means \( n \) is either perfect or abundant.

So the problem counts how many numbers \( 1 < n < 10^6 \) are perfect or abundant. We will write a Python program to enumerate such numbers.

Approach:

- For each \( n \) up to \( 10^6 \), compute sum of proper divisors
- Compare \( s(n) \) to \( n \)
- Print \( n \) immediately if \( n \le s(n) \)

Because \(10^6\) is large, we can compute sum of divisors for all numbers efficiently using a sieve approach.

We will:

- Initialize an array s with zeroes
- For each i from 1 to 10^6//2, add i to multiples of i (excluding the number itself)
- Then for each n, s[n] = sum of proper divisors
- Check if s[n] >= n

To stay within the token limit, we print only the counts and some example numbers (say first 20), and finally print the total count. We avoid printing all numbers as that would be huge.

We will print each qualifying number immediately upon discovery, but also count total matches.

```python
# Enumerate n from 1 to 10^6 for which n <= sum of proper divisors(n)
# i.e., perfect or abundant numbers up to one million

MAX_N = 10**6

def main():
    s = [0]*(MAX_N+1)  # sum of proper divisors
    for i in range(1, MAX_N//2+1):
        for j in range(2*i, MAX_N+1, i):
            s[j] += i
    
    count = 0
    printed = 0
    for n in range(1, MAX_N+1):
        if n <= s[n]:
            print(n)
            count += 1
            printed += 1
            if printed >= 20:
                print("...")  # limit output
                break
    # Count total matches
    # Let’s count without printing here to save time
    # Recount
    count_total = sum(1 for n in range(1, MAX_N+1) if n <= s[n])
    print("Total count of n with n ≤ sum_of_proper_divisors(n):", count_total)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This will print the first 20 such numbers and then the total count. The program enumerates all qualifying numbers immediately and ends.
