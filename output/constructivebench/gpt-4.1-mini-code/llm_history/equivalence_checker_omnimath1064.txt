abbrev omnimath1064_answer : â„š := sorry
theorem omnimath1064 :
  let n := 60
  let p := (3^(n-1) + 1) / (4 * 3^(n-1))
  p = omnimath1064_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: (3^59 + 1) / (4 * 3^59)
Proposed Answer: (3^(60 - 1) + 1) / (4 * 3^(60 - 1))
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is exactly equivalent to the ground truth answer. Both expressions represent the same mathematical quantity:
1. The ground truth uses n=60 directly in the exponent (59 = 60-1)
2. The proposed answer explicitly shows the calculation (60-1) in the exponent
The only difference is syntactic - one uses the pre-calculated exponent while the other shows the calculation - but they represent identical values.
