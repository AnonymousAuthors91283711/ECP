The problem involves summing products of probabilities defined by sequences, over a range of presses from start to presses-1. To explore and conjecture the sum, we'll enumerate the values for each k, calculate the indicator, and then sum these values, printing partial results as we proceed.

We will print values of k, the corresponding probabilities, the indicator value, and running sum to get insight into the pattern. Parameters: presses = 100, start = 3.

```python
# Enumerate k from start+1 to presses, print indicator and running sum
def main():
    presses = 100
    start = 3
    
    def X(k):
        return k - 1  # current floor after (k-1) presses

    def Y(k):
        return k - 1  # total presses before current (k-th) press

    def p(k):
        if Y(k) == 0:
            return 0.0
        return X(k) / Y(k)

    total = 0.0
    for k in range(start+1, presses+1):
        val = p(k-1) * p(k) if k >= start+1 else 0
        total += val
        print(f"k={k}, p(k-1)={p(k-1):.4f}, p(k)={p(k):.4f}, indicator={val:.4f}, running sum={total:.4f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
