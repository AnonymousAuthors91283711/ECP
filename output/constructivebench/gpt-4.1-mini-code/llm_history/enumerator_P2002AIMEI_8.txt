The problem is looking for the smallest natural number \( k \) such that there exist two distinct pairs \((a_1,a_2) \neq (b_1,b_2)\), with \(0 < a_1 \le a_2\), \(0 < b_1 \le b_2\), and both sequences defined by that generalized Fibonacci-like rule have the same 9th term equal to \(k\).

To assist in conjecturing the answer, we will enumerate values of \(a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2\) over a small range, compute the 9th term of each fibLike sequence, and whenever we find two distinct pairs producing the same term, print the pairs and the term. This will reveal candidate values of \(k\), and the minimum \(k\) found is our conjectured answer.

Since the problem asks for natural numbers and \(a_1 \le a_2\), we can limit \(a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2\) to small values (say 1 to 10) to keep runtime and output reasonable.

```python
# enumerator.py
def fib_like(a1, a2, n):
    # Define the recursive sequence fibLike with fibLike(0)=0, fibLike(1)=a1, fibLike(2)=a2
    f = [0, a1, a2]
    for i in range(3, n+1):
        f.append(f[i-1] + f[i-2])
    return f[n]

def main():
    max_val = 10  # limit search space a1,a2,b1,b2 âˆˆ [1..10]
    n = 9

    found = {}  # map from fibLike(a1,a2,9) -> list of (a1,a2) pairs producing it

    for a1 in range(1, max_val+1):
        for a2 in range(a1, max_val+1):
            val = fib_like(a1, a2, n)
            # print exact value and pairs producing it
            if val not in found:
                found[val] = [(a1,a2)]
            else:
                # Check if distinct pair exists
                distinct_pairs = [p for p in found[val] if p != (a1,a2)]
                if distinct_pairs:
                    for p in distinct_pairs:
                        print(f"Value {val} obtained by pairs {p} and ({a1},{a2})")
                found[val].append((a1,a2))
    # Print minimal such value
    candidates = [val for val, pairs in found.items() if len(set(pairs)) > 1]
    if candidates:
        min_val = min(candidates)
        print(f"Minimum k with distinct pairs producing fibLike(9)={min_val}")
    else:
        print("No duplicates found in search range.")

    main()
