The problem appears to involve finding rational numbers \( w, b, r \) satisfying the system:
\[
w + b + r = 1, \quad \frac{w}{b} = \frac{16}{3}, \quad \frac{b}{r} = 3,
\]
and identifying the exact value \( w \) consistent with these equations.

Below is a Python program that computes \( w, b, r \) based on the given ratios and sums, printing exact rational values in fractional form immediately.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# We want to find w, b, r in Q such that:
# w + b + r = 1
# w / b = 16 / 3
# b / r = 3 / 1

# Let r = x (parameter in Q), then
# b = 3 * r = 3x
# w = (16/3) * b = (16/3) * 3x = 16x
# Sum: w + b + r = 16x + 3x + x = 20x = 1 => x = 1/20
# Then r = 1/20, b = 3/20, w = 16/20 = 4/5

r = Fraction(1, 20)
b = 3 * r
w = Fraction(16, 3) * b

print(f"r = {r}")  # r as exact fraction
print(f"b = {b}")  # b as exact fraction
print(f"w = {w}")  # w as exact fraction, candidate exact answer

# Confirm sum is exactly 1
print(f"Sum w + b + r = {w + b + r}")
```
