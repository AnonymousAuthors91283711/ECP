[write_program]
The problem asks for the number of integers \( n \) such that \(\sqrt{15} < n < \sqrt{50}\). To assist in conjecturing the answer, I'll write a Python program that enumerates the integers \( n \) within the bounds for sample integer intervals, checking which satisfy the inequality. The program will compute exact integer bounds by comparing squares (avoiding floating-point issues) and stream all valid integer values.

```python
# Enumerate integers n such that sqrt(15) < n < sqrt(50)
# Instead of using float sqrt, compare n^2 with 15 and 50 to avoid precision issues.

def enumerate_candidates():
    lower_bound_sq = 15
    upper_bound_sq = 50

    # The candidate n must satisfy sqrt(15) < n < sqrt(50)
    # So n^2 > 15 and n^2 < 50

    # Find candidate integers n starting from 1 to some upper limit
    # sqrt(50) ~7.07, so n up to 7 suffices
    print("Enumerating integers n where sqrt(15) < n < sqrt(50):")
    candidates = []
    for n in range(-10, 11):  # include some negative integers to check
        if n*n > lower_bound_sq and n*n < upper_bound_sq:
            print(f"n = {n} (since {n}^2 = {n*n} satisfies 15 < n^2 < 50)")
            candidates.append(n)

    # Count only distinct values
    count = len(set(candidates))
    print(f"Count of such integers n: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    enumerate_candidates()
```
