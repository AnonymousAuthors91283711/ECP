This problem involves evaluating a simple arithmetic expression and comparing it to a variable, presumably to find the numeric value. We will enumerate possible values of the term 4 * (4 * 5 + 2) + 2, printing the intermediate components and the final total.

```python
# Compute and enumerate components of the expression 4 * (4 * 5 + 2) + 2
def main():
    for a in range(0, 10):  # sample values around 4
        for b in range(0, 10):  # sample values around 5
            inner = a * (a * b + 2) + 2
            print(f"For a={a}, b={b}: 4 * (4 * 5 + 2) + 2 evaluates to {inner}")
            if a == 4 and b == 5:
                print(f"Exact match for given expression: {inner}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
