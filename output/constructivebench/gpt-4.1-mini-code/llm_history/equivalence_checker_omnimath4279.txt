Ground Truth Answer: fun x k => x^k + (1/x)^k
Proposed Answer: fun x k => k * x ^ 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a functional equation that must satisfy two conditions:
   - A multiplicative condition involving x,y,z > 0
   - A monotonicity condition for x ≥ 1

2. The ground truth answer is f(x) = x^k + (1/x)^k
   - This satisfies both conditions:
     * For the functional equation: The symmetry in x and 1/x makes it work
     * For monotonicity: When k > 0 and x ≥ 1, this is strictly increasing

3. The proposed answer is f(x) = k*x^2
   - This fails the functional equation:
     * Let's test with x=y=z=1: f(1*1*1)+3f(1) = 4k vs f(1)*f(1)*f(1) = k^3
     * These are not equal for general k > 0
   - It also fails to satisfy the condition f(x) > 0 for all x > 0 when k=0 (though k>0 is required)
   - The monotonicity condition would hold for k > 0

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the functional equation part of the problem, while the ground truth does. They are not equivalent.
