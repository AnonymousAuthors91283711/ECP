The problem involves natural numbers S and B satisfying S * 4 = B * 7 and S = B + 12. The goal is to find S + B. We can enumerate B in a reasonable range and check the given equations, printing all solutions and the corresponding sum S + B. Then we can identify the actual answer.

```python
# Enumerate B, check conditions, print all (S,B) and sums S+B

def main():
    for B in range(1, 100):  # reasonable range for small natural numbers
        S = B + 12
        if 4 * S == 7 * B:
            total = S + B
            print(f"S={S}, B={B}, S+B={total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
