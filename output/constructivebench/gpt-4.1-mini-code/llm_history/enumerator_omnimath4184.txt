The problem describes a function \( f:\mathbb{N}^3 \to \mathbb{R} \) defined recursively. When any coordinate is zero, \(f=0\), otherwise \(f\) equals \(1 + \frac{1}{6}\) times the sum of values at 6 neighbors with coordinate increases/decreases of 1 that keep the sum \(p+q+r\) constant. We want to explore possible values of \(f\) for small integers \(p,q,r\).

I will enumerate \(f(p,q,r)\) for small triples with \(p,q,r \leq 3\), starting from boundary cases where \(f=0\) (any coordinate zero), and iteratively apply the recursion to compute values inside the cube. Values will be printed in lexicographic order with exact rational output using Python's fractions module.

```python
from fractions import Fraction
from collections import deque

# f(p,q,r) stored in a dictionary with keys tuples (p,q,r)
f = {}

# Initialize boundary cases: if any coordinate zero => f=0
max_n = 3
for p in range(max_n+1):
    for q in range(max_n+1):
        for r in range(max_n+1):
            if p==0 or q==0 or r==0:
                f[(p,q,r)] = Fraction(0)

# BFS queue for states with at least one neighbor known, start with boundaries known
q = deque()
for key in f.keys():
    q.append(key)

# neighbors in the recursion (deltas)
deltas = [
    (1, -1, 0),
    (-1, 1, 0),
    (-1, 0, 1),
    (1, 0, -1),
    (0, 1, -1),
    (0, -1, 1)
]

# We'll iterate several times to propagate values until stable or max_iters
max_iters = 20

# Initialize f for interior points as None to distinguish unknown
for p in range(1,max_n+1):
    for q1 in range(1,max_n+1):
        for r1 in range(1,max_n+1):
            if (p,q1,r1) not in f:
                f[(p,q1,r1)] = None

# Iterate updates on f:
for it in range(max_iters):
    updated = False
    for p in range(1,max_n+1):
        for q1 in range(1,max_n+1):
            for r1 in range(1,max_n+1):
                if f[(p,q1,r1)] is None or it>0:  # if unknown or on iteration >0, try updating
                    # compute sum of neighbors if all defined else skip
                    neighbors = []
                    for dp,dq,dr in deltas:
                        np, nq, nr = p+dp, q1+dq, r1+dr
                        if np>=0 and nq>=0 and nr>=0 and np<=max_n and nq<=max_n and nr<=max_n:
                            val = f.get((np,nq,nr))
                            if val is None:
                                break
                            neighbors.append(val)
                        else:
                            break
                    else:  # if break not triggered
                        # if any coord zero neighbors not possible by boundary, but we allow zero coords neighbors
                        new_val = Fraction(1) + sum(neighbors)/6
                        if f[(p,q1,r1)] != new_val:
                            f[(p,q1,r1)] = new_val
                            updated = True
    if not updated:
        break

# Print results for interior points sorted by lex order, exact fractions
for p in range(max_n+1):
    for q1 in range(max_n+1):
        for r1 in range(max_n+1):
            if p==0 or q1==0 or r1==0:
                continue
            val = f[(p,q1,r1)]
            if val is not None:
                print(f"f({p},{q1},{r1}) = {val}")
```
This enumerates exact values for \(f(p,q,r)\) for small triples, aiding conjecture and understanding of the recursive formula.
