The problem involves finding real numbers \( x \) such that there exists a natural number \( k \) with \( k \le x < k+1 \), and the ratio \(\lfloor x \rfloor / x = \frac{2015}{2016}\). The floor of \( x \) must be \( k \), so the equation is \( k/x = 2015/2016 \), implying \( x = \frac{2016}{2015} k \).

Since \( x \in [k, k+1) \), we get the inequality \( k \le \frac{2016}{2015} k < k+1 \). This narrows down the possible \( k \).

We want to enumerate integers \( k \) and check whether \( \frac{2016}{2015} k \) lies in the interval \([k, k+1)\).

The answer looks like \(2015 + \text{fractional_part} \) of the largest such \( x \).

The program will search for values of \( k \) from 1 to a small upper bound, print all valid \( x \), then identify the maximum \( x \).

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# We want to find all k in a reasonable range such that
# k <= (2016/2015)*k < k+1

frac = Fraction(2015, 2016)
ratio = Fraction(2016, 2015)  # reciprocal of 2015/2016

max_k = 5000  # arbitrary upper bound to find candidates

candidates = []

for k in range(1, max_k):
    x = ratio * k  # x = (2016/2015)*k
    # Check if x in [k, k+1)
    if k <= x < k + 1:
        # floor(x) = k, and floor(x)/x = 2015/2016
        val = float(x)
        candidates.append((k, x))
        print(f"k={k}, x={x} ≈ {val:.8f}")

if candidates:
    max_candidate = max(candidates, key=lambda t: t[1])
    max_k, max_x = max_candidate
    fract_part = max_x - max_k
    print(f"\nMaximum x found at k={max_k}: x = {max_x} ≈ {float(max_x):.8f}")
    print(f"Fractional part = {fract_part} ≈ {float(fract_part):.8f}")
    sum_val = Fraction(2015) + fract_part
    print(f"Answer = 2015 + fractional_part = {sum_val} ≈ {float(sum_val):.8f}")
else:
    print("No candidates found.")
```
