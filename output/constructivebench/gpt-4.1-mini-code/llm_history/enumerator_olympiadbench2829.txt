The problem involves finding the greatest real number \(x\) such that \(\lfloor \frac{x}{3} \rfloor + \lceil 3x \rceil = \sqrt{11} x\). To assist in understanding this, we will enumerate real values \(x\) over some rational candidates with small denominators, compute the left side, and check how close it is to \(\sqrt{11} x\). We prioritize exact expressions where possible, and print candidates where equality holds or nearly holds.

```python
import math

sqrt11 = math.sqrt(11)

def floor_div_3(x):
    return math.floor(x / 3)

def ceil_mul_3(x):
    return math.ceil(3 * x)

# We'll try rationals x = n / d with small denominator d up to 20
max_denom = 20

print(f"Enumerating candidates for x = n/d with 1 <= d <= {max_denom}")

# To search around the expected range, analyze multiples of sqrt(11) ~ 3.3166
# Since floor(x/3) and ceil(3x) are integer, left side integer, right side real
# So x must be such that sqrt(11)*x is integer and equals floor(x/3)+ceil(3x)

# We'll print candidates where abs(lhs - rhs) < 1e-6 (numerical equality)

for d in range(1, max_denom+1):
    for n in range(-50, 51):  # test n/d in approx range [-2.5,2.5]
        x = n / d
        lhs = floor_div_3(x) + ceil_mul_3(x)
        rhs = sqrt11 * x
        diff = lhs - rhs
        if abs(diff) < 1e-7:
            print(f"x={n}/{d}={x:.6f}, floor(x/3)={floor_div_3(x)}, ceil(3x)={ceil_mul_3(x)}, sum={lhs}, sqrt(11)*x={rhs:.6f}")

# After printing candidates meeting approximate equality,
# we guess the greatest such x (roughly close to 3.3166),
# so print the maximal candidate found from above.
```
