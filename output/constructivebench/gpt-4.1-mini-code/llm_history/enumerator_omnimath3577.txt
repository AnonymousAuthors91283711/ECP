The problem is to find all quadruples of positive integers (x, y, z, t) such that

12^x + 13^y - 14^z = 2013^t.

We'll examine small ranges for x, y, z, t to find any exact solutions and print them immediately.

```python
# Enumerate positive integer quadruples (x,y,z,t) with small values,
# checking if 12^x + 13^y - 14^z == 2013^t.
# Print any exact matches found.

def main():
    max_val = 10  # check exponents up to 10 for feasibility
    # Precompute powers to speed up
    pow12 = [12**i for i in range(max_val+1)]
    pow13 = [13**i for i in range(max_val+1)]
    pow14 = [14**i for i in range(max_val+1)]
    pow2013 = [2013**i for i in range(max_val+1)]

    for x in range(1, max_val+1):
        px = pow12[x]
        for y in range(1, max_val+1):
            py = pow13[y]
            sum12_13 = px + py
            for z in range(1, max_val+1):
                pz = pow14[z]
                diff = sum12_13 - pz
                if diff <= 0:
                    continue
                for t in range(1, max_val+1):
                    p2013 = pow2013[t]
                    if diff == p2013:
                        print(f"Found solution: x={x}, y={y}, z={z}, t={t}, 12^{x}+13^{y}-14^{z}={diff}=2013^{t}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
