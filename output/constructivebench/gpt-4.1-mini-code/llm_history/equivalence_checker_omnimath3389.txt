Ground Truth Answer: fun x => 1 - (sin (2^2011 * x))^2 / (4^2011 * (sin x)^2)
Proposed Answer: fun x : ℝ => 1 - (sin (2^(2011) * x))^2 / ((4^(2011)) * (sin x)^2)
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is exactly equivalent to the ground truth answer. The only differences are purely syntactic (parentheses around exponents and multiplication), but mathematically they represent the same function. Both expressions compute 1 minus the squared sine of 2^2011 times x, divided by 4^2011 times the squared sine of x. The additional parentheses in the proposed answer don't change the mathematical meaning.
