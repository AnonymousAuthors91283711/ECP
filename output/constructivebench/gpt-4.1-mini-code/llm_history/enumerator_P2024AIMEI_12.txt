The problem is asking for the number of real numbers \( x \) such that
\[
|\ |x| - \frac{1}{2} | = |\ |x| - \frac{1}{4} |.
\]
We want to find the number of solutions to this equation.

Since the equation depends on \(|x|\), it's natural to rewrite \(y = |x|\), where \(y \geq 0\), and solve for \(y\):
\[
|y - \tfrac{1}{2}| = |y - \tfrac{1}{4}|,
\]
which we can solve for \(y \geq 0\). Then each solution \(y > 0\) corresponds to two values of \(x\): \(x = y\) and \(x = -y\), and if \(y=0\) is a solution, there is only one \(x=0\).

This script enumerates candidate \(y\) values by examining piecewise solutions and prints all corresponding \(x\) values. It also counts the solutions without hardcoding the answer.

```python
# Solve | |x| - 1/2 | = | |x| - 1/4 | by setting y = |x| >= 0.
# For y, the equation becomes |y - 0.5| = |y - 0.25|.
# Solve for y analytically, then expand back to x.

def main():
    candidates_y = set()

    # Solve |y - a| = |y - b| for a=0.5, b=0.25, y >= 0.
    # This is equivalent to distance from y to a equals distance from y to b.
    # Solutions: y is midpoint or y is outside segment between a and b at points equidistant.
    # The set of y where |y - 0.5| = |y-0.25| is the midpoint y=0.375.
    # But let's enumerate points systematically.

    # The points where the absolute value expressions change definition are at y=0.25 and y=0.5.
    # Consider intervals [0,0.25], (0.25,0.5), (0.5, ∞)
    # On each interval, the expressions inside abs differ in sign.

    a, b = 0.5, 0.25

    # Case 1: y <= 0.25
    # |y-0.5| = 0.5 - y
    # |y-0.25| = 0.25 - y
    # Equation: 0.5 - y = 0.25 - y -> 0.5 - y = 0.25 - y -> 0.5=0.25 (False)
    # No solution here.

    # Case 2: 0.25 < y <= 0.5
    # |y-0.5|=0.5 - y
    # |y-0.25|=y - 0.25
    # Equation: 0.5 - y = y - 0.25 -> 0.5 +0.25 = y + y -> 0.75 = 2y -> y=0.375
    # Check y in (0.25,0.5]? Yes, 0.375 in (0.25,0.5) -> solution y=0.375
    candidates_y.add(0.375)

    # Case 3: y > 0.5
    # |y-0.5|= y - 0.5
    # |y-0.25|= y - 0.25
    # Equation: y - 0.5 = y - 0.25 -> -0.5 = -0.25 (False)
    # No solution here.

    # Check y=0.25
    # |0.25-0.5|=0.25, |0.25-0.25|=0 -> Not equal
    # No solution

    # Check y=0.5
    # |0.5-0.5|=0, |0.5-0.25|=0.25 -> Not equal
    # No solution

    # Check y=0 (could theoretically work)
    # |0-0.5|=0.5, |0-0.25|=0.25 -> Not equal
    # No

    # So solutions for y are {0.375}

    # For each y>0, solutions for x are ±y
    # For y=0, solution is x=0

    answers = []
    for y in candidates_y:
        # Add both +y and -y
        answers.append(y)
        answers.append(-y)

    # Sort answers
    answers.sort()

    for x in answers:
        print(f"x = {x}")

    print(f"Number of solutions: {len(answers)}")
