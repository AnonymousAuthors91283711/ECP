The problem is to find a real number \( t \geq 0 \) such that \(18t + 12t = 45\), and then determine the value \(18t\).

From the equation:
\[
18t + 12t = 30t = 45 \implies t = \frac{45}{30} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5
\]
Then:
\[
18t = 18 \times 1.5 = 27
\]

To assist with conjecturing, I'll write a Python program that iterates over possible \( t \) values starting from 0 up to 5 with small increments, checking if \(18t + 12t = 45\) approximately and printing the corresponding \(18t\).

```python
# Enumerate t values from 0 to 5 in increments of 0.1
# Check if 18*t + 12*t == 45 approximately
# Print each t and corresponding 18*t when condition is met approximately

def is_close(a, b, eps=1e-9):
    return abs(a - b) < eps

for i in range(51):
    t = i * 0.1
    val = 18 * t + 12 * t
    if is_close(val, 45):
        print(f"t = {t}, 18*t = {18*t}")

# Try exact rational solution
from fractions import Fraction
t_exact = Fraction(45, 30)
print(f"Exact t = {float(t_exact)}, 18*t = {18 * float(t_exact)}")
```
This enumerates possible approximate solutions and also prints the exact rational solution.
