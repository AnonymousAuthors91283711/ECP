This problem asks for the probability that the line segment between two uniformly chosen points in the pentomino-shaped set lies entirely within the set. To assist in conjecturing the exact value, we enumerate pairs of points in a discretized version of the pentomino and check if the entire linear interpolation between them remains inside. We print each pair and whether it is "good" or not as the partial results, then estimate and print the ratio. Since exact real sets and infinite points aren't possible in code, we approximate with grids of points within each region.

```python
# Enumerate pairs of points in a discretized pentomino and check if the line segment between them lies within
# the pentomino. Print each pair status and final ratio to assist with conjecture.

def in_pentomino(x, y):
    # Check if (x,y) lies in the pentomino union of rectangles:
    # (0,1)x(1,2), (1,2)x(0,3), (2,3)x(1,2), (-1,0)x(1,2)
    in1 = (0 <= x <= 1) and (1 <= y <= 2)
    in2 = (1 <= x <= 2) and (0 <= y <= 3)
    in3 = (2 <= x <= 3) and (1 <= y <= 2)
    in4 = (-1 <= x <= 0) and (1 <= y <= 2)
    return in1 or in2 or in3 or in4

def check_segment(p1, p2, steps=10):
    # Check if all points on the segment from p1 to p2 are inside pentomino at steps intervals
    for t in [i/steps for i in range(steps+1)]:
        x = t*p1[0] + (1-t)*p2[0]
        y = t*p1[1] + (1-t)*p2[1]
        if not in_pentomino(x,y):
            return False
    return True

def main():
    # We take points on a 0.5 grid in [-1,3]x[0,3], focused on pentomino ranges for efficiency
    xs = [ -1 + 0.5*i for i in range(9) ]  # -1 to 3
    ys = [ 0 + 0.5*i for i in range(7) ]   # 0 to 3
    points = [(x,y) for x in xs for y in ys if in_pentomino(x,y)]

    total = 0
    good = 0
    for i, p1 in enumerate(points):
        for j, p2 in enumerate(points):
            total += 1
            ok = check_segment(p1, p2)
            if ok:
                good += 1
                print(f"Good segment between {p1} and {p2}")
            else:

    print(f"Estimated ratio of good pairs: {ratio:.4f}")
