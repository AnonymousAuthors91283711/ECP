The problem involves a sum over j from 1 to 2014 of terms involving powers and products that are somewhat factorial-like but with high powers in the denominators. To get insight, we test smaller values of the range (like n=1,2,3,4) to see if the sum pattern can be recognized, then conjecture the closed form or the value.

The code outputs exact rationals when possible, printing partial results immediately for each n and j. This helps us conjecture about the general sum.

```python
from math import prod
from fractions import Fraction

def term(n, j):
    # Compute the denominator product for fixed n, j
    p = Fraction(1, (j+1)**n)
    indices = [i for i in range(n) if i != j]
    denom_product = Fraction(1, 1)
    base_j = (j+1)**n
    for i in indices:
        base_i = (i+1)**n
        denom_product *= (base_i - base_j)
    return p / denom_product

max_n = 6  # test from small n up to 6 to manage output size

for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
    print(f"n = {n}")
    total = Fraction(0, 1)
    for j in range(n):
        val = term(n, j)
        total += val
        print(f" j={j+1}, term = {val}")
    print(f" sum = {total}")
    print()
```
