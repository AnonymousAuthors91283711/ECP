The problem involves three distinct primes p, q, r satisfying certain linear equations involving p, q, r and A. We need to find A such that the given equalities hold. We will enumerate small primes p, q, r, check the conditions and compute A accordingly.

```python
from sympy import primerange, Eq, solve

# Enumerate distinct primes p,q,r among small primes
primes = list(primerange(2, 20))

# Given equalities:
# 2*p*q*r + 50*p*q = 7*p*q*r + 55*p*r
# 7*p*q*r + 55*p*r = 8*p*q*r + 12*q*r
#
# From these, we want to find A satisfying the problem condition.
# The target is to find A such that A = omnimath1687_answer,
# under these constraints.
#
# We note that hA involves those equalities. We'll try to find p,q,r
# triples that satisfy both equalities exactly.

for i, p in enumerate(primes):
    for j, q in enumerate(primes):
        if q == p:
            continue
        for k, r in enumerate(primes):
            if r == p or r == q:
                continue

            # Check if conditions hold
            lhs1 = 2 * p * q * r + 50 * p * q
            mid = 7 * p * q * r + 55 * p * r
            rhs1 = mid
            lhs2 = mid
            rhs2 = 8 * p * q * r + 12 * q * r

            if lhs1 == rhs1 == rhs2:
                # From the problem, A is involved in the theorem but unknown.
                # Let's try to compute A from the relationship or output p,q,r and these values.
                print(f"Found primes p={p}, q={q}, r={r}, with equalities value {lhs1}")
                # Print A candidates from the equalities if possible.
