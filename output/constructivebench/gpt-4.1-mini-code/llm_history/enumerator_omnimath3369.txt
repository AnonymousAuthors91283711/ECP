The problem is to find how many natural numbers \( n \) satisfying \( 0 < n \leq 100 \) can be represented as the greatest common divisor of \( a^2 \) and \( b^3 \) for some positive integers \( a, b \).

We need to enumerate all \( n \leq 100 \) for which there exist positive \( a,b \) such that \( n = \gcd(a^2, b^3) \).

Note:
- \( a^2 \) and \( b^3 \) are perfect square and cube respectively.
- The gcd will be composed of prime factors with exponents being the minimum of exponents in \( a^2 \) and \( b^3 \).

Key insight:
- Prime factorization of \( a^2 \) has even exponents.
- Prime factorization of \( b^3 \) has exponents divisible by 3.
- \(\gcd(a^2, b^3)\) prime exponents are \(\min(2x, 3y)\) where \(x,y \geq 0\).

So each prime factor exponent in \(n\) is an integer \(e\) such that \(e = \min(2x, 3y)\) for some \(x,y \geq 0\).

Possible values of \(e\) are the nonnegative integers that can be realized as min of an even number and a multiple of 3.

Because \(a,b>0\), positive exponents must be positive integers meeting \(e = \min(2x,3y)\).

For nonzero exponents, by varying \(x,y\), the set of possible exponents \(e\) are all nonnegative integers that either are multiples of 2 or 3, or numbers where the min of the two sequences 0,2,4,... and 0,3,6,... coincides.

Ellaborating, the exponents \(e\) that appear are those integers that lie in the intersection of the sequences of 2x and 3y exponent values where \(x,y\) are integers, or more generally the minimum of these two sequences.

To determine the possible gcd \(n\) we factor each \(n\) and check if for every prime factor exponent \(e\), \(e\) can be written as \(\min(2x,3y)\) for some integers \(x,y\geq0\).

We will write a python script to enumerate \(n\) from 1 to 100, factor \(n\), and test if each prime exponent \(e\) satisfies the condition.

If yes, print \(n\).

At the end, count all such \(n\).

    # Since min(2x,3y)=e <=> 2x>=e and 3y>=e and one of 2x or 3y = e
    # Iterate possible y and see if (e % 3 == 0 and e <= 2*(e//3))

                return True
            # If 3y == e but e odd, no integer x possible
            # If 3y > e but e odd, no 2x = e
            # Another case: 3y == e and 2x > e (x>e/2)
            # min is e means one equals e, so check if 3y == e or 2x == e
            
            # Check if min is 3y = e, then 2x must be >= e

                return True

```
This program enumerates all possible \( n \leq 100 \) that can appear as \(\gcd(a^2, b^3)\). It prints all satisfying \(n\) and the total count at the end. This will assist in conjecturing the full set and proving the theorem.
