The problem considers the average number of divisors of numbers from 1 to 100, normalized by the count of divisors and the size of the set 1 to 100. We want to enumerate the sums involved to conjecture the exact value.

```python
def divisors(n):
    # Return the set of divisors of n
    divs = set()
    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divs.add(i)
            divs.add(n // i)
    return divs

N = 100
D = set(divisors(N))  # divisors of 100
Z = range(1, N+1)

total = 0
count_D = len(D)
count_Z = N

print(f"Divisors of {N}: {sorted(D)}")
print(f"Number of divisors: {count_D}")
print(f"Number of numbers in Z: {count_Z}")

# For each divisor d in D, count how many numbers in Z are divisible by d
for d in sorted(D):
    divisible_count = 0
    # Numbers in Z divisible by d are multiples of d up to N
    divisible_count = N // d
    total += divisible_count
    print(f"d={d}: count divisible = {divisible_count}, partial sum = {total}")

average = total / (count_D * count_Z)
print(f"\nFinal value = total / (|D|*|Z|) = {total}/{count_D}*{count_Z} = {average}")
```
