The problem seeks the largest size \(k\) of a subset \(T\) of the grid \(\{1, \dots, 1993\} \times \{1, \dots, 4\}\) with no quadruple of points forming a specific rectangle configuration involving equal distances.

To experiment, I will enumerate subsets in smaller grids (e.g., up to 6 by 4) and try to find sets without the forbidden configuration, printing large subsets found. This helps conjecture the maximal size \(k\).

```python
from itertools import product, combinations
# Checks if four points form the forbidden rectangle configuration
def forbidden_quad(a,b,c,d):
    # Conditions from problem:
    # a.1 = b.1, a.2 = c.2, b.2 = d.2, c.1 = d.1
    # dist(a,b) = dist(a,c) = dist(b,d) = dist(c,d)
    (x1,y1),(x2,y2),(x3,y3),(x4,y4) = a,b,c,d
    if not (x1 == x2 and y1 == y3 and y2 == y4 and x3 == x4):
        return False
    d_ab = abs(y1 - y2)
    d_ac = abs(x1 - x3)
    d_bd = abs(x2 - x4)
    d_cd = abs(y3 - y4)
    return d_ab == d_ac == d_bd == d_cd and d_ab > 0

# Enumerate subsets in smaller grids to find large sets without forbidden quads
def test_grid(n,m):
    points = list(product(range(1,n+1), range(1,m+1)))
    max_found = 0
    # We'll try all subsets of size up to threshold (here 8 for time)
    from time import time
    start = time()
    for size in range(1,9):
        # comb = combinations(points,size)
        for T in combinations(points,size):
            # Check forbidden quads in T
            forbidden = False
            for quad in combinations(T,4):
                if forbidden_quad(*quad):
                    forbidden = True
                    break
            if not forbidden:
                if size > max_found:
                    max_found = size
                    print(f"Grid {n}x{m}: Found size {max_found} safe set: {T}")
        # Timeout to avoid long runtimes
        if time()-start>5:
            print("Timeout")
            break
    print(f"Grid {n}x{m} max safe set size found: {max_found}")

# Try smaller sample grids as per requirement:
for (n,m) in [(4,4),(5,4),(6,4)]:
    print(f"Testing grid {n}x{m}")
    test_grid(n,m)
```
