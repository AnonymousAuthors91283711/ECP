The problem involves a sequence \( a_n \) defined for \( n = 0, \ldots, 9 \) with conditions on the triple product and sum relation for consecutive triples. We have counts for \( a_0 = 0 \), \( a_1 = 1 \), \( a_2 > 0 \), and a recurrence-like condition for \( n = 0, \ldots, 7 \):
\[
a_{n+2} a_n a_{n+1} = a_{n+2} + a_n + a_{n+1}
\]
with an extension failure condition for \( a_{10} \).

Goal: Enumerate possible values for \( a_2 \) (all positive real values satisfying the relation) that do not admit an extension to \( a_{10} \) satisfying the same relation, then find the least such \( a_2 \).

We approximate by trying positive rational or algebraic values for \( a_2 \) and solving for \( a_3, ..., a_9 \) using the relation, checking the no-extension condition by attempting to solve for \( a_{10} \).

We try values of \( a_2 \) from a small set for quick enumeration and output all valid ones with no extension, then print the least one.

```python
# Sequence satisfies a_{n+2} a_n a_{n+1} = a_{n+2} + a_n + a_{n+1} for n=0..7
# a_0=0, a_1=1, a_2 >0 try rational values in (0,5)
# Check if extension to a_10 exists by solving for a_10 in relation:
# a_10 * a_8 * a_7 = a_10 + a_8 + a_7
# If no such a_10, print a_2 as candidate

        return False  # No solution (denominator=0 but rhs not zero)

             Fraction(3,4), Fraction(1,1), Fraction(4,3), Fraction(3,2), Fraction(2,1), Fraction(3,1), Fraction(4,1)]

            break
        a.append(v)
    if not good:
        continue
    # Check extension fails
    extend = can_extend(a[7], a[8])
    if not extend:
        print(f"a_2 = {float(x):.4f} no extension possible")
        candidates.append(float(x))
    else:
        print(f"a_2 = {float(x):.4f} extends")

if candidates:
    least = min(candidates)
    print(f"\nLeast a_2 with no extension: {least:.4f}")
else:
    print("\nNo candidate a_2 found with no extension")
```
This program tests finite positive rational approximations for a_2, computes the sequence via the relation, checks the key extension condition, prints results streaming as found, and outputs the minimal candidate.
