The problem is to count the number of functions \( f: \{0,\ldots,5\} \times \{0,\ldots,5\} \to \{0,1\} \) such that for every row \(i\), exactly 2 entries are 0, and for every column \(j\), exactly 2 entries are 0.

This is equivalent to counting 0-1 matrices of size 6x6 with exactly two 0s in every row and column (and the rest are 1s).

The problem is a classical combinatorial enumeration related to \(6 \times 6\) (0-1)-matrices with prescribed row and column sums equal to 2 (zeros). Since there are six rows and each has 2 zeros, total zeros are \(6 \times 2 = 12\). Similarly, columns have 2 zeros each, consistent.

Such matrices correspond to bi-regular bipartite graphs with degree 2 on each side or equivalently the enumeration of 2-regular bipartite graphs between two sets of size 6.

A 2-regular bipartite graph on \(2 \times 6\) vertices is a disjoint union of cycles covering all vertices, since each vertex degree is 2.

Therefore, the number of such matrices equals the number of 2-factors (2-regular spanning subgraphs) of the complete bipartite graph \(K_{6,6}\).

We will enumerate all possible cycle decompositions of the bipartite graph vertices into even cycles (all cycles in bipartite graphs are even length).

Maximum cycle length is 12 (covering all vertices).

Cycles must have length multiples of 2, minimum 4 since we want degree 2 at every vertex.

We will enumerate partitions of 12 into even parts >=4.

Each such cycle corresponds to a cycle cover block in the bipartite graph; the number of 2-factors equals sum over all cycle decompositions of product of number of ways to realize each cycle.

The count of possible 2-factors in \(K_{n,n}\) with degree 2 is known combinatorially but complicated. Here we pick 6 as a sample.

We use a simplified brute force approach: we generate all 0-1 matrices with row sums=2 zeros and count those with column sums=2 zeros too.

Since this direct enumeration is huge \(\binom{6}{2}^6 = 15^6 = 11390625\), too big to brute force fully, we will generate only some samples and print count estimates or known cycle type enumerations to guess the number.

We'll enumerate tuples of 6 subsets of size 2 (rows), then count how many satisfy column sum 2 zeros.

Let's implement partial enumeration with early pruning to list some answers.


```python
from itertools import combinations, product

n = 6
row_zero_positions = list(combinations(range(n), 2))  # all ways to pick zero positions per row

count = 0
max_print = 10  # limit output for brevity

print(f"Enumerating functions f: [6]x[6]->[2] with 2 zeros per row and column...")

for rows in product(row_zero_positions, repeat=n):
    # Count zero in each column
    col_counts = [0]*n
    for r in range(n):
        for c in rows[r]:
            col_counts[c] +=1
    if all(c == 2 for c in col_counts):
        count += 1
        if count <= max_print:
            print(f"Valid matrix zero positions per row: {rows}")
print(f"Total valid matrices found (up to max_print): {min(count, max_print)}; total count so far: {count}")
```
This program enumerates some valid configurations with exact counts for a sample of size 6 and prints early results immediately after found. It is a starting point for conjecturing the total count.
