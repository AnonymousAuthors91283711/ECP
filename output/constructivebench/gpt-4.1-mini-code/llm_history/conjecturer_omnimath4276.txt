theorem omnimath4276 (x y : ℕ) (hx : Nat.Prime x) (hy : Nat.Prime y) :
    x^y - y^x = x * y^2 - 19 ↔ (x, y) ∈ omnimath4276_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Checking pairs (x,y) of primes with x,y in primes:
Solution found: x=2, y=3, x^y - y^x = -1, x*y^2 - 19 = -1
Solution found: x=2, y=7, x^y - y^x = 79, x*y^2 - 19 = 79. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ)
