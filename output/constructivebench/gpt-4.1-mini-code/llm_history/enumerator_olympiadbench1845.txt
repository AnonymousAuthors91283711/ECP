The problem involves finding the supremum \( a \) such that for every strictly increasing sequence \( x_i \) with \( x_0 = 0 \), the given inequality holds. We want to guess or conjecture the value of \( a \).

The inequality is:

\[
\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \frac{1}{x_{i+1} - x_i} \geq a \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \frac{i+2}{x_{i+1}}
\]

We fix \( n \), try various monotone increasing sequences \( x \) with \( x_0=0 \), compute left and right sums, and compute ratio:

\[
R := \frac{\sum 1/(x_{i+1} - x_i)}{\sum (i+2)/x_{i+1}}
\]

For the inequality to hold for all \( x \), \( a \) must be less than or equal to \(\min R\) over all such \( x \).

We try small \( n=2,3,4 \), small sequences \( x_i \) increasing from 0 with positive real values, sample values to approximate min \( R \). Print each ratio from each \( x \) tried.

We focus on exact fractions, so use fractions from `fractions.Fraction`.

The code uses brute force sampling for small sequences and prints all ratios found.

```python
from fractions import Fraction
from itertools import product

# Enumerate increasing sequences x with x0=0 and x1,x2,... positive increasing fractions
# For fixed n, try x_i from grid points, e.g. multiples of 1/10 from 1 to 5

def increasing_sequences(n, steps=10, max_val=5):
    # yields sequences (x0=0, x1, ..., x_n), increasing positive
    positions = [Fraction(i, steps) for i in range(1, max_val*steps+1)]
    # generate increasing sequences of length n with x0=0
    # x is length n, so indices 0..n-1, but we consider x0=0 fixed outside
    # Actually x in problem has n terms x0,..x_{n-1}, but sums run to n-1 indexes

    # For problem sum i in [0..n-1], x has length n (x0 to x_{n-1})
    # We fix x0=0, then choose x1,... x_{n-1} increasing

    # So total length = n, first=0 fixed

    # For i>0 pick increasing positions in positions list

    def backtrack(prefix, start_idx, depth):
        if depth == n-1:
            yield [Fraction(0)] + prefix
            return
        for i in range(start_idx, len(positions)):
            if not prefix or positions[i] > prefix[-1]:
                backseq = prefix + [positions[i]]
                yield from backtrack(backseq, i+1, depth+1)

    yield from backtrack([],0,0)
