Ground Truth Answer: 4^7
Proposed Answer: 16384
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem presents a disjunction of 5 possibilities where a natural number squared equals various exponential expressions.

2. The ground truth answer is 4^7, which evaluates to 16384 (since 4^7 = (2^2)^7 = 2^14 = 16384).

3. The proposed answer is exactly 16384, which is the evaluated form of 4^7.

4. Therefore, the proposed answer is exactly equivalent to the ground truth answer, just in a different form (evaluated vs. unevaluated exponential expression).

5. Both represent the same mathematical truth that 128^2 = 16384 (since 128^2 = (2^7)^2 = 2^14 = 16384 = 4^7).
