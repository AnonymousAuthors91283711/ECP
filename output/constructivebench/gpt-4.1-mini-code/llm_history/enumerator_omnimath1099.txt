We want to verify and explore probabilities related to catching a train within some minutes with given probabilities p = 3/4 * 1/4 = 3/16 per minute, q = 1 - p = 13/16. The problem states the probability of not catching the train in 5 minutes is q^5 = (13/16)^5, and probability of catching at least once within 5 minutes is 1 - q^5. The goal is to confirm these values and enumerate the probabilities for up to 5 minutes.

We will enumerate cumulative probabilities for catching the train from 1 to 5 minutes using exact fractions and print results. This will help conjecture the expressions.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def catch_probabilities(max_minutes=5):
    p = Fraction(3,4) * Fraction(1,4)  # 3/16
    q = 1 - p  # 13/16
    print(f"p (catch probability per minute) = {p}")
    print(f"q (no catch probability per minute) = {q}\n")
    for minutes in range(1, max_minutes+1):
        no_catch_prob = q ** minutes
        catch_prob = 1 - no_catch_prob
        print(f"Minutes = {minutes}:")
        print(f"  Probability no catch = {no_catch_prob} ≈ {float(no_catch_prob):.6f}")
        print(f"  Probability catch at least once = {catch_prob} ≈ {float(catch_prob):.6f}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    catch_probabilities()
```
