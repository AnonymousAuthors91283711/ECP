Ground Truth Answer: 112
Proposed Answer: 2
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem defines a recursive sequence modulo 11 and asks for the product of three specific terms (2018, 2020, 2022).

2. The ground truth answer is 112, which suggests this is the actual product of these terms modulo 11 (since 112 mod 11 = 2, but 112 is likely the direct product).

3. The proposed answer is 2, which would be the result modulo 11.

4. The answers are not equivalent as stated, but the proposed answer is correct modulo 11 while the ground truth appears to be the actual product before modulo reduction.
