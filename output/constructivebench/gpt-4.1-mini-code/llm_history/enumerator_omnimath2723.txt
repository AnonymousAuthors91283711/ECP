The problem defines four natural numbers \(a, b, c, d\) such that their sum is 120, and they form an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 6: \(b = a + 6\), \(c = b + 6\), \(d = c + 6\). We want to find the value of \(d\).

This is a straightforward arithmetic problem: From the conditions, \(b = a + 6\), \(c = a + 12\), \(d = a + 18\), and their sum is \(a + (a+6) + (a+12) + (a+18) = 4a + 36 = 120\). Hence \(4a = 84\) and \(a = 21\). Then \(d = 21 + 18 = 39\).

I'll write a Python enumerator that iterates over possible values of \(a\) to find integer solutions satisfying \(a + (a+6) + (a+12) + (a+18) = 120\), printing all found answers immediately. It will confirm the computed value of \(d\).

```python
# Enumerate possible values of a, b, c, d with sum 120 and b=a+6, c=b+6, d=c+6
# Print all solutions found, then print the value of d.

def main():
    total = 120
    diff = 6
    # Try all integer values of a from 0 up to 120
    for a in range(total + 1):
        b = a + diff
        c = b + diff
        d = c + diff
        if a + b + c + d == total:
            print(f"Found solution: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}")
            print(f"Value of d: {d}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
