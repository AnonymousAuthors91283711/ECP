Ground Truth Answer: {1, (3 + sqrt 21)/2, (3 - sqrt 21)/2}
Proposed Answer: {1, (3 - Real.log 3 / Real.log (27)) , (3 + Real.log 3 / Real.log (27))}
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

1. First, let's simplify the ground truth answer:
   - The solutions are x = 1, x = (3 ± √21)/2

2. Now examine the proposed answer:
   - The first solution x=1 matches
   - The other solutions are expressed in terms of logarithms: (3 ± (log 3 / log 27))

3. Let's simplify the logarithmic expression:
   - logₐb = ln b / ln a
   - log 3 / log 27 = log₂₇3 (change of base formula)
   - 27 = 3³, so log₂₇3 = 1/3
   - Therefore, (3 ± (log 3 / log 27)) = (3 ± 1/3)

4. Compare with ground truth:
   - (3 + √21)/2 ≈ (3 + 4.583)/2 ≈ 3.7915
   - (3 + 1/3) = 3.333...
   - These are clearly different values

The proposed answer incorrectly represents the solutions using logarithms when the actual solutions involve square roots. The logarithmic expression simplifies to rational numbers that don't match the irrational solutions in the ground truth.
