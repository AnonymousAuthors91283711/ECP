theorem omnimath3666 : 
  IsGreatest {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ ∀ k, 0 < k → k ≤ n / 2 → ∃ d₁ d₂, d₁ ∣ n ∧ d₂ ∣ n ∧ d₂ - d₁ = k} omnimath3666_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n=1 has all differences k in 1..0
n=2 has all differences k in 1..1
n=4 has all differences k in 1..2
n=6 has all differences k in 1..3
n=8 has all differences k in 1..4
n=12 has all differences k in 1..6
n=18 has all differences k in 1..9
n=24 has all differences k in 1..12
Greatest n found with the property up to 10000 is 24. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<24>>>
