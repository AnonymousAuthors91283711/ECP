The problem asks to evaluate the product over k from 0 to 350 of \(k^3 - (350 - k)\). Since \(k\) ranges from 0 up to 350, and the expression inside involves cubes and linear terms, it's feasible to compute this product directly in Python for small values and look for patterns or notable zero factors.

Important: The product is over k in range 351, meaning k = 0 to 350 inclusive.

Check for terms where the factor is zero, which immediately makes the product zero.

Let's write a program that:

- Prints the value of each factor \(k^3 - (350 - k)\)
- Identify zero factors
- Since the product for the full range might be huge, confirm if there's any zero factor

We'll print the factors for k in 0..350 inclusive.

Because the output limit is tight, we'll stop printing after finding a zero factor.

```python
# Enumerate factors k^3 - (350 - k) for k in [0..350]
# Print each factor immediately
# Stop on first factor == 0

def main():
    N = 350
    product = 1
    zero_found = False
    for k in range(N + 1):
        val = k**3 - (N - k)
        print(f"k={k}, factor={val}")
        if val == 0:
            print(f"Zero factor found at k={k}, product is zero.")
            zero_found = True
            break
        product *= val
    if not zero_found:
        print("No zero factors found; product is", product)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
