The problem seems to involve a function \( f: \mathbb{N} \times X \to \text{Option} \), where for each natural number \( n \), the set of \( x \) with \( f(n,x) \neq \text{none} \) is considered. We want to find the greatest \( N \) such that \( f(N, x) \neq \text{none} \) for some \( x \), and a corresponding real number \( c \) so that \( \{x \mid f(N,x) \neq \text{none}\} = \{c\} \) and \( N + c = \) some constant.

Without explicit details of \( f \), we can try to simulate a function \( f \) with small parameters to investigate possible pairs \((N, c)\) that satisfy the conditions. We'll define some sample \( f(n, x) \) functions and enumerate \( N, c \) pairs.

We enumerate pairs by inspecting natural \( n \) up to some limit, and for each \( n \), find if the set \( \{ x \mid f(n,x) \neq \text{none} \} \) reduces to a unique \( c \). When such a unique \( c \) exists, print \( n, c, n+c \).

This will aid conjecture about the solution.

```python
# Enumerates candidate (N, c) pairs for the property:
# For each n, find the set S_n = { x | f(n,x) != None }.
# If S_n is a singleton {c}, print n, c, and n+c.

# We consider sample f functions; here we take one example,
# f(n,x) = None if x < n or x > n+1, else f(n,x) = x
# So the set S_n is [n, n+1]; singleton only if n = n (?)
# To try variations, we test a few functions.

from fractions import Fraction

def f1(n, x):
    # Example function: returns x if x == n else None
    return x if x == n else None

def f2(n, x):
    # returns x if x == n or x == n+1, else None
    return x if x == n or x == n+1 else None

def f3(n, x):
    # returns x if x == Fraction(1, n+1) else None (fractional c)
    return x if x == Fraction(1, n+1) else None

def enumerate_f(f, nmax=10):
    for n in range(nmax+1):
        # Consider x in a small range near n
        candidates = []
        # Try possible x in [0, n+2] including fractions with denominator up to 5
        xs = []
        for i in range(n+3):
            xs.append(i)
        # Also rationals fraction(1..5)/(1..5) to get fractional values
        for denom in range(1,6):
            for numer in range(1, denom+1):
                xs.append(Fraction(numer, denom))
        # Collect x where f(n,x) != None
        S = set()
        for x in xs:
            if f(n,x) is not None:
                S.add(x)
        if len(S)==1:
            c = S.pop()
            print(f"n={n}, c={c}, n+c={n + float(c)}")
