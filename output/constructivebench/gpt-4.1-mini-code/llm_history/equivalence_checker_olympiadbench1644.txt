Ground Truth Answer: fun m n => m * n - (m / 2)
Proposed Answer: fun m n => m * 2 * n
Let me analyze the problem and compare the answers:

1. The problem involves counting maximum non-overlapping domino placements on a grid with specific constraints, including:
   - m ≤ n condition
   - Forced placements for j < n
   - Complex non-overlapping conditions

2. Ground truth answer: m * n - (m / 2)
   - This suggests a linear relationship with adjustment for even/odd m
   - The m/2 term accounts for some reduction based on parity

3. Proposed answer: m * 2 * n
   - This is simply doubling m*n without any adjustment
   - Doesn't account for the constraints that reduce the maximum count

The proposed answer is clearly different from the ground truth:
- For m=2, n=2:
  - Ground truth: 2*2 - (2/2) = 3
  - Proposed: 2*2*2 = 8
- For m=3, n=3:
  - Ground truth: 3*3 - (3/2) = 9-1 = 8
  - Proposed: 3*2*3 = 18

The proposed answer overcounts significantly and doesn't match the ground truth's behavior.
