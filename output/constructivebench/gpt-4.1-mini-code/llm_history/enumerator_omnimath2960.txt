The problem concerns four consecutive integers \(p, q, r, s\) such that \(q = p+1\), \(r = q+1\), \(s = r+1\), and their first and last sum \(p + s = 109\). We want to find \(q + r\).

Since the problem uses integer values and simple arithmetic constraints, we can enumerate possible \(p, q, r, s\) for small values of \(p\), check the sum condition \(p + s = 109\), and then calculate \(q + r\).

```python
# Enumerate integers p to find p, q, r, s consecutive with p + s = 109
# Then print q + r for each valid set

def main():
    # Since p + s = p + (p + 3) = 109, p can be from -100 to 110 to be safe
    for p in range(-100, 110):
        q = p + 1
        r = q + 1
        s = r + 1
        if p + s == 109:
            qr = q + r
            print(f"p={p}, q={q}, r={r}, s={s} => q+r={qr}")

    # From the constraint p + s = 109 => p + (p+3) = 109 => 2p + 3 = 109 => 2p =106 => p=53
    # Then q=54, r=55, s=56, and q+r=109
    print("=> Final answer: 109")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
