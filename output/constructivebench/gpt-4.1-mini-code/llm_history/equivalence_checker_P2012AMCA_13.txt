Ground Truth Answer: 48
Proposed Answer: 360
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem describes a painting scenario over three days with different working times and painting rates.

2. The ground truth answer is 48 minutes, which means:
   - Monday work time: 480 - 48 = 432 minutes
   - Tuesday work time: 372 - 48 = 324 minutes
   - Wednesday work time: 672 - 48 = 624 minutes

3. The proposed answer is 360 minutes, which would mean:
   - Monday work time: 480 - 360 = 120 minutes
   - Tuesday work time: 372 - 360 = 12 minutes
   - Wednesday work time: 672 - 360 = 312 minutes

4. Checking the Wednesday equation with proposed answer:
   p * 312 = 1/2 ⇒ p = 1/624
   Then Monday equation: (1/624 + h1 + h2)*120 = 1/2
   Tuesday equation: (h1 + h2)*12 = 24/100 ⇒ h1 + h2 = 2/100 = 1/50
   Substituting into Monday: (1/624 + 1/50)*120 ≈ (0.0016 + 0.02)*120 ≈ 2.6 ≠ 0.5
   This doesn't satisfy the Monday equation.

The proposed answer of 360 doesn't satisfy all the given conditions, while the ground truth answer of 48 does. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
