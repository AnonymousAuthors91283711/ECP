The problem involves sets of integers bounded between -a and b (a,b > 0) and finding the smallest cardinality m for which every subset s of size m in that range contains three distinct elements whose sum is zero.

The program below:
- Enumerates small values of a, b (say 1 to 3)
- For each (a,b), enumerates subsets of integers from -a to b and checks if they contain 3 distinct elements summing to zero
- Finds the minimum subset size m for which all subsets of that size contain such a triple
- Prints intermediate results and the minimal m for each (a,b)

This helps conjecture the answer by examining which minimal m works for each range.

```python
# Enumerate minimal m for which every subset of size m of integers in [-a, b]
# contains distinct x,y,z with x+y+z=0.

from itertools import combinations

def has_zero_sum_triple(s):
    arr = sorted(s)
    # Use three pointers or check all triples
    for x, y, z in combinations(arr, 3):
        if x + y + z == 0:
            return True
    return False

def check_all_subsets(a, b, m):
    universe = list(range(-a, b+1))
    # We want to check if EVERY subset of size m of universe contains a zero-sum triple
    # If we find one without zero-sum triple, return False
    for subset in combinations(universe, m):
        if not has_zero_sum_triple(subset):
            print(f"Counterexample subset of size {m} for a={a},b={b}: {subset}")
            return False
    return True

def find_min_m(a, b):
    universe = list(range(-a, b+1))
    n = len(universe)
    print(f"a={a}, b={b}, universe={universe}")
    for m in range(3, n+1):
        if check_all_subsets(a, b, m):
            print(f"Minimal m for a={a},b={b} is {m}")
            return m
    print(f"No minimal m found for a={a},b={b} up to m={n}")
    return None

def main():
    # Check small values of a,b
    for a in range(1, 4):
        for b in range(1, 4):
            find_min_m(a, b)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
