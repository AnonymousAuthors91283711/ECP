The problem is to find a 10-tuple of positive integers \( S(i) \) for \( i = 0, \ldots, 9 \) such that each element satisfies

\[
S(i) = 1 + \gcd(S((i-1) \bmod 10), S((i+1) \bmod 10))
\]

and then sum all \( S(i) \).

We want to find all such 10-tuples \( S \).

The gcd relation links neighbors cyclically.

Approach:
- Enumerate possible 10-tuples \( S \) with each element positive and bounded reasonably.
- For each tuple, check if the condition holds for all \( i \).
- Output each valid tuple and its sum.
- To keep it efficient, limit values to some small upper bound.
- Also print parameter values (none here since problem is fixed).

This will help guess the unique \( \sum S(i) \).

```python
# Problem constraints:
# For each i in 0..9, S[i] = 1 + gcd(S[i-1], S[(i+1)%10])
# S[i] > 0. We want to find tuples S meeting this and sum S[i].

import math

N = 10
MAX_VAL = 20  # max value for each S[i], heuristically small

def valid(S):
    for i in range(N):
        left = S[(i-1) % N]
        right = S[(i+1) % N]
        if S[i] != 1 + math.gcd(left, right):
            return False
        if S[i] <= 0:
            return False
    return True

def main():
    count = 0
    # Because of complexity, partially prune by generating candidate tuples cleverly.
    # But here brute force with pruning for small MAX_VAL:
    # We do nested loops with pruning by forward checking.

    # To keep the output short, only print tuples found.

    from itertools import product
    vals = range(1, MAX_VAL + 1)

    for S in product(vals, repeat=N):
        # Check condition
        # For efficiency, check condition on the fly could be better,
        # but direct check is simplest given MAX_VAL=20.

        if valid(S):
            s_sum = sum(S)
            print(f"Valid S: {S} sum={s_sum}")
            count += 1
            # Stop after printing up to 5 examples to save output length
            if count >= 5:
                break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
