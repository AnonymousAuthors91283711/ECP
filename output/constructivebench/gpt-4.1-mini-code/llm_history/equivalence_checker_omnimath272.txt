Ground Truth Answer: {f | ∃ (c : ℤ) (a : ℕ → ℤ) (k : ℕ), 
    c ≠ 0 ∧ 
    (∀ i ≤ k, Odd (a i) ∧ 0 < a i) ∧ 
    f = C c * ∏ i in Finset.range k, (C 4 * X - C (a i ^ 2))}
Proposed Answer: { f | ∃ a b : ℤ, (a = 0 ∨ a = 1 ∨ a = -1 ∨ a = 2 ∨ a = -2) ∧ f = C a + C b * X }
Let's analyze the two answers:

1. Ground Truth Answer: Describes polynomials that are constant multiples of products of linear factors (4X - a_i²) where a_i are positive odd integers.

2. Proposed Answer: Describes only linear polynomials (degree ≤ 1) with very restricted constant terms (a can only be 0,±1,±2).

The proposed answer is much more restrictive:
- It only allows linear polynomials
- It restricts the constant term to specific values
- It doesn't capture the product structure or odd square conditions of the ground truth

The two answers are clearly not equivalent. The proposed answer describes a much smaller subset of polynomials than the ground truth answer.
