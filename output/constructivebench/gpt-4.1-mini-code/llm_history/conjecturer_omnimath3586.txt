abbrev omnimath3586_answer : Set ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath3586 (x : ℝ) :
    x^2010 = fib 2009 * x + fib 2008 ↔ x ∈ omnimath3586_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: n = 10, equation: x^10 = fib(9)*x + fib(8) = 34*x + 21
Real solution: -0.617410325190111
Real solution: 1.5362823394473955
n = 12, equation: x^12 = fib(11)*x + fib(10) = 89*x + 55
Real solution: -0.6179426952866185
Real solution: 1.5504632028226333. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
<<<{x | x^2 = x + 1}>>>
