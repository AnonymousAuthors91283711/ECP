The problem involves sequences of natural numbers where each term divides the next, and considering the set of all residues modulo 210 of the sequence terms. The problem asks for the greatest possible size of such a residue set when it is finite.

To explore this, I will:
- Enumerate sequences a: ℕ → ℕ satisfying a_i | a_{i+1}
- For each sequence, collect distinct residues modulo 210 of terms
- Restrict to sequences for which this residue set is finite (meaning the residues must eventually repeat)
- Determine the cardinality of this residue set
- Enumerate possible sizes of these finite sets, based on trying different sequences formed by divisibility chains within numbers mod 210.

Since 210 = 2 * 3 * 5 * 7, the residues mod 210 relate to divisibility by these primes. We can try sequences formed by multiplying by factors that divide 210, to keep residues within a finite cycle.

We will try small sequences built by starting with a residue r and repeatedly multiplying by elements of the divisors of 210 (like 1,2,3,5,6,7,10,...), computing the "orbit" of r mod 210 under these multiplicative steps.

We want to compute all possible sizes of sets of residues modulo 210 that arise from sequences a with a_i dividing a_{i+1}.

Due to the problem complexity, the program will:
- Enumerate multiplicative chains modulo 210 starting from residues 1..209
- For each, try chains formed by multiplying by divisors of 210 up to some length
- Collect resulting residue sets, and print sizes

This will help conjecture the greatest possible cardinality of such finite residue sets under the divisibility condition.
