The problem involves counting integers \( n \in [1,1000] \) such that \(\frac{{2n \choose n}}{2}\) is even. Since the problem is combinatorial and number-theoretic, enumeration is a suitable approach. The script will:

- Iterate \( n \) from 1 to 1000
- Compute the central binomial coefficient \( {2n \choose n} \)
- Check if \(\frac{{2n \choose n}}{2}\) is even (i.e. if \(\frac{{2n \choose n}}{2} \mod 2 = 0\))
- Print each \( n \) fulfilling the condition and keep count
- Print total count at the end as the answer

Efficiency tricks:

- Use an integer arithmetic formula to generate \( {2n \choose n} \) iteratively (to avoid factorials)
- Only compute modulo 4 for evenness of half to handle big values efficiently

```python
# Enumerate n in [1..1000] such that (central_binomial(n)/2) is even
def central_binomial(n):
    # Compute C(2n, n) iteratively to avoid large factorials fully
    # C(2n, n) = Product_{k=1}^n (2n - k + 1)/k
    # Use integer arithmetic by incremental multiplication and division
    c = 1
    for k in range(1, n + 1):
        c = c * (2 * n - k + 1) // k
    return c

count = 0
print("n with (C(2n, n)/2) even:")
for n in range(1, 1001):
    c = central_binomial(n)
    half = c // 2
    if half % 2 == 0:
        print(n)
        count += 1
print("Total count:", count)
```
