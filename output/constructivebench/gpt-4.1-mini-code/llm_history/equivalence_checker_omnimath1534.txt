Ground Truth Answer: -1/4
Proposed Answer: 0
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves logarithmic expressions with different bases (2, 4, 16) and their relationships.
2. The ground truth answer is -1/4, while the proposed answer is 0.
3. The equation given in the theorem (h1) is symmetric in a certain way, but the expression we're trying to evaluate is not simply equal to 0.
4. Through logarithmic identities and base changes, one can show that the correct evaluation indeed leads to -1/4, not 0.

The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't match the ground truth. The expressions are not equivalent.
