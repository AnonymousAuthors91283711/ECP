The problem defines a function `omnimath2876_answer` on natural numbers and asks to verify that for specific inputs a=15 and n=51, the function equals 218. Since the actual function is omitted ("sorry"), let's attempt to guess or find patterns by enumerating possible values for `a` and `n` near the provided values, then attempt to find `omnimath2876_answer` results matching 218 or close values.

We'll:
- Enumerate values of a from 10 to 20.
- Enumerate values of n from 40 to 60.
- For each pair (a, n), we'll compute some plausible formula candidates which could fit the output 218 for (15, 51).
- We'll print any matches or near values to conjecture the function definition.

```python
# Trying to guess omnimath2876_answer for sample values of a and n.
# Since nothing is given, try sample formulas involving a and n.

def sample_formulas(a, n):
    # List of possible formula candidates involving a,n
    # We try to find an expression matching 218 at a=15,n=51
    results = []
    # Example formula 1: a + n
    results.append((a + n, f"a + n = {a}+{n}"))
    # formula 2: a * n
    results.append((a * n, f"a * n = {a}*{n}"))
    # formula 3: a * n - something
    results.append((a * n - a, f"a * n - a = {a}*{n}-{a}"))
    # formula 4: a*n // 3
    results.append((a * n // 3, f"a * n // 3 = {a}*{n}//3"))
    # formula 5: (a + n)*2
    results.append(((a + n)*2, f"(a + n)*2 = ({a}+{n})*2"))
    # formula 6: 7*a + n
    results.append((7*a + n, f"7*a + n = 7*{a}+{n}"))
    return results

# Search range
a_values = range(10, 21)
n_values = range(40, 61)

target = 218
epsilon = 5  # allow close matches

print("Searching for values of omnimath2876_answer(a,n) near 218 for a in 10..20 and n in 40..60")
for a in a_values:
    for n in n_values:
        for val, desc in sample_formulas(a, n):
            if val == target or (target - epsilon <= val <= target + epsilon):
                print(f"a={a}, n={n}, value={val}, formula: {desc}")

# After gathering candidates, print the likely exact match info.
print("\nExact matches for value = 218:")
for a in a_values:
    for n in n_values:
        for val, desc in sample_formulas(a, n):
            if val == target:
                print(f"a={a}, n={n}, formula: {desc}")
