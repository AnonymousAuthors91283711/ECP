abbrev mathodyssey21_answer : ℕ × ℕ := sorry
theorem mathodyssey21 (a : ℕ) (b : ℕ) (ha : Nat.Prime a) (hb : 0 < b) :
  9 * (2 * a + b)^2 = 509 * (4 * a + 511 * b) ↔ (a, b) = mathodyssey21_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: (a,b) = (251, 7) satisfies the equation.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ × ℕ
<<<(251, 7)>>>
