Ground Truth Answer: 175 / 1296
Proposed Answer: -(4^4 - 3^4 - (5^4 - 4^4)) / 6^4
Let's analyze the problem and answers:

1. The problem is calculating a probability where:
   - Total outcomes = 6^4 (rolling a die 4 times)
   - Favorable outcomes = 4^4 - 3^4 - (5^4 - 4^4)

2. Ground truth answer is 175/1296

3. Proposed answer has a negative sign in front: -(4^4 - 3^4 - (5^4 - 4^4))/6^4

Calculating the numerator:
4^4 = 256
3^4 = 81
5^4 = 625
So favorable_outcomes = (256 - 81) - (625 - 256) = 175 - 369 = -194

The proposed answer makes this -(-194) = 194, but the correct calculation should be 175 (from ground truth).

The negative sign in the proposed answer is incorrect, and the actual calculation of favorable outcomes is wrong (should be 175 not 194).
