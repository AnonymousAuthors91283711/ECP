The problem concerns finding pairs \((a,b)\) of positive integers such that:

1. \(a^3 b - 1\) is divisible by \(a + 1\), and
2. \(b^3 a + 1\) is divisible by \(b - 1\).

We want to enumerate possible pairs \((a,b)\) with small values for \(a,b\) and test the divisibility conditions, printing all pairs that satisfy both conditions. This will help conjecture what the set of solutions, `omnimath293_answer`, might be.

```python
# Enumerate pairs (a,b) with 1 <= a,b <= 50 and check:
# (a^3 * b - 1) divisible by (a+1)
# (b^3 * a + 1) divisible by (b-1) (b > 1)
# Print each pair that satisfies both conditions.

def main():
    print("Enumerating pairs (a,b) with 1 <= a,b <= 50 satisfying both divisibility conditions:")
    for a in range(1, 51):
        for b in range(1, 51):
            if b == 1:
                # b - 1 = 0, division undefined, skip.
                continue
            val1 = a**3 * b - 1
            val2 = b**3 * a + 1
            if val1 % (a + 1) == 0 and val2 % (b - 1) == 0:
                print(f"(a, b) = ({a}, {b})")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
