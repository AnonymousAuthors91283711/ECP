theorem P2010AMCA_4 (x : ℝ) (hx : x < 0) :
  0 < P2010AMCA_4_answer x ∧

Ground Truth Answer: fun x => -x⁻¹
Proposed Answer: fun x : ℝ => abs x
Let me analyze this carefully.

1. The problem asks for a function P2010AMCA_4_answer that satisfies several conditions when x < 0:
   - 0 < P2010AMCA_4_answer x
   - x/|x| ≤ 0
   - -x² ≤ 0
   - -2^x < 0
   - x^(1/3) < 0

2. Ground truth answer is -x⁻¹ (which equals -1/x for x ≠ 0)
   - For x < 0: -1/x > 0 (satisfies first condition)
   - Other conditions are properties of x itself, not the function

3. Proposed answer is abs x
   - For x < 0: abs x = -x > 0 (satisfies first condition)
   - Other conditions are same as ground truth since they don't involve the function

The key difference:
- Both functions satisfy all the given conditions for x < 0
- However, the ground truth (-1/x) and proposed answer (abs x) are different functions
- The problem only specifies behavior for x < 0, where both work
- But the functions are not equivalent in general (they differ for x > 0)

Since the problem only specifies conditions for x < 0 and both functions satisfy them, they are equivalent in the required domain.
