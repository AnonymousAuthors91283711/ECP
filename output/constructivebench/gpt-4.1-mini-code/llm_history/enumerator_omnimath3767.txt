The problem is to explore rational triples (p, q, r) with p + q + r = 0 and p * q * r = 1. We want to enumerate some rational triples satisfying these conditions to conjecture the answer. Let's test small rational values systematically and print any triples found.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Enumerate rational numbers with small numerators and denominators
rationals = [Fraction(n, d) for d in range(1, 6) for n in range(-5, 6) if d != 0]

# Enumerate triples (p,q,r) in rationals
# with p + q + r == 0 and p*q*r == 1
# print triples immediately when found

# To reduce time, loop first two variables, compute third:
# r = -(p + q)
# Check p*q*r == 1 => p*q*(-(p+q)) == 1 => -p*q*(p+q) == 1

# We'll enumerate p and q and compute r, check rationality and condition

print("Enumerating rational triples (p,q,r) with p+q+r=0 and p*q*r=1:")

found = 0
for p in rationals:
    for q in rationals:
        r = -(p + q)
        if r in rationals:  # We limit r to our small list for practicality
            prod = p * q * r
            if prod == 1:
                print(f"p={p}, q={q}, r={r}")
                found += 1
                if found >= 10:
                    print("... (limited to first 10 solutions)")
                    break
    if found >= 10:
        break
```
