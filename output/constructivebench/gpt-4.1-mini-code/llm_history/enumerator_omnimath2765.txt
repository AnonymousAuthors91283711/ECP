The problem involves solving the equation \( \frac{1}{2n} + \frac{1}{4n} = \frac{3}{12} \) for the rational number \( n \). I will write a Python program to enumerate rational values \( n = \frac{p}{q} \) with small integers \( p, q \), and check which satisfy the equation exactly.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# We'll enumerate n = p/q for integers p,q with small absolute values
# and check if 1/(2n) + 1/(4n) == 3/12 exactly.

target = Fraction(3, 12)

print("Enumerating candidates n = p/q and checking 1/(2n) + 1/(4n) = 3/12")

# To avoid division by zero and keep denominators small, try p,q in range 1 to 20
for q in range(1, 21):
    for p in range(1, 21):
        n = Fraction(p, q)
        left = 1/(2*n) + 1/(4*n)  # equivalent to (1/(2n) + 1/(4n))
        if left == target:
            print(f"Found exact solution: n = {p}/{q} = {n}")

# Try negative values for p (to test if negative rationals satisfy)
for q in range(1, 21):
    for p in range(-20, 0):
        n = Fraction(p, q)
        # ensure n != 0
        if n == 0:
            continue
        left = 1/(2*n) + 1/(4*n)
        if left == target:
            print(f"Found exact solution (negative numerator): n = {p}/{q} = {n}")
```
