The problem involves finding natural numbers \( k \) for which there exists a cubic polynomial \( P \) over \(\mathbb{Q}\) divisible by two given quadratics parameterized by \( k \). Our goal is to find all such \( k \), ideally the greatest one.

Key insight: For \(P\) of degree 3 to be divisible by both quadratics, the quadratics must share a common root (over \(\mathbb{C}\)), so their gcd has degree at least 1, enabling a cubic polynomial divisible by both (the cubic can be the product of the gcd and a linear factor).

We'll enumerate possible integer \( k \) values, check if the quadratics share a root, and print \( k \) when a common root exists. We'll restrict \( k \) (e.g. 0 to 50) for efficiency. If a common root \( r \) is found, there's a cubic divisible by both (the product of the gcd and a linear factor), so \( k \) is valid.

```python
from sympy import symbols, Poly, Rational, solveset, S

X = symbols('X')

# Quadratics parameterized by k:
# Q1 = X^2 + (k - 29)*X - k
# Q2 = 2*X^2 + (2k - 43)*X + k

for k in range(51):  # examine k=0..50
    k_rat = Rational(k)
    Q1 = Poly(X**2 + (k_rat - 29)*X - k_rat, X)
    Q2 = Poly(2*X**2 + (2*k_rat - 43)*X + k_rat, X)
    
    # Find gcd of Q1 and Q2:
    gcd = Q1.gcd(Q2)
    
    # Check if gcd degree >=1 (common root or factor):
    if gcd.degree() >= 1:
        print(f'k = {k} valid, gcd = {gcd.as_expr()}')

# Among printed k, the largest is the answer for the problem.
```
This script prints every \( k \) with common roots of the two quadratics, allowing us to conjecture the greatest such \( k \).
