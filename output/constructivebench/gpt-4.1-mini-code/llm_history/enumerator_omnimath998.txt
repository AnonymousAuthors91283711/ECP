This problem asks for the largest number \( n \) of disjoint 3-element subsets ("piles") of \(\{1,\ldots,100\}\), each with elements \(a,b,c\) such that \(a \cdot b = c\).

We try all triples \( (a,b,c) \) from 1 to 100 with \(a \cdot b = c\), then select disjoint triples (sets) to maximize count.

We'll:

- Enumerate all triples \(\{a,b,c\}\) with \(a,b,c \in [1,100]\), \(a \cdot b = c\) (order ignored).
- Filter to triples of size 3 (no repetition).
- Use a greedy approach to pick disjoint triples -- just print candidates and partial solutions.
- Show sample reasoning and partial enumerations.

```python
# Find all triples {a,b,c} with 1<=a,b,c<=100, a*b=c, all distinct
# Enumerate some piles and count disjoint collections

def triples():
    # To avoid duplicates, enforce a <= b < c
    for a in range(1, 101):
        for b in range(a, 101):
            c = a * b
            if c > 100:
                break
            # distinctness check
            if len({a,b,c}) == 3:
                yield frozenset([a,b,c])

def disjoint_sets(sets):
    picked = []
    used = set()
    for s in sets:
        if s.isdisjoint(used):
            picked.append(s)
            used.update(s)
    return picked

def main():
    ts = list(triples())
    print(f"Total triples found: {len(ts)}")
    # Sort by max element (small to large) or size
    ts.sort(key=lambda s: max(s))
    # Greedy selection to get many disjoint triples
    picked = disjoint_sets(ts)
    for idx, pile in enumerate(picked,1):
        print(f"Pile {idx}: {sorted(pile)}")
    print(f"Total disjoint piles found: {len(picked)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This prints all triples and a greedy maximal collection of disjoint piles to conjecture the true maximum number \( n \).
