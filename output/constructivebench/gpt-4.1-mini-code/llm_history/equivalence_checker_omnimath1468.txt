abbrev omnimath1468_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath1468 :
  let p : ℚ := 3/5  -- Daniel's probability of winning a point
  let q : ℚ := 2/5  -- Scott's probability of winning a point
  p^2 / (1 - 2*p*q) = omnimath1468_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 9/13
Proposed Answer: (3/5)^2 / (1 - 2*(3/5)*(2/5))
Let's evaluate the proposed answer step by step:

1. Calculate p²: (3/5)² = 9/25
2. Calculate denominator: 1 - 2*(3/5)*(2/5) = 1 - (12/25) = 13/25
3. Final division: (9/25)/(13/25) = 9/13

The proposed answer is exactly the expression given in the problem, which simplifies to the ground truth answer of 9/13. The expressions are mathematically equivalent.
