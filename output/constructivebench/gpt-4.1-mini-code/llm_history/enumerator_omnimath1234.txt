The problem considers the sum of binomial coefficients from 0 to 2008, but only for even k:
S = ∑_{k even} (2009 choose k).

We want to find log₂(S), which is likely an integer since the problem is posed with a natural number answer.

A known identity: The sum over even k of (n choose k) = 2^{n-1} if n is odd.

Here, n=2009 (odd), so:
S = 2^{2008}.

Then log₂(S) = 2008.

Let's verify by enumerating smaller odd n, summing (n choose k) over even k and checking log₂ of the sum.

I'll write a program enumerating n=1,3,5,...,15, summing even k binomial coefficients and printing log₂(sum). For the problem's n=2009, this is enormous, but we just want to observe the pattern, not compute the full sum.

```python
from math import comb, log2

for n in range(1, 16, 2):
    S = 0
    for k in range(0, n+1, 2):
        S += comb(n, k)
    print(f"n={n}, sum even k of C(n,k)={S}, log2={log2(S)}")
```

The output will show the pattern, hinting the answer to the original problem is 2008.

```python
from math import comb, log2

# Enumerate odd n <= 15, sum even binomial coefficients, print log base 2
for n in range(1, 16, 2):
    S = 0
    for k in range(0, n+1, 2):
        S += comb(n, k)
    print(f"n={n}, sum even k of C(n,k)={S}, log2={log2(S)}")

# Check the original problem for n=2009
# Compute sum for n=2009 is enormous, so just show formula value
n = 2009
S = 2**(n-1)
print(f"n={n}, sum even k of C(n,k)={S} (2^{n-1}), log2={n-1}")
```
