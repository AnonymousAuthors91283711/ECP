The problem is to find all pairs of positive integers (x, y) such that:

  (x² * y + x + y) is divisible by (x * y² + y + 7).

We'll enumerate small (x, y) pairs and print those satisfying the divisibility.

```python
# Enumerate (x,y) with x,y positive integers up to a threshold
# Print all pairs where (x^2*y + x + y) % (x*y^2 + y + 7) == 0

MAX = 50  # reasonable small limit to find patterns

for x in range(1, MAX + 1):
    for y in range(1, MAX + 1):
        numerator = x**2 * y + x + y
        denominator = x * y**2 + y + 7
        if numerator % denominator == 0:
            print(f"(x, y) = ({x}, {y}), quotient = {numerator // denominator}")

# After enumerating, one might conjecture about the solution set.
```
