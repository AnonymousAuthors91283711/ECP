Ground Truth Answer: fun x => 1 / x
Proposed Answer: fun q : ℚ => q⁻¹
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer `fun q : ℚ => q⁻¹` is exactly equivalent to the ground truth answer `fun x => 1 / x`, since in mathematics (and specifically in Lean's rational numbers ℚ), the notation `q⁻¹` is just syntactic sugar for `1/q`. Both functions represent the multiplicative inverse of their input. The problem is about finding a function satisfying the given functional equation, and both formulations correctly represent the reciprocal function.
