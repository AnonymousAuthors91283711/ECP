The problem involves finding five distinct integers \(a,b,c,d,e\) such that the product \((6-a)(6-b)(6-c)(6-d)(6-e) = 45\), then computing their sum \(a+b+c+d+e\).

To find all such quintuples, we can enumerate all 5-tuples of distinct integers where each factor \((6 - x_i)\) divides 45, given 45's divisors are limited. We'll try small factor combinations of 45 (since \(6 - x_i\) must be divisors or factors of 45), then derive the corresponding \(x_i\).

We'll restrict each \(6 - x_i\) to be a divisor of 45, chosen from \(\pm 1, \pm 3, \pm 5, \pm 9, \pm 15, \pm 45\), because other values won't multiply to 45 nicely.

Let's enumerate all 5-element sets of distinct divisors of 45 (with repetition not allowed) whose product is 45, then compute \(a_i = 6 - d_i\), sum them up, print all sums.

```python
from itertools import permutations
divisors = [1,3,5,9,15,45, -1,-3,-5,-9,-15,-45]

def prod(lst):
    p = 1
    for x in lst:
        p *= x
    return p

seen_sums = set()

# Enumerate all 5-element permutations of divisors (distinct)
# so factors multiply to 45
# Because product is commutative, sets suffice; permutations used to generate different orderings

from itertools import combinations

# Use only combinations to avoid repeated sets (since multiplication is commutative)
for combo in combinations(divisors,5):
    if len(set(combo)) != 5:
        continue
    if prod(combo) == 45:
        # compute corresponding a_i = 6 - factor
        a_list = [6 - d for d in combo]
        if len(set(a_list)) == 5:  # a_i must be distinct
            s = sum(a_list)
            if s not in seen_sums:
                seen_sums.add(s)
                print(f"a,b,c,d,e = {a_list}, sum = {s}")
                
# Print extremal sums found
if seen_sums:
    print("Minimum sum found:", min(seen_sums))
    print("Maximum sum found:", max(seen_sums))
else:
    print("No solutions found.")
```
