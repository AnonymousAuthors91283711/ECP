The problem involves two real numbers \(r_1\) and \(r_2\) satisfying:
\[
r_1 r_2 = 8 \quad \text{and} \quad r_1 + r_2 = 180.
\]
We want to find all possible values of
\[
S = \frac{r_1}{(r_2)^{1/3}} + \frac{r_2}{(r_1)^{1/3}}.
\]

To conjecture the exact value or expression for \(S\), we can explore sample values of \((r_1, r_2)\) satisfying the conditions. Because \(r_1\) and \(r_2\) are roots of the quadratic \(x^2 - 180x + 8 = 0\), we know both roots are positive real numbers and can be found numerically or symbolically. Then we calculate \(S\) for these roots.

The program below:
- Computes the roots,
- Calculates the expression \(S\),
- Prints exact or numerical approximations.

This can help guess closed forms or relationships.

```python
import math
import cmath

def main():
    # Given:
    # r1 * r2 = 8, r1 + r2 = 180
    # Roots of x^2 - 180x + 8 = 0
    a, b, c = 1, -180, 8  # coefficients
    
    # Compute roots exactly using quadratic formula
    discriminant = b*b - 4*a*c
    sqrt_disc = math.sqrt(discriminant)
    r1 = (180 + sqrt_disc) / 2
    r2 = (180 - sqrt_disc) / 2
    
    # Print roots
    print(f"Roots r1={r1}, r2={r2}")
    
    # Compute S = r1 / r2^(1/3) + r2 / r1^(1/3)
    cube_root_r1 = r1 ** (1/3)
    cube_root_r2 = r2 ** (1/3)
    
    S = r1 / cube_root_r2 + r2 / cube_root_r1
    print(f"S = r1 / r2^(1/3) + r2 / r1^(1/3) = {S:.10f}")
    
    # Try symmetry by swapping roots to confirm same S
    S_swapped = r2 / cube_root_r1 + r1 / cube_root_r2
    print(f"Swapped S (should be same) = {S_swapped:.10f}")
    
    # Observe and print candidate values
    # Try rational approximations given the roots are close to 180 and 0.04444...
    # Checking if S is near some simple value like 180 * cube_root(8) or similar.
    approx = 180 * 2  # 2 is cube root of 8 approx 2, but here 2 is cube root of 8?
    print(f"180 * cube_root(8) = 180 * 2 = {approx}")

    main()
