The problem describes finding an integer \( n \leq 200 \) that minimizes the absolute difference \(|n - X|\) for all \( k \leq 200 \), where 
\[ X = 3 + \frac{107 + 99n}{200}. \]

We want to enumerate values \( n \leq 200 \), calculate \( X \), and check if \( |n - X| \) is minimal compared to all other \( k \leq 200 \). The answer is the \( n \) that achieves this minimum.

The program below:
- Enumerates \( n \) and \( k \) from 0 to 200.
- Computes \( X \) for each \( n \).
- Finds which \( n \) minimizes \( \max_k |n - X| - |k - X| \ge 0 \).
- Prints all candidates \( n \) where \( |n - X| \) is minimal.
- Finally prints the unique minimizing \( n \).

```python
# Python enumerator for problem omnimath759.

def X(n):
    return 3 + (107 + 99 * n) / 200  # Note 2*100=200

N_MAX = 200

# We find for each n, the maximum over k ≤ 200 of |n - X(n)| - |k - X(n)|.
# We want to find n where this is ≤ 0 for all k, i.e. n with minimal |n - X(n)|.

candidates = []
min_distance = None

for n in range(N_MAX +1):
    x = X(n)
    dist_n = abs(n - x)
    # Check if dist_n ≤ dist_k for all k
    # Instead of checking all k, find min dist_k to x
    # minimal distance to x for any k ≤ 200 is min_{k} |k - x|
    dist_k_min = min(abs(k - x) for k in range(N_MAX + 1)) 
    if dist_n == dist_k_min:
        print(f"Candidate n={n}, |n-X|={dist_n:.6f}")
        if min_distance is None or dist_n < min_distance:
            min_distance = dist_n
            candidates = [n]
        elif dist_n == min_distance:
            candidates.append(n)

print("Candidates minimizing |n - X|:")
print(candidates)

# If multiple, pick minimal n
answer = min(candidates)
print("Answer:")
print(answer)
