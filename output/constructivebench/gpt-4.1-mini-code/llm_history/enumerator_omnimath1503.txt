[write_program]
The problem explores a grid from (1,1) to (100,100) and considers reachability by steps with L-shaped moves of fixed length k in one dimension and 1 in the other. We want to explore which points (a,b) are reachable for k between 51 and 99, and count them.

This Python program enumerates reachable points for each k in the range 51 to 99. It uses breadth-first search (BFS) on the grid to find all reachable points from (1,1). Each move is either (±1, ±k) or (±k, ±1). The program immediately prints the k value and the discovered reachable count. Finally, it prints the minimum and maximum counts found among tested k's.

```python
from collections import deque

def neighbors(x, y, k):
    # Possible moves: (±1, ±k) and (±k, ±1)
    steps = [(1, k), (1, -k), (-1, k), (-1, -k), (k, 1), (k, -1), (-k, 1), (-k, -1)]
    for dx, dy in steps:
        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
        if 1 <= nx <= 100 and 1 <= ny <= 100:
            yield nx, ny

def reachable_count(k):
    start = (1, 1)
    visited = set([start])
    queue = deque([start])
    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        for nx, ny in neighbors(x, y, k):
            if (nx, ny) not in visited:
                visited.add((nx, ny))
                queue.append((nx, ny))
    return len(visited)

min_k, max_k = 51, 99
results = []

for k in range(min_k, max_k + 1):
    count = reachable_count(k)
    results.append((k, count))
    print(f"k={k}, reachable_count={count}")

min_count = min(count for _, count in results)
max_count = max(count for _, count in results)
min_k_val = [k for k, c in results if c == min_count]
max_k_val = [k for k, c in results if c == max_count]

print(f"Minimum reachable count: {min_count} at k = {min_k_val}")
print(f"Maximum reachable count: {max_count} at k = {max_k_val}")
```
