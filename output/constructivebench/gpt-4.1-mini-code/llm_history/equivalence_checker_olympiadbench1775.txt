Ground Truth Answer: fun n => ⌊log 2 n⌋₊ + 1
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => n
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the minimal sum s where s is defined as the sum of a[i].val/(i.val+1) over all i in Fin n, for some bijective function a.

2. The ground truth answer suggests that the minimal sum is floor(log₂ n) + 1. This makes sense because:
   - The minimal sum would occur when we pair the largest denominators with smallest numerators
   - This resembles harmonic numbers and their logarithmic growth
   - The floor(log₂ n) + 1 matches known results for such optimization problems

3. The proposed answer is simply n, which is clearly different from the ground truth answer. For example:
   - When n=1: ground truth gives 1 (correct), proposed gives 1 (matches)
   - When n=2: ground truth gives 2 (correct), proposed gives 2 (matches)
   - When n=3: ground truth gives 2, proposed gives 3 (diverges)
   - When n=4: ground truth gives 3, proposed gives 4 (diverges)

The proposed answer only matches for n=1 and n=2, but diverges for all n≥3. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.
