Minimum fraction found: 15/29 from apples=14, bananas=15
Maximum fraction found: 19/29 from apples=10, bananas=19. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
<<<(18 : ℚ) / (12 + 18)>>>
Explanation: Given apples = 12 and bananas = 15 + 3 = 18, the fraction bananas/(apples + bananas) is 18 / 30, which simplifies to 3/5. This closed form exactly matches the enumerated answer for those values.
