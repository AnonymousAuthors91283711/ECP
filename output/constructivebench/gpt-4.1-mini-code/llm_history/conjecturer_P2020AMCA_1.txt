abbrev P2020AMCA_1_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem P2020AMCA_1 : 
  let remainder := 1 - 7/10
  let maria_took := (1/3) * remainder
  1 - 7/10 - maria_took = P2020AMCA_1_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Remainder after taking 7/10: 3/10
Maria took: 1/10
Final remainder after Maria took her part: 1/5. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
