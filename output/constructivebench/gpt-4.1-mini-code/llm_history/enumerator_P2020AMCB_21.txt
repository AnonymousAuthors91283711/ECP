The problem seems to ask for all positive integers \( n \) such that \( \frac{n}{n+1} \) is an integer (equal to its floor). Since \( 0 < n \), \( \frac{n}{n+1} \) is always less than 1, so the only way the fraction equals its floor is if it equals 0, which would mean \( n = 0 \) which contradicts \( n > 0 \). So likely the problem is to enumerate candidates and show none or see which n satisfy the condition.

I'll write a Python program to enumerate \( n \) from 1 to 20, compute \( n/(n+1) \), check if it equals its floor, and print such \( n \). This should confirm the answer.

```python
# Enumerate positive integers n, check if n/(n+1) is integer (equals its floor)
# Print n when condition holds

for n in range(1, 21):
    val = n / (n + 1)
    floor_val = int(val)
    if val == floor_val:
        print(f"n={n}, n/(n+1)={val}, floor={floor_val}")

print("Checked n=1 to 20. No n found where n/(n+1) equals its floor except possibly n=0, which is excluded.")
```
