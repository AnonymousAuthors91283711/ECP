Ground Truth Answer: {12, 15, 18}
Proposed Answer: { n | 10 < n ∧ n < 20 ∧ 9 ∣ n^2 }
<<<Close>>>
The proposed answer is mostly correct in terms of the mathematical expression, as it correctly identifies the condition that n² must be divisible by 9 (9 ∣ n²) and the range constraint (10 < n < 20). However, it doesn't explicitly list the solutions {12, 15, 18} which satisfy these conditions, making it less precise than the ground truth answer. The proposed answer is correct in spirit but lacks the explicit enumeration of solutions.
