The problem defines \( x \) by the equation \( 3^x = 5 \) and asks to find the exact value of \( 3^{x+2} \).

Since \( 3^{x+2} = 3^x \cdot 3^2 = 5 \cdot 9 = 45 \), the exact answer is 45.

To assist understanding, the program enumerates values of \( x \) around the solution with \( 3^x \) close to 5, and computes \( 3^{x+2} \), printing results alongside the expected answer. This helps confirm the answer and illustrate the relationship.

```python
import math

# Define 3^x = 5, so x = log_3(5) exactly.
x_exact = math.log(5, 3)

print(f"x (exact) = log_3(5) â‰ˆ {x_exact:.6f}")

# Compute 3^{x+2} = 3^2 * 3^x = 9 * 5 = 45 exactly.
value = 9 * 5
print(f"3^(x+2) = 9 * 5 = {value} exactly")

# Enumerate x values around exact x to show behavior and verify correctness.
for delta in [-0.1, 0, 0.1]:
    x = x_exact + delta
    val_3x = 3**x
    val_3xp2 = 3**(x + 2)
    print(f"x = {x:.6f}, 3^x = {val_3x:.6f}, 3^(x+2) = {val_3xp2:.6f}")
```
