The problem involves verifying the infinite sum of a sequence defined by p(n) = (1/2)^(2n - 1). We want to compute the sum over n ∈ ℕ (natural numbers). This is a geometric series with ratio (1/2)^2 = 1/4 and first term (1/2)^1 = 1/2. The sum should be 1/2 / (1 - 1/4) = 1/2 / (3/4) = 2/3.

Instead of just stating the result, we'll write a Python program enumerating the partial sums for increasing n to illustrate convergence, printing exact fractions using `fractions.Fraction` and also printing float approximations to assist conjecturing.

```python
# Enumerate partial sums of p(n) = (1/2)^(2n - 1) for n = 1..N, illustrating convergence.

from fractions import Fraction

def p(n):
    return Fraction(1, 2) ** (2 * n - 1)

def partial_sum(N):
    s = Fraction(0, 1)
    for n in range(1, N+1):
        s += p(n)
        print(f"n={n}, partial_sum={s} ≈ {float(s):.6f}")

print("Enumerating partial sums for p(n) = (1/2)^(2n - 1):")
partial_sum(10)

# Print conjectured full sum:
full_sum = Fraction(2, 3)
print(f"Conjectured full sum (exact): {full_sum} ≈ {float(full_sum):.6f}")
```
