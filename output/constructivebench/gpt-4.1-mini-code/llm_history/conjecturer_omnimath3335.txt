open Complex Real

abbrev omnimath3335_answer : ℂ := sorry
theorem omnimath3335 : 
  (Complex.exp (I * (2 * π / 3))) ^ 6 + (Complex.exp (I * (4 * π / 3))) ^ 6 = omnimath3335_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: e^(i*1*2π/3)^6 = 0.9999999999999998+-1.2212453270876722e-15j
e^(i*2*2π/3)^6 = 1.0+-3.1086244689504383e-15j
Sum of the two terms: 1.9999999999999998+-4.3298697960381105e-15j. Expected Answer Type: ℂ
<<<2>>>
