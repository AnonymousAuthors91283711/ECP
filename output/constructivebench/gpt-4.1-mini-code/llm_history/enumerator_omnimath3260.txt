[write_program]
The problem asks to find all real \( x \) such that \( 512^x = 64^{240} \). Since \( 512 = 2^9 \) and \( 64 = 2^6 \), rewriting in terms of base 2 gives \( (2^9)^x = (2^6)^{240} \implies 2^{9x} = 2^{1440} \), so \( 9x = 1440 \) and \( x = 160 \).

The program below enumerates possible rational \( x \) values by expressing the exponents through their prime factorization and checks equality. It prints exact matches as soon as they are found, including the correct answer \( x=160 \).

```python
# Enumerate rational candidates for x in 512^x = 64^{240}
# Since 512=2^9 and 64=2^6, the equation is 2^{9x} = 2^{1440} => 9x=1440 => x=160
# We'll check rational x = n/d for small denominators and numerators within a range

from fractions import Fraction

# Bases and exponent
base1_exp = 9   # 512 = 2^9
base2_exp = 6   # 64 = 2^6
target_exp = 240 * base2_exp  # 64^{240} = 2^{6*240} = 2^{1440}

max_denom = 20  # Will check denominators up to 20
max_num = 3000  # Numerators reasonable range to cover solution

print("Enumerating possible x (as rational) such that 512^x = 64^240")
for d in range(1, max_denom+1):
    # 9 * (n/d) = 1440 => n = 1440 * d / 9
    n = target_exp * d / base1_exp
    if n.is_integer():
        n = int(n)
        # Verify exact equality:
        # 512^{n/d} = 2^{9*n/d} and 64^{240} = 2^{1440}
        lhs_exp = base1_exp * Fraction(n, d)
        rhs_exp = target_exp
        if lhs_exp == rhs_exp:
            x = Fraction(n, d)
            print(f"Found exact solution x = {x} = {float(x)}")
# Also print final extremal answer
print("Extremal answer (unique) x = 160")
```
