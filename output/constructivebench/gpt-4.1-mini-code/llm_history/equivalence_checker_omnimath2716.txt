Ground Truth Answer: fun c => -12 - 18  -- For x² + 12x + c, sum of roots is -12, so other root is -12 - 18
Proposed Answer: fun c : ℤ => c - 18 + 18
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem is about finding the other root of a quadratic polynomial x² + 12x + c given that one root is 18.

Key points:
1. For a quadratic x² + bx + c, sum of roots = -b
2. Here, b = 12, so sum of roots = -12
3. Given one root is 18, the other root must be (-12) - 18 = -30

The ground truth answer correctly implements this logic: fun c => -12 - 18 = -30

The proposed answer is: fun c : ℤ => c - 18 + 18 = c
This is incorrect because:
1. It doesn't use the sum of roots property
2. It simplifies to just c, which is not related to finding the other root
3. The answer should be independent of c (as seen in ground truth)
