The problem involves rational numbers that can be written as k/4 or k/6, i.e., the sets S1 = {k/4} and S2 = {k/6}. Their intersection is numbers representable as both k/4 and k/6, which are rationals with denominators dividing both 4 and 6; effectively multiples of 1/lcm(4,6) = 1/12. So common = {k/12 | k ∈ ℤ}.

We want to find the T-th smallest element in common (with T=19), and enumerate elements of common less than that. Since common is ordered by integer multiples of 1/12, we can print these elements and identify the T-th element.

Below is a Python program that enumerates elements of common up to a small threshold and prints them, illustrating the concept.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def main():
    T = 19
    print(f"T = {T}")
    # The intersection set is multiples of 1/12
    step = Fraction(1, 12)
    # Enumerate first T elements in ascending order (non-negative)
    for k in range(T):
        val = k * step
        print(f"common element #{k+1}: {val} ({float(val)})")

    # The T-th element (index T-1)
    answer = (T - 1) * step
    print(f"T-th element (answer): {answer} ({float(answer)})")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
