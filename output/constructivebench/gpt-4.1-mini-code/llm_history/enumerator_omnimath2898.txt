[write_program]
This problem considers the numbers obtained from the operations with 4 and 2: 4Â², 4*2, 4-2, 4/2, 4+2, and asks to find the maximum among them. The program enumerates these values exactly (not approximations) and prints each, then outputs the maximum.

```python
# Enumerate operation results with 4 and 2, print each, then print the maximum.
def results():
    a, b = 4, 2
    vals = []
    vals.append(a ** b)
    print(f"4 ^ 2 = {vals[-1]}")
    vals.append(a * b)
    print(f"4 * 2 = {vals[-1]}")
    vals.append(a - b)
    print(f"4 - 2 = {vals[-1]}")
    vals.append(a / b)
    print(f"4 / 2 = {vals[-1]}")
    vals.append(a + b)
    print(f"4 + 2 = {vals[-1]}")

    maximum = max(vals)
    print(f"Maximum = {maximum}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    results()
```
