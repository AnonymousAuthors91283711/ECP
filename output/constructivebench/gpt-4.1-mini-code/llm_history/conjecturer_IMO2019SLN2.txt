abbrev IMO2019SLN2_answer : Set (ℕ × ℕ × ℕ) := sorry
theorem IMO2019SLN2 (a b c : ℕ) (ha : 0 < a) (hb : 0 < b) (hc : 0 < c) :
  a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = (a * b * c)^2 ↔ (a, b, c) ∈ IMO2019SLN2_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing triples (a,b,c) with 1 <= a,b,c <=  30
Found solution: a=1, b=2, c=3
Enumeration finished.. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ × ℕ)
<<<{(1, 2, 3)}>>>
