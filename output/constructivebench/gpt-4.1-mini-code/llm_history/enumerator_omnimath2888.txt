[write_program]
We have a sequence defined by a starting number `init` and a recursive rule:
- If the current term n is even: next term = n/2 + 1
- If the current term n is odd: next term = (n + 1)/2

We want to understand the behavior of the sequence starting at 16, applied 100 times, i.e., `omnimath_sequence 16 100`.

To assist in conjecturing the value, we will write a Python program that:
- Implements the `nextTerm` function exactly
- Computes the sequence starting from 16
- Prints every term up to 100 terms (or until a fixed threshold if the sequence stabilizes)
- At the end, prints the term number and the corresponding value

This will help conjecture the stable value or behavior of the sequence after many iterations.

```python
def nextTerm(n):
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return n // 2 + 1
    else:
        return (n + 1) // 2

def omnimath_sequence(init, steps):
    term = init
    for k in range(steps + 1):
        print(f"Term {k}: {term}")  # Streaming output of exact terms
        term = nextTerm(term)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    init_value = 16
    steps = 100
    print(f"Starting sequence with init = {init_value}, steps = {steps}")
    omnimath_sequence(init_value, steps)
```
This enumerates and prints all terms of the sequence for further analysis.
