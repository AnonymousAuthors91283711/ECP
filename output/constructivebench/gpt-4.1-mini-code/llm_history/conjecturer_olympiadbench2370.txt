abbrev olympiadbench2370_answer : Set ℝ := sorry
theorem olympiadbench2370 :
  {x : ℝ | (x + 8) ^ 4 = (2 * x + 16) ^ 2} = olympiadbench2370_answer :=
sorry
. Enumerated answers: x = -10: (x+8)^4 = 16, (2x+16)^2 = 16
x = -8: (x+8)^4 = 0, (2x+16)^2 = 0
x = -6: (x+8)^4 = 16, (2x+16)^2 = 16

All solutions found:
[-10, -8, -6]
Minimum solution: -10
Maximum solution: -6. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
<<<{x | x = -10 ∨ x = -8 ∨ x = -6}>>>
