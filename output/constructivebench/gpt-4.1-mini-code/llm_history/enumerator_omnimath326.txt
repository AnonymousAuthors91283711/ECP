The problem appears to ask for the maximum dimension \( d \) of a subspace \( V \) of \( n \times n \) complex matrices such that every matrix \( A \in V \) commutes with its transpose \( A^T \), i.e., \( A A^T = A^T A \).

We can try small values of \( n \), enumerate subspaces (or rather, their dimensions) and check which dimensions admit such a subspace to gain insight.

Due to exponential complexity of enumerating subspaces, a practical approach is to test random or structured sets of commuting matrices or verify conditions on the dimension of subspaces formed by symmetric or skew-symmetric matrices, because \( A A^T = A^T A \) is related to the matrix being normal or symmetric.

We will try:
- \( n=1,2,3,4 \)
- For each, consider spaces like symmetric matrices, skew-symmetric matrices, diagonal matrices, and their dimensions.
- Print the space dimension if it fits the requirement.

This can help conjecture the maximal dimension.

```python
# Enumerate possible subspace dimensions of n x n complex matrices commuting with their transpose.
# We consider special subspaces: symmetric, skew-symmetric, diagonal, and direct sums.
# Output dimension and subspace description for n=1..4.

def symmetric_dim(n):
    # symmetric matrices dim = n(n+1)/2
    return n*(n+1)//2

def skew_symmetric_dim(n):
    # skew-symmetric matrices dim = n(n-1)/2
    return n*(n-1)//2

def diagonal_dim(n):
    # diagonal matrices dim = n
    return n

def print_info(n, dim, desc):
    print(f"n={n} dimension={dim} : {desc}")

def main():
    for n in range(1,5):
        # symmetric matrices satisfy A = A^T, so A A^T = A^2 symmetric = A = A^T, so commute
        sd = symmetric_dim(n)
        print_info(n, sd, "symmetric matrices; A=A^T implies A A^T = A^2 = A^T A")

        # skew-symmetric matrices satisfy A = -A^T;
        # since A^T = -A, A A^T = A (-A) = -A^2, and A^T A = (-A) A = -A^2, so they commute
        skd = skew_symmetric_dim(n)
        print_info(n, skd, "skew-symmetric matrices; A=-A^T, so A A^T = A^T A")

        # diagonal matrices satisfy A = diag(...), A^T = A, so as symmetric
        dd = diagonal_dim(n)
        print_info(n, dd, "diagonal matrices")

        # sum of symmetric + skew matrices = all matrices (full space dim n^2)
        # but note that arbitrary linear combinations may not satisfy condition
        # try subspace of diagonal + scalar multiples of identity
        print_info(n, 1, "scalar multiples of identity; min nonzero dim")
