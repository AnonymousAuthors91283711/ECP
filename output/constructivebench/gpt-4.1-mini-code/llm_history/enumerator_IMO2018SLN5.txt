The problem involves natural numbers \( x, y, z, t > 0 \) satisfying two conditions:
\[
x y - z t = x + y \quad \text{and} \quad x + y = z + t,
\]
and asks about the possibility that both \( x y \) and \( z t \) are perfect squares. We want to enumerate small positive integer quadruples \((x,y,z,t)\) that satisfy the conditions, and check whether both products are squares.

```python
import math

def is_square(n):
    r = int(math.isqrt(n))
    return r*r == n

# Enumerate quadruples with small values
max_val = 30
print("x y z t : conditions met : is_xy_square : is_zt_square")
for x in range(1, max_val+1):
    for y in range(1, max_val+1):
        s = x + y
        # Since x + y = z + t = s, z and t satisfy z+t = s
        # So t = s - z
        for z in range(1, s):
            t = s - z
            # Check positivity of t and conditions
            if t <= 0:
                continue
            lhs = x*y - z*t
            cond1 = (lhs == s)
            cond2 = (s == z + t)
            if cond1 and cond2:
                xy_square = is_square(x*y)
                zt_square = is_square(z*t)
                print(f"{x} {y} {z} {t} : {cond1 and cond2} : {xy_square} : {zt_square}")
```
This program prints all quadruples with \(x,y,z,t \leq 30\) that satisfy the conditions, and indicates whether \(xy\) and \(zt\) are perfect squares. From the output, one may conjecture if both \(xy\) and \(zt\) can simultaneously be perfect squares under these conditions.
