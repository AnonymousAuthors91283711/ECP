The problem is to find all natural numbers n with 0 < n < 25 that cannot be expressed as a difference of two squares a^2 - b^2, where a, b are integers. We'll enumerate n from 1 to 24 and check if integers a, b exist with n = a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b). Since a and b are integers, (a - b) and (a + b) are integers with the same parity, so n must be expressible as a product of two integers of the same parity. We'll use this property to test quickly.

```python
# Enumerate n in (0,25) to find those not expressible as difference of two squares a^2 - b^2.

def can_be_diff_of_squares(n):
    # n = (a-b)(a+b), with a,b integers => factors of n of same parity
    for d1 in range(1, int(n**0.5)+1):
        if n % d1 == 0:
            d2 = n // d1
            # check parity
            if (d1 + d2) % 2 == 0:
                # a = (d1 + d2)//2, b = (d2 - d1)//2 integers
                return True
    return False

print("n (1..24) and if difference of squares:")
for n in range(1,25):
    if not can_be_diff_of_squares(n):
        print(f"{n} cannot be expressed as a^2 - b^2")

# Count number of such n
impossible = [n for n in range(1,25) if not can_be_diff_of_squares(n)]
print(f"Count: {len(impossible)}")
```
