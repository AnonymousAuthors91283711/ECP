The problem involves finding \( p \) such that \( y \times (1 - p) = x \) with \( y = x \times (1 + 0.6) = 1.6x \). Thus \( 1.6x (1 - p) = x \Rightarrow 1-p = \frac{1}{1.6} = 0.625 \Rightarrow p = 0.375 \).

To assist understanding and verification, I will write a program iterating over some positive \( x \), calculate \( p \) for each, and print exact values as rational fractions and as decimal approximations. This enumerates and supports conjecturing \( p = 3/8 = 0.375 \).

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Sample some positive x-values and compute p = 1 - x / y with y = x * 1.6
for x_num in range(1, 6):
    # Use fractional x to maintain exactness
    x = Fraction(x_num, 1)  # x = 1,2,3,4,5
    y = x * Fraction(8, 5)  # 1 + 0.6 = 8/5
    p = 1 - x / y  # p = 1 - x/(1.6x) = 1 - 1/1.6
    print(f"x = {x} => y = {y}, p = {p} = {float(p):.6f}")
```
