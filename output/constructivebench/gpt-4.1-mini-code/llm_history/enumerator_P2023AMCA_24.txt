The problem is about enumerating sequences of finite subsets of {0,...,9} with non-decreasing inclusion and length up to 10, then taking the count modulo 10. The key challenge is efficiently counting chains of subsets from the powerset of a 10-element set.

I will:
- Represent subsets as integers 0..1023 (bitmasks for subsets of {0..9}).
- Generate all chains of length ≤ 10 of subsets with non-decreasing inclusion.
- Count total number of such sequences.
- Print intermediate counts for each length.
- Finally print the total count mod 10.

To avoid memory explosion, compute counts by dynamic programming: for length 1, count is 1024 sequences (each subset). For longer lengths, for each subset s, sum over supersets t of s the count of sequences ending at t with length one less.

Because each level involves sums over supersets, we precompute supersets or use a bit-trick to efficiently propagate sums.

Note: The total count grows huge since chains can be of length up to 10. To fit output length and efficiency, we print counts modulo 10 only.

```python
# Enumerate all sequences of subsets of {0..9}, length up to 10, 
# where seq[i] ⊆ seq[i+1], count total sequences mod 10.
# Uses DP: dp[length][subset] = number of chains of that length ending with 'subset'.

def main():
    n = 10  # size of base set
    N = 1 << n  # total subsets

    # dp arrays: dp for previous length, dpn for current length
    dp = [1] * N  # length = 1: each subset itself
    print(f"Length=1, total sequences mod 10 = {sum(dp) % 10}")

    # For efficient superset-sum: use SOS DP
    # To get sum over supersets for each subset:
    # We perform n iterations, in each with OR-mask over bits.

    def superset_sums(arr):
        # arr: list of length N, arr[s] = value for subset s
        res = arr[:]
        for i in range(n):
            for mask in range(N):
                if (mask & (1 << i)) == 0:
                    res[mask] = (res[mask] + res[mask | (1 << i)]) % 10
        return res

    for length in range(2, 11):
        # For dp[length][s], sum dp[length-1][t] for all t ⊇ s
        # So dpn[s] = sum over supersets t of s of dp[t].
        dpn = superset_sums(dp)
        dp = dpn
        total = sum(dp) % 10
        print(f"Length={length}, total sequences mod 10 = {total}")

    # Final answer is total sequences of length ≤10, 
    # sum over length=1 to 10 of totals mod 10.
    # But since modulus is 10, sum is length 10 times total as above.
    # We have printed partial totals, sum them now:
    # Note: Instead, accumulate totals while printing to output final answer.

    main()
