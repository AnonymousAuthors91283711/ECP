[write_program]
The problem asks to find a real number \( r \) such that 
\[
1 \times (1 - 0.029) \times (1 + 0.089) \times (1 + 0.069) = (1 + r/100)^3.
\]
We want to find \( r \) exactly or numerically such that the equality holds, then verify uniqueness.

The program below:
- Calculates the left-hand side product.
- Enumerates rational approximations for \( r \) with denominators up to 100 that satisfy the equation within a small tolerance.
- Prints exact fractions and decimal approximations immediately.
- Finally prints the value \( r \) computed by inversion and rounded for reference.

```python
from fractions import Fraction
from math import isclose

# Compute left side value
P0 = 1.0
P_A = P0 * (1 - 0.029) * (1 + 0.089) * (1 + 0.069)
# Equation: (1 + r/100)^3 = P_A  -> r = 100*(P_A^{1/3} - 1)
r_exact = 100 * (P_A ** (1/3) - 1)

print(f"P_A = {P_A:.10f}")
print(f"Exact r (approx): {r_exact:.10f}")

# Enumerate rational candidates r = numerator/denominator in [-5,5] percent range
# since changes are in low single digits
tolerance = 1e-6
for denom in range(1, 101):
    for numer in range(-5*denom, 5*denom+1):
        r = numer / denom
        LHS = (1 + r / 100) ** 3
        if abs(LHS - P_A) < tolerance:
            # print candidates with fraction and decimal
            frac = Fraction(numer, denom)
            print(f"Candidate r = {frac} = {float(frac):.6f}")
            
print(f"Unique solution approximation r â‰ˆ {r_exact:.6f}")
```
