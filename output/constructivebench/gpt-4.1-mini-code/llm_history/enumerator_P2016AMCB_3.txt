The problem likely asks for a function \( P2016AMCB_3\_answer(x) \) with some specific value at \( x = -2016 \). Since the code references integers and has a parameter \( x \), I'll enumerate values of a plausible function around \( x = -2016 \) to conjecture the pattern and check when the output might be 4032.

```python
# Enumerate values of a candidate function f(x) related to x around -2016.
# Assumption: The output at x=-2016 is 4032, so try multiples or simple polynomial forms.
def P(x):
    # Try linear function: 2 * abs(x)
    return 2 * abs(x)

x_target = -2016
print(f"Testing function: P(x) = 2 * |x| around x = {x_target}")

for x in range(x_target - 5, x_target + 6):
    val = P(x)
    print(f"P({x}) = {val}")

print(f"At x = {x_target}, P(x) = {P(x_target)}")  # Should print 4032 if matching

# Try also quadratic and other forms if needed
def P_quad(x):
    return x**2 + 2016*x

print("\nTesting quadratic form P_quad(x) = x^2 + 2016*x around x = -2016")
for x in range(x_target - 5, x_target + 6):
    val = P_quad(x)
    print(f"P_quad({x}) = {val}")

print(f"At x = {x_target}, P_quad(x) = {P_quad(x_target)}")
```
