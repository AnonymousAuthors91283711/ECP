The problem involves summing times given by 10 * (k+1) for k from 0 to 118 and finding the heightAtHalfTime defined by counting how many intervals fit into halfTime. The goal is to find 10 * heightAtHalfTime.

I will write a Python program that:
- Computes totalTime = sum of 10*(k+1) for k in 0..118
- Finds halfTime = totalTime/2
- Iterates over k to find how many intervals fit in halfTime
- Computes and prints the value 10 * heightAtHalfTime immediately

This will aid in conjecturing the formula or answer.

```python
# Enumerate 10 * heightAtHalfTime from the problem scenario to help guess and prove the answer.
def main():
    n = 119
    times = [10 * (k+1) for k in range(n)]
    totalTime = sum(times)
    halfTime = totalTime / 2
    print(f"Total time: {totalTime}, Half time: {halfTime}")

    cumulative = 0
    count = 0
    # count how many intervals fit within halfTime (<= halfTime)
    for k, t in enumerate(times):
        cumulative += t
        if cumulative <= halfTime:
            count = k + 1
        else:
            break

    heightAtHalfTime = n - count
    answer = 10 * heightAtHalfTime
    print(f"Intervals counted: {count}")
    print(f"heightAtHalfTime: {heightAtHalfTime}")
    print(f"10 * heightAtHalfTime (answer candidate): {answer}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
