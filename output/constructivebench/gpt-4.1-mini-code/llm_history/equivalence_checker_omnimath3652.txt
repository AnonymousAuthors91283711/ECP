Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: { f : ℝ → ℝ |
  ∃ a b c : ℝ,
    f = (fun x => a * x^2 + b * x + c) ∧
    ((a = 0 ∧ b = 0 ∧ c = 0) ∨ (a = 1 ∧ b = 0 ∧ c = 0))
}
<<<None>>>
Since the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's not provided), I cannot verify whether the proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth. The proposed answer suggests quadratic functions with specific coefficients, but without knowing the actual solution set, I can't determine equivalence.
