The problem involves evaluating the average value of the function M(a,b,c,d,e,f) mod 64 over all 6-tuples (a,b,c,d,e,f) where each coordinate is an integer from 1 to 100. We want to enumerate some values of M modulo 64 and accumulate the sum to guess the average.

Since M = a + 2b + 4c + 8d + 16e + 32f, mod 64 it behaves like adding weighted variables mod 64. Each variable is from 1 to 100, but the modulo bounds it within 0 to 63.

To manage output size and time, we try small ranges (e.g., 1 to 5) first to see partial sums and approximate the average. Then we increase sample size. We'll output partial sums, averages, and the modulos used.

```python
# Enumerate sums of M(a,b,c,d,e,f) mod 64 for small ranges to guess average over 1..100.
def mod64(x):
    return x % 64

def main():
    # We'll try ranges 1..5, 1..10, ... up to 1..20 for partial enumeration.
    print("Enumerating sums of M mod 64 for sample ranges")
    weights = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32]

    for N in [5, 10, 20]:
        total = 0
        count = N ** 6
        # Enumerate all 6-tuples in 1..N
        # To reduce computation, sum over each dimension separately then combine using convolution-like approach.
        # But direct iteration is simplest here.

        # Since count = N^6 grows fast, we do direct iteration only up to N=10 here.
        if N <= 10:
            for a in range(1, N+1):
                wa = weights[0]*a
                for b in range(1, N+1):
                    wb = wa + weights[1]*b
                    for c in range(1, N+1):
                        wc = wb + weights[2]*c
                        for d in range(1, N+1):
                            wd = wc + weights[3]*d
                            for e in range(1, N+1):
                                we = wd + weights[4]*e
                                for f in range(1, N+1):
                                    val = we + weights[5]*f
                                    total += val % 64
        else:
            # For N=20, do a statistical sample instead of full enumeration
            import random
            samples = 10**6
            total = 0
            for _ in range(samples):
                tuple_vals = [random.randint(1,N) for _ in range(6)]
                val = sum(w*v for w,v in zip(weights, tuple_vals))
                total += val % 64
            count = samples
        avg = total / count
        print(f"N={N}, Sum mod 64 over all tuples (or samples): {total}, Count: {count}, Average mod 64 value: {avg:.6f}")
