The enumerations show a pattern of gcd values heavily involving Fibonacci numbers or their related sequences (e.g., 55, 377, 2584, 832040, which are Fibonacci numbers). Also note that certain gcd values at specific indices like gcd(a(5), b(5)) = 55 = Fib(10) and gcd(a(10), b(10)) = 2255, which looks like a product of Fibonacci numbers (or Lucas-related sequences).

The sequences a_sequence and b_sequence satisfy linear recurrences of order 2 with characteristic polynomials:

- For a_sequence: x² - 7x + 1 = 0
- For b_sequence: x² - 3x + 1 = 0

The gcd of terms in sequences defined by linear recurrences often correspond to gcd properties of their indices and relate to the values of the sequence at gcd(n,m).

The given problem asks for gcd(a_sequence 5000, b_sequence 501).

Observations from enumerations reveal gcd is often 1, except at multiples related to 5.

It is natural to guess that:

omnimath1561_answer = 1

since the gcd is 1 for most randomly chosen large pairs with indices not sharing particular relationships.

Alternatively, another conjecture is that since 501 is not a multiple of 5, gcd(a(5000), b(501)) = 1.

But 5000 is multiple of 5 and 501 is not, so from enumerations when one index is multiple of 5 and the other is not, gcd is usually 1.

We must also address Lean errors due to scope of identifiers.

The error "unknown identifier 'a_sequence'" when defining abbrev omnimath1561_answer means the abbreviation is defined before the sequence definitions or outside their scope.

Fix is to move the abbrev after the sequences are defined.

But since asked for closed form, and because the gcd is 1, we can safely define:

omnimath1561_answer : ℕ := 1

and this will compile and match the conjectured gcd at this point.

Hence, the fixed answer is:

<<<1>>>
