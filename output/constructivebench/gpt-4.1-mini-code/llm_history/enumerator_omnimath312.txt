The problem considers a set of natural numbers \( n \) for which there exist three monic integer polynomials \( p_0, p_1, p_2 \) such that every integer from 1 to \( n \) can be represented as \( p_j(m) \) for some integer \( m \) and some polynomial \( j \in \{0,1,2\} \).

We want to find the greatest \( n \) for which this property holds.

We'll enumerate possible \( n \) values up to some range, and for each \( n \), try to find polynomials \( p_0, p_1, p_2 \) that cover all integers from 1 to \( n \). To keep complexity low, we can consider polynomials of degree 1 or 2 (and monic implies leading coefficient 1).

For example, consider polynomials: \( p_i(x) = x + a_i \) or \( x^2 + b_i x + c_i \) with integer coefficients.

We'll try linear polynomials with integer shifts first, as these are simpler and might already yield large coverage.

The program enumerates small sets of integer shifts for three linear monic polynomials, checking if their integer outputs cover \( 1 \) to \( n \) for increasing \( n \).

Print polynomials and \( n \) when a full coverage is found.

```python
# Enumerate n and try to find three monic integer polynomials p_0, p_1, p_2,
# each either x + a or x^2 + b x + c, covering {1,...,n} by their integer values.

# We'll restrict to linear monic polynomials of form x + a for efficiency.

# For each triple (a,b,c) in range(-5,6), check coverage on {1,...,n} for n up to 20.

def monic_linear_values(a, low, high):
    # Values of p(x) = x + a for x in integers s.t. p(x) in [low,high]
    vals = set()
    # Solve x+a in [low, high] => x in [low - a, high - a]
    x_low, x_high = low - a, high - a
    for x in range(x_low, x_high + 1):
        vals.add(x + a)
    return vals

def check_coverage(n, shifts):
    covered = set()
    low, high = 1, n
    for a in shifts:
        covered |= monic_linear_values(a, low, high)
    return set(range(1, n+1)) <= covered

def main():
    from itertools import product
    max_n = 20
    # Search shifts a,b,c in -5 to 5 for polynomials x + a, x + b, x + c
    candidates = []
    for n in range(1, max_n+1):
        for shifts in product(range(-5,6), repeat=3):
            if check_coverage(n, shifts):
                # Print immediately when found
                print(f"n = {n}, shifts = {shifts}")
                candidates.append(n)
                break
    if candidates:
        print(f"Greatest n found (linear): {max(candidates)}")
