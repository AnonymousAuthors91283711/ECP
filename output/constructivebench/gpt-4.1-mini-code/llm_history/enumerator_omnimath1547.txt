The problem asks to characterize all real values \(y\) such that there exists a function \(f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\) with the property \(f(x)f(y) = f(x - y)\) and \(f(2017) = y\).

To explore possible values \(y = f(2017)\), we can try some simple functional forms \(f\) satisfying the equation and evaluate \(f(2017)\). The goal is to enumerate candidate values \(y\) consistent with the property by explicit construction.

Key observations to guide enumeration:
- \(f(x) f(y) = f(x-y)\) looks like a functional equation reminiscent of multiplicative or exponential functions but with subtraction inside the argument.
- Try constant functions and exponential forms \(f(x) = a^{cx}\), etc., to find those that satisfy the relation.
- Evaluate \(f(2017)\) for constructive \(f\) and print results.

Below is a Python enumerator to explore candidate \(y\) values by testing functions of the form \(f(x) = r^x\) for small rational \(r\), the zero function, and some constants, checking the defining property approximately on some test points for early filtering.

```python
import math

def check_property(f, samples, tol=1e-9):
    # Check f(x)*f(y) == f(x - y) on samples approximately
    for x in samples:
        for y in samples:
            lhs = f(x)*f(y)
            rhs = f(x - y)
            if abs(lhs - rhs) > tol:
                return False
    return True

def main():
    samples = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]  # small test points
    candidates = set()
    
    # Check zero function
    fzero = lambda x: 0.0
    if check_property(fzero, samples):
        y = fzero(2017)
        print(f"From zero function: f(2017) = {y}")
        candidates.add(y)

    # Check constant functions f(x) = c
    for c in [-1, 0, 1]:
        fconst = lambda x, c=c: c
        if check_property(fconst, samples):
            y = fconst(2017)
            print(f"From constant function f(x)={c}: f(2017) = {y}")
            candidates.add(y)

    # Try functions of form f(x) = r^x for r in some rationals
    # with care for zero/division
    possible_rs = [math.exp(k) for k in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]]  # e^{-2}, e^{-1}, 1, e, e^{2}
    for r in possible_rs:
        fexp = lambda x, r=r: r**x
        # Because r^x*r^y=r^{x+y} != r^{x-y}, only r=1 or r=0?
        # Check property:
        if check_property(fexp, samples):
            y = fexp(2017)
            print(f"From exponential base r={r:.5f}: f(2017) = {y}")
            candidates.add(y)
    
    # Try sign function f(x) = 1 or -1 alternatively to test other behaviors could be complex
    
    # Report unique candidates
    if candidates:
        print("\nUnique candidate values for f(2017):")
        for val in sorted(candidates):
            print(val)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script tests a few plausible functions against the functional equation on selected sample points and prints values \(f(2017)\) if the property holds approximately. This can aid conjecturing about the true solution set.
