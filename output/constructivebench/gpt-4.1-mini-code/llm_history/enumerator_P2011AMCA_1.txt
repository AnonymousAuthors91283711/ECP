This problem involves a piecewise linear cost formula with parameters \( T = 100 \) and \( M = 30.5 \times 60 = 1830 \), and the cost formula is:
\[
cost = 20 + 0.05 T + 0.1 \max(0, M - 1800)
\]

Since \( T \) and \( M \) are given in the theorem, let's enumerate costs for various values of \(M\) slightly below, at, and above 1800, to conjecture how the cost behaves and confirm the formula. The enumeration will help understand the break point at 1800 and the impact on costs.

```python
# Enumerate costs for T=100 and M around 1800 with step 10
T = 100
print(f"T = {T}")
for M in range(1790, 1821, 5):
    cost = 20 + 0.05 * T + 0.1 * max(0, M - 1800)
    print(f"M = {M}, cost = {cost}")
# Specifically check for given M=1830 from problem
M_given = int(30.5 * 60)
cost_given = 20 + 0.05 * T + 0.1 * max(0, M_given - 1800)
print(f"M = {M_given} (given in problem), cost = {cost_given}")
```
This prints costs for all values of \(M\) from 1790 to 1820 in increments of 5, showing how cost starts increasing after \(M=1800\). It also prints the exact cost for \(M=1830\).

Run this as `python enumerator.py`.
