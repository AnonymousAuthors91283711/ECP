abbrev omnimath3676_answer : ℕ → ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath3676 (k : ℕ) (hk : 2 ≤ k) (f : ℕ → ℕ) :
  (∀ (x : Fin k → ℕ), (∑ i, (f (x i))!) ∣ (∑ i, (x i)!)) ↔ f = omnimath3676_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Checking for k=2
Identity function f(x)=x works for k=2

Checking for k=3
Identity function f(x)=x works for k=3
. Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
