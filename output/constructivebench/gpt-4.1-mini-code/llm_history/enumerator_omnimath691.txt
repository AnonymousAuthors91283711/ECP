[write_program]
The problem defines a sequence \( a_n \) with initial values \( a_1=1 \), \( a_2=0 \), and a recurrence relation \( a_{n+2} = 2a_n + a_{n+1} \). We want to find \( a_{2004} \).

To assist in conjecturing the answer, I will write a Python program that computes and prints the first several values \( a_n \) following the recurrence, then also print \( a_{2004} \). Since values can get large, Python's integers are arbitrary precision and thus exact. The program will print the terms as they are found to satisfy the streaming output requirement.

```python
# Enumerate the sequence defined by:
# a_1 = 1, a_2 = 0, and a_{n+2} = 2 * a_n + a_{n+1}

def generate_sequence(n):
    a = [0]*(n+1)  # 1-based indexing
    a[1], a[2] = 1, 0

    for i in range(3, n+1):
        a[i] = 2*a[i-2] + a[i-1]
        print(f"a[{i}] = {a[i]}")  # streaming output

    return a

if __name__ == "__main__":
    N = 20  # print first 20 terms to see pattern
    a = generate_sequence(N)
    print(f"a[2004] = ", end="")
    # Compute a_2004 efficiently
    # Use a loop rather than recursion for efficiency
    a1, a2 = 1, 0
    for i in range(3, 2005):
        a3 = 2 * a1 + a2
        a1, a2 = a2, a3
    print(a2)
```

This program will print the first 20 \( a_n \) values and then print \( a_{2004} \). The exact integer values help form conjectures about the general form.
