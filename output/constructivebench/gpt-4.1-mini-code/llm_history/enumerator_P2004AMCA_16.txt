The problem is to find the least real number \( c \) such that for every \( x > c \), there exists a real \( y \) with \( y^{2002} = x - 2001^{2002} \).

Rearranging, this means for every \( x > c \), \( x - 2001^{2002} \) must be a perfect 2002-th power of some real number \( y \).

Since \( y^{2002} \geq 0 \) for all real \( y \) (even power), the expression \( x - 2001^{2002} \) must be nonnegative. Therefore, \( c \geq 2001^{2002} \).

At exactly \( x = 2001^{2002} \), \( y = 0 \) works.

For any \( x > 2001^{2002} \), \( y = \sqrt[2002]{x - 2001^{2002}} \) exists and is real.

Hence the minimal such \( c \) should be \( 2001^{2002} \).

Let's verify this for smaller values of the exponent using Python, printing all candidates for \( c \) generated similarly for smaller powers and bases, confirming this reasoning.

```python
# Enumerate and verify the minimal c for small bases and exponents,
# matching the problem pattern: least c s.t. ∀ x > c, ∃ y: y^n = x - b^n

def is_real_nth_root_possible(x, b, n):
    # y^n = x - b^n should be solvable for real y
    # Since n even, y^n >= 0 => x - b^n >=0
    return x >= b**n

def test_candidates(max_b=5, max_n=6):
    # We test for integers b and n, n even
    for b in range(1, max_b+1):
        for n in range(2, max_n+1, 2):  # even n
            c = b**n
            print(f"For base b={b}, exponent n={n}, candidate c={c}")
            # Test a few x values close to c
            test_xs = [c - 1, c, c + 1, c + 10]
            for x in test_xs:
                possible = is_real_nth_root_possible(x, b, n)
                print(f"  x={x}: real y exists? {possible}")
            print("-" * 30)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_candidates()
```
This will enumerate candidates for c = b^n for small bases and exponents, verifying no smaller c can work due to negative radicands for smaller x. This matches the conjectured answer \( 2001^{2002} \) for the problem.
