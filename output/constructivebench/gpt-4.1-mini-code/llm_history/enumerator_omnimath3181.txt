The problem involves finding triples (a, b, c) where each is a power of 3 (with exponents from 1 to 8), ordered so that a ≤ b ≤ c, and certain divisibility conditions hold involving products and modulo operations.

Below is a Python program that enumerates these triples and prints each one as found.

```python
# Enumerate triples (a,b,c), a,b,c = 3^i for i=1..8, a<=b<=c,
# satisfying (a*b) % c == 0, (a*c) % b == 0, (b*c) % a == 0.
# Print each triple as found.

def main():
    powers = [3**i for i in range(1,9)]
    for i, a in enumerate(powers):
        for j in range(i, len(powers)):
            b = powers[j]
            for k in range(j, len(powers)):
                c = powers[k]
                if (a*b) % c == 0 and (a*c) % b == 0 and (b*c) % a == 0:
                    print(f"({a}, {b}, {c})")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
