[write_program]
The problem is to find three two-digit numbers \(a, b, c\) (each between 10 and 99 inclusive) whose product is 636405, and then consider their sum. The goal is to find all such triples and their sums.

The program will:
- Iterate over all \(a, b, c\) in [10, 99]
- Check if \(a \times b \times c = 636405\)
- Print the triple and their sum when found
- Keep track of sums to identify possible values of the sum

Since the problem hints at a specific sum, after enumerating candidates, we can also print the minimum sum found (if any).

To be efficient, we only iterate \(a, b, c\) with \(a \le b \le c\) to avoid duplicates.

```python
# Enumerate triples of two-digit numbers (10 to 99) whose product is 636405.
# Print each triple and their sum immediately.
# Then print the minimum sum found.

TARGET = 636405
min_sum = None

for a in range(10, 100):
    if TARGET % a != 0:
        continue
    target_ab = TARGET // a
    for b in range(a, 100):
        if target_ab % b != 0:
            continue
        c = target_ab // b
        if c < b or c >= 100:
            continue
        if a * b * c == TARGET:
            s = a + b + c
            print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, sum={s}")
            if min_sum is None or s < min_sum:
                min_sum = s

if min_sum is not None:
    print(f"Minimum sum: {min_sum}")
```
