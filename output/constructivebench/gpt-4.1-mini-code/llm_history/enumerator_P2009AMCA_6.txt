The problem seems to involve expressing \(12^{m \cdot n}\) in some form \(P2009AMCA_6\_answer(m,n)\) involving natural numbers \(m,n\). Since the statement is not explicit, let's explore factorizations of powers of 12 for small \(m,n\). The base 12 factors into primes as \(2^2 \cdot 3\). We'll enumerate powers \(12^{m \cdot n}\) for small \(m,n\) and express each power in terms of prime factors for clues about the underlying formula.

```python
# Enumerate factorizations of 12^(m*n) for small m,n to investigate patterns.
from math import log2

def prime_factors(n):
    # Return prime factorization of n as dict {prime: exponent}
    pf = {}
    d = 2
    while d * d <= n:
        while n % d == 0:
            pf[d] = pf.get(d, 0) + 1
            n //= d
        d += 1
    if n > 1:
        pf[n] = pf.get(n, 0) + 1
    return pf

print("Enumerations of 12^(m*n) and their prime factorization for 1 <= m,n <= 5")
for m in range(1, 6):
    for n in range(1, 6):
        exp = m * n
        val = 12 ** exp
        # 12 = 2^2 * 3^1, so 12^(m*n) = 2^{2*m*n} * 3^{m*n}
        # But we verify prime_factors(val) matches this.
        pf = prime_factors(val)
        # Printing exact powers rather than approximations
        print(f"m={m}, n={n}, 12^(m*n) = {val}")
        print(f" prime factors: {pf}")
        # Check consistency with formula: 2^(2*m*n), 3^(m*n)
        expected_pf = {2: 2*exp, 3: exp}
        print(f" expected: {expected_pf}")
        print()
```
