Ground Truth Answer: 738826
Proposed Answer: 8 * factorial 9 / 4 + 4 * factorial 7 / 2 + 4 * factorial 6 + 4 * factorial 4 + factorial 3 + factorial 2 + factorial 2
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is algebraically equivalent to the original expression. The only change is simplifying 8 * (factorial 9) / (2 * 2) to 8 * factorial 9 / 4, which is mathematically identical since (2 * 2) = 4. All other terms remain unchanged. Both expressions would evaluate to the same ground truth answer of 738826 when computed.
