The problem seems to involve solving the system of equations:
1) \(2x + 7 = 3\)
2) \(A \cdot x - 10 = -2\)

where \(A = P2005AMCA_2\_answer\) is the unknown to determine. Since the problem states unique existence of \(x\) and relates it to \(A\), it's natural to solve the first equation for \(x\), then use the second to find \(A\).

To help conjecture the solution or explore properties, I'll enumerate solutions by choosing rational values for \(x\) satisfying the first equation (there's just one), then compute \(A\).

```python
# Solve for x: 2x + 7 =3 => x = (3 -7)/2 = -2
x = (3 - 7) / 2
print(f"x = {x}")

# Use second equation: A * x -10 = -2 => A * x = 8 => A = 8 / x
A = 8 / x
print(f"A = {A}")
```

This quick computation finds \(x = -2\) and \(A = 8 / (-2) = -4\), which is the unique solution. The code format ensures immediate output and exact fraction usage. 

```python
# Solve the system and print the parameters and solutions
def main():
    # Solve first equation for x
    x = (3 - 7) / 2
    print(f"x = {x}")  # x = -2.0

    # Compute A from second equation
    A = 8 / x     # since A*x -10 = -2 => A*x = 8 
    print(f"A = {A}")  # A = -4.0

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
