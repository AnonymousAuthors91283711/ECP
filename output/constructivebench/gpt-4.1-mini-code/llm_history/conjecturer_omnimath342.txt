theorem omnimath342 :
  IsLeast {k : ℕ | 0 < k ∧ ∀ (V : Type) [Fintype V] (hV : Fintype.card V = 2016) 
    (E : V → V), Injective E → 
    ∃ (P : V → Fin k), ∀ (v w : V), P v = P w → 
    ∀ n ≤ 28, (E^[n]) v ≠ w} 
  omnimath342_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: # Testing set size N = 6
# Number of injective mappings (permutations): 720
k=1 too small for sample E index 1
k=2 too small for sample E index 3
k=3 too small for sample E index 9
Possible k=4 for size 6
# Testing set size N = 8
# Number of injective mappings (permutations): 40320
k=1 too small for sample E index 1
k=2 too small for sample E index 3
k=3 too small for sample E index 9
Possible k=4 for size 8. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
