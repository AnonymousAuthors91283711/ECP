Ground Truth Answer: 1512
Proposed Answer: (9 : ℕ) * 111
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is summing the digit sums of all numbers in the form 9*(k+1) where k ranges from 0 to 110 (Finset.range 111).

2. The numbers being considered are: 9, 18, 27, ..., 999 (since 9*111=999)

3. For any number 9*m where 1 ≤ m ≤ 111:
   - The digit sum of 9*m is always 9 (this holds true for all multiples of 9 up to 999)
   - Example: 9→9, 18→1+8=9, 27→2+7=9, ..., 999→9+9+9=27, but wait 999 is 9*111 and its digit sum is 27, not 9

4. The proposed answer is 9*111=999, which would be correct if all numbers had digit sum 9, but 999 has digit sum 27.

5. There are 110 numbers (9*1 to 9*110) with digit sum 9, and 1 number (9*111=999) with digit sum 27.

6. Correct calculation: 110*9 + 27 = 990 + 27 = 1017, which doesn't match the ground truth of 1512.

Wait, this suggests neither answer is correct. However, the ground truth is given as 1512, which suggests I might be misunderstanding the problem.

Looking again: The range is (Finset.range 111).map (9*(k+1)), so k goes from 0 to 110, meaning numbers are 9*(1) to 9*(111), which is 9 to 999.

But the digit sums:
- 9 to 99: digit sums are 9 (9,18,...,99→9+9=18)
- 108 to 999: some have digit sums 9 (108,117,...,990→9+9+0=18), others more

This is more complex than initially thought. The proposed answer (999) is clearly incorrect, but the ground truth (1512) might be correct based on actual summation.
