The problem involves two quadratic polynomials with real coefficients. Polynomial \(P\) has roots \(r_1, r_2\), parameterized by \(T\), and \(Q\) is another quadratic depending on \(r_1, r_2\). Our goal is to find the sum of coefficients of \(Q\):

\[
Q = X^2 + (r_1 + r_2 + 2) X + (r_1 r_2 + r_1 + r_2)
\]

Sum of coefficients of \(Q\) is:

\[
Q(1) = 1 + (r_1 + r_2 + 2) + (r_1 r_2 + r_1 + r_2)
\]

We want to enumerate sample values of \(T\), compute roots \(r_1, r_2\) of \(P\), and then compute the sum of \(Q\) coefficients. This may help guess a closed form.

```python
import math

def roots_of_P(T):
    # P = x^2 + T x + 800
    # roots r1,r2 satisfy r1 + r2 = -T, r1 r2 = 800
    D = T*T - 4*800
    if D < 0:
        return None  # no real roots
    sqrt_D = math.sqrt(D)
    r1 = (-T + sqrt_D)/2
    r2 = (-T - sqrt_D)/2
    return r1, r2

print("T, r1, r2, Q_coeff_sum")

# Enumerate T from -100 to 100 with step 20 to keep output short
for T in range(-100, 101, 20):
    roots = roots_of_P(T)
    if roots is None:
        print(f"T={T}: no real roots")
        continue
    r1, r2 = roots
    Q_coeff_sum = 1 + (r1 + r2 + 2) + (r1 * r2 + r1 + r2)
    print(f"T={T:.1f}, r1={r1:.2f}, r2={r2:.2f}, sum(Q_coeffs)={Q_coeff_sum:.2f}")
```
This will print sample values of \(T\), roots, and sum of Q's coefficients, enabling conjecture.
