abbrev omnimath1563_answer : ℕ × ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath1563 :
  let people := 5
  let questions := 5
  let total_outcomes := 2^(people * questions)
  let favorable_outcomes := 255 * 2^17  -- Computed combinatorially
  let p := favorable_outcomes / total_outcomes
  ∃ a b : ℕ, a % 2 = 1 ∧ p = a / (2^b : ℝ) ∧ 100 * a + b = 25517 ∧ (a, b) = omnimath1563_answer := by sorry
