Ground Truth Answer: 1
Proposed Answer: 0
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the number of real solutions to the equation 2003^x + 2004^x = 2005^x.

2. For x=1: 2003 + 2004 = 4007 > 2005, so x=1 is too large.
For x=0: 1 + 1 = 1 → 2 = 1, which is false.
For x=2: 2003² + 2004² ≈ 8,024,000 + 8,016,000 = 16,040,000 vs 2005² ≈ 4,020,000, so x=2 is too small.

3. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be at least one solution between 1 and 2 since the difference (2003^x + 2004^x - 2005^x) changes from positive to negative.

4. The function f(x) = 2003^x + 2004^x - 2005^x is strictly decreasing for x > 0 (can be shown by derivative), meaning there can be only one solution.

The ground truth answer (1) is correct, while the proposed answer (0) is incorrect as there is exactly one real solution.
