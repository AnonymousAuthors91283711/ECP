The problem presents three average equations for real numbers \(a,b,c,d,e\):

1) \(\frac{a+b+c}{3} = 16\)
2) \(\frac{c+d+e}{3} = 26\)
3) \(\frac{a+b+c+d+e}{5} = 20\)

We are to find \(c\).

Let's enumerate possible values for \(a,b,c,d,e\) consistent with these equations using a Python program. The program will scan integer values for \(a,b,c,d,e\) within a reasonable range, filter by the average conditions (with exact division), and print each found value of \(c\).

This will help us conjecture the true value of \(c\).

```python
# Enumerate integer solutions for a,b,c,d,e satisfying the average equations with exact values.
# Print c values immediately upon finding solutions.

def main():
    # Given averages:
    avg1 = 16
    avg2 = 26
    avg3 = 20
    
    # Ranges chosen to keep sums close to total sum implied by averages:
    # sum of a,b,c -> 3*16=48; sum of c,d,e -> 3*26=78; sum of all five -> 5*20=100
    # We'll try a,b,c,d,e in [0..50] (a guess)
    
    found_c = set()
    for a in range(0, 51):
        for b in range(0, 51):
            sum_ab = a + b
            # c must satisfy (a+b+c)/3=16 => c = 48 - (a+b)
            c = 48 - sum_ab
            # c must be integer within [0..50]
            if not (0 <= c <= 50):
                continue
            
            # similarly from (c+d+e)/3=26 => d+e = 78 - c
            sum_de = 78 - c
            # now d,e integers >=0, sum to sum_de, both <=50
            # enumerate d,e pairs:
            for d in range(0, 51):
                e = sum_de - d
                if 0 <= e <= 50:
                    # check total sum: a+b+c+d+e == 100
                    if (a + b + c + d + e) == 100:
                        # valid solution found
                        if c not in found_c:
                            print(f"Found c = {c} with a={a}, b={b}, d={d}, e={e}")
                            found_c.add(c)
    # After enumeration print unique c values
    if found_c:
        c_values = sorted(found_c)
        print(f"Unique possible c values found: {c_values}")
    else:
        print("No solution found in given integer range.")
