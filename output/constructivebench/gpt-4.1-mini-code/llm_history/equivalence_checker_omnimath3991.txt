    (2*cake_price + 2*bagel_price = omnimath3991_answer * cupcake_price) := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 13/4
Proposed Answer: 5
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem presents a system of equations with variables cake_price (x), cupcake_price (y), and bagel_price (z):
   - x + 2y + 3z = 3x + z
   - 3x + z = 6y
   - 2x + 2z = answer * y

2. Simplifying the first equation: x + 2y + 3z = 3x + z → 2y + 2z = 2x → y + z = x

3. Second equation: 3x + z = 6y
   Substitute x from first simplification: 3(y + z) + z = 6y → 3y + 3z + z = 6y → 4z = 3y → z = (3/4)y

4. Now x = y + z = y + (3/4)y = (7/4)y

5. Third equation: 2x + 2z = answer * y
   Substitute x and z: 2*(7/4)y + 2*(3/4)y = answer*y → (14/4)y + (6/4)y = answer*y → (20/4)y = answer*y → 5 = answer

The ground truth answer is 13/4 (3.25), but through correct algebraic manipulation, we arrive at 5. The proposed answer matches our derivation.
