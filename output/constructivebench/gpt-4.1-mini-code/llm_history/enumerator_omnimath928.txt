The problem concerns: finding the greatest integer d that can be represented as the difference between the digit sums of x+2019 and x, for natural x>0.

We enumerate x from 1 up to some threshold, say 10000, and compute d = sum_digits(x+2019) - sum_digits(x). We print all unique d found, and track the maximum one.

This should give us a conjecture about the maximal difference.

```python
def digit_sum(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

def main():
    max_d = None
    seen = set()
    limit = 10000  # upper bound for x to check
    SUB = 2019
    for x in range(1, limit+1):
        d = digit_sum(x+SUB) - digit_sum(x)
        if d not in seen:
            seen.add(d)
            print("d =", d, "at x =", x)
        if (max_d is None) or (d > max_d):
            max_d = d
    print("Maximum d found:", max_d)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
