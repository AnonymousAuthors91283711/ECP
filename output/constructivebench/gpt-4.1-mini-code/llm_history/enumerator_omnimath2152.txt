This problem asks to find all positive integer pairs \((a,b)\) such that:
\[
(2a+1) \mid (3b-1) \quad \text{and} \quad (2b+1) \mid (3a-1).
\]

We'll enumerate small \((a,b)\) pairs and check these divisibility conditions, printing each solution as found, to conjecture the solution set.

```python
# Enumerate positive integers a,b and check (2a+1)|(3b-1) and (2b+1)|(3a-1).
# Print solutions immediately afterwards.
# We'll check a,b up to 50 for manageable output length.

def divides(x, y):
    return y % x == 0

print("Enumerating (a,b) with a,b>0, up to 50:")

max_val = 50

for a in range(1, max_val+1):
    two_a_p1 = 2*a + 1
    three_a_m1 = 3*a - 1
    for b in range(1, max_val+1):
        two_b_p1 = 2*b + 1
        three_b_m1 = 3*b - 1

        if divides(two_a_p1, three_b_m1) and divides(two_b_p1, three_a_m1):
            print(f"(a,b)=({a},{b}) satisfies conditions")

# Let's highlight the minimal such pairs found:
print("\nMinimal solution candidates found:")
solutions = []
for a in range(1, max_val+1):
    two_a_p1 = 2*a + 1
    three_a_m1 = 3*a - 1
    for b in range(1, max_val+1):
        two_b_p1 = 2*b + 1
        three_b_m1 = 3*b - 1
        if divides(two_a_p1, three_b_m1) and divides(two_b_p1, three_a_m1):
            solutions.append((a,b))

solutions = sorted(solutions)
for s in solutions:
    print(s)

# This enumeration helps conjecture the structure of the solution set.
