Ground Truth Answer: 27720
Proposed Answer: 77 * 1000
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest natural number n such that there are exactly 77,000 quadruples (a,b,c,d) where:
   - The GCD of all four numbers is 77
   - The LCM of all four numbers is n

2. The ground truth answer is 27720, which factors as 77 × 360.

3. The proposed answer is 77 × 1000 = 77000.

Analysis:
- The GCD condition tells us all numbers must be multiples of 77.
- The LCM must be a multiple of 77, but 77000 is not a minimal solution.
- 27720 is indeed the minimal such number that satisfies both conditions and gives exactly 77,000 solutions.
- The proposed answer of 77000 is much larger than the minimal solution and doesn't satisfy the "IsLeast" condition in the theorem.
