abbrev P2017AMCA_3_answer : Prop := sorry
theorem P2017AMCA_3 : P2017AMCA_3_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: ∀ (A : Prop) (got_right : ℕ → Prop) (multiple_choice_questions : Set ℕ),
  (A ↔ ∀ q ∈ multiple_choice_questions, got_right q) →
  (¬A → ∃ q ∈ multiple_choice_questions, ¬got_right q)
Proposed Answer: ∃ a b c : ℕ, a^2 + b^2 = c^2 ∧ a = 3 ∧ b = 4 ∧ c = 5 ∨ a = 6 ∧ b = 8 ∧ c = 10
