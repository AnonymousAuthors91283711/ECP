[write_program]
The problem asks to find triples of positive integers \((a,b,c)\) such that

\[
\gcd(a^2, b^2) + \gcd(a, bc) + \gcd(b, ac) + \gcd(c, ab) = 199.
\]

We want to enumerate such triples and print them immediately when found.

Key observations:
- \(\gcd(a^2, b^2) = (\gcd(a,b))^2\).
- The gcd terms involve \(a, b, c\) multiplied in various ways.
- Since the sum is fairly large (199), \(a,b,c\) are likely not tiny, but since the max output is restricted, we limit search to small values for efficiency.

The program:
- Enumerate \(a,b,c\) in a small range (1 to 20) to keep output small.
- Compute each gcd and sum.
- Print when sum equals 199.

This will help discover candidates and conjecture the answer.

```python
# Enumerate positive triples (a,b,c) with gcd expressions summing to 199, print immediate results

import math

def main():
    MAX = 20  # limit search space for efficiency
    found = []
    for a in range(1, MAX+1):
        for b in range(1, MAX+1):
            gcd_ab = math.gcd(a,b)
            gcd_ab_sq = gcd_ab * gcd_ab  # gcd(a^2,b^2) = gcd(a,b)^2
            for c in range(1, MAX+1):
                sum_gcd = gcd_ab_sq \
                    + math.gcd(a, b*c) \
                    + math.gcd(b, a*c) \
                    + math.gcd(c, a*b)
                if sum_gcd == 199:
                    print(f"Found triple: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}")
                    found.append((a,b,c))

    # Print extremal answers if needed (e.g. minimal sum with triple) - not requested here.
    if not found:
        print("No triples found with sum 199 in range 1..20")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
