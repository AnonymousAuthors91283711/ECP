The problem describes a set of real numbers \( a \) for which there does not exist a sequence \( x:\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{R} \) starting at \( x_0 = a \) and satisfying the recurrence 
\[
x_{n+1} = \frac{x_n + \alpha}{\beta x_n + 1}.
\]
The condition is that \(\alpha \beta > 0\).

To explore this, let's enumerate possible starting values \(a\) and simulate a few steps of the sequence to see if it remains well-defined (denominator non-zero) to identify which \(a\) do or don't yield valid sequences. We'll print the value \(a\) if the sequence runs without division by zero for, say, up to 10 steps; otherwise, we'll note failure. We will try this for multiple small sample \(\alpha,\beta\) with \(\alpha\beta > 0\).

This exploration can help conjecture the characterization of the excluded set.

```python
# enumerator.py
def sequence_defined(a, alpha, beta, steps=10):
    x = a
    for n in range(steps):
        denom = beta * x + 1
        if denom == 0:
            return False
        x = (x + alpha) / denom
    return True

# Sample alpha and beta values with product > 0
samples = [(1, 2), (0.5, 0.5), (2, 1), (-1, -2), (-0.5, -0.5), (-2, -1)]

print("Exploring sequences x_{n+1} = (x_n + α) / (β x_n + 1) with αβ > 0")
for alpha, beta in samples:
    print(f"\nα = {alpha}, β = {beta}")
    # Test starting a in a range; avoid large intervals to limit output
    for a_int in range(-3, 4):
        a = float(a_int)
        defined = sequence_defined(a, alpha, beta)
        if defined:
            print(f"  a = {a}: sequence exists for {10} steps")
        else:
            print(f"  a = {a}: sequence breaks (division by zero)")

# End of enumeration
print("\nNote: 'sequence breaks' indicates no sequence as defined by problem")
```
This code systematically checks for existence of sequences from initial values \(a\) under given \(\alpha, \beta\) and prints immediate findings, helping identify which \(a\) fail to produce sequences, shedding light on omnimath4202_answer.
