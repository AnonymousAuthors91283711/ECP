[write_program]
This system of equations looks like a small integer problem: find natural numbers p and n such that p + n = 13, n + 1 = p, and then compute p + 5n. The program enumerates possible p, n pairs that satisfy the constraints and prints p, n, and the value p + 5n.

```python
# Enumerate natural numbers p, n with p + n = 13 and n + 1 = p, then output p + 5*n
def main():
    total = 13
    for n in range(total + 1):
        p = total - n
        if n + 1 == p:
            val = p + 5 * n
            print(f"p={p}, n={n}, p+5n={val}")
            # Since n+1=p is strict, no further checking needed
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
