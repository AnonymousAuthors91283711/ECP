The problem asks to find the greatest natural number k such that there exists a subset "colored" of a 6x6 grid with 6k elements (cells), and for every 3x3 subgrid, there is at least one cell not in "colored". In other words:

- colored is a subset of all (i,j) pairs with i,j in 0..5,
- |colored| = 6*k,
- For every choice of 3 row indices and 3 column indices, the 3x3 subgrid formed is not fully contained in colored (there is at least one cell outside colored),
- We want the maximum possible k.

We need to find the maximum k for which such a set colored exists.

Because the problem is about 6x6 grid and 3x3 subgrids, parameters are fixed. We'll enumerate k from 1 upwards to a threshold (like 12, since 6*12=72 which is the whole grid), and try to find colored of size 6*k satisfying the condition.

To check the condition for a candidate colored: For all C(6,3)=20 subsets of rows and columns respectively, check if the 3x3 subgrid has at least one cell outside colored.

Because the problem is complex, a brute force over all subsets of size 6*k is too large. Instead, we can attempt to verify condition for certain large sets colored (like full rows, full columns, or specific patterns) or search over candidates by heuristic or by gradually increasing k and printing possible candidates.

We will print k and the set colored if it satisfies the subgrid condition. For this enumerator, we will only try some structured candidates: e.g., color by rows, by columns, or a checkerboard pattern, and check if the subgrid condition holds.

We'll print candidates as we find them.

```python
# Enumerate candidate colored sets on 6x6 grid of size 6*k
# For simplicity, try simple candidates: entire rows, entire columns, checkerboard with k*6 cells
# Check condition: For every 3-row subset and 3-col subset, some cell outside colored in subgrid

from itertools import combinations, product

N = 6
row_indices = range(N)
col_indices = range(N)

def check_condition(colored):
    # For every 3-row and 3-col subset, check if subgrid not fully contained in colored
    for rows in combinations(row_indices, 3):
        for cols in combinations(col_indices, 3):
            # Subgrid cells
            subgrid = {(r,c) for r in rows for c in cols}
            # Check if subgrid subset of colored
            if subgrid.issubset(colored):
                return False
    return True

def print_candidate(k, colored):
    print(f"k={k}, colored size={len(colored)}")
    print(sorted(colored))

print("Trying k from 1 to 10\n")

# Try k from 1 to 10
for k in range(1, 11):
    target_size = 6*k
    
    # Candidate 1: color first k rows fully
    if k <= N:
        colored = {(r,c) for r in range(k) for c in col_indices}
        if len(colored) == target_size and check_condition(colored):
            print_candidate(k, colored)
    
    # Candidate 2: color first k columns fully
    if k <= N:
        colored = {(r,c) for r in row_indices for c in range(k)}
        if len(colored) == target_size and check_condition(colored):
            print_candidate(k, colored)
    
    # Candidate 3: checkerboard pattern choosing k rows mod 2 == 0, for instance
    # To get exactly 6*k cells, select k rows fully? Already done.
    # So try something else:
    # Try k rows fully and remove some cells to get exact size (skip for simplicity)

# Try checkerboard pattern with all (r+c)%2==0 cells colored (18 cells)
checkerboard = {(r,c) for r in row_indices for c in col_indices if (r+c)%2==0}
k_cb = len(checkerboard)//6
if check_condition(checkerboard):
    print_candidate(k_cb, checkerboard)

# Try complement of checkerboard for comparison
checkerboard_comp = {(r,c) for r in row_indices for c in col_indices if (r+c)%2==1}
k_cbc = len(checkerboard_comp)//6
if check_condition(checkerboard_comp):
    print_candidate(k_cbc, checkerboard_comp)
