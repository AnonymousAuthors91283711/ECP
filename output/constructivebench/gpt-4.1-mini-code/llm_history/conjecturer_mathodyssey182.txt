[conjecture_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

open Real

abbrev mathodyssey182_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem mathodyssey182 (x : ℝ) : 
  4 * (x + 4) = 24 + 3 * (2 * x - 2) ↔ x = mathodyssey182_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Equation: 4*(x+4) = 24 + 3*(2*x - 2)
Potential solutions:
-1

Enumerating x values and checking equation equality:
x = -1 satisfies the equation: 12 = 12. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
