This problem asks to find the least natural number \( c \) such that there exist natural numbers \( a < b < c \) satisfying both \( b - a = c - b \) and \( c \cdot a = b^2 \).

From \( b - a = c - b \), \( a, b, c \) form an arithmetic progression with common difference \( d = b - a = c - b \). So we can write \( b = a + d \) and \( c = a + 2d \).

The second condition \( c \cdot a = b^2 \) becomes:
\[
(a + 2d) \cdot a = (a + d)^2 \implies a^2 + 2ad = a^2 + 2ad + d^2 \implies 0 = d^2
\]

This implies \( d = 0 \), but \( d = b - a > 0 \), a contradiction.

Wait, let's re-check algebra carefully:

\[
(a + 2d)a = (a + d)^2 \implies a^2 + 2ad = a^2 + 2ad + d^2 \implies 0 = d^2
\]

There is no solution if \( d > 0 \). Thus, no solutions exist with natural numbers \( a,b,c \).

However, since problem asks to output enumeration to find candidates, we try small values of \( a, b, c \) with \( a < b < c \leq 100 \) and check conditions.

We'll implement a Python program enumerating such triples and printing any found candidates.

```python
# Enumerate triples (a,b,c) with 1 <= a < b < c <= 100 satisfying:
# 1) b - a = c - b
# 2) c * a = b * b

for c in range(3, 101):
    for b in range(2, c):
        a = 2 * b - c   # from b - a = c - b => a = 2b - c
        if a < b and a > 0:
            if c * a == b * b:
                print(f"Found solution: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}")
print("Enumeration complete.")
```

This will print all valid triples (a,b,c) found up to c=100. Since the problem asks for the smallest such \( c \), this enumeration assists conjecture.
