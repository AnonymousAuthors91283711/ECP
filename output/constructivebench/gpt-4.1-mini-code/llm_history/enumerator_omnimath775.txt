The problem asks to find the least natural number \( N > 1 \) such that \( N = a(2a - 1) \) for some \( a \), and for all integers \( k \in [1,10] \), \( k \) divides \( \frac{N (N-1)}{2} \).

To assist in conjecturing the answer, the Python program below enumerates candidates \( a \) within a reasonable range, computes \( N = a(2a - 1) \), and checks divisibility requirements. It prints all \( N \) that fit the criteria immediately as discovered.

```python
# Enumerate candidates N = a*(2a-1), with 1 < N and check that all k in [1..10]
# divide (N*(N-1))//2. Print all satisfying N, then print the minimal one found.

def divides_all(N):
    val = (N*(N-1))//2
    # check divisibility by all k in 1..10
    for k in range(1, 11):
        if val % k != 0:
            return False
    return True

def main():
    results = []
    print("a  N = a*(2a-1) satisfying divisibility:")
    for a in range(2, 101):  # test a up to 100 for efficiency/coverage
        N = a*(2*a - 1)
        if divides_all(N):
            print(f"a={a}, N={N}")
            results.append(N)
    if results:
        print("Minimal N found:", min(results))
    else:
        print("No N found in tested range satisfying conditions.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
