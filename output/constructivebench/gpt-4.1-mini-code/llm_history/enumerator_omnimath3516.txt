The problem states a multiplication of scaled numbers: \(100 \times \frac{120}{100} \times \frac{150}{100}\). To assist in conjecturing the exact answer, I will enumerate possible ways to evaluate this expression carefully in integers or exact fractions, then print each intermediate result.

```python
# Enumerate the exact values of the expression 100 * (120/100) * (150/100)
# and also print intermediate steps and final result as exact fractions and integers.

from fractions import Fraction

def main():
    base = 100
    factors = [Fraction(120, 100), Fraction(150, 100)]

    # Print base value
    print(f"Base value: {base}")

    # Multiply stepwise and print intermediates
    current = Fraction(base, 1)
    for i, f in enumerate(factors, start=1):
        current *= f
        print(f"After multiplying by factor {i} = {f}: value = {current}")

    # Check if the final value is an integer
    if current.denominator == 1:
        print(f"Final answer as integer: {current.numerator}")
    else:
        print(f"Final answer as exact fraction: {current}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
