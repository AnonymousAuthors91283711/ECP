Ground Truth Answer: 1002
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for the smallest natural number c such that there exist numbers a < b < c where the system of equations has exactly one real solution x.

2. The ground truth answer is 1002, which suggests this is a complex problem requiring analysis of exponential and quadratic functions.

3. The proposed answer is 4, which seems too small considering the nature of the problem.

4. For c=4, the possible pairs (a,b) would be (1,2), (1,3), (2,3). Testing these:
   - For (1,2,4), the system would have multiple solutions
   - For (1,3,4), similar issues would arise
   - The uniqueness condition is unlikely to be satisfied with such small numbers

5. The ground truth answer of 1002 suggests the problem requires much larger numbers to satisfy the uniqueness condition.

Conclusion: The proposed answer is incorrect.

<<<False>>>
