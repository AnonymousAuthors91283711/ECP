This problem involves evaluating a probability-type integral over the unit square where the integrand tests whether floor(sqrt(x/y)) is even. To get insight, we enumerate over a fine grid of (x,y) values in (0,1)^2, compute floor(sqrt(x/y)), determine evenness, and estimate the measure ratio as the fraction of grid points satisfying the condition. This will approximate the ratio of the volume of the subset to the volume of the whole unit square (which is 1).

```python
import math

# We sample points (x,y) in the open unit square (0,1)^2 on a grid,
# skip x=0 or y=0 to avoid division by zero.
# For speed and to limit output, we use a modest grid size.

def even_floor_sqrt_ratio(grid_size=1000):
    count_even = 0
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, grid_size):
        x = i / grid_size
        for j in range(1, grid_size):
            y = j / grid_size
            val = math.sqrt(x / y)
            fl = math.floor(val)
            if fl % 2 == 0:
                count_even += 1
            total += 1
            # For brevity, only print every 10000th count with partial ratio
            if total % 10000 == 0:
                print(f"Checked {total} points, partial ratio: {count_even/total:.6f}")
    ratio = count_even / total
    print(f"Final estimate of ratio: {ratio:.8f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Enumerating ratio of points where floor(sqrt(x/y)) is even in (0,1)^2:")
