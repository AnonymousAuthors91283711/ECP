The problem involves two people, Amrita and Zhang, using paddling and swimming times with given speeds and total time. The goal is to find times t₁ and t₂ (for paddling and swimming respectively) that satisfy the equations described. The kayak idle time is related to these times.

We'll enumerate possible values of t₁ and t₂ in a reasonable granular range and try to solve the conditions to find all valid tuples. The problem parameters:

- paddle_speed = 7
- swim_speed = 2
- total_time = 1.5 hours

Steps:
- Iterate t₁ and t₂ from 0 to total_time with small increments (say 0.05).
- Check constraints and equations:
  - paddle_speed * t₁ + swim_speed * (total_time - t₁) == swim_speed * t₂ + paddle_speed * (total_time - t₂)
  - paddle_speed * t₁ == swim_speed * t₂
- Calculate kayak_idle_time = total_time - (t₁ + (total_time - t₂))
- Output found tuples and kayak idle time in seconds since the provided answer is divided by 60.

We print each valid solution immediately when found and limit the output length.

```python
# Enumerate possible values of t1, t2 for the given problem
# paddle_speed = 7 units/hour
# swim_speed = 2 units/hour
# total_time = 1.5 hours

paddle_speed = 7
swim_speed = 2
total_time = 1.5
eps = 1e-6  # tolerance for float comparison
step = 0.05

print(f"Parameters: paddle_speed={paddle_speed}, swim_speed={swim_speed}, total_time={total_time}")

def approx_eq(a, b, tol=eps):
    return abs(a - b) < tol

solutions = []
for i in range(int(total_time / step) + 1):
    t1 = i * step
    for j in range(int(total_time / step) + 1):
        t2 = j * step
        if 0 <= t1 <= total_time and 0 <= t2 <= total_time:
            lhs = paddle_speed * t1 + swim_speed * (total_time - t1)
            rhs = swim_speed * t2 + paddle_speed * (total_time - t2)
            cond1 = approx_eq(lhs, rhs)
            cond2 = approx_eq(paddle_speed * t1, swim_speed * t2)
            if cond1 and cond2:
                kayak_idle = total_time - (t1 + (total_time - t2))  # idle time in hours
                kayak_idle_seconds = kayak_idle * 3600
                print(f"t1={t1:.2f}, t2={t2:.2f}, kayak_idle_time={kayak_idle_seconds:.2f} sec")
                solutions.append((t1, t2, kayak_idle_seconds))

if solutions:
    # Output minimum kayak idle time found, since problem suggests finding such a value
    min_idle = min(s[2] for s in solutions)
    print(f"Minimum kayak idle time (seconds): {min_idle:.2f}")
else:
    print("No solutions found.")
```
