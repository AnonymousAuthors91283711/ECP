The problem defines an integer built from digits \(d\) in the list `omnimath3381_answer` via the folding formula:

\[
n \mapsto n \times (-4) + d
\]

starting from 0 and producing \(-2013\).

We want to find all lists of natural numbers (digits) \(d_i\) that satisfy:

\[
d_0 -4(d_1 -4(d_2 -4(\cdots))) = -2013.
\]

In fact, this is like expressing \(-2013\) in base \(-4\) with digits \(d_i\).

Digits should satisfy \(0 \leq d_i < 4\) (usual base digits assumption), but the problem does not set this explicitly.

Hence, let's enumerate small lists of digits (base \(-4\) digits from 0 to 3) that produce \(-2013\).

We'll try from length 1 up to length 10 to find all such expansions and print them immediately.

```python
# Enumerate digit lists d = [d0, d1, ..., d_k] with digits in 0..3
# so that foldr((d,n) -> n*(-4)+d, 0, d) = -2013.
# This is representing n in base -4.
# The program tries lengths 1 to 12, enumerates all digit lists and checks the value.
# Prints all solutions immediately.

TARGET = -2013
BASE = -4
MAX_LENGTH = 12  # enough to represent 2013 in base 4 or -4

def foldr_negbase(digits):
    n = 0
    for d in reversed(digits):
        n = n * BASE + d
    return n

def main():
    from itertools import product
    # digits allowed: 0..3 (common base-4 digits)
    digits_range = range(4)
    found = []
    for length in range(1, MAX_LENGTH+1):
        # iterate all digits lists of given length
        for digits in product(digits_range, repeat=length):
            val = foldr_negbase(digits)
            if val == TARGET:
                print(f'Solution with length {length}: {list(digits)}')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
