Ground Truth Answer: {(1, 1), (3, 3)}
Proposed Answer: { (m, n) | m = n ∧ (m = 1 ∨ m = 3) }
<<<True>>>

Explanation: The proposed answer { (m, n) | m = n ∧ (m = 1 ∨ m = 3) } is exactly equivalent to the ground truth answer {(1, 1), (3, 3)}. Both expressions describe the same set of pairs where m and n are equal and either both 1 or both 3. The proposed answer uses set builder notation while the ground truth uses explicit enumeration, but they represent identical mathematical objects.
