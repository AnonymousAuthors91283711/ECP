The problem involves finding values of \(a \in \mathbb{R}\) such that the equation
\[
a (\sin x + \sin 2x) = \sin 3x
\]
has two distinct solutions \(x_1, x_2 \in (0, \pi)\) with \(x_1 \neq x_2\). The goal in the theorem is to characterize \(a\) as one of three distinct values \(p < q < r\) with \(p + q + r = \text{some constant}\).

This suggests investigating the function
\[
f_a(x) := a (\sin x + \sin 2x) - \sin 3x
\]
and for fixed values of \(a\), checking the number of distinct solutions in \((0, \pi)\).

We want to enumerate triples \((p, q, r)\) of distinct real numbers, candidates for \(a\), such that each coincides with a root \(a\) corresponding to the condition of two distinct solutions in \((0,\pi)\).

A practical approach: For sample values of \(a\) in some range, find \(x \in (0,\pi)\) solving the equation, then check if multiple distinct solutions exist. Track \(a\)-values for which the number of solutions changes (i.e., multiple roots), collect candidates, and sum triples.

The sine terms suggest the equation is transcendental but manageable for numerical root-finding and counting zeros using a fine grid.

Below is the enumerator program:

- Try sample \(a\) values from -5 to 5 with small step
- For each \(a\), evaluate \(g_a(x) = a(\sin x + \sin 2x) - \sin 3x\) on a fine grid in (0, π)
- Count sign changes (indicating zeros)
- Print the values of \(a\) for which there are at least two distinct zeros
- Store such \(a\)'s and try to find triples \(p < q < r\)
- Print such triples and their sums

```python
import math

def sign_changes(vals):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(len(vals) -1):
        if vals[i]*vals[i+1] < 0:
            cnt +=1
    return cnt

def f(a, x):
    return a*(math.sin(x) + math.sin(2*x)) - math.sin(3*x)

def main():
    # sample a values from -5 to 5 step 0.01
    a_candidates = []
    step_a = 0.005
    xs = [i*math.pi/1000 for i in range(1, 1000)] # avoid 0 and pi boundaries

    for i in range(int(-5/step_a), int(5/step_a)+1):
        a = i*step_a
        vals = [f(a,x) for x in xs]
        zeros = sign_changes(vals)
        if zeros >= 2:
            print(f"a={a:.5f} has {zeros} distinct zeros in (0,π)")
            a_candidates.append(a)

    # Extract distinct sorted a values with two or more zeros
    ac = sorted(set(round(a,5) for a in a_candidates))

    # Enumerate triples p<q<r from ac with spacing at least step_a
    print("\nTriples (p,q,r) from candidates with p<q<r:")
    n = len(ac)
    for i in range(n):
        p = ac[i]
        for j in range(i+1,n):
            q = ac[j]
            for k in range(j+1,n):
                r = ac[k]
                # print only some triples to limit output
                if r - p > 0.05: # spacing threshold
                    s = p+q+r
                    print(f"p={p:.5f}, q={q:.5f}, r={r:.5f}, sum={s:.5f}")

    # print minimal and maximal sum among triples
    sums = [p+q+r for i,p in enumerate(ac) for j,q in enumerate(ac) if j>i for k,r in enumerate(ac) if k>j]
    if sums:
        print(f"\nMinimum sum of triple candidates: {min(sums):.5f}")
        print(f"Maximum sum of triple candidates: {max(sums):.5f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This program outputs values of \(a\) where two or more solutions exist, lists possible triples, and their sums to assist in conjecturing the constant \(P2022AMCA\_17\_answer\).
