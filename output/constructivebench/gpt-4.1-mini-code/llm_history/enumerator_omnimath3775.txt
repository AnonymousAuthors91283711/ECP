[write_program]
This problem appears to ask for the least number n such that for every set of n red squares on an 8×8 grid, and every choice of 4 rows and 4 columns, there exists a red square outside those rows and columns. That is, no 4×4 subgrid is "red-free". We want to find the minimal cardinality n of a red set having this property.

To assist, the program will:
- Enumerate candidate sets of red squares.
- For various small values of n, and for all 4-subsets of rows and columns, check if any red set of that size can avoid having a red square outside them (i.e., check whether there is a set of red squares from which in any 4×4 block, some red lies outside that block).
- Since enumerating all sets of size n on 64 squares is huge, we will just illustrate on smaller parameters (like 4×4 grid with subsets of size 2), as the original problem is large.
- This will output candidates n checked, parameters used, and whether all such red sets satisfy the condition.

This program will enumerate smaller test instances and print outputs immediately.

```python
# Enumerate candidate answers for the minimal n with given constraints on a grid.
# Due to combinatorial explosion, we illustrate with smaller parameters:
# Grid size m x m, subsets of rows and columns of size k,
# checking all subsets of red squares of size n for the property.
# Adjust m, k, max_n below for tractability.

from itertools import combinations, product

def check_property(m, k, n):
    grid = list(range(m))  # Rows and columns: 0..m-1
    print(f"Parameters: grid {m}x{m}, subset size {k}, red set size {n}")
    all_positions = list(product(grid, grid))
    # Enumerate all red sets of size n
    red_sets = combinations(all_positions, n)
    
    # For each candidate red set, verify the property:
    # For every choice of rows and columns subsets of size k,
    # there exists a red square outside these rows and columns.
    # That means in each reds and subsets rows,cols:
    # ∃ (i,j) ∈ reds with i ∉ rows and j ∉ cols
    
    # To speed up, for fixed red set, check all subsets of rows and cols
    rows_subsets = list(combinations(grid, k))

                    # Actually, if all reds are inside rs × cs, then no red outside rs or cs
                    # We want at least one red outside (i∉rows and j∉cols), so property fails if all reds are inside the block
