The problem is to find \( N > 0 \) such that
\[
\frac{4 \times 16 + 6 \times N}{10 \times (16 + N)} = \frac{58}{100}.
\]

We can simplify and solve this equation for small integer values of \(N\) to verify the solution. The program will enumerate positive integers \(N\), compute the left-hand side exactly, and compare it to \( \frac{58}{100} \).

```python
from fractions import Fraction

target = Fraction(58, 100)
print(f"Target fraction: {target}")

# Enumerate positive integers N and check the fraction equality
for N in range(1, 50):
    numerator = 4 * 16 + 6 * N
    denominator = 10 * (16 + N)
    frac = Fraction(numerator, denominator)
    print(f"N={N}, fraction={frac}")
    if frac == target:
        print(f"Found N with exact equality: N = {N}")
        break
```
