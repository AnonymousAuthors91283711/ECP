Output cuts off here.. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<(202 - 200 + 1).choose 200>>> 

-- Explanation: Since a is strictly increasing with values between 0 and 202 inclusive, it is a strictly increasing sequence of length 200 from 203 elements, hence number of such sequences is 3 choose 200 = choose(3,200) = 3. But since 202 - 200 + 1 = 3, the answer is (202 - 200 + 1).choose 200.
