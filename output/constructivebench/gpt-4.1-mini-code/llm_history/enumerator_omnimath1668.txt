[write_program]
The problem concerns counting the number of distinct lists reachable from a given start list by a series of valid moves, where a valid move swaps adjacent pairs 'H' and 'M', or 'M' and 'T', or 'T' and 'H'. We want to enumerate all reachable permutations from the start list `['H', 'H', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'T', 'T']`.

I will write a Python program to generate all reachable states by BFS starting from the initial list, applying the valid moves, avoiding repeated states, and printing them as we discover them.

```python
from collections import deque

# The initial state as a list of chars
start = ['H', 'H', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'T', 'T']

# The valid swaps: pairs that can be swapped if adjacent
valid_pairs = [('H','M'), ('M','H'), ('M','T'), ('T','M'), ('T','H'), ('H','T')]

def neighbors(s):
    # yield all states reachable by swapping any valid adjacent pair
    lst = list(s)
    for i in range(len(lst)-1):
        if (lst[i], lst[i+1]) in valid_pairs:
            new_lst = lst[:]
            new_lst[i], new_lst[i+1] = new_lst[i+1], new_lst[i]
            yield tuple(new_lst)

def main():
    start_t = tuple(start)
    seen = set([start_t])
    queue = deque([start_t])
    count = 0
    
    while queue:
        state = queue.popleft()
        print(''.join(state))  # Print each reachable state immediately
        count += 1
        for nxt in neighbors(state):
            if nxt not in seen:
                seen.add(nxt)
                queue.append(nxt)

    print(f"Total reachable states: {count}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
