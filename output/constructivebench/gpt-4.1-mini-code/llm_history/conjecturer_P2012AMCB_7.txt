abbrev P2012AMCB_7_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem P2012AMCB_7 : 
  let pattern := [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]  -- 0 for red, 1 for green
  let totalRedLights := 21
  let redPositions := List.filter (fun n => pattern[n % 5]! = 0) (List.range (5 * totalRedLights))
  let thirdRed := (redPositions.get? 2).getD 0
  let twentyFirstRed := (redPositions.get? 20).getD 0
  ((twentyFirstRed - thirdRed) * 6 : ℚ) / 12 = P2012AMCB_7_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Parameters: pattern = [0,0,1,1,1], totalRedLights = 21
Number of red lights found: 21
3rd red light position: 5
21st red light position: 50
Computed value ((21st - 3rd)*6)/12 = 45 * 6 / 12 = 22.5
Exact result as fraction: 45/2 = 22.5. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
<<<45 / 2>>>
