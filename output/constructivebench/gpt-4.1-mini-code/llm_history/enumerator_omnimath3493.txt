The problem involves evaluating a set of expressions for a real number \( x < -2 \):

\[
\{x, x+2, \frac{x}{2}, x-2, 2x\}
\]

We want to find the least element (minimum value) of this set as a function of \( x \).

To conjecture the function \(\text{omnimath3493\_answer}(x)\) that gives the minimum for each \( x < -2 \), we enumerate these values at sample points \( x=-3, -4, -5 \), and print each candidate along with the minimum found.

```python
# Enumerate all candidate values for sample x and print the minimum among them
# for x in (-10 to -3), focusing on integer values less than -2.

def candidates(x):
    return [x, x + 2, x / 2, x - 2, 2 * x]

def main():
    print("x, candidates, minimum")
    for x in range(-10, -2):
        c = candidates(x)
        mins = min(c)
        # Print all candidates precisely and minimum
        print(f"x={x}, candidates={c}, min={mins}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
