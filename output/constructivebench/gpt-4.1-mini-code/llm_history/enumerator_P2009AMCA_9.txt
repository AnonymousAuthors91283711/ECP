The problem involves a functional equation of a quadratic polynomial f satisfying f(x+3) = 3x² + 7x + 4 and also f(x) = a x² + b x + c for all real x. We want to find a+b+c.

To assist solving this, we enumerate possible (a,b,c) that satisfy the equation for some sample x and then check if the polynomial equality holds in general.

We use the condition f(x+3) = 3x² + 7x +4 and f(x) = a x² + b x + c for all x.
Since f is quadratic, compute f(x+3) in terms of a,b,c:
f(x+3) = a(x+3)² + b(x+3) + c = a(x²+6x+9) + b x + 3 b + c = a x² + 6 a x + 9 a + b x + 3 b + c

Equate to 3 x² + 7 x + 4 and match coefficients:
- coefficient of x²: a = 3
- coefficient of x: 6 a + b = 7
- constant term: 9 a + 3 b + c = 4

From a=3:
6*3 + b =7 → 18 + b=7 → b= -11
Then constant term:
9*3 + 3*(-11) + c =4
27 -33 + c =4
-6 + c=4 → c=10

Sum: a + b + c=3 -11 +10=2

We write a Python program to verify this calculation by enumerating a,b,c near these values and print tuples where the polynomial identity holds exactly for multiple values.

```python
# Enumerate triple (a,b,c) near plausible values and test polynomial equality f(x+3)=3x²+7x+4
for a in [3]:
    for b in range(-15, -5):
        for c in range(0, 15):
            # Check identity for few sample x values to confirm
            holds = True
            for x in [-1,0,1]:
                lhs = a*(x+3)**2 + b*(x+3) + c
                rhs = 3*x**2 + 7*x +4
                if lhs != rhs:
                    holds = False
                    break
            if holds:
                print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, sum={a+b+c}")
```
This prints candidate triples and sums, helping conjecture the answer a+b+c=2.
