The problem involves checking collinearity of three points in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) whose coordinates depend on parameters \(a, b\), then relating this to a function \(omnimath647\_answer(a,b)\). We'll try to guess this function by enumerating \(a,b\) values, checking collinearity using determinants or vector cross products (as three points are collinear if the vectors between them are linearly dependent).

We output the candidate values of \(omnimath647\_answer(a,b)\) when the points are collinear, focusing on exact values for rational \(a,b\).

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def collinear(p1, p2, p3):
    # Three points p1,p2,p3 in R^3 are collinear iff vectors p2-p1 and p3-p1 are linearly dependent
    # i.e. their cross product is zero vector
    v1 = [p2[i] - p1[i] for i in range(3)]
    v2 = [p3[i] - p1[i] for i in range(3)]
    cp = [v1[1]*v2[2] - v1[2]*v2[1],
          v1[2]*v2[0] - v1[0]*v2[2],
          v1[0]*v2[1] - v1[1]*v2[0]]
    return cp == [0,0,0]

    # From the problem, the function omnimath647_answer(a,b) is unknown.
    # We'll test if collinearity holds and print potential values a,b and maybe an expression involving them
