Ground Truth Answer: 108
Proposed Answer: 37
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem describes a system of equations involving integers b, c, r, d with P2016AIMEII_1_answer as the main solution.

2. The ground truth answer is 108, which satisfies all the given conditions when plugged into the equations.

3. The proposed answer is 37. Let's test if this could work:
   - From b = 37 * r and c = 37 * r², and 37 + b + c = 444, we'd get 37(1 + r + r²) = 444 ⇒ 1 + r + r² = 12 ⇒ r² + r - 11 = 0
   - This quadratic has no integer solutions (solutions are irrational), so 37 cannot satisfy all conditions.

4. The ground truth 108 works because:
   - 108 + 144 + 192 = 444 (with r=4/3, but this would require non-integer values)
   - Wait, actually even 108 requires fractional r (4/3), so the problem might allow rational r
   - But 37 leads to no real solutions that satisfy all conditions
