The problem involves characterizing all real triples \((a,b,c)\) satisfying the system:
\[
\begin{cases}
a^2 + 2b^2 - 2bc = 16 \\
2ab - c^2 = 16
\end{cases}
\]
We want to enumerate solutions \((a,b,c)\) for small integer or rational values to gain insight into the structure of solutions.

```python
# Enumerate candidates (a,b,c) with small integer values and check the system
# Print all exact real triples satisfying the equations (within exact integer domain)
# This might reveal patterns or constraints on (a,b,c).

def is_integer_solution(a,b,c):
    return (a*a + 2*b*b - 2*b*c == 16) and (2*a*b - c*c == 16)

print("Enumerating integer (a,b,c) with -10 <= a,b,c <= 10 satisfying:")
print("a^2 + 2b^2 - 2bc = 16 and 2ab - c^2 = 16")

for a in range(-10,11):
    for b in range(-10,11):
        # Compute c candidates for the second equation: 2ab - c^2 = 16 => c^2 = 2ab - 16
        val = 2*a*b - 16
        if val < 0:
            continue  # c^2 cannot be negative for real c
        # c could be positive or negative sqrt(val) if integer
        cs = []
        root = int(val**0.5)
        if root*root == val:
            cs = [root, -root]
        for c in cs:
            # Check first equation exactly
            if a*a + 2*b*b - 2*b*c == 16:
                print(f"Exact integer solution: a={a}, b={b}, c={c}")
```
This code searches integral solutions in a feasible range, printing exact integer triples satisfying both equations immediately as they are found. This should help in conjecturing or disproving particular solution forms.
