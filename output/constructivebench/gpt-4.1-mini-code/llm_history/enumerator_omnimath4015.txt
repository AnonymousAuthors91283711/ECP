[write_program]
The problem involves finding all polynomials \( P \in \mathbb{R}[X] \) satisfying an inequality that compares evaluations at a linear transformation \( 2x + \alpha \) to a polynomial expression involving \( x^{20} + x^{19} \) and the evaluation at \( x \).

To gain insight, I will write a Python program to enumerate candidate polynomials \( P \) with small degrees (up to degree 4 for practicality), and for various values of \(\alpha\) in a small range (e.g., \(\alpha \in \{-1,0,1\}\)). The program will test the inequality for several sample \( x \) values and output any polynomials that satisfy the inequality for all tested \( x \) values.

This should help conjecture the form of \( P \) (which may be monomials or certain "extremal" polynomials) and potentially detect the unique polynomial \( \texttt{omnimath4015\_answer} \).

```python
# Enumerate candidate real polynomials P with degree <=4 and integer coefficients in [-3,3].
# For selected alpha in {-1,0,1}, check inequality:
#   P(2x + alpha) <= (x^20 + x^19)*P(x) for various x in a suitable test set.
# Print all polynomials passing the test.

def eval_poly(coeffs, x):
    # coeffs: list of coefficients, coeffs[i] for x^i
    return sum(c * x**i for i, c in enumerate(coeffs))

def poly_str(coeffs):
    terms = []
    for i, c in enumerate(coeffs):
        if abs(c) > 1e-8:
            if i == 0:
                terms.append(f"{c}")
            elif i == 1:
                terms.append(f"{c}*x")
            else:
                terms.append(f"{c}*x^{i}")
    return " + ".join(terms) if terms else "0"

def test_poly(coeffs, alpha, xs):
    for x in xs:
        Px = eval_poly(coeffs, x)
        if Px <= 0:
            # Because (x^20 + x^19) is positive for most x > 0,
            # we avoid division by zero or negative values which make inequality trivial.
            return False
        lhs = eval_poly(coeffs, 2*x + alpha)
        rhs = (x**20 + x**19) * Px
        if lhs > rhs + 1e-12:  # allow small epsilon for float errors
            return False
    return True
