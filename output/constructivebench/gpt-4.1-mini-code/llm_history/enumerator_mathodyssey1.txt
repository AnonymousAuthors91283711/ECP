The problem asks to find the smallest natural number \( n \) such that every subset \( T \) of \(\{1, 2, ..., 2024\}\) with size \( n \) which is pairwise coprime must contain a prime number.

In other words, the problem investigates the minimal size \( n \) so that any \( n \)-element subset of \(\{1,\ldots,2024\}\) with pairwise coprime elements contains at least one prime.

Our strategy:

1. Enumerate subsets \( T \subseteq \{1,...,2024\} \) with pairwise coprime elements *without any primes*.
2. Find the maximum cardinality of such subsets.
3. The answer \( n \) will be one more than this maximum size.

Because the problem space is huge, we simplify by enumerating primes and prime powers, and combinations thereof to construct pairwise coprime sets without primes.

Key insight: Any composite number whose prime factors are distinct will be coprime to numbers composed of disjoint prime factors.

Try:

- Collect the set of primes up to 2024.
- To avoid primes, consider sets made up of prime powers with exponent ≥ 2.
- Also consider 1, which is coprime with all.
- Maximize the size of prime-free, pairwise coprime subsets.
- Since primes are forbidden, these sets consist only of composite numbers with prime exponents ≥ 2.
- We'll enumerate all possible such sets with pairwise coprime elements to find the maximum size.

We focus on prime powers \(p^k\) with \(k \ge 2\), since primes are excluded.

Due to complexity, print all candidates of such sets and track the maximum size found.

The minimum \( n \) is one more than this maximum size.

```python
# This program enumerates large pairwise coprime sets without primes up to 2024,
# to find the minimal n such that every pairwise coprime set of size n contains a prime.
from math import sqrt

MAX_N = 2024

def is_prime(x):
    if x < 2:
        return False
    if x in (2, 3):
        return True
    if x%2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(sqrt(x))+1, 2):
        if x % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Collect primes up to MAX_N
primes = [p for p in range(2, MAX_N+1) if is_prime(p)]

# Collect prime powers with exponent >= 2 up to MAX_N
prime_powers = []
for p in primes:
    power = p*p
    while power <= MAX_N:
        prime_powers.append(power)
        power *= p

# Include 1 (coprime with all)
prime_powers.append(1)
prime_powers = sorted(prime_powers)

# We want to find largest subset of prime_powers with pairwise coprime elements and no primes
# Since these numbers are prime powers with distinct bases or 1, to be pairwise coprime,
# their prime bases must be distinct.
# So maximal size = number of distinct prime bases plus 1 if includes 1.

# Get prime bases used in prime_powers (excluding 1).
bases = set()
for x in prime_powers:
    if x == 1:
        continue
    # Find base prime
    for p in primes:
        if x % p == 0:
            bases.add(p)
            break

max_size = len(bases) + 1  # +1 for 1

print(f"Number of prime bases for prime powers ≥ 2: {len(bases)}")
print(f"Including 1, maximal coprime set without primes has size: {max_size}")
print(f"Therefore minimal n is {max_size + 1}")

# Print example elements of such maximal coprime set without primes:
example_set = [1]
used_bases = set()
for x in prime_powers:
    if x == 1:
        continue
    # find base prime
    for p in primes:
        if x % p == 0:
            if p not in used_bases:
                example_set.append(x)
                used_bases.add(p)
            break

print("Example maximal pairwise coprime set with no primes:")
print(sorted(example_set))
