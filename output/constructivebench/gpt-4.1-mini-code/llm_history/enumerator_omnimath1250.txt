The problem sums the products i*j*k over all triples (i,j,k) of natural numbers less than 17 with i+j+k=17. We'll enumerate all such triples and compute the sum of i*j*k. The ranges are from 0 to 16 inclusive.

```python
# Enumerate triples (i,j,k) with i,j,k in [0..16], i+j+k=17.
# Sum i*j*k for all such triples.

def main():
    limit = 17
    total_sum = 0
    print(f"Enumerating triples (i,j,k) with i+j+k=17, 0 ≤ i,j,k ≤ {limit-1}:\n")
    for i in range(limit):
        # j+k = 17 - i
        target = 17 - i
        for j in range(limit):
            k = target - j
            if 0 <= k < limit:
                product = i*j*k
                total_sum += product
                print(f"i={i}, j={j}, k={k}, product={product}")
    print("\nSum of products i*j*k over all triples is:", total_sum)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
