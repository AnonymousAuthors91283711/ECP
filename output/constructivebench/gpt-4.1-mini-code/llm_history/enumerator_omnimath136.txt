The problem asks to find all prime numbers \( p \) for which there exist positive integers \( x, y \) satisfying the Diophantine equation:

\[
x (y^2 - p) + y (x^2 - p) = 5p.
\]

We will enumerate primes \( p \) in a small range and positive integers \( x, y \) in small ranges to find tuples \((p, x, y)\) that satisfy the equation exactly. This will help conjecture the set of such primes.

```python
# Enumerate primes p and positive integers x,y to find all solutions of
# x*(y^2 - p) + y*(x^2 - p) = 5*p for small ranges to conjecture answers.

from sympy import primerange

# Search parameters
max_p = 50  # upper bound for prime p
max_xy = 20  # upper bound for x,y

primes = list(primerange(2, max_p+1))

for p in primes:
    found = False
    for x in range(1, max_xy+1):
        for y in range(1, max_xy+1):
            lhs = x*(y**2 - p) + y*(x**2 - p)
            rhs = 5*p
            if lhs == rhs:
                print(f"p={p}, x={x}, y={y}: lhs={lhs} = rhs={rhs}")
                found = True
    if found:
        print(f"Solutions found for prime p = {p}\n")
```
