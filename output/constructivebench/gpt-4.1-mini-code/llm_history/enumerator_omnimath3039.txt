The problem is to find a natural number \( n > 1 \) such that:

\[
\sqrt{\prod_{i=1}^{n-1} \frac{i}{i+1}} = \frac{1}{8}.
\]

We can rewrite the product inside the square root more explicitly and numerically evaluate it for small values of \( n \).

Discover if and where the equality holds, and verify uniqueness by enumerating values.

```python
# Enumerate n > 1 and evaluate sqrt(prod_{i=1}^{n-1} (i/(i+1))) = sqrt(1/n)
# since product_{i=1}^{k} (i/(i+1)) = 1/(k+1).
# Check where sqrt(1/n) = 1/8, so 1/n = 1/64 => n=64.

for n in range(2, 70):
    prod = 1 / n            # product from i=1 to n-1 of i/(i+1) = 1/n
    val = prod**0.5
    print(f"n={n}, sqrt(prod)={val}")
    if val == 1/8:
        print(f"Exact match found at n={n}")
# Confirm uniqueness: sqrt(1/n) is strictly decreasing, so only one n where sqrt(prod)=1/8.
print("\nConclusion: The unique n with sqrt(prod) = 1/8 is n = 64.")
```
