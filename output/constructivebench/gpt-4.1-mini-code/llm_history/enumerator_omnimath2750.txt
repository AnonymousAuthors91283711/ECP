The given theorem involves real variables \(x, y\) with a linear constraint \(x + 2y = 30\), and an expression 
\[
\frac{x}{5} + \frac{2y}{3} + \frac{2y}{5} + \frac{x}{3}.
\]
We want to find the value of this expression based on the constraint.

Let's write a Python program to enumerate values of \(x, y\) satisfying the constraint approximately for integer values or fractions with small denominators, compute the expression, and see if we can guess the exact simplified value of the expression in terms of \(x,y\).

```python
# Enumerate values of x from 0 to 30, deduce y = (30 - x)/2,
# compute the expression = x/5 + 2*y/3 + 2*y/5 + x/3,
# and print exact fractions when possible

from fractions import Fraction

print("Enumerating possible values of x and y with x + 2y = 30:")
print("x, y, expression value")

for x_int in range(0, 31):  # x from 0 to 30
    # y = (30 - x)/2
    y_frac = Fraction(30 - x_int, 2)
    x_frac = Fraction(x_int,1)

    # Compute expression:
    # x/5 + 2y/3 + 2y/5 + x/3
    # Combine terms
    expr = x_frac / 5 + 2 * y_frac / 3 + 2 * y_frac / 5 + x_frac / 3

    # Simplify expression, print as Fraction and decimal
    print(f"x = {x_frac}, y = {y_frac}, expr = {expr} â‰ˆ {float(expr):.4f}")

print("\nObserving these values, we can try to derive a closed form for the expression:")
# Let's simplify expression symbolically:
# expr = x/5 + x/3 + 2y/3 + 2y/5
# = (x/5 + x/3) + (2y/3 + 2y/5)
# = x(1/5 + 1/3) + 2y(1/3 + 1/5)
# = x(8/15) + 2y(8/15) = (8/15)*x + (16/15)*y

# Using x + 2y = 30 => y = (30 - x)/2
# expr = (8/15)*x + (16/15)*y = (8/15)*x + (16/15)*((30 - x)/2)
# = (8/15)*x + (8/15)*(30 - x) = (8/15)*x + (8/15)*30 - (8/15)*x = (8/15)*30 = 16

print("Hence, expression simplifies to constant 16 regardless of valid x,y.")
```
