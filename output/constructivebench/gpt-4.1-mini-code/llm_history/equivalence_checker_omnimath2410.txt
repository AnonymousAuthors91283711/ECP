Ground Truth Answer: 83/80
Proposed Answer: 2 * Real.sqrt 3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem gives trigonometric relationships between angles and sides of a triangle (implied by the notation A,B,C for angles and AB,AC,BC for sides).

2. The ground truth answer is a simple rational number (83/80 ≈ 1.0375).

3. The proposed answer is an irrational number (2√3 ≈ 3.4641).

The two answers are numerically very different (1.0375 vs 3.4641), and there's no obvious transformation that would make them equivalent. The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth in any clear way.
