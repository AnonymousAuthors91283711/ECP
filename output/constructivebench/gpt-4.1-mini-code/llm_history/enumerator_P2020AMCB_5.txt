The problem requires finding natural numbers \(a, b > 0\) satisfying:
- \(2a \equiv 0 \pmod{3}\)
- \(5b \equiv 0 \pmod{8}\)
- \(\frac{5b}{8} = \frac{2a}{3} + 7\)
- \(\frac{3b}{8} = \frac{a}{3} + 7\)

We will enumerate positive integers \(a, b\) respecting the divisibility constraints and check the equations. Since exact solutions are required, only integer \(a, b\) making all fractions integers and satisfying the equations will be printed.

```python
# Enumerate all natural numbers a,b > 0 up to a reasonable limit
# Constraints:
# 2a % 3 == 0 => 2a divisible by 3
# 5b % 8 == 0 => 5b divisible by 8
# (5b / 8) = (2a / 3) +7
# (3b / 8) = (a / 3) +7
# All fractions must be integers, so denominators divide numerator

def valid_fraction(numer, denom):
    return numer % denom == 0

def main():
    # We'll try a, b up to 200 for brevity
    for a in range(1, 201):
        if (2*a) % 3 != 0:
            continue
        if a % 3 != 0:
            # Because a/3 appears, it must be integer
            continue
        for b in range(1, 201):
            if (5*b) % 8 != 0:
                continue
            # Check (3b/8) integer
            if (3*b) % 8 != 0:
                continue
            lhs1 = (5*b)//8
            rhs1 = (2*a)//3 + 7
            lhs2 = (3*b)//8
            rhs2 = (a)//3 + 7
            if lhs1 == rhs1 and lhs2 == rhs2:
                print(f"a={a}, b={b}")
    # No extremal answer required explicitly by problem statement

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
