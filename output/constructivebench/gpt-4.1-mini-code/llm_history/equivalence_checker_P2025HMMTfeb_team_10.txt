Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

The ground truth answer states that n must not have any prime factor p ≡ 3 mod 4 with exponent exactly 1. This is a precise mathematical characterization.

The proposed answer suggests that n must be expressible as d*k³ where k is between 1 and 20. This is a much more restrictive condition that doesn't capture the full generality of the ground truth condition. For example:
1. Numbers like 7 (a prime ≡ 3 mod 4) would be excluded by the ground truth, but could be included in the proposed answer if k=1 and d=7
2. Numbers like 9 (3²) would be allowed by the ground truth (since the exponent is 2, not 1), but might be excluded by the proposed answer depending on how it's expressed as d*k³
3. The proposed answer arbitrarily limits k to ≤20, which is not part of the ground truth condition

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
- It's too restrictive in some cases (arbitrary k limit)
- It's too permissive in others (allows numbers that should be excluded)
- Doesn't properly capture the prime factor condition
