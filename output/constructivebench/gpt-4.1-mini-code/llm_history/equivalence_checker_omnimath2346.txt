Ground Truth Answer: 1024 / 255
Proposed Answer: (∑ k in Finset.range 9 \ {0}, (k : ℚ) * (Nat.choose 8 k)) / ((2^8) - 1)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is calculating the average size of non-empty subsets of an 8-element set.

2. Ground Truth Answer:
- 1024/255 is correct because:
  - Total sum of sizes of all non-empty subsets = ∑(k=1 to 8) k*C(8,k) = 8*2⁷ = 1024
  - Number of non-empty subsets = 2⁸ - 1 = 255

3. Proposed Answer:
- The numerator is exactly the same as the ground truth (sum of k*C(8,k) for k=1..8)
- The denominator is correctly (2⁸ - 1) which equals 255
- The Finset.range 9 \ {0} correctly gives indices 1 through 8
- The answer is mathematically equivalent to 1024/255

The proposed answer is exactly equivalent to the ground truth answer, just written in a different (more explicit) form.
