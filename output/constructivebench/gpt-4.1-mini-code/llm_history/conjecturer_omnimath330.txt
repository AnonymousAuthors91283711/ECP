theorem omnimath330 (p q : ℕ) :
  p.Prime ∧ q.Prime ∧ IsSquare (p - q) ∧ IsSquare (p * q - q) ↔ (p, q) ∈ omnimath330_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating pairs (p,q) of primes ≤50 with conditions:
(p, q) = (3, 2), p-q=1 (square), p*q - q=4 (square). Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ)
<<<{(p, q) | p.Prime ∧ q.Prime ∧ p = q + 1 ∧ IsSquare q}>>>
