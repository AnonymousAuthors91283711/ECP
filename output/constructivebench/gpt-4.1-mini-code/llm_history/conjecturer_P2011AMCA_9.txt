  (twin_handshakes + triplet_handshakes) / 2 = P2011AMCA_9_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating handshake counts for sample values:
twins = 1, triplets = 1, handshakes = 3
twins = 1, triplets = 2, handshakes = 15
twins = 1, triplets = 3, handshakes = 36
twins = 1, triplets = 4, handshakes = 66
twins = 2, triplets = 1, handshakes = 10
twins = 2, triplets = 2, handshakes = 25
twins = 2, triplets = 3, handshakes = 49
twins = 2, triplets = 4, handshakes = 82
twins = 3, triplets = 1, handshakes = 21
twins = 3, triplets = 2, handshakes = 39
twins = 3, triplets = 3, handshakes = 66
twins = 3, triplets = 4, handshakes = 102
twins = 4, triplets = 1, handshakes = 36
twins = 4, triplets = 2, handshakes = 57
twins = 4, triplets = 3, handshakes = 87
twins = 4, triplets = 4, handshakes = 126
Original problem counts: twins = 9, triplets = 6
Total handshakes = 441. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
