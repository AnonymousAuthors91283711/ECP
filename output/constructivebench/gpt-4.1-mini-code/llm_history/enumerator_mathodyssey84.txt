This problem involves real parameters \(a, b\) and certain equations relating \(x, y, m\). To explore and conjecture values related to the problem, we will enumerate samples for \(a, b\) in small integer ranges, try to solve the system approximately or symbolically where possible, and print immediate candidate results.

We focus on solving:
- \( \frac{x^2}{7} - \frac{y^2}{5} = 1 \)
- \( a x + b y + 1 = 0 \)
- Exists \( m \in \mathbb{R} \) such that:
  \[
  2 \frac{x}{7} - 2 \frac{y}{5} m = 0, \quad m \left( -\frac{a}{b} \right) = -1
  \]

From the second last equation, we get \( m = \frac{x / 7}{y / 5} = \frac{5x}{7 y} \) (assuming \(y \neq 0\)).

From the last equation, \( m = \frac{b}{a} \).

So 
\[
\frac{5 x}{7 y} = \frac{b}{a} \implies 5 a x = 7 b y.
\]

We will try small integer values \(a, b\) in \([-3,3]\) (excluding zero denominators) and solve algebraically or numerically for \(x, y\) to check if solutions exist, then print candidates.

Let's print results immediately to streaming output. The problem states the answer should match 144 in the theorem, so we seek evidence supporting or contradicting.

# Line equation
eq2 = Eq(a_sym * x + b_sym * y + 1, 0)

# Conditions from m
# eq3: 2*x/7 - 2*y/5*m = 0 => (x/7) - (y/5)*m = 0
eq3 = Eq(x/7 - m * y/5, 0)

# eq4: m*(-a/b) = -1 => m = b/a (assuming a != 0)
# We'll check consistency: m from eq3 and eq4 must equal
# Hence: x/7 = m*y/5 => x/7 = (b/a)* y/5 => 5 a x = 7 b y
