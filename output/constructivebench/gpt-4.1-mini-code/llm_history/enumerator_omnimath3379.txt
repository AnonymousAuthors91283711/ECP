The problem involves a 6Ã—6 matrix \(T\) with specified off-diagonal entries 1/4 on certain edges of an undirected graph, zeros on diagonals, and a uniform starting vector \(p\). The goal is to find the first entry of \(T^5 p\). I will enumerate \(T^5 p\) exactly using rational arithmetic, printing partial results to see how \(p_5(0)\) evolves. Since the graph and probabilities are small, the program will do it step-by-step and print the value for each power.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Define the 6x6 matrix T with entries as per problem
edges = {(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(0,4),(1,2),(1,3),(1,5),(2,4),(2,5),(3,4),(3,5),(4,5)}
N = 6
T = [[Fraction(0) for _ in range(N)] for _ in range(N)]

for i in range(N):
    for j in range(N):
        if i != j and ((i,j) in edges or (j,i) in edges):
            T[i][j] = Fraction(1,4)

# Initial vector p
p = [Fraction(1,6) for _ in range(N)]

def mul_mat_vec(M, v):
    res = []
    for i in range(len(M)):
        s = Fraction(0)
        for j in range(len(v)):
            s += M[i][j] * v[j]
        res.append(s)
    return res

# Compute p_k and print p_k(0) for k=0..5
p_k = p
print(f"p_0(0) = {p_k[0]}")  # initial
for k in range(1, 6):
    p_k = mul_mat_vec(T, p_k)
    print(f"p_{k}(0) = {p_k[0]}")
```
