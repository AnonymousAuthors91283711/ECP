The problem is to find how many distinct sums less than or equal to 100 can be formed by adding 1, 2, or 3 numbers chosen from the set {2, 5, 7, 12, 19, 31, 50, 81}. We enumerate all such sums and print them as we find them. Finally, we print the count.

```python
from itertools import combinations

numbers = [2, 5, 7, 12, 19, 31, 50, 81]
sums_found = set()

# Consider subsets of size 1, 2, or 3
for r in range(1, 4):
    for combo in combinations(numbers, r):
        s = sum(combo)
        if s <= 100 and s not in sums_found:
            sums_found.add(s)
            print(s)

print("Total count:", len(sums_found))
```
