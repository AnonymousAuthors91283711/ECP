The problem defines a sequence of functions \( f_n:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R} \) recursively:
- \( f_0(x) = x + |x - 100| - |x + 100| \),
- \( f_n(x) = |f_{n-1}(x)| - 1 \) for \( n \geq 1 \).

The problem asks for the number of real solutions to \( f_{100}(x) = 0 \).

To explore this, we:
1. Numerically and exactly explore \( f_0 \),
2. Apply the iteration recursively,
3. For \( n = 100 \), find roots of \( f_{100}(x) = 0 \),
4. Count how many solutions there are.

Because \( f_n \) is piecewise, nested absolute values create multiple intervals.

We will:
- Enumerate piecewise linear intervals for each step,
- For small \( n \) verify the pattern,
- Then approximate the behavior at \( n=100 \),
- Print candidate roots of \( f_n(x) = 0 \),
- And count them.

We expect the roots to be at points where the function transitions through 0, i.e. where \( f_n(x) = 0 \).

We'll sample \( x \) in relevant intervals around \([-200,200]\) (to include all break points at ±100 and after iterations).

Below is a Python program that enumerates the zeroes of \( f_n \) for \(n=0,1,2,...,5\), then for \(n=100\) it approximates the roots by iteration from the previous step's roots. It prints the roots as soon as found, and the count of roots for \( f_{100} \).

This should help conjecture the exact count of zeros of \( f_{100} \).

# Enumerate zeroes of f_n defined recursively by:
# f_0(x) = x + |x-100| - |x+100|
# f_n(x) = |f_{n-1}(x)| - 1 for n>=1
# For n=100, print roots of f_100(x)=0 and their number.
