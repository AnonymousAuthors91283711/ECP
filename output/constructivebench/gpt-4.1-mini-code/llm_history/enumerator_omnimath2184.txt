The problem is about counting functions x: Fin 2012 → ℤ where each x(i) is between 0 and 2011 inclusive, and the sum ∑ (i+1)*x(i) is divisible by 2012. We want to enumerate the number of such functions.

We will:
- Let n=2012.
- Observe x(i) ∈ [0, n-1].
- The sum mod n must be 0.
- We want to count the number of vectors (x_0,...,x_{n-1}) with each x_i ∈ {0,...,n-1} s.t.
  sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i+1)*x_i ≡ 0 mod n.

Since all ranges are length n, this is a counting problem in modular arithmetic. The number of all such vectors is n^n, but only those that satisfy the modular sum condition count.

Because n=2012 is large, we'll try a smaller sample n to look for a pattern.

Use the program to count the number of functions x from Fin n to [0,n-1] with ∑ (i+1)*x(i) ≡ 0 mod n.

Direct enumeration for large n is impossible, so we pick smaller n to calculate and print counts.

This needs efficient approaches, for example dynamic programming using convolution modulo n.

We do DP over positions, with the state being the distribution of remainder mod n.

At each step, for each possible value of x_i, we add (i+1)*x_i mod n.

Thus, the transitions at step i:


dp[i+1][(r + (i+1)*v) % n] += dp[i][r]


with v = 0..n-1

Since each position can contribute n possible values, total complexity is O(n^2), acceptable for small n.

We will implement this code for sample small n values, say n=2,3,4,5, and print the counts.

At the end, print the counts and conjecture the value for n=2012.

```python
# Enumerate number of functions x: Fin n -> [0..n-1] with sum (i+1)*x(i) ≡ 0 mod n
# Print exact counts for small n and speculate on n=2012

def count_good_vectors(n):
    dp = [0]*n
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(n):
        ndp = [0]*n
        coeff = i+1
        for r in range(n):
            ways = dp[r]
            if ways==0:
                continue
            # Add contributions for x_i in 0..n-1
            # For each v, new remainder is (r + coeff*v)%n
            # Since dp is large, use arithmetic series trick:
            # For fixed r, counts added to ndp[(r + coeff*v)%n] += ways
            # counts are 1 for each v -> cumulative dp update
            # But since n is small, do direct loop
            for v in range(n):
                nr = (r + coeff*v)%n
                ndp[nr] += ways
        dp = ndp
    return dp[0]

print("n count")
for n in range(2,6):
    c = count_good_vectors(n)
    print(n,c)

# For n=2012 printing count is impossible, only print n=2012 and indicate count unknown
print("n=2012 count = unknown (too large to compute here)")
```
