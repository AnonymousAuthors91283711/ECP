The problem is to find the sum S = âˆ‘_{i=1}^{18} (-1)^{i+1} * i^3 where the sign alternates starting with positive at i=1 (since i=1 is odd, we negate cubes for odd i, but in the code the condition is "if Even i then i^3 else -i^3" so the sign for even i is positive, for odd i is negative).

We want to compute S = -1^3 + 2^3 - 3^3 + 4^3 - 5^3 + ... + 18^3 (with negative sign on odd i, positive sign on even i).

Let's write a Python program to enumerate all terms, print each partial sum, and finally the total sum.

```python
# Sum S = sum_{i=1}^18 (i^3 if i even else -i^3)
def main():
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, 19):
        term = (i ** 3) if (i % 2 == 0) else (-i ** 3)
        print(f"i={i}, term={term}")
        total += term
        print(f"Partial sum up to i={i}: {total}")
    print(f"Final sum: {total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
