The problem is to find the smallest positive integer \( s \) such that there exist integers \( a, b, c \) with product \( abc = 60 \) and sum \( a+b+c = s \).

To help conjecture the minimal sum, we will enumerate integer triples \((a,b,c)\) with product 60 and print their sums. We will limit the search to a reasonable integer range around the cube roots (since \( |a|, |b|, |c| \) shouldn't be too large). The program will print all sums found and finally the minimum sum.

```python
# Enumerate integer triples (a,b,c) with product 60 and sum s > 0,
# print sums to find the minimal positive sum.

def main():
    product = 60
    candidate_sums = set()
    # Reasonable bounds: factors of 60 lie roughly between -60 and 60
    # but to reduce search, try -30..30
    bound = 30
    for a in range(-bound, bound+1):
        if a == 0 or product % a != 0:
            continue
        ab = product // a
        for b in range(-bound, bound+1):
            if b == 0 or ab % b != 0:
                continue
            c = ab // b
            # verify product just in case of integer division issues
            if a * b * c == product:
                s = a + b + c
                if s > 0:
                    print(f"Found sum {s} with triple ({a},{b},{c})")
                    candidate_sums.add(s)
    if candidate_sums:
        minimal = min(candidate_sums)
        print(f"Minimum positive sum s is {minimal}")
    else:
        print("No positive sums found")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
