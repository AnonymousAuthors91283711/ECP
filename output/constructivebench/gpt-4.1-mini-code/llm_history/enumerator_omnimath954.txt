[write_program]
The problem involves finding all pairs \((a,b) \in \mathbb{C}^2\) such that:

\[
a^2 + b^2 \neq 0, \quad a + \frac{10b}{a^2 + b^2} = 5, \quad b + \frac{10a}{a^2 + b^2} = 4.
\]

We want to enumerate candidates for \((a,b)\) in complex numbers satisfying these equations.

To simplify the search, we can try restricting \(a,b\) to real numbers initially (as complex enumeration is infinite-dimensional). We'll check integer and rational values for \(a\) and \(b\) in a range to find candidates satisfying these equations (within some numerical tolerance). Printing exact matches only when equations hold exactly (or nearly exactly).

We will print each candidate pair \((a,b)\) that satisfy the equations and print both the exact fractions if possible and floating approximations.

The program will enumerate over rational pairs \(a,b\) with denominators up to 10, numerators between -10 and 10, test the conditions, and print matches.

```python
from fractions import Fraction
from math import isclose

def approx_eq(x, y, tol=1e-12):
    return isclose(x, y, abs_tol=tol)

def try_pairs(max_num=10, max_den=10):
    # Enumerate rationals a,b with numerator in [-max_num,max_num], denominator in [1,max_den]
    candidates = []
    for an in range(-max_num, max_num+1):
        for ad in range(1, max_den+1):
            a = Fraction(an, ad)
            for bn in range(-max_num, max_num+1):
                for bd in range(1, max_den+1):
                    b = Fraction(bn, bd)
                    denom = a**2 + b**2
                    if denom == 0:
                        continue
                    left1 = a + Fraction(10) * b / denom
                    left2 = b + Fraction(10) * a / denom
                    # Check if left1 == 5 and left2 == 4 exactly (Fraction)
                    if left1 == 5 and left2 == 4:
                        print(f"a = {a}, b = {b}")
                        candidates.append((a,b))
    return candidates

if __name__ == "__main__":
    candidates = try_pairs()
```

This searches over rationals only for simplicity; the problem is in \(\mathbb{C}\) but this gives plausible exact candidates. If none found, can try float approximations or extend to complex with floats.
