The problem involves an arithmetic sequence \(seq(k) = a + kd\) with terms indexed from \(k=0\) to \(k=5\). The conditions are:
- \(seq(5) = 2 \times seq(0)\)
- Sum of first 6 terms = 990

We want to find all possible values of \(seq(5)\), then identify the greatest such value.

We enumerate possible integer pairs \((a,d)\) that satisfy given constraints and print each value of \(seq(5)\) immediately. Finally, we print the maximum value.

```python
# Enumerate pairs (a,d) generating arithmetic sequences seq(k) = a + kd
# subject to seq(5) = 2*seq(0) and sum(seq(0..5)) = 990,
# then output all possible seq(5) values and maximum among them.

def main():
    # From seq(5) = 2*seq(0), we have: a + 5d = 2a -> 5d = a -> a = 5d
    # Sum of first 6 terms:
    # S = 6/2 * (seq(0) + seq(5)) = 3 * (a + (a + 5d)) = 3 * (a + a + 5d) = 3*(2a + 5d)
    # But since a=5d, 2a + 5d = 2*5d + 5d = 15d
    # So S = 3 * 15d = 45d
    # Set sum = 990 => 45d = 990 => d = 22
    # Then a=5d=110
    # seq(5) = a + 5d = 110 + 110 = 220

    # We confirm this programmatically by enumerating small d values
    max_val = None
    for d in range(1, 50):  # small range to check for d
        a = 5 * d
        s = 3 * (2 * a + 5 * d)
        if s == 990:
            val = a + 5 * d
            print(val)
            if max_val is None or val > max_val:
                max_val = val
    print(f"Maximum seq(5) value: {max_val}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
