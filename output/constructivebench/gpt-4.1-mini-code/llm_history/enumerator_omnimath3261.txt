The problem involves computing the determinant of an nÃ—n matrix A(n) where the (i,j)-entry counts the number of nonnegative integer solutions \((p_1,p_2)\) to the equation \(p_1 \cdot i + p_2 \cdot j = n\). The goal is to conjecture a closed form or pattern for \(\det A(n)\) for positive integers \(n\).

The program below:
- Enumerates values of \(n\) from 1 to 6 (small sample values).
- For each fixed \(n\), constructs the matrix \(A(n)\) with entries given exactly by counting solutions.
- Computes and prints the determinant immediately.
- Attempts a brute force count of solutions quantitatively rather than combinatorially.
  
This should provide insight into how the determinant behaves and aid conjecture formation.

```python
import numpy as np

def count_solutions(n, i, j):
    # Count nonnegative integer solutions (p1, p2) to p1*i + p2*j = n
    # p1 in [0, n//i], for each p1 check if (n - p1*i) divisible by j
    count = 0
    for p1 in range(n // i + 1):
        rem = n - p1*i
        if rem >= 0 and rem % j == 0:
            count += 1
    return count

def matrix_and_det(n):
    A = np.zeros((n,n), dtype=int)
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        for j in range(1, n+1):
            A[i-1,j-1] = count_solutions(n, i, j)
    det = round(np.linalg.det(A))
    return A, det

print("Enumerating determinants for n = 1 to 6")
for n in range(1, 7):
    A, det = matrix_and_det(n)
    print(f"n={n}:")
    print(A)
    print("det =", det)
```
This script prints the exact matrix and integer determinants for \(n=1\) to 6, thus streaming exact results and illuminating the behavior of the determinant sequence.
