abbrev omnimath511_answer : Prop := sorry
theorem omnimath511 : omnimath511_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating Pythagorean triples with a,b,c <= 20:
Pythagorean triple: a=3, b=4, c=5
Pythagorean triple: a=5, b=12, c=13
Pythagorean triple: a=6, b=8, c=10
Pythagorean triple: a=8, b=15, c=17
Pythagorean triple: a=9, b=12, c=15
Pythagorean triple: a=12, b=16, c=20. Expected Answer Type: Prop
<<<∃ (a b c : ℕ), a = 3 ∧ b = 4 ∧ c = 5 ∨ a = 5 ∧ b = 12 ∧ c = 13 ∨ a = 6 ∧ b = 8 ∧ c = 10 ∨ a = 8 ∧ b = 15 ∧ c = 17 ∨ a = 9 ∧ b = 12 ∧ c = 15 ∨ a = 12 ∧ b = 16 ∧ c = 20>>>
