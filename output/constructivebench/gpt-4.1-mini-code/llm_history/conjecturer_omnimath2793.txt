(a b : ℝ)
(hab : a ≠ b)
(hfrac : (a + b) / (a - b) = 3)

sorry
. Enumerated answers: Enumerating for various b values:
b = 1, a = 2, a/b = 2.0
b = -1, a = -2, a/b = 2.0
b = 2, a = 4, a/b = 2.0
b = -2, a = -4, a/b = 2.0
b = 0.5, a = 1.0, a/b = 2.0
b = -0.5, a = -1.0, a/b = 2.0
Conclusion: a/b = 2 for all valid (a,b).. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<2>>>
