This problem involves solving the system of two equations in real numbers:
1. \( x^2 + y^2 = 6y - 4x + 12 \)
2. \( 4y = x^2 + 4x + 12 \)

We want to find all \((x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2\) pairs satisfying both. A Python program can either numerically solve or check points to conjecture the solution set.

Strategy:
- Use the second equation to express \( y \) in terms of \( x \), then substitute in the first.
- Simplify and solve for \( x \).
- Enumerate \( x \) values in a range, compute corresponding \( y \), and check if the first equation holds.
- Print exact matches with some tolerance.

We'll try \( x \) from -10 to 10 with a 0.01 step to keep output short. We'll print found exact pairs approximately satisfying both equations.

```python
# Solve system:
# 1) x^2 + y^2 = 6y -4x +12
# 2) 4y = x^2 + 4x + 12 => y = (x^2 + 4x + 12)/4

def close(a,b,eps=1e-6):
    return abs(a-b) < eps

answers = set()

for i in range(-1000, 1001):
    x = i / 100
    y = (x**2 + 4*x + 12)/4
    lhs = x**2 + y**2
    rhs = 6*y - 4*x + 12
    if close(lhs, rhs):
        # Round for neat output
        xr = round(x, 4)
        yr = round(y, 4)
        pair = (xr, yr)
        if pair not in answers:
            answers.add(pair)
            print(f"Found solution: x={xr}, y={yr}")

# Optional: print number of solutions found
print(f"Total distinct solutions found: {len(answers)}")
```
