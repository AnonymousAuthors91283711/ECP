The problem looks for natural numbers \(a < b < c\) such that \(b^2 = a c\), the difference \(b - a\) is a perfect square, and the sum of their base-6 logarithms is 6. Since \(\log_6 a + \log_6 b + \log_6 c = \log_6(abc) = 6\), we have \(abc = 6^6 = 46656\).

We will:
- Enumerate triples \((a,b,c)\) with \(a < b < c\), \(b^2 = a c\).
- Check if \(b - a\) is a perfect square.
- Check if \(abc = 46656\).
- Print each triple fulfilling conditions.
- Finally print their sum \(a+b+c\).

We limit \(a,b,c\) to small ranges for efficiency and since \(abc=46656\) constraints the size. 

```python
from math import isqrt

TARGET = 6**6  # 46656

def is_perfect_square(x):
    r = isqrt(x)
    return r*r == x

def main():
    # Enumerate possible a
    for a in range(1, 200):  # upper bound guessed from 46656^(1/3) ~ 36, higher to be safe
        # Since b^2 = a c, c = b^2 / a must be integer
        # Also abc = 46656 => c = 46656 / (a*b)
        # So b^2 / a = 46656 / (a*b) => b^3 = 46656 * a
        # From this relation, b^3 must be divisible by a
        # Let's solve by enumerating b, then compute c:
        # Since b > a, start b from a+1
        # Since a,b,c natural and c integer
        # For given a,b, check if c integer and if b^2 = a c
        # But also check if b - a is perfect square
        
        for b in range(a+1, 300): 
            if (b**2) % a != 0:
                continue
            c = (b**2)//a
            if c <= b:
                continue
            if a * b * c != TARGET:
                continue
            diff = b - a
            if not is_perfect_square(diff):
                continue
            # If all conditions met, print result
            print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, sum={a+b+c}")
    # No additional extremal output as problem does not request min/max explicitly

    main()
