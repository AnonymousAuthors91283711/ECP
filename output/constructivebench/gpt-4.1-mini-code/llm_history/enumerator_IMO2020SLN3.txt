[write_program]
The problem is about finite sequences of length \( n \) with certain properties connecting averages and squares. To explore it computationally, I'll write a Python program that, for small \( n \), enumerates sequences \( a \) of length \( n \) with distinct elements, then checks whether for every pair \( (i,j) \) the average \(\frac{a_i + a_j}{2}\) equals some \( a_k \) which is also a perfect square of some \( a_l \). This will help conjecture for which \( n \) such sequences exist.

Given exponential growth, I'll limit elements to small integers and small \( n \) like 2,3,4 for exploration.

```python
from itertools import product, combinations

def is_perfect_square(x):
    if x < 0:
        return False
    r = int(x**0.5)
    return r*r == x

def check_sequence(a):
    n = len(a)
    # Condition: sequence not all equal
    if all(x == a[0] for x in a):
        return False
    # For all i,j there exists k,l with a_k = (a_i+a_j)/2 and a_k = a_l^2
    for i, j in combinations(range(n), 2):
        s = a[i] + a[j]
        if s % 2 != 0:
            return False
        mid = s // 2 # integer division
        if mid not in a:
            return False
        # Check if mid is a perfect square of some a_l in sequence
        if all(mid != x*x for x in a):
            return False
    return True

max_elem = 10  # limit element size to keep enumeration feasible

for n in range(2,5):
    print(f"n={n}")
    found = False
    # Generate all sequences of length n with elements in [0..max_elem] and not all equal
    # To reduce search, enforce strictly increasing sequences (since order indexed by Fin n)
    for a in product(range(max_elem+1), repeat=n):
        if len(set(a)) == 1:
            continue
        # Check condition
        if check_sequence(a):
            found = True
            print(f"Found sequence: {a}")
    if not found:
        print("No sequence found satisfying conditions")
```
This will enumerate candidate sequences for small \( n \) to assist conjecture about the problem.
