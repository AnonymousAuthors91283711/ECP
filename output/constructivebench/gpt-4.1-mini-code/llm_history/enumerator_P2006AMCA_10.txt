The problem concerns the set of real numbers \( x \) for which there exists an integer \( n \) with \( n = \sqrt{120 - \sqrt{x}} \). We want to find the cardinality of this set (the number of such real \( x \)).

Rearranging:
\[
n = \sqrt{120 - \sqrt{x}} \implies n^2 = 120 - \sqrt{x} \implies \sqrt{x} = 120 - n^2 \implies x = (120 - n^2)^2.
\]

For \( n \) an integer, \(\sqrt{x}\) must be non-negative, so \(120 - n^2 \geq 0 \implies n^2 \leq 120\). This restricts \( n \) to integers with \(-10 \leq n \leq 10\).

Each such \( n \) gives one \( x = (120 - n^2)^2 \). Check for duplicates among these values.

The code enumerates \( n \) and prints the corresponding \( x \) to detect duplicates and count distinct \( x \).

```python
# Enumerate all integers n with n^2 <= 120, compute x = (120 - n^2)^2, print and count distinct x
def main():
    distinct_x = set()
    print("n\t(120 - n^2)^2")
    for n in range(-11, 12):  # n from -11 to 11; 11^2=121>120 stops at 10
        if n * n <= 120:
            val = (120 - n * n) ** 2
            print(f"{n}\t{val}")
            distinct_x.add(val)
    print(f"Number of distinct x values: {len(distinct_x)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
