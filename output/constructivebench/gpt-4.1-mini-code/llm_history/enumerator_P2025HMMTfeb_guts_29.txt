The problem involves three real numbers \(a, b, c\) satisfying symmetric equations with square roots. To explore possible values of \(a, b, c\), I'll discretize possible values for each variable from a reasonable range, check the given equations approximately (within some small tolerance), and print candidate triples \((a,b,c)\) that satisfy all three equations closely. This will help conjecture exact values and verify uniqueness.

```python
import math

def close(x, y, tol=1e-6):
    return abs(x - y) < tol

# Equation checks
def eq1(a, b):
    return a * math.sqrt(1 + b**2) + b * math.sqrt(1 + a**2)

def eq2(b, c):
    return b * math.sqrt(1 + c**2) + c * math.sqrt(1 + b**2)

def eq3(c, a):
    return c * math.sqrt(1 + a**2) + a * math.sqrt(1 + c**2)

# Search space: sample values for a, b, c
vals = [-2 + 0.25*i for i in range(17)]  # from -2 to 2 in steps of 0.25

print("Searching for (a,b,c) approximations...")

for a in vals:
    for b in vals:
        for c in vals:
            v1 = eq1(a, b)
            if not close(v1, 3/4):
                continue
            v2 = eq2(b, c)
            if not close(v2, 5/12):
                continue
            v3 = eq3(c, a)
            if not close(v3, 21/20):
                continue
            print(f"Candidate solution: a={a:.5f}, b={b:.5f}, c={c:.5f}")
```
This will print approximate triples meeting all three equations' values close to the targets 3/4, 5/12, 21/20. By inspecting these, one can guess exact forms for \(a\).
