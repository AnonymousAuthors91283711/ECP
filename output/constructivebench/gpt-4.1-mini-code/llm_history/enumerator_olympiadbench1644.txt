The problem involves finding the maximum number of non-overlapping domino placements on a grid with given constraints. Since the original statement is complex, we will experimentally enumerate domino sets for small m,n values according to the rules, and print the sizes to conjecture the formula for the maximum k.

We treat dominoes as coordinates (r1,c1,r2,c2), with allowed vertical or horizontal dominoes under constraints, check non-overlapping conditions, and count the largest sets for small parameters. This approach will help us observe patterns.

```python
# Enumerate valid domino sets for small m,n and print max count found.
# Dominoes are either vertical or horizontal on an m x 2n grid with given conditions.
# We try all subsets of dominoes, check validity, and print sizes.
# This is exponential in number of dominoes, so we limit m,n ≤ 3 for feasibility.

    # Generate all possible dominoes under problem constraints
    # Vertical domino: (r,c), (r,c+1) with r ≤ m, c ≤ 2n-1
    verticals = [((r, c), (r, c + 1)) for r in range(1, m + 1) for c in range(1, 2 * n) if c + 1 <= 2 * n]
    # Horizontal domino: (r,c), (r+1,c) with r ≤ m-1, c ≤ 2n
    horizontals = [((r, c), (r + 1, c)) for r in range(1, m) for c in range(1, 2 * n + 1)]

    # Check if dominoes share a side but not overlap, in a forbidden pattern.
