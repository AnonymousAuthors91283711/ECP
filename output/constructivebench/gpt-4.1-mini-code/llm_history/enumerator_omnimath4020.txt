The problem asks to find all positive integer triples \((x, y, z)\) satisfying the equation:
\[
2(x + y + z + 2xyz)^2 = (2xy + 2yz + 2zx + 1)^2 + 2023.
\]

We will enumerate small positive \(x,y,z\) values, print any triples that satisfy this equation exactly, and try to detect patterns or potential solutions.

```python
# Enumerate positive integers x,y,z up to a small limit to find solutions
# Equation: 2*(x+y+z+2*x*y*z)^2 = (2*x*y + 2*y*z + 2*z*x + 1)^2 + 2023

def main():
    LIMIT = 30  # Small positive integers up to 30 for manageable enumeration
    found = []
    print(f"Enumerating (x,y,z) triples with 1 <= x,y,z <= {LIMIT}")
    for x in range(1, LIMIT+1):
        for y in range(1, LIMIT+1):
            for z in range(1, LIMIT+1):
                lhs = 2 * (x + y + z + 2*x*y*z)**2
                rhs = (2*x*y + 2*y*z + 2*z*x + 1)**2 + 2023
                if lhs == rhs:
                    print(f"Solution found: x={x}, y={y}, z={z}")
                    found.append((x,y,z))
    if found:
        print(f"Total solutions found: {len(found)}")
    else:
        print("No solutions found in the given range")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
