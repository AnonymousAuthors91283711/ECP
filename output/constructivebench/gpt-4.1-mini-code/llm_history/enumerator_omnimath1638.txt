The problem seems to involve checking divisibility conditions on numbers of the form \(2^{n!} - 1\) by integers of the form \(2n + 3\), for \(n\) in a specific range. We want to sum those \(n\) for which the divisor condition fails (i.e., \(2n+3\) does NOT divide \(2^{n!}-1\)), for \(n \in [51, 100]\). To explore this, I'll write a Python program that enumerates \(n\) from 51 to 100, checks the divisibility, and sums accordingly.

Because factorials and exponentiation grow very fast, direct computation is expensive. I'll exploit modular arithmetic properties and Python's pow with three arguments for efficiency.

The program prints each \(n\) where the divisibility condition fails, then sums them at the end.

```python
import math

def divides(a, b):
    # Check if a divides b
    return b % a == 0

def check_divisibility(n):
    divisor = 2 * n + 3
    # Compute n! for exponent
    exponent = math.factorial(n)
    # Use pow with modulus for efficient computation
    # Check if 2^(n!) â‰¡ 1 (mod divisor)
    return pow(2, exponent, divisor) == 1

total = 0
for n in range(51, 101):
    if not check_divisibility(n):
        print(f"n={n} fails: (2n+3)={2*n+3} does NOT divide 2^(n!)-1")
        total += n

print("Sum of all such n:", total)
```
This should help identify the exact answer and verify the algebraic theorem.
