This problem involves weighted averages with certain quantities and corresponding weights. The equation:

(3rd * 12 + 4th * 15 + 5th * 10) / (3rd + 4th + 5th) = answer

where 3rd=4, 4th=2, 5th=1 as given in the Lean statement, but it looks like they are just placeholders. Since the theorem is unspecified, I will enumerate values of third, fourth, fifth with small integers (0 to 5), calculate the weighted average, and print each exact rational value found.

This enumeration may help in detecting a pattern or conjecturing the answer.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Enumerate small integer values for third, fourth, fifth (0 to 5)
# Skip cases where total is zero
# For each combination print the weighted average: (third*12 + fourth*15 + fifth*10)/(third+fourth+fifth)

def main():
    print("Enumerating weighted averages for various weights (third, fourth, fifth):")
    for third in range(6):
        for fourth in range(6):
            for fifth in range(6):
                total = third + fourth + fifth
                if total == 0:
                    continue  # skip zero denominator
                weighted_sum = third*12 + fourth*15 + fifth*10
                avg = Fraction(weighted_sum, total)
                print(f"third={third}, fourth={fourth}, fifth={fifth} => average = {avg} = {float(avg):.4f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
