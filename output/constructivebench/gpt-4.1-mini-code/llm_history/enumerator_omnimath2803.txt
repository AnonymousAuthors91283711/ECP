The problem involves real numbers \(a, b\) with the constraint \(a = \frac{2}{3} b\) and \(b \neq 0\). We want to simplify and analyze the expression \(\frac{9a + 8b}{6a}\).

To assist, Iâ€™ll write a Python program that:
- takes sample values for \(b\),
- computes \(a = \frac{2}{3} b\),
- evaluates the expression \(\frac{9a + 8b}{6a}\),
- prints exact fractions where possible,
- and stream results for various \(b\).

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Enumerate sample values for b
sample_bs = [Fraction(n, d) for n in range(-5, 6) for d in range(1, 6) if n != 0]

print("Enumerating values for (9a + 8b) / (6a) with a = (2/3) * b:")
for b in sample_bs:
    a = Fraction(2, 3) * b
    # Ensure a and b are Fraction for exact computation
    value = (9 * a + 8 * b) / (6 * a)
    print(f"b = {b}, a = {a}, value = {value}")

# Observation: expression is equal to (9a + 8b) / (6a) = ?
# Let's also print the simplified formula symbolically:
print("\nSymbolic simplification:")
print("Given a = (2/3)*b,")
print("value = (9*(2/3)*b + 8*b) / (6*(2/3)*b) = (6b + 8b)/(4b) = 14b / 4b = 7/2")

# Print the fixed value found by symbolic simplification:
print("\nConjectured exact value for all b != 0:")
print("omnimath2803_answer = 7/2 = 3.5")
```
