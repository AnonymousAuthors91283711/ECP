. Enumerated answers: Testing candidate functions...
Candidate f(x) = 1/x satisfies all conditions.
Candidate f(x) = 1 * x^-1 satisfies all conditions.
Enumerated candidate functions; based on testing, functions of form f(x)=c/x with c>0 satisfy all conditions.. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℝ → ℝ)
<<<{f : ℝ → ℝ | ∃ c > 0, ∀ x > 0, f x = c / x}>>>
