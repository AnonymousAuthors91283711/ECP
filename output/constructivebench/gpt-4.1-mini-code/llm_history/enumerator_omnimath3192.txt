The problem relates to finding a natural number 'nextPoints' that satisfies the equation upon incrementing some counter 'previousGames'. The key equation is:

20 * previousGames + 36 + nextPoints = 22 * (previousGames + 2)

given the condition:

20 * previousGames + 36 = 21 * (previousGames + 1)

By trying small 'previousGames' values, we want to find all possible 'nextPoints' values fulfilling both relations. This will help conjecture the correct formula or answer.

```python
# Verify the condition and compute nextPoints for small 'previousGames'
print("previousGames | nextPoints")
for previousGames in range(10):  # check small samples 0 to 9
    lhs_cond = 20 * previousGames + 36
    rhs_cond = 21 * (previousGames + 1)
    if lhs_cond == rhs_cond:
        # Calculate nextPoints using the second equation:
        # nextPoints = 22*(previousGames +2) - (20*previousGames + 36)
        nextPoints = 22 * (previousGames + 2) - (20 * previousGames + 36)
        print(f"{previousGames:<13} | {nextPoints}")
# The output shows which previousGames satisfy the initial equation and their nextPoints
```
