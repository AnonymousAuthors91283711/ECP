[write_program]
The problem describes a recurrence for a sequence \(E\) with initial conditions \(E(k) = 0\) for \(k \leq 0\) and for \(k > 0\):
\[
E(k) = 1 + \frac{E(k-1) + E(k-2)}{2}.
\]
We want to analyze the asymptotic behavior of \(E(n)\), specifically expressing it as
\[
E(n) \approx a n + b,
\]
and to find the constants \(a\) and \(b\).

We'll write a Python program to:
- Compute \(E(k)\) for \(k\) up to some \(N\),
- Use linear regression or finite differences to guess \(a\) and \(b\),
- Print the computed values and approximations to observe the convergence.

```python
# Program to analyze the sequence defined by
# E(k) = 0 for k <= 0
# E(k) = 1 + (E(k-1) + E(k-2)) / 2 for k > 0
# Goal: find (a,b) with E(n) ~ a*n + b

def compute_sequence(N):
    E = [0]*(N+1)
    for k in range(1, N+1):
        if k == 1:
            E[k] = 1 + (E[k-1] + E[k-2]) / 2  # E[0] and E[-1] treated as 0
        else:
            E[k] = 1 + (E[k-1] + E[k-2]) / 2
    return E

def estimate_linear_params(E):
    # Use last few points to estimate slope a and intercept b via differences
    n = len(E)-1
    # Use points n-4, n-3, n-2, n-1, n
    points = [(i, E[i]) for i in range(n-4, n+1)]
    # Compute slope estimates by finite differences:
    slopes = [(points[i+1][1] - points[i][1]) for i in range(4)]
    avg_slope = sum(slopes)/4
    # Estimate intercept by least squares
    # b ~ E(n) - a*n
    last_intercepts = [E[i] - avg_slope*i for i in range(n-4, n+1)]
    avg_intercept = sum(last_intercepts)/5
    return avg_slope, avg_intercept

def main():
    N = 30
    E = compute_sequence(N)
    print("k\tE(k)")
    for k in range(N+1):
        print(f"{k}\t{E[k]:.8f}")
    a, b = estimate_linear_params(E)
    print(f"\nEstimated asymptotic parameters:")
    print(f"a (slope) = {a:.8f}")
    print(f"b (intercept) = {b:.8f}")
    # Also print E(k) - (a*k + b) to see closeness
    print("\nk\tE(k) - (a*k + b)")
    for k in range(N-5, N+1):
        diff = E[k] - (a*k + b)
        print(f"{k}\t{diff:.8e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
