The problem is to find the expected number of matches between the 6th die and each of the first 5 dice, when rolling 6 dice all with faces from 1 to 6. We want to enumerate sequences of 6 dice rolls from {1,...,6}^6, count how many of the first 5 dice match the 6th die, and compute the expectation.

A direct combinatorial solution: For each fixed last die value, the expected count of matches among first 5 dice is 5*(1/6) since each die has a 1/6 chance to match the last. So overall expectation should be 5/6.

We will enumerate all sequences explicitly for verification and print each sequence's match count streaming. To keep output short, only print counts as integer values as they occur, and after enumeration print the average.

```python
# Enumerate all sequences of length 6 with dice faces 1-6.
# For each sequence, count how many of first 5 equal the 6th.
# Print that count immediately and accumulate sum for expectation.

def main():
    from itertools import product

    faces = range(1, 7)
    total = 0
    n = 6 ** 6
    for seq in product(faces, repeat=6):
        last = seq[5]
        count = sum(1 for i in range(5) if seq[i] == last)
        print(count)
        total += count

    expectation = total / n
    print(f'Expectation: {expectation}')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
