The problem appears to involve finding the smallest natural number \( n \leq 17 \) such that \( n \times 6 + \frac{8 \times 5}{2} \geq 100 \). We want to enumerate all \( n \leq 17 \) satisfying this and print the minimal such \( n \).

Let's implement a Python program to list all \( n \leq 17 \) meeting the inequality, printing each when found, and then explicitly state the minimal \( n \).

```python
# Enumerate n <= 17 such that n*6 + (8*5)/2 >= 100 and print all candidates and minimal

def main():
    threshold = 100
    max_n = 17
    constant_term = (8 * 5) / 2  # 8*5/2 = 20
    candidates = []
    print(f"Enumerating n <= {max_n} with n*6 + {constant_term} >= {threshold}:")
    for n in range(max_n + 1):
        value = n * 6 + constant_term
        if value >= threshold:
            print(f"n = {n}, n*6 + 20 = {value}")
            candidates.append(n)
    if candidates:
        minimal = min(candidates)
        print(f"Minimal n satisfying the condition is {minimal}")
    else:
        print("No n <= 17 satisfies the condition.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
