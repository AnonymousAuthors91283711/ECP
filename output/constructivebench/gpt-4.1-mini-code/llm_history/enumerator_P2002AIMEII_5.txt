The problem involves checking which numbers \( a \) from a given candidate set satisfy the divisibility condition \( a^6 \mid 6^a \). We will enumerate all candidates, test the divisibility, print the failures immediately, and accumulate those to sum them up. Then we'll print the sum.

```python
# Enumerate candidates a in the given set and check if a^6 divides 6^a.
# Print each candidate a for which the divisibility fails.
# At the end, print the sum of these failing candidates.

candidates = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24, 27, 32, 36, 48, 54,
              64, 72, 81, 96, 108, 128, 144, 162, 192, 216, 243, 256,
              288, 324, 384, 432, 486, 512, 576, 648, 729, 768, 864, 972}

failures = []

for a in sorted(candidates):
    # Compute a^6 and 6^a
    a_pow_6 = a**6
    six_pow_a = pow(6, a)
    if six_pow_a % a_pow_6 != 0:
        print(a)
        failures.append(a)

print("Sum of failing candidates:", sum(failures))
```
