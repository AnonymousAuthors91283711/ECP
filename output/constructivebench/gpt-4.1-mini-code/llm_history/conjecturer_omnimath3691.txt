The main issue is that you tried to define an intermediate polynomial `C := X + 1` inside the abbreviation declaration using `:=`, which is not allowed. Instead, directly write the polynomial expression `(X + 1)^2` of type `ℤ[X]`. In Lean, `X` denotes the polynomial variable and addition/multiplication are overloaded properly.

The answer polynomial is the perfect square \((X + 1)^2\), which matches the problem conditions and the enumerated examples pattern.

Here is the corrected Lean expression for the answer polynomial of type `ℤ[X]`:

<<<(X + 1)^2>>>
