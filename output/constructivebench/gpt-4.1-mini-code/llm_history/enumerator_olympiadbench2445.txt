The problem involves solving a system of logarithmic equations for positive real numbers \(x\) and \(y\):

\[
\log_{10}(x^3) + \log_{10}(y^2) = 11
\]
\[
\log_{10}(x^2) - \log_{10}(y^3) = 3
\]

We want to find \((x,y)\) that satisfy both equations. The program below enumerates potential candidates for \(x\) and \(y\) by solving the transformed linear equations in \(\log_{10}x\) and \(\log_{10}y\). It then prints the exact values of \(x\) and \(y\) and verifies the solutions.

```python
import math

# We want to solve:
# 3 log10(x) + 2 log10(y) = 11
# 2 log10(x) - 3 log10(y) = 3
#
# Let a = log10(x), b = log10(y).
# System:
# 3a + 2b = 11
# 2a - 3b = 3

# Solve linear system exactly:
# Multiply second eq by 2:
# 4a - 6b = 6
# Multiply first eq by 3:
# 9a + 6b = 33
# Add:
# 13a = 39 => a = 3
# Substitute in first eq: 3*3 + 2b = 11 => 9 + 2b = 11 => 2b=2 => b=1

# So:
a = 3
b = 1

x = 10**a
y = 10**b

print(f"Computed exact solution:")
print(f"x = 10^{a} = {x}")
print(f"y = 10^{b} = {y}")

# Verify the equations:
eq1 = 3 * a + 2 * b
eq2 = 2 * a - 3 * b
print(f"Check eq1 (should be 11): {eq1}")
print(f"Check eq2 (should be 3): {eq2}")

# For sample verification, also check the logs:
log_x3 = math.log10(x**3)
log_y2 = math.log10(y**2)
log_x2 = math.log10(x**2)
log_y3 = math.log10(y**3)

print(f"log10(x^3) + log10(y^2) = {log_x3 + log_y2}")
print(f"log10(x^2) - log10(y^3) = {log_x2 - log_y3}")
```
