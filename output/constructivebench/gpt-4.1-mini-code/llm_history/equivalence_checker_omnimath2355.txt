Ground Truth Answer: fun n => n - 2
Proposed Answer: fun n => if n <= 3 then 0 else n / 3
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

Problem Analysis:
This is a graph theory problem asking for the maximum number of vertices with degree ≥3 in a graph with n vertices where there's exactly one path between any two distinct vertices (i.e., the graph is a tree).

Ground Truth Answer:
n-2 - This is correct because in a tree with n vertices:
1. The maximum degree is n-1 (star graph)
2. But to maximize vertices with degree ≥3, we need a different configuration
3. The optimal configuration is a "comet" shape with one central vertex connected to many paths
4. In this case, the maximum number of degree ≥3 vertices is indeed n-2

Proposed Answer:
if n <= 3 then 0 else n/3 - This is incorrect because:
1. For n=4, ground truth gives 2 (correct), proposed gives 1 (incorrect)
2. For n=5, ground truth gives 3, proposed gives 1 (integer division)
3. The n/3 formula doesn't match the correct pattern
4. The n <= 3 case is correct (0 is right), but the else case is wrong
