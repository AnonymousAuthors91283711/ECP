The polynomial \( f \) is monic of degree 4 and satisfies:
\[
f(-1) = -1, \quad f(2) = -4, \quad f(-3) = -9, \quad f(4) = -16.
\]
We want to find \( f(1) \).

We can write \( f(x) = x^4 + a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d \) because it is monic of degree 4. We know the values of \( f \) at four points, so we get four equations in \( a,b,c,d \). Solving these exactly will give \( a,b,c,d \) as rationals, then we compute \( f(1) \).

The approach for the enumerator:
- Enumerate over rational candidates for \(a,b,c,d\) by solving the linear system exactly.
- Print candidate exact values for \( f(1) \).
- Include sample parameters formed by given points and values.

Let's implement a program to solve the linear system symbolically using sympy and print the exact solution for \( f(1) \).

```python
from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Rational

# Define variables
a, b, c, d = symbols('a b c d')

# monic degree 4 polynomial: f(x) = x^4 + a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d
# Known points and values
points = [(-1, -1), (2, -4), (-3, -9), (4, -16)]

# Setup equations from f(x) = x^4 + a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d = val
equations = []
for x_val, val in points:
    eq = Eq(x_val**4 + a*x_val**3 + b*x_val**2 + c*x_val + d, val)
    equations.append(eq)

# Solve the system
sol = solve(equations, (a, b, c, d), dict=True)

for solution in sol:
    a_val = solution[a]
    b_val = solution[b]
    c_val = solution[c]
    d_val = solution[d]
    # Compute f(1)
    f1 = 1**4 + a_val*1**3 + b_val*1**2 + c_val*1 + d_val
    print("Parameters used:")
    print(f"a = {a_val}, b = {b_val}, c = {c_val}, d = {d_val}")
    print("Candidate f(1) =", f1)
```
This program finds the exact polynomial coefficients and evaluates \( f(1) \) exactly, printing the solution immediately.
