[write_program]
The problem defines a function \( k(n) \) as the count of 1's in the binary representation of \( 2023 \times n \). We want to find the minimal value of \( m \) for which there exists an \( n > 0 \) such that \( k(n) = m \).

I will write a Python program to enumerate values of \( k(n) \) for \( n \) from 1 up to some reasonable limit (e.g., 10000) to discover possible counts. The program will print each newly found count of 1's, and at the end print the minimal count found.

```python
# Count the number of ones in the binary representation of 2023 * n
def count_ones(x):
    return bin(x).count('1')

def main():
    seen = set()
    limit = 10000  # reasonable iteration limit for enumeration
    print("Parameters: multiplier=2023, n in [1..{}]".format(limit))
    min_count = None
    for n in range(1, limit + 1):
        val = 2023 * n
        c = count_ones(val)
        if c not in seen:
            seen.add(c)
            print("k({}) = {}".format(n, c))
            if min_count is None or c < min_count:
                min_count = c
    print("Minimal value of k(n) found:", min_count)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
