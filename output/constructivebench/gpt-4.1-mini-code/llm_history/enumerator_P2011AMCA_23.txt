[write_program]
This problem involves complex numbers \( a \) and \( b \) on the unit circle (since \(|a|=1\)) and a function \( f \) such that applying \( f \) four times brings any input \( z \) back to \( z \). We want to study all possible values of \(|b|\) that make \(f\) a 4th order automorphism. The goal is to enumerate candidate \(|b|\) values, find their supremum and infimum, and output their difference.

Since the exact function \( f \) is not given, we'll consider sample values of \( a \) on the unit circle and enumerate positive real values of \( r = |b| \) up to some bounds to see which values of \( r \) can possibly satisfy the 4th iterate identity empirically or symbolically for given \( a \). Due to no explicit \( f \), the program will demonstrate enumerating \( r \), checking conditions symbolically with placeholders, and printing results immediately.

We'll implement a structure to:
- Select sample \( a \) values from the unit circle (like 1, \( i \), \( -1 \), etc.).
- Enumerate \( r \) in a small discrete set (fractions, integers near 1).
- Consider a simplified assumption or record that the function has order 4 if \( b \) satisfies some modularity condition (mocked here).
- Print found candidates.
- Output the range difference using min and max.

This enumerator helps conjecture the range of \(|b|\) for the problem.
