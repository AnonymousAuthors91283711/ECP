The problem appears to investigate an inequality involving parameters \(n\) and \(N=2^n\), and a real number \(a\), with a condition that \(a \geq \text{olympiadbench1872_answer}(n)\). To guess the form of \( \text{olympiadbench1872_answer}(n) \), we can try small values of \(n\), calculate \(N=2^n\), and for various \(x\), test the inequality.

The inequality is:
\[
\sqrt[\,1/N]{\frac{x^{2N} + 1}{2}} \leq a(x-1)^2 + x
\]

We want to find the minimal \(a\) such that the inequality holds for all \(x\).

We can re-arrange terms and numerically approximate the minimal \(a\) for given small \(n\) by testing a range of \(x\) values and computing the required \(a\). Since the right side grows quadratically near 1, and the left involves a root mean, checking around \(x\) near 1 should be enough.

We will proceed as follows:
- For \(n = 1, 2, 3\), compute \(N=2^n\).
- For each \(x\) in a range (say from 0 to 2 in small steps, including points near 1), calculate lhs = \(\sqrt[1/N]{(x^{2N}+1)/2}\),
- Then, solve \(a \geq \frac{\text{lhs} - x}{(x-1)^2}\) for \(x \neq 1\).
- Take the supremum (max) of these values over \(x\), the minimal \(a\) satisfying the inequality.
- Print candidates for each \(n\).

Let's code this approximate enumeration efficiently and stream partial results.

```python
import math

def lhs(x, N):
    # Compute ((x^{2N} + 1)/2)^{1/N}
    return ((x**(2*N) + 1)/2)**(1/N)

def candidate_a(x, N):
    if abs(x - 1) < 1e-12:
        return None  # avoid division by zero
    numerator = lhs(x, N) - x
    denominator = (x - 1)**2
    return numerator / denominator

def enumerate_candidates_for_n(n):
    N = 2**n
    xs = []

    # Select a refined set of points focusing near x=1 and wider range
    for delta in [i*0.01 for i in range(-50,51)]:  # 0.5 around 1
        x = 1 + delta
        if x > 0:
            xs.append(x)
    # Add points away from 1 to check behavior
    xs += [0.1, 0.5, 1.5, 2.0]

    candidates = []
    for x in xs:
        a_cand = candidate_a(x, N)
        if a_cand is not None:
            candidates.append(a_cand)
            print(f"n={n}, N=2^{n}={N}, x={x:.3f}, candidate a = {a_cand:.6f}")

    if candidates:
        a_min = max(candidates)
        print(f"n={n}, minimal a (approx) >= {a_min:.6f}")
    else:
        print(f"n={n}, no candidates found")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    for n in range(1,4):
        print(f"Enumerating candidates for n={n}:")
        enumerate_candidates_for_n(n)
        print()
```
This script prints candidate \(a\) values for several \(x\) and outputs the minimal \(a\) bound found for \(n=1,2,3\). This will help build conjectures on the form of olympiadbench1872_answer.
