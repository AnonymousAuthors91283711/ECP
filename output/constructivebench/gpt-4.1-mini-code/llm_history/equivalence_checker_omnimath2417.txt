Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: 25502400
<<<None>>>
Since the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (which typically means it's intentionally left undefined in theorem proving contexts), we cannot verify whether the proposed answer "25502400" is correct or equivalent. The problem appears to be from a theorem proving context (using Lean/Mathlib), and without the actual ground truth value, we cannot make a determination.
