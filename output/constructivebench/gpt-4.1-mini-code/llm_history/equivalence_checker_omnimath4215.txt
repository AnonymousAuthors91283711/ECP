Ground Truth Answer: fun m a b c i => 
    let S := a + b + c
    match i with
    | 0 => (1 / (m - 1)) * (c - S / (m + 2))
    | 1 => (1 / (m - 1)) * (b - S / (m + 2))
    | 2 => (1 / (m - 1)) * (a - S / (m + 2))
Proposed Answer: fun m a b c i =>
  let denom := (m + 2) * (m - 1)
  match i with
  | 0 => ((m + 1) * a - b - c) / denom
  | 1 => (a + (m + 1) * b - c) / denom
  | 2 => (a - b + (m + 1) * c) / denom
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

1. First, observe that both answers are functions taking m, a, b, c and returning a vector of 3 components.

2. The ground truth answer uses S = a + b + c and expresses each component in terms of (value - S/(m+2)) divided by (m-1).

3. The proposed answer uses a common denominator (m+2)(m-1) and different numerators for each component.

4. Let's verify if they're equivalent by expanding the ground truth answer:
   For i=0: (1/(m-1))*(c - (a+b+c)/(m+2)) = [c(m+2) - (a+b+c)]/[(m-1)(m+2)]
   = [cm + 2c - a - b - c]/denom = [-a - b + (m+1)c]/denom
   This matches the proposed answer's i=2 case (with variables permuted)

5. Similarly, the other components will match but with rotated variable assignments:
   - Ground truth's i=0 corresponds to proposed's i=2 (with a↔c)
   - Ground truth's i=1 corresponds to proposed's i=1
   - Ground truth's i=2 corresponds to proposed's i=0 (with a↔c)

6. The difference is just a permutation of the output components, but the mathematical expressions are equivalent when properly matched.
