[write_program]
The problem is to explore for which pairs \((m,n)\) with \(m,n>0\) there exists a polynomial \(p \in \mathbb{Z}[X]\) such that

\[
\sum_{k=0}^m X^{n k} = \left(\sum_{k=0}^m X^k\right) \cdot p.
\]

We want to enumerate such \((m,n)\) for small values to conjecture the exact characterization (which typically involves divisibility or constraints on \(m,n\)).

The program will:
- Iterate over small \(m,n\) (say up to 10).
- Construct the polynomials \(\sum_{k=0}^m X^{nk}\) and \(\sum_{k=0}^m X^k\).
- Check if the former is divisible by the latter in \(\mathbb{Z}[X]\).
- When divisibility holds, print the pair \((m,n)\).

This will help hypothesize the possible structure of the answer.

```python
# Enumerate (m,n) with m,n in [1..10], check if sum X^{n*k} (k=0..m) 
# is divisible by sum X^k (k=0..m) over integer coefficients, print pairs where true.

from sympy import symbols, Poly, div

def main():
    X = symbols('X')
    max_val = 10
    for m in range(1, max_val+1):
        base_poly = sum(X**k for k in range(m+1))
        base_p = Poly(base_poly, X, domain='ZZ')
        for n in range(1, max_val+1):
            poly = sum(X**(n*k) for k in range(m+1))
            p = Poly(poly, X, domain='ZZ')
            quotient, remainder = div(p, base_p, domain='ZZ')
            if remainder.as_expr() == 0:
                print(f'(m,n)=({m},{n}) divisible with quotient {quotient.as_expr()}')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
