The problem is about finding the least positive integer \(t\) for which there exists a function \(x : \{0, \ldots, t-1\} \to \mathbb{Z}\) such that the sum of the cubes of \(x(i)\) equals \(2002^{2002}\).

The program enumerates possible \(t\) values (number of terms \(t\)) starting from 1 and tries to find integer solutions \((x_0,\ldots,x_{t-1})\) to the equation \(\sum x_i^3 = 2002^{2002}\). We'll attempt to find sums of cubes equal to \(2002^{2002}\) with increasingly many cubes. We'll limit the range of \(x_i\) for computational feasibility. 

Since \(2002^{2002}\) is enormous, direct search is impossible, but we can try small powers like \(200^2\) or smaller powers for demonstration to conjecture the minimal \(t\).

The program prints intermediate results including the chosen target values and possible decompositions of cubes summing approximately (exact in the reduced examples) to these targets.

```python
# Enumerate minimal t for expressing n = a^b as sum of t cubes of integers
# Due to huge exponent 2002, we test smaller exponents and bases to conjecture behavior.

def cubes_up_to(n):
    # generate cubes up to n
    c = []
    i = 0
    while i**3 <= n:
        c.append(i**3)
        i += 1
    return c

def find_sum_of_cubes(target, max_terms, max_abs=50):
    # Search for a solution with up to max_terms cubes in range [-max_abs, max_abs]
    # Uses simple backtracking. Prints exact solutions when found.
    sols = []
    arr = []
    def backtrack(pos, current_sum):
        if pos == max_terms:
            if current_sum == target:
                sols.append(arr.copy())
                print(f"Sum of cubes = {target} found with {max_terms} terms: {arr}")
            return
        # Try small range for speed
        for x in range(-max_abs, max_abs+1):
            arr.append(x)
            s_new = current_sum + x**3
            # Prune if s_new too large or too small
            if abs(s_new) <= abs(target):
                backtrack(pos+1, s_new)
            arr.pop()
    backtrack(0, 0)
    return sols

    # Sample smaller targets due to complexity; print parameters used
    exponents = [2,3]  # test for perfect squares and cubes of 2002
    base = 2002
    max_terms_limit = 4  # small t for demo
    max_abs = 30

    for b in exponents:
        target = base**b
        print(f"Testing target = {base}^{b} = {target} with max_terms up to {max_terms_limit}")
