The problem involves finding the largest natural number \( m \) for which there exist collections of sets \( (A_i)_{i=0}^{m-1} \) and \( (B_i)_{i=0}^{m-1} \) such that:
- Each \( A_i \) has cardinality 2012,
- Each \( B_i \) has cardinality 2013,
- For all \( i, j \), \( A_i \) and \( B_j \) are disjoint if and only if \( i = j \).

We want to enumerate possible \( m \) values and attempt to build such families concretely with small \( m \), then print candidates and verify constraints. This will help conjecture the maximum \( m \).

We try small values of \( m \) such as 1, 2, 3, ..., and for each, attempt to construct explicit examples or counterexamples using sets of natural numbers. The idea is to pick disjoint unions and intersecting sets accordingly, printing \( m \) values where constructions are possible.

```python
# enumerator.py
# Enumerate possible m for the problem:
# Find largest m with sets A_i (|A_i|=2012), B_i (|B_i|=2013),
# and Disjoint(A_i, B_j) iff i=j.

def test_m(m):
    # Strategy:
    # Construct all A_i disjoint, each size 2012:
    # A_i = {2012*i, ..., 2012*i+2011}
    # For B_i, must be disjoint from A_i, but intersect every A_j for j!=i.
    # Each B_i has size 2013.
    # Try constructing B_i as {all elements in A_j for j!=i} plus some extras to get 2013.
    # Since sets are from N, guess that B_i includes exactly one element from each A_j (j!=i),
    # then add distinct elements outside all A_i to make total size 2013.
    # This requires sum of (m-1) elements from different A_j plus extras =2013.
    # Must check feasibility.
    
    # Sizes:
    # |A_i|=2012
    # |B_i|=2013
    # Number of other A_j sets: m-1
    # Need to select from these sets one element each => (m-1) elements must be in B_i
    # The rest (2013-(m-1)) elements are new extras disjoint from all A_i.
    
    if m <= 0:
        return False
    if 2013 - (m - 1) < 0:
        return False  # can't have negative extra elements
    
    # Total extras needed per B_i:
    extras = 2013 - (m - 1)
    # Check that extras >=0, which implies m <= 2013 + 1 = 2014
    
    # Also, since each A_i has 2012 elements, when m is large, total elements used by A_i is 2012*m.
    # For B_i construct, must pick 1 element from every A_j (j!=i)
    # So (m-1) must be <= 2012 because from each A_j picking 1 distinct element
    
    if m - 1 > 2012:
        return False
    
    # So m <= 2013 to satisfy this
    
    return True

print("Attempting values of m:")
candidates = []
for m in range(1, 21):  # small range for brevity
    feasible = test_m(m)
    print(f"m = {m}: feasible = {feasible}")
    if feasible:
        candidates.append(m)

if candidates:
    max_m = max(candidates)
    print(f"Maximum candidate m found: {max_m}")
else:
    print("No feasible m found in tested range.")
