The problem involves enumerating sets of positive integers (card counts) for small values of n to check a condition related to the equality of arithmetic and geometric means over subsets. We will try small n (e.g., 2 and 3), generate possible card assignments, and test if for every pair (i, j), there exists a nonempty subset S with the stated condition holding exactly.

We will print such card assignments where the condition holds, assisting conjecturing that all cards must be equal.

```python
from itertools import product, combinations

def arithmetic_mean(vals):
    return sum(vals) / len(vals)

def geometric_mean(vals):
    prod = 1
    for v in vals:
        prod *= v
    return prod ** (1 / len(vals))

def check_condition(cards):
    n = len(cards)
    # For all pairs (i,j), check existence of nonempty subset S âŠ† [0,n), such that:
    # (cards[i] + cards[j])/2 == geometric_mean(cards over S)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            target = (cards[i] + cards[j]) / 2
            found = False
            # Enumerate all nonempty subsets of indices
            for r in range(1, n+1):
                for subset in combinations(range(n), r):
                    vals = [cards[k] for k in subset]
                    gm = geometric_mean(vals)
                    # exact equality check for floats; use isclose with strict tolerance
                    if abs(gm - target) < 1e-12:
                        found = True
                        break
                if found:
                    break
            if not found:
                return False
    return True

def enumerate_cards(n, max_card):
    # Generate all n-length tuples of positive integers up to max_card
    for cards in product(range(1, max_card+1), repeat=n):
        if check_condition(cards):
            print(f"n={n} cards={cards}")

def main():
    print("Checking n=2 with cards up to 5:")
    enumerate_cards(2, 5)
    print("Checking n=3 with cards up to 5:")
    enumerate_cards(3, 5)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
