open Set Nat

abbrev mathodyssey1_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem mathodyssey1 : 
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | ∀ (T : Finset ℕ), T ⊆ (Icc 1 2024).toFinset → (∀ x ∈ T, ∀ y ∈ T, x ≠ y → Coprime x y) → (∃ p ∈ T, Nat.Prime p)} mathodyssey1_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Number of prime bases for prime powers ≥ 2: 14
Including 1, maximal coprime set without primes has size: 15
Therefore minimal n is 16
Example maximal pairwise coprime set with no primes:
[1, 4, 9, 25, 49, 121, 169, 289, 361, 529, 841, 961, 1369, 1681, 1849]. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
