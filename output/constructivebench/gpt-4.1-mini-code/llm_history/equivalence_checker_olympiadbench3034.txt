Ground Truth Answer: 6455
Proposed Answer: 5 + 45 * (2011 - 1)
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem is asking for the smallest number N where:
1. N > 0
2. The number of digits of 2N is exactly one more than the number of digits of N
3. There are exactly 2011 numbers ≤ N that satisfy these conditions

The ground truth answer is 6455. The proposed answer is a formula: 5 + 45 * (2011 - 1).

Let's evaluate the proposed formula:
5 + 45 * (2011 - 1) = 5 + 45 * 2010 = 5 + 90450 = 90455

This is clearly different from 6455. The proposed answer is off by orders of magnitude.

The correct answer should be in the range where numbers transition from 4-digit to 5-digit when doubled (specifically numbers from 5000 to 9999, since 2*5000=10000 is the first 5-digit result), but 90455 is way beyond this range.
