The problem investigates the count of numbers below 100 that contain the digit 6. The program will enumerate numbers from 0 to 99, check for digit 6, print those numbers, then print the total count.

```python
# Enumerate numbers 0 to 99 containing digit '6' and count them
def digits(n):
    return set(str(n))

count = 0
print("Numbers with digit 6:")
for n in range(100):
    if '6' in digits(n):
        print(n)
        count += 1
print("Total count:", count)
```
