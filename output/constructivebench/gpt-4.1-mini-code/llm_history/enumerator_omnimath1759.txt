[write_program]
The problem involves summing integers from 1 to 199 with a specific rule: ignore numbers divisible by 10; and for others, add +n if n is odd and -n if n is even (both with sign). I'll write a Python program to enumerate and print partial sums step-by-step to conjecture the value.

```python
# Enumerate sums for n from 1 to 199, skipping multiples of 10.
# Add n if odd, subtract n if even, sum incrementally and print partial sums.

def main():
    total = 0
    for n in range(1, 200):
        if n % 10 == 0:
            # Skip multiples of 10
            continue
        if n % 2 == 1:
            total += n
        else:
            total -= n
        print(f"n={n}, partial_sum={total}")
    print(f"Final sum = {total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
