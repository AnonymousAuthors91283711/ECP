This problem involves variables \(a, b, x, y\) with constraints and relations involving squares and sums. We want to find the greatest \(\rho\) such that there exist \(x, y \geq 0\) with \(x < a, y < b\), and the two given equations hold:

\[
a^2 = x^2 + y^2 + xy \quad \text{and} \quad b^2 = x^2 + y^2
\]

with \(b \leq a\) and \(b > 0\).

To investigate this, let's fix some small rational pairs \((a,b)\) with \(b \leq a\), \(b > 0\), and try to find \(\rho = \frac{a}{b}\) that works (by solving for \(x,y\) satisfying the system and constraints). The problem likely wants the supremum of \(\rho = \frac{a}{b}\) for which the conditions hold.

We can attempt enumerations over small positive integer pairs \((a,b)\), with \(1 \leq b \leq a \leq 10\), and for each pair try to solve for \(x,y\) with the constraints. Since \(x^2 + y^2 = b^2\), and \(x,y\) nonnegative real, we parametrize \(x = r \cos \theta, y = r \sin \theta\) or directly check values on the circle \(x^2 + y^2 = b^2\).

Then we check if \(a^2 = x^2 + y^2 + xy = b^2 + xy\), so \(a^2 = b^2 + xy\), so \(xy = a^2 - b^2\).

Given \(x^2 + y^2 = b^2\), and \(xy = a^2 - b^2\), the problem boils down to finding \(x,y \ge 0\), \(x < a\), \(y < b\), and their product equal to \(a^2 - b^2\), with sum of squares equal to \(b^2\).

Because \(xy\) cannot exceed \(\frac{(x + y)^2}{4} \leq \frac{(a + b)^2}{4}\), and \(x,y\) constrained by \(x^2 + y^2 = b^2\), we may try to enumerate pairs \((a,b)\), attempt to find \(x,y\), print the approximate ratio \(\frac{a}{b}\).

We will enumerate rational values of \(a,b\), try solving quadratic for \(x,y\) (or parametrize \(x = t\), \(y = \sqrt{b^2 - t^2}\)), then check if \(t \cdot y = a^2 - b^2\).

We print each \(\frac{a}{b}\) where a solution with constraints is found.
