[write_program]
The problem involves two distinct triples \((x_1,y_1,z_1)\) and \((x_2,y_2,z_2)\) of real numbers satisfying the same symmetric sums of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd powers. We want to explore pairs \((y_1,y_2)\) under these conditions.

To investigate, I'll write a Python program to:
- Enumerate real triples satisfying the sums \(x+y+z=6\), \(x^2+y^2+z^2=8\), \(x^3+y^3+z^3=5\).
- For efficiency, parametrize two variables and calculate the third via the sum constraint.
- Roughly scan for real triples (x,y,z) that satisfy the constraints (with a tolerance).
- Print discovered solutions and then candidate sums \(y_1+y_2\) for distinct pairs.

We restrict scanning to some grid of values for (x, y) and compute z = 6-x-y, checking the constraints. Then pair solutions distinct by coordinates and print \(y_1 + y_2\).

This will allow enumerating possible \(y_1+y_2\) values appearing in such pairs.

```python
import math

# Parameters for scanning and tolerance
STEP = 0.5
TOL = 1e-4

solutions = []

# Given constraints:
# x + y + z = 6
# x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 8
# x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 5

# We'll scan x,y in some range and calculate z = 6 - x - y, then check sums

for x in [i*STEP for i in range(-20, 21)]:  # Rough range from -10 to 10
    for y in [j*STEP for j in range(-20, 21)]:
        z = 6 - x - y
        s2 = x*x + y*y + z*z
        s3 = x**3 + y**3 + z**3
        if abs(s2 - 8) < TOL and abs(s3 - 5) < TOL:
            # Store as a sorted tuple to avoid permutations counted as distinct
            triple = tuple(sorted((x, y, z)))
            if triple not in solutions:
                solutions.append(triple)
                print(f"Solution triple: {triple}")

print("\nChecking pairs of distinct solutions and sums y1+y2:")

# For each pair of distinct solutions, print y1 + y2 values (y is the middle element here)
for i in range(len(solutions)):
    for j in range(i+1, len(solutions)):
        t1 = solutions[i]
        t2 = solutions[j]
        if t1 != t2:
            y1 = sorted(t1)[1]
            y2 = sorted(t2)[1]
            sum_y = y1 + y2
            print(f"y1 + y2 = {sum_y:.4f} from triples {t1} and {t2}")
```
