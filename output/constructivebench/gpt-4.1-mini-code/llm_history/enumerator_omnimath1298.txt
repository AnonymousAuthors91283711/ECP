[write_program]
The problem counts sequences of length n+m with n false and m true values, such that for every prefix, it's not the case that both counts of false and true are odd. We want to enumerate such sequences for n=8, m=14.

I'll write a Python program to generate all bit strings with 8 falses (0) and 14 trues (1), and print those sequences that satisfy the prefix condition. We print sequences as 0/1 strings, and finally print the count. We only handle the given (8,14).

```python
from itertools import combinations

n, m = 8, 14
length = n + m
total = 0

# Generate indices where 0's are placed
for zero_positions in combinations(range(length), n):
    # zero_positions defines which indices are False (0)
    # build the sequence
    seq = [1] * length
    for pos in zero_positions:
        seq[pos] = 0

    valid = True
    cnt0 = 0
    cnt1 = 0
    # check prefix condition
    for k in range(1, length + 1):
        if seq[k-1] == 0:
            cnt0 += 1
        else:
            cnt1 += 1
        if (cnt0 % 2 == 1) and (cnt1 % 2 == 1):
            valid = False
            break
    if valid:
        total += 1
        # print sequence with 0/1
        print(''.join(str(x) for x in seq))

print("Total valid sequences:", total)
```
