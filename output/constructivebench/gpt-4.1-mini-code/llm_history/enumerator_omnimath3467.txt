[write_program]
We have a list of numbers from 1 to 20 and transform it by swapping its two halves. The task is to find the element at index 12 (0-based) in the new list. The code will just emulate this and print all list elements around index 12 to conjecture the answer.

```python
# Enumerate the process described in the problem
original_list = list(range(1, 21))
first_half = original_list[:10]
second_half = original_list[10:]
new_list = second_half + first_half

print("Parameters: List range 1..20, index 12 (0-based)")
print("First half:", first_half)
print("Second half:", second_half)
print("New list:", new_list)

# Enumerate elements around index 12
start = max(0, 12-3)
end = min(len(new_list), 12+4)
print(f"Elements from index {start} to {end-1} in new_list:")
for i in range(start, end):
    print(f"Index {i}: {new_list[i]}")

print("\nAnswer is new_list[12] =", new_list[12])
```
