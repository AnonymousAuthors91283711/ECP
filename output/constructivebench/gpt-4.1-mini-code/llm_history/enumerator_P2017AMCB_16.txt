The problem appears to involve enumerating the odd factors of 21! and computing the ratio of the number of odd factors of 21! to the total number of factors of 21!. The problem statement references sets:
- factors = {k ∈ ℕ | k divides 21!}
- S = {k ∈ factors | k is odd}

We want to find the ratio |S|/|factors|.

To approach this in Python, we can:
- Factorize 21! into primes and their exponents.
- Compute the total number of factors = product of (exponents + 1).
- Compute the number of odd factors = product of (exponents of odd primes + 1).
- The ratio = odd_factors / total_factors.

We will print:
- Prime factors and exponents of 21!
- Number of factors total and odd
- The ratio.

This program enumerates the primes up to 21, computes the exponents of these primes in 21!, and outputs the ratio.

```python
# Enumerate ratio of number of odd factors of 21! to total factors

def primes_up_to(n):
    sieve = [True]*(n+1)
    sieve[0]=False; sieve[1]=False
    for i in range(2,int(n**0.5)+1):
        if sieve[i]:
            for j in range(i*i,n+1,i):
                sieve[j]=False
    return [p for p in range(2,n+1) if sieve[p]]

def exponent_in_factorial(n,p):
    # exponent of prime p in n!
    exp=0
    k = p
    while k<=n:
        exp += n//k
        k*=p
    return exp

def main():
    n = 21
    primes = primes_up_to(n)
    print(f"Primes up to {n}: {primes}")
    exps = []
    for p in primes:
        e = exponent_in_factorial(n,p)
        exps.append((p,e))
        print(f"Prime {p} exponent in {n}! = {e}")

    total_factors = 1
    odd_factors = 1
    for p,e in exps:
        total_factors *= (e+1)
        if p != 2:
            odd_factors *= (e+1)
    print(f"Total factors of {n}! = {total_factors}")
    print(f"Odd factors of {n}! = {odd_factors}")
    ratio = odd_factors / total_factors
    print(f"Ratio (odd factors / total factors) = {ratio}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This will print all intermediary data immediately and then the final ratio.
