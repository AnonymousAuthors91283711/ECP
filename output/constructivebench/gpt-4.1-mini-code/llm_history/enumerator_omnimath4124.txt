This problem involves finding natural numbers \( n > 0 \) for which there exists a partition of the six consecutive integers \( \{n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4, n+5\} \) into two triples \(\{a,b,c\}\) and \(\{d,e,f\}\) such that the products of the triples are equal. The goal is to enumerate such \( n \) values (or confirm no such \( n \) exists up to some threshold). I'll write a Python program to iterate through sample values of \( n \), check all partitions of the set into two triples, and print those \( n \) for which the product equality holds.

```python
from itertools import combinations
from math import prod

# We'll test n from 1 up to 50 to keep output manageable.
MAX_N = 50

print("n values with equal triple products partition:")

for n in range(1, MAX_N + 1):
    nums = [n + i for i in range(6)]
    found = False
    # Enumerate all 3-combinations for the first triple
    for triple1 in combinations(nums, 3):
        triple2 = [x for x in nums if x not in triple1]
        # Check if product of triple1 equals product of triple2
        if prod(triple1) == prod(triple2):
            # Print the solution for this n
            print(f"n={n}, triples={triple1} and {tuple(triple2)}, product={prod(triple1)}")
            found = True
            # We print all such partitions, but break to avoid duplicate sets
            # because the roles could be switched.
            # So break after first found partition for given n.
            break
```
This code enumerates all partitions into two triples and prints immediately when such partitions are found for each \( n \). It helps conjecture which \( n \) belong to `omnimath4124_answer`.
