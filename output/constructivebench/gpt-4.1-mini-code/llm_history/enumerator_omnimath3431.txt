The problem seems to involve integer pairs \((m, n)\) such that for all integers \(x\),
\[
(x + m)(x + n) = x^2 + (m + n)x + mn
\]
with the condition
\[
mn = -12.
\]
The equation holds for all \(x\) by expansion, so we want to enumerate integer pairs \((m, n)\) with product \(-12\), and analyze if a certain integer \(m\) can or cannot be in the set of such \(m\).

To assist with conjecturing and exploring, I'll enumerate all integer pairs \((m, n)\) with \(m \cdot n = -12\), printing the pairs immediately when found.

```python
# Enumerate integer pairs (m, n) with m*n = -12
# Print pairs as soon as found to assist in conjecture
# We'll limit to |m|, |n| <= 20 to keep output concise

product = -12
limit = 20

print(f"Enumerating integer pairs (m,n) with m*n = {product}:")

pairs = []
for m in range(-limit, limit + 1):
    if m == 0:
        continue
    if product % m == 0:
        n = product // m
        if -limit <= n <= limit:
            # Print each valid pair immediately
            print(f"m={m}, n={n}")
            pairs.append((m, n))

# After enumeration, print unique m values found
unique_m = sorted(set(m for m, n in pairs))
print("\nUnique m values found:", unique_m)
```

This program enumerates all integer pairs with product \(-12\), printing results streaming. From the output, one could then test which values of \(m\) can appear in such pairs and help in proving or disproving membership of \(m\) in the desired set.
