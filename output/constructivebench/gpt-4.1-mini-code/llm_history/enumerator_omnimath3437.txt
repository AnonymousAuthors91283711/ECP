The problem defines a set \( S \) of natural numbers \( p \) such that there exist positive integers \( a, b \) with \( a \cdot b = 24 \) and \( 2(a+b) = p \). We want to find all such \( p \), and identify the unique natural number not in \( S \), which will be the answer.

Since \( a,b \) are positive divisors of 24, enumerate all positive factor pairs \((a,b)\) with \(a b = 24\), compute \(p = 2(a+b)\), and print these \(p\). Then, check small natural numbers outside the found set to find the unique missing one.

```python
# Enumerate p = 2(a+b) for positive integers a,b with a*b=24.
# List all positive divisors a of 24, find corresponding b=24//a,
# compute p=2*(a+b), collect all distinct p.
# Then check natural numbers not in this set up to max(p)+10 and print any missing.

def main():
    n = 24
    ps = set()
    for a in range(1, n+1):
        if n % a == 0:
            b = n // a
            if a > 0 and b > 0:
                p = 2 * (a + b)
                print(f"Found p = 2 * ({a} + {b}) = {p}")
                ps.add(p)
    print("\nDistinct p values in S:", sorted(ps))
    max_p = max(ps)
    print("\nChecking natural numbers up to", max_p + 10, "for missing p:")
    missing = []
    for x in range(1, max_p + 11):
        if x not in ps:
            print(f"p = {x} is NOT in S")
            missing.append(x)
    print("\nCandidates for unique missing p:", missing)
    if len(missing) == 1:
        print("Unique missing p (omnimath3437_answer):", missing[0])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
