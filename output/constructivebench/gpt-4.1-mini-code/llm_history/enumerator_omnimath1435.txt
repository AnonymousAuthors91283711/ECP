The problem involves finding natural numbers \( n > 0 \) such that \( n^2 + 1 \) is divisible by \( \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor^2 + 2 \).

We'll enumerate values of \( n \) from 1 to a reasonable limit (e.g., 1000), compute the divisor, and check divisibility. We'll print each \( n \) that satisfies the divisibility and in the end print all such \( n \) as candidates for the set `omnimath1435_answer`.

```python
import math

# Enumerate n from 1 to 1000, and check if (n^2 + 1) divisible by floor(sqrt(n))^2 + 2
def main():
    limit = 1000
    answers = []
    for n in range(1, limit + 1):
        floor_sqrt = math.isqrt(n)  # equivalent to floor of sqrt(n)
        divisor = floor_sqrt**2 + 2
        numerator = n**2 + 1
        if numerator % divisor == 0:
            print(f"n={n}, divisor={divisor}, quotient={(numerator // divisor)}")
            answers.append(n)
    print("\nCandidates for omnimath1435_answer up to", limit, ":", answers)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
