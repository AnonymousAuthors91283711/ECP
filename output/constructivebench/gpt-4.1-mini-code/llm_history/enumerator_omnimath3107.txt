The problem involves solving a linear equation: 4x + 14 = 8x - 48. We want to find the value of 2x given this equation.

The program below enumerates values of x over a small range and checks the equation. When the equation holds, it prints the value of 2x exactly.

```python
# Enumerate x over small rational candidates to find 2*x where 4*x + 14 = 8*x - 48 holds exactly

def is_solution(x):
    return 4 * x + 14 == 8 * x - 48

# We can test rationals with denominator up to 10 within a range to find exact solution
from fractions import Fraction

for denom in range(1, 11):
    for num in range(-100, 101):
        x = Fraction(num, denom)
        if is_solution(x):
            print(f"x = {x}, 2*x = {2*x}")
            # Since solution is unique, can break after printing
            break
    else:
        continue
    break
```
