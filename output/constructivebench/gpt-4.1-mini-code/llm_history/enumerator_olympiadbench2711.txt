The problem is to find the smallest natural number greater than 2013 that cannot be represented as a sum of two palindromic numbers (where palindromic numbers have no leading zeros and are not zero).

We will:
- Generate palindromic numbers up to some limit beyond 2013.
- For each number n > 2013, check if it can be expressed as a sum of two palindromes.
- Output each such n found that cannot be expressed as such.
- Stop once we find the smallest such number.
  
We will try some upper bound and print partial results for verification.

```python
# Enumerate numbers just above 2013 and find the smallest that cannot be
# expressed as a sum of two palindrome numbers (no leading zeros and nonzero).

def is_palindrome(n: int) -> bool:
    if n == 0:
        return False  # exclude zero
    s = str(n)
    if s[0] == '0':
        return False  # leading zero disallowed by problem (digits reversed and leading digits no zero)
    return s == s[::-1]

# Since we want sums > 2013, consider palindromes up to about 4000 for coverage.
max_n = 4000

# Generate palindromes up to max_n.
palindromes = [p for p in range(1, max_n + 1) if is_palindrome(p)]

pal_set = set(palindromes)

# For each n > 2013 up to max_n, test if n = a + b for palindrome a,b
def can_be_sum(n):
    for a in palindromes:
        if a > n:
            break
        b = n - a
        if b in pal_set:
            return True
    return False

found = []
for n in range(2014, max_n+1):
    if not can_be_sum(n):
        print(n)
        found.append(n)
        # Stop at first minimal number
        break

if found:
    print(f"Smallest number >2013 not sum of two palindromes: {found[0]}")
else:
    print("No such number found up to", max_n)
```
