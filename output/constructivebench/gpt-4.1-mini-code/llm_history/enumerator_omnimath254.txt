[write_program]
The problem asks to find the smallest size of a set defined by counting integers \( k \in [1,2011] \) for which \((a k) \bmod 2012 > (b k) \bmod 2012\), for distinct \( a, b \in (0,2012) \).

The program below enumerates candidates for \( a, b \) in a smaller test range (1 to 20) to detect patterns and outputs their set sizes immediately. It keeps track of the minimum size encountered and outputs it at the end.

```python
# Enumerate sizes of sets {k in [1, N-1] | (a*k)%N > (b*k)%N} for distinct a, b in (1, M)
# Here N=2012 and M=2012 in problem, but reduced to smaller sample for feasibility and pattern spotting.

N = 50   # Reduced modulus for tractability and example discovery
M = 20   # Reduced range for a,b

min_size = None
min_pairs = []

print(f"Enumerating for N={N}, a,b in [1,{M}] distinct:")

for a in range(1, M+1):
    for b in range(1, M+1):
        if a == b:
            continue
        count = 0
        for k in range(1, N):
            if ((a * k) % N) > ((b * k) % N):
                count += 1
        print(f"a={a}, b={b}, count={count}")
        if min_size is None or count < min_size:
            min_size = count
            min_pairs = [(a, b)]
        elif count == min_size:
            min_pairs.append((a, b))

print("\nMinimum count encountered:", min_size)
print("Pairs (a,b) achieving minimum count:")
for p in min_pairs:
    print(p)
```
