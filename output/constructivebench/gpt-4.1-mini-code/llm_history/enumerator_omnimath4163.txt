The problem is to investigate functions \( f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \) that are strictly increasing, satisfy \( f(1) = 2 \), and the functional equation \( f(f(n)) = f(n) + n \).

This is a challenging functional equation. To guide conjectures, the program will:

- Enumerate candidate functions over a small domain (e.g., n=1 to 10).
- Enforce strict monotonicity (f(n+1) > f(n)).
- Check if \( f(f(n)) = f(n) + n \) holds for all n in domain.
- Print all sequences f(1)..f(10) that satisfy these constraints on the limited domain.

To keep output concise, we print possible f arrays satisfying the constraints for n=1..10.

```python
# Enumerate strictly increasing functions f: {1..10} → ℕ with f(1)=2
# Check if f(f(n)) = f(n) + n holds for n=1..10 (where f(n) is within domain)
# Since f(f(n)) requires f(n) ≤ 10, we restrict values to ≤10 for indexing

def check_f(f):
    for n in range(1, 11):
        fn = f[n]
        if fn > 10:
            # f(f(n)) undefined as index out of range
            return False
        if f[fn] != fn + n:
            return False
    return True

def enumerate_f():
    # f[1..10], with f[1]=2, and strictly increasing f[i] < f[i+1]
    # Values must be ≥ 2 and ≤ 20 (arbitrary upper limit)
    # Since f(1)=2, next values > 2 and values ≤ max_val
    max_val = 30

    # Use backtracking to build f array, index from 1 to 10
    f = [0]*11
    f[1] = 2

    def backtrack(i):
        if i == 11:
            if check_f(f):
                print([f[j] for j in range(1,11)])
            return
        start = f[i-1] + 1
        for val in range(start, max_val+1):
            f[i] = val
            backtrack(i+1)

    backtrack(2)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Enumerating strictly increasing f: N→N with f(1)=2 and f(f(n))=f(n)+n for n=1..10")
    enumerate_f()
```
