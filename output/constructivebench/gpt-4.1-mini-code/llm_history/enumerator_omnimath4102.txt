The problem involves functional equations on real functions \(f\) and \(g\) satisfying 
\[ g(f(x+y)) = f(x) + (2x+y)g(y) \]
for all real \(x, y\).

To explore candidates, let's enumerate simple polynomial forms for \(f\) and \(g\) with small integer coefficients. We'll verify the equation for these candidates and print those that fit the condition exactly.


```python
# Enumerate polynomial candidates for f, g with low degree and integer coefficients
# Check if they satisfy g(f(x+y)) = f(x) + (2x + y)*g(y) for many sample x,y

def poly_eval(coeffs, x):
    return sum(c * x**i for i, c in enumerate(coeffs))

def check_fg(f_coeffs, g_coeffs):
    # check equation for multiple sample points exactly
    for x in (-2, -1, 0, 1, 2):
        for y in (-2, -1, 0, 1, 2):
            left = poly_eval(g_coeffs, poly_eval(f_coeffs, x + y))
            right = poly_eval(f_coeffs, x) + (2 * x + y) * poly_eval(g_coeffs, y)
            if abs(left - right) > 1e-9:
                return False
    return True

# Restrict ourselves to degrees 0 or 1 or 2 with coefficients in {-2,-1,0,1,2}
coeffs_range = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]

print("Checking polynomial pairs (f, g) for the functional equation:")

for deg_f in range(3):
    for f_coeffs in [(a if i <= deg_f else 0) for i, a in enumerate([0]*(deg_f+1))]:
        # build all combinations for f coeffs
        from itertools import product
        f_coeffs_list = list(product(coeffs_range, repeat=deg_f+1))
        for f_c in f_coeffs_list:
            # similarly for g
            for deg_g in range(3):
                g_coeffs_list = list(product(coeffs_range, repeat=deg_g+1))
                for g_c in g_coeffs_list:
                    if check_fg(f_c, g_c):
                        print(f"f coeffs: {f_c}, g coeffs: {g_c}")
```
