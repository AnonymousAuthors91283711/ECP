The problem involves functions \( t: \{0,1,2\} \to \mathbb{R} \) with non-negative values summing to 1, called IsSpecial. For any two such functions \( a,b \), \( a \) is "better" than \( b \) if both are nonnegative, and \( a \) is strictly greater than \( b \) in exactly two of the three coordinates. The task is to find the set of natural numbers \( n \) such that there exists a set \( S \) of such special functions of size \( n \), covering all special \( t \) by some \( s \in S \) that is better than \( t \).

We want to enumerate candidate finite sets \( S \subseteq \Delta_2 \) (the 2-simplex in \(\mathbb{R}^3_{\ge0}\)) and check the covering property for a finite discretization.

Given the continuous nature, we try discretizing the simplex at step 0.1 or 0.2, produce candidate sets \( S \) of size \( n \), pick small \( n \), and check coverage.

The program enumerates all candidate points in a discretized simplex of step 0.2, enumerates subsets of size \( n=1,2,3,4 \), and for each, checks if for every point \( t \) in the discretized simplex, there exists some \( s \in S \) with \( s \) better than \( t \).

We print candidate \( n \) and sets \( S \) that cover all points. We output all candidates up to \( n=4 \), then print minimal \( n \) found.

    return all(x >= 0 for x in t) and abs(sum(t) - 1) < 1e-8

def is_better(a, b):
    # a,b are tuples of length 3, nonnegative
    # Check condition: a_i >= 0, b_i >= 0 and exactly two indices i have a_i > b_i
    if any(x < 0 for x in a) or any(x < 0 for x in b):
        return False
    greater_count = sum(ai > bi for ai, bi in zip(a,b))
    return greater_count == 2

    for x in vals:
        for y in vals:
            z = 1 - x - y
            if z < -1e-8 or z > 1+1e-8:
                continue
            if abs(z - round(z,8)) < 1e-8 and round(z,8) in vals:
                z = round(z,8)
                if z < 0:
