The problem involves evaluating the sum of two complex exponential expressions raised to the 6th power. The enumeration will calculate each term for sample integer multiples of \(2\pi/3\) exponentiated and raised to the sixth power, printing exact complex values for insight.

```python
import cmath
import math

# We explore values of k*2π/3 for k=1,2,...
# Then compute (e^(i*k*2π/3))^6 and sum for k=1 and k=2.
# Print exact values as complex numbers on the unit circle.

two_pi_over_3 = 2 * math.pi / 3
for k in [1, 2]:
    angle = k * two_pi_over_3
    val = cmath.exp(1j * angle) ** 6
    # cmath.exp(1j*angle)**6 = exp(i*6*angle) = exp(i*6*k*2π/3) = exp(i*4πk) = 1 or -1 depending on k
    print(f"e^(i*{k}*2π/3)^6 = {val.real}+{val.imag}j")

sum_val = sum(cmath.exp(1j * k * two_pi_over_3) ** 6 for k in [1, 2])
print(f"Sum of the two terms: {sum_val.real}+{sum_val.imag}j")
```
