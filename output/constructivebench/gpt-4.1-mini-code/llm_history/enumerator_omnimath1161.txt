The problem appears to involve the sum of a series based on the Poisson distribution's tail probability weighted by a geometric series term. To explore the sum numerically and conjecture a closed form or behavior, we will fix small parameters and print partial sums.

We will:
- Choose sample values for `t` (e.g., 0.5, 1.0) and set `p = math.log(2)` to match the problem.
- For each `(t, p)`, compute partial sums up to some `k_max` (say 20).
- Print each partial sum immediately to observe convergence or pattern.

```python
import math

def poisson_tail(t, k):
    # Compute tail probability P(X >= k) for Poisson(t)
    # = 1 - sum_{n=0}^{k-1} e^{-t} t^n / n!
    s = 0.0
    for n in range(k):
        s += math.exp(-t) * (t ** n) / math.factorial(n)
    return 1 - s

def series_sum(t, p, k_max=20):
    # Compute partial sums of the series for k in [1..k_max]
    # sum_k (Poisson tail at k) * (1-p)^{k-1} * p
    # Print partial sums immediately
    total = 0.0
    for k in range(1, k_max+1):
        tail = poisson_tail(t, k)
        term = tail * ((1 - p) ** (k - 1)) * p
        total += term
        print(f"t={t:.3f}, p={p:.6f}, k={k}, partial_sum={total:.10f}")

def main():
    ps = [math.log(2)]
    ts = [0.5, 1.0]
    for p in ps:
        for t in ts:
            print(f"Parameters: t={t}, p=log(2)={p}")
            series_sum(t, p, k_max=20)
            print()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
