[write_program]
This problem asks to find the count of positive divisors \( d \) of \( 12! \) such that \( d \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \).

To explore this, the program will:
- Compute \( 12! \) and its divisors (by prime factorization and enumeration).
- For each divisor \( d \), check if \( d \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \).
- Print each divisor that satisfies the condition.
- Finally, print the count.

We limit ourselves to enumerating the divisors by prime factorization rather than naive iteration for efficiency.

```python
from math import factorial
from functools import reduce

# Compute prime factors of 12! with their exponents
# 12! prime factorization:
# 12! = 2^10 * 3^5 * 5^2 * 7^1 * 11^1
prime_factors = {2:10, 3:5, 5:2, 7:1, 11:1}

# Generate all divisors from prime factors
def generate_divisors(primes_exp):
    primes = list(primes_exp.keys())
    exps = [list(range(e+1)) for e in primes_exp.values()]
    # iterate all combinations of exponents to generate divisors
    def backtrack(idx, current):
        if idx == len(primes):
            print(current)  # print divisor immediately
            return 1
        count = 0
        p = primes[idx]
        for e in exps[idx]:
            count += backtrack(idx+1, current*(p**e))
        return count
    return backtrack(0,1)

print("Divisors d of 12! with d % 3 = 1:")
count = 0
# We use a modified function to print only those divisors d where d % 3 == 1
def generate_divisors_mod3_1(primes_exp):
    primes = list(primes_exp.keys())
    exps = [list(range(e+1)) for e in primes_exp.values()]
    count = 0
    def backtrack(idx, current):
        nonlocal count
        if idx == len(primes):
            if current % 3 == 1:
                print(current)
                count +=1
            return
        p = primes[idx]
        for e in exps[idx]:
            backtrack(idx+1, current*(p**e))
    backtrack(0,1)
    return count

count = generate_divisors_mod3_1(prime_factors)
print("Count =", count)
```
