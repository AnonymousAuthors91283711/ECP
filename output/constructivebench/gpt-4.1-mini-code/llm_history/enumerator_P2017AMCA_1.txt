The problem is to find the greatest integer \( n \) such that there exist nonnegative integers \( x, y, z \) satisfying 
\[ x + 2y + 3z \leq 8 \quad \text{and} \quad n = x + 3y + 5z. \]

To approach this, we enumerate all triples \((x,y,z)\) with \(x,y,z \geq 0\) such that \(x + 2y + 3z \leq 8\), calculate \(n = x + 3y + 5z\) for each, and collect the results to find the maximum \(n\).

We'll print out all values of \(n\) found, then explicitly print the maximum \(n\).

```python
# Enumerate integers n = x + 3y + 5z with x+2y+3z <= 8 and x,y,z >= 0
# Print n for each feasible triple immediately and finally print the max n found

def main():
    max_n = -1
    for z in range(0, 3):  # 3*3=9 > 8 so max z=2
        max_y = (8 - 3*z) // 2
        for y in range(0, max_y +1):
            max_x = 8 - 2*y - 3*z
            for x in range(0, max_x +1):
                n = x + 3*y + 5*z
                print(n)
                if n > max_n:
                    max_n = n
    print("Maximum n found:", max_n)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
