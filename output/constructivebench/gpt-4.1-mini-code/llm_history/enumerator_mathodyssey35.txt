The problem involves natural numbers a, b > 0 satisfying divisibility conditions by 79 and 77, and we want to find the least sum s = a + b for such pairs. We enumerate pairs (a,b) with small values and check divisibility conditions to find candidate sums, printing as we find them.

```python
# Enumerate positive integers a,b with conditions:
# 79 divides (a + 77*b)
# 77 divides (a + 79*b)
# Print sums a+b meeting conditions; then print minimal such sum.

def divides(d, x):
    return x % d == 0

max_val = 200  # Search limit for a,b
min_sum = None

for a in range(1, max_val):
    for b in range(1, max_val):
        cond1 = divides(79, a + 77*b)
        cond2 = divides(77, a + 79*b)
        if cond1 and cond2:
            s = a + b
            print(f"a={a}, b={b}, sum={s}")
            if min_sum is None or s < min_sum:
                min_sum = s

if min_sum is not None:
    print(f"Minimum sum s = {min_sum}")
else:
    print("No solutions found within search range")
```
