The problem involves finding the greatest positive integer \( n \) for which there exists a positive integer \( k \) such that \( k \times (n + 1) = 840! \). Equivalently, we want the greatest divisor \( n+1 \) of \( 840! \).

To explore this, we can test divisors \( d \) of \( 840! \), and for each divisor \( d \) print \( d-1 \) as a candidate for \( n \).

Given the immense size of \( 840! \), enumerating its divisors directly is impossible for a program. Instead, we can experiment with smaller factorials (say, up to \( 10! \)), print the divisors of \( m! \), and conjecture the answer for larger factorials.

We will:

- Iterate over factorial values \( m! \) for \( m = 1 \) to 10.
- For each \( m! \), find all its divisors efficiently.
- For each divisor \( d \), print \( d - 1 \) as a candidate \( n \).
- Also print which factorial we use for clarity.

Since the largest divisor of \( m! \) is \( m! \), the greatest \( n \) is \( m! - 1 \).

We'll print divisors from largest to smallest to get the greatest candidates early.

```python
# Enumerate candidates n such that k*(n+1) = m!, for m up to 10,
# to assist conjecturing the answer for 840!.

from math import factorial, isqrt

def divisors(num):
    # Return sorted divisors of num in descending order.
    small_divs = []
    large_divs = []
    for i in range(1,isqrt(num)+1):
        if num % i == 0:
            small_divs.append(i)
            if i*i != num:
                large_divs.append(num//i)
    return large_divs + small_divs[::-1]

def main():
    for m in range(1, 11):
        f = factorial(m)
        print(f"\nm = {m}, m! = {f}")
        divs = divisors(f)
        # Print first few candidates only to limit output size.
        for d in divs[:10]:
            n = d - 1
            print(n)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
