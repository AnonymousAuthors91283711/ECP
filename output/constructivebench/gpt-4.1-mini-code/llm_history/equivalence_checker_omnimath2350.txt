theorem omnimath2350 :
  (∑ n in Finset.range 4096, countTransitions (digits 2 n) : ℚ) / 4096 = omnimath2350_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 20481 / 4096
Proposed Answer: (11 * 4096) / 8
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about counting bit transitions (changes between 0 and 1) in binary representations of numbers from 0 to 4095 (since Finset.range 4096 = {0,...,4095}).

2. The ground truth answer is 20481/4096 ≈ 4.999755859375

3. The proposed answer is (11*4096)/8 = 45056/8 = 5632 ≈ 5.0

The two answers are numerically close but not identical. The ground truth answer is more precise and correct, while the proposed answer is a simplified approximation that doesn't match the exact calculation.
