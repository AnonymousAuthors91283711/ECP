theorem omnimath975 : 
  List.foldl circ (2005 : ℚ) (List.range 2006) = omnimath975_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 1/12
Proposed Answer: 2005 / (4 + 2005)
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer.

The problem defines a function `circ(m,n) = (m + n)/(m*n + 4)` and asks to evaluate a left fold of this operation over a list from 0 to 2005, starting with 2005. The ground truth answer is 1/12.

The proposed answer suggests that the result is 2005/(4 + 2005), which simplifies to 2005/2009. This is clearly different from 1/12 (which is approximately 0.0833 vs 2005/2009 ≈ 0.9975).

The proposed answer appears to be just the result of applying the operation once with m=2005 and n=0 (the first element in the range), rather than properly folding the operation over the entire list. This is incorrect as it doesn't account for all the operations in the fold.
