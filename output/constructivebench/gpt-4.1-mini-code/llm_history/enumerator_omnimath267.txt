The problem involves a function \( f: \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \) with the initial value \( f(0,0) = 0 \) and the property that for each pair \((a,b)\), the set \(\{ f(a,b), f(a,b+1), f(a+1,b) \}\) consists of three consecutive integers in some order (a set of the form \(\{m, m+1, m+2\}\)).

We want to explore which values \(n\) can be attained at \(f(x,y)\) for given \((x,y)\).

The plan:
- Choose small sample values for \((x,y)\), e.g. from 0 to 3.
- Enumerate all functions \(f\) that satisfy the constraints up to \((x,y)\).
- Use backtracking or dynamic programming to generate all possible values at each pair from the base condition.
- Print all attainable \(n=f(x,y)\) for each chosen \((x,y)\).

The program below implements a BFS-like exploration of possible values on a grid from \((0,0)\) to \((x,y)\), adhering to the consecutive triples constraint for each cell and its neighbors. It stores possible values at each coordinate and expands accordingly.

```python
# Enumerates all possible values of f(x,y) given the problem constraints
# for sample points (x,y) in [0..3]x[0..3].
# f(0,0)=0 and for each (a,b):
# {f(a,b), f(a,b+1), f(a+1,b)} = {m, m+1, m+2} for some m.
