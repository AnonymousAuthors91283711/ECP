noncomputable abbrev omnimath871_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath871 : 
    sin (arcsin 0.4 + arcsin 0.5) * sin (arcsin 0.5 - arcsin 0.4) = omnimath871_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 9 / 100
Proposed Answer: 0.4 * 0.5 * (1 - sqrt (1 - 0.4^2) * sqrt (1 - 0.5^2))
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer step by step.

1. The problem involves trigonometric identities for arcsin and sin functions.
2. The expression can be rewritten using the identity:
   sin(A+B)*sin(A-B) = sin²A - sin²B
3. Applying this to the given problem:
   sin(arcsin 0.4 + arcsin 0.5)*sin(arcsin 0.5 - arcsin 0.4) = sin²(arcsin 0.5) - sin²(arcsin 0.4) = 0.5² - 0.4² = 0.25 - 0.16 = 0.09 = 9/100
4. The proposed answer is: 0.4 * 0.5 * (1 - sqrt(1 - 0.4²) * sqrt(1 - 0.5²))
   This simplifies to: 0.2 * (1 - √0.84 * √0.75) ≈ 0.2 * (1 - 0.7937) ≈ 0.04126
   Which is not equal to 0.09

The proposed answer doesn't match the ground truth answer of 9/100 (0.09). The correct simplification should lead to 0.5² - 0.4² = 0.09.

<<<False>>>
