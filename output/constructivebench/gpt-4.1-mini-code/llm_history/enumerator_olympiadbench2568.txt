The problem relates to finding real values of \( k \) such that the quadratic equation 
\[ k x^2 + (5k+3)x + (6k+5) = 0 \]
has a root \( x \) that simultaneously satisfies the derivative condition 
\[ 2kx + (5k+3) = 0. \]
Our goal is to find \( k \neq 0 \) such that there exists such an \( x \).

We interpret the second equation as the derivative of the quadratic equal to zero at \( x \), implying \( x \) is a root and a critical point simultaneously (so the quadratic has a double root at \( x \)).

To help conjecture the set of such \( k \), the program below iterates over a range of rational \( k \)-values, finds candidate \( x \) from the derivative equation, checks if it solves the quadratic, and prints such \( k \) values as exact fractions when possible.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# We try k values as fractions around zero, excluding zero itself
# to find those k for which quadratic and derivative-root coincide.

def check(k):
    # For k = 0, skip
    if k == 0:
        return False
    # derivative root: 2*k*x + (5*k+3) = 0 => x = -(5k+3)/(2k)
    numerator = - (5*k + 3)
    denominator = 2*k
    x = numerator / denominator
    # check if x satisfies the quadratic: k x^2 + (5k+3) x + (6k+5) = 0
    val = k * x * x + (5 * k + 3) * x + (6 * k + 5)
    return abs(val) < 1e-14

print("Testing k values (fractions) for which x is root and critical point:")
for den in range(1, 11):
    for num in range(-20, 21):
        # exclude k=0
        if num == 0:
            continue
        k = Fraction(num, den)
        # check condition
        numerator = - (5 * k + 3)
        denominator = 2 * k
        if denominator == 0:
            continue
        x = numerator / denominator
        # check if quadratic(k,x) == 0 exactly
        lhs = k * x ** 2 + (5 * k + 3) * x + (6 * k + 5)
        if lhs == 0:
            print(f"k = {k}, x = {x}")

# Print a summary suggesting these k values form the answer set.
print("\nCandidates for k are fractions as above, possibly infinitely many.")
```
This enumerates all rational \( k \) with denominators up to 10 and numerators between -20 and 20, printing those \( k \) allowing a root \( x \) that also zeros the derivative. This helps form or verify conjectures about the set \( olympiadbench2568\_answer \).
