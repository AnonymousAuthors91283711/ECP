The problem hints at evaluating and simplifying the expression \(5 \cdot \left( (2^0 - 1 + 5^2 - 0)^{-1} \right)\). To assist in conjecturing or confirming the exact value, we can enumerate the numeric evaluation straightforwardly and print it immediately.

```python
# Evaluate and print the expression 5 * ( (2^0 - 1 + 5^2 - 0) ^ -1 )
def main():
    base_expr = (2**0 - 1 + 5**2 - 0)
    if base_expr != 0:
        val = 5 / base_expr  # equivalent to 5 * (base_expr^-1)
        print(f"Expression value: 5 / {base_expr} = {val}")
    else:
        print("Denominator is zero; expression undefined.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
