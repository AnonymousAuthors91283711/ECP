The problem involves summing the gcd of integers from 1 to 91 with 91. We enumerate gcd values for n in [1,91], print them and accumulate the sum.

```python
from math import gcd

def main():
    limit = 91
    total = 0
    print(f"Enumerating gcd(n, {limit}) for n in [1, {limit}]:")
    for n in range(1, limit+1):
        g = gcd(n, limit)
        print(f"gcd({n}, {limit}) = {g}")
        total += g
    print(f"Sum of gcd(n, {limit}) for n=1 to {limit} is {total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
