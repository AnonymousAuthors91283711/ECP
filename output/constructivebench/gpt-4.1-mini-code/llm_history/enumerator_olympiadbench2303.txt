The given problem involves solving a system of logarithmic equations with positive real variables \(x, y, z\) and constants \(a, b, c\). We want to enumerate possible triples \((x, y, z)\) that satisfy the system for given \(a, b, c\), and investigate the solution set.

To assist in conjecturing solutions, I will:
- Fix the constants \(a=-4, b=4, c=-18\) as given.
- Enumerate over positive \(x, y, z\) values on a small discrete grid (like powers of 2 and 5) to keep outputs manageable.
- Print each candidate solution triple along with the residuals of the three equations, focusing on those close to zero.
- Use exact logs when possible (log(2), log(5), log(8), log(16), log(625)) to keep accuracy.
- Use natural logarithm (`math.log`).
- Stop searching once enough precise candidates are found or when the grid is exhausted.

```python
import math

# Given constants
a, b, c = -4, 4, -18

# Precompute logs used for speed and exactness
log2 = math.log(2)
log5 = math.log(5)
log8 = math.log(8)     # 2^3
log16 = math.log(16)   # 2^4
log625 = math.log(625) # 5^4

def eq1(x,y):
    return math.log(x)*math.log(y) - 3*math.log(5*y) - math.log(8*x)

def eq2(y,z):
    return math.log(y)*math.log(z) -4*math.log(5*y) - math.log(16*z)

def eq3(z,x):
    return math.log(z)*math.log(x) -4*math.log(8*x) - 3*math.log(625*z)

# We pick x,y,z from small products of 2 and 5 powers to limit search space,
# since logs of such numbers are linear combinations of log2 and log5.
powers2 = [1,2,4,8,16]
powers5 = [1,5,25,125]

# Consider x,y,z in products of powers2 * powers5
vals = []
for p2 in powers2:
    for p5 in powers5:
        vals.append(p2*p5)

print(f"Enumerating (x,y,z) from values: {vals}")

threshold = 0.1  # tolerance for proximity to target equations

for x in vals:
    for y in vals:
        for z in vals:
            v1 = eq1(x,y)
            v2 = eq2(y,z)
            v3 = eq3(z,x)
            # Check if close to a,b,c (a,b,c are targets)
            if abs(v1 - a) < threshold and abs(v2 - b) < threshold and abs(v3 - c) < threshold:
                print(f"x={x}, y={y}, z={z}: eq1={v1:.5f}, eq2={v2:.5f}, eq3={v3:.5f}")

# This helps conjecture a possible pattern of solutions near the target constants.
