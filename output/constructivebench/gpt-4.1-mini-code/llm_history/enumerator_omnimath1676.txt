This functional equation looks challenging to solve in full generality, but we can try to enumerate candidate functions f: ℝ → ℝ satisfying the equation for various sample points. We will test polynomial candidates up to degree 2 since the equation involves cubes and squares. We will check functions f(x) = a*x^2 + b*x + c for small rational coefficients a,b,c.

By enumerating possibilities for a,b,c in some small range, printing those which satisfy the equation for some sample points, we can conjecture the form of the solution. The program prints parameter settings tried and any functions matching the equation at test points.

```python
import itertools

def test_function(a,b,c):
    # Test the equation for various (x,y)
    test_points = [-1,0,1,2]
    for x,y in itertools.product(test_points, repeat=2):
        lhs = a*(x**3 + y**3 + x*y)**2 + b*(x**3 + y**3 + x*y) + c
        rhs = x**2*(a*x**2 + b*x + c) + y**2*(a*y**2 + b*y + c) + (a*x*y**2 + b*x*y + c)
        if abs(lhs - rhs) > 1e-8:
            return False
    return True

print("Enumerating f(x) = a x^2 + b x + c with a,b,c in [-2,-1,0,1,2]")
for a,b,c in itertools.product(range(-2,3), repeat=3):
    if test_function(a,b,c):
        print(f"Possible function: f(x) = {a}*x^2 + {b}*x + {c}")

print("Finished enumeration.")
```

This approach explores simple polynomial guesses. The output functions satisfy the relation at sampled points and help to form hypotheses on the solution structure.
