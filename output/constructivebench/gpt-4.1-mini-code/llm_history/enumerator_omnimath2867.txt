The problem defines a sequence \((s_n)\) with initial values \(s_0=1, s_1=4, s_2=2, s_3=3\), and a recurrence \(s_{n+4} = s_{n+3} + s_{n+2} + s_{n+1} + s_n\). We want to find \(s_8\).

This is a linear recurrence, so we can enumerate values from \(n=0\) to \(n=8\) using the given rule and print intermediate results. That helps conjecture the answer for \(s_8\).

```python
# Enumerate s_n from n=0 to n=8 given initial values and recurrence

s = [1, 4, 2, 3]  # s_0, s_1, s_2, s_3

print(f"s_0 = {s[0]}")
print(f"s_1 = {s[1]}")
print(f"s_2 = {s[2]}")
print(f"s_3 = {s[3]}")

# Compute further terms up to s_8
for n in range(4, 9):
    val = s[n-1] + s[n-2] + s[n-3] + s[n-4]
    s.append(val)
    print(f"s_{n} = {val}")
```
