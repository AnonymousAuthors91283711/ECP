The problem involves finding the smallest natural number \(k > 45\) for which there exists a bijection \(a: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}\) satisfying certain conditions on intervals of length 45. To explore candidates for \(k\), we can try small values \(k > 45\), and for each, test whether such a function \(a\) can exist by verifying the required constraints on intervals, mainly involving bijections on intervals of length 45 for odd \(n\).

The code below tries values \(k = 46, 47, \ldots, 60\) (as a small sample), printing \(k\) and indicating possible existence or failure of the conditions by attempting a simplified construction of \(a\) that meets the boundary constraints for indices \(1 \le i \le 45\) and \(k-45 \le i \le k-1\). Due to complexity, the check for all intervals may not be exhaustive but can guide conjectures.

```python
# Enumerate candidate values of k > 45 for which the given mapping a might exist
# For demonstration, we handle k in [46..60].
# We print each candidate k and some basic checks relevant to the constraints.

def check_candidate(k):
    # Define a function a on domain [1 .. k-1]
    # Conditions:
    # 1) a(i) = i for 1 <= i <= 45
    # 2) a(k - i) = i for 1 <= i <= 45
    # So for indices in [1..45], a(i) = i; for indices in [k-45..k-1], a(i) = k - i
    # The function a should thus be defined at least on these intervals.
    # We must check consistency (overlapping indices) and possible bijections on intervals.
    
    # check overlap between [1..45] and [k-45..k-1]
    start2 = k - 45
    overlap_start = max(1, start2)
    overlap_end = min(45, k - 1)
    overlap = max(0, overlap_end - overlap_start + 1)

    # On overlap, a(i) = i and a(i) = k - i must hold => i = k - i => k = 2i
    # So overlap can exist only if k even and i = k/2 in the overlap.
    # Check if for overlap indices values agree
    consistent = True
    for i in range(overlap_start, overlap_end+1):
        if i != k - i:
            consistent = False
            break

    # print details about consistency
    print(f"k={k}, overlap_size={overlap}, consistent_overlap={consistent}")

    # Further checks (not exhaustive) could go here for the bijection condition.
    
# Run for k in 46 to 60
for k in range(46, 61):
    check_candidate(k)
