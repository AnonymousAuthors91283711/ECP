The problem seems to involve solving the equation \(0.8 \times 60 = \frac{4}{3} \times x\) for \(x\). We'll enumerate candidates for \(x\) based on this relation by computing the exact value and checking multiples around it.

```python
# Enumerate candidate solutions for x satisfying 0.8 * 60 = (4/3) * x
# Solve algebraically: x = (0.8 * 60) * (3/4) = 48 * 0.75 = 36

target = 0.8 * 60
ratio = 4/3

# Compute exact value for x
x_exact = target / ratio

print("Target:", target)
print("Ratio (4/3):", ratio)
print("Exact solution x =", x_exact)

# Enumerate integer candidates around exact solution
for x_candidate in range(int(x_exact)-3, int(x_exact)+4):
    left = target
    right = ratio * x_candidate
    if abs(left - right) < 1e-9:
        print(f"x candidate {x_candidate} yields exact equality: {left} = {right}")
    else:
        print(f"x candidate {x_candidate}: left={left}, right={right} (difference {abs(left - right):.4f})")
```
