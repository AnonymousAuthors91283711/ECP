We want to find the smallest integer \( b > 1 \) such that:

- \( f = 11! \) is divisible by \( b^2 \), i.e., \( f = k \cdot b^2 \) for some \( k \in \mathbb{N} \),
- and \( b \nmid k \) (b does not divide k),
- but there is no such \( m < 2 \) (i.e., \( m=0 \) or \( m=1 \)) with 
  \( f = k \cdot b^{m+1} \) and \( b \nmid k \).

In other words, \( b^2 \) "exactly divides" \( f \) with quotient not divisible by \( b \), and there is no higher power dividing \( f \) with the same property. The requirement for \( m < 2 \) means: for \( m=0 \), \( b^1 \) does NOT satisfy \( f = k \cdot b^{1} \) with \( b \nmid k \), or that does not matter? Actually \( m=0 \) means looking at \( b^{1} \), and \( m=1 \) means \( b^2 \). They want to ensure that \( m=0 \) and \( m=1 \) are not such that \( f = k b^{m+1} \) with \( b \nmid k \), except for the main condition holding at \( m=1 \) (i.e. \( b^2 \)).

Re-reading:

- Condition: There exists \( k \) with \( f = k b^2 \land b \nmid k \) holds.
- For all \( m<2 \), no such \( k \) with \( f = k b^{m+1} \land b \nmid k \).
 
Since \( m<2 \) means \( m=0,1 \):

- For \( m=0 \), \( f = k b^{1} = k b \) with \( b \nmid k \) is NOT possible.
- For \( m=1 \), \( f = k b^{2} \) with \( b \nmid k \) IS possible (per first bullet).
- So the min m with that property is exactly 1.

So \( b \) is such that \( b^2 \) divides \( f \) with quotient not divisible by \( b \), and \( b \) divides \( f \) but not in a way satisfying \( b \nmid k \) for \( f=k b \).

A natural interpretation is: the highest power of \( b \) dividing \( f \) with quotient not divisible by \( b \) is exactly \( b^2 \).

This suggests considering the prime factorization of \( 11! \):

11! = 39916800

Prime factorize 11!:

- prime 2: \( \lfloor 11/2 \rfloor + \lfloor 11/4 \rfloor + \lfloor 11/8 \rfloor + \lfloor 11/16 \rfloor = 5 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 8 \)
- prime 3: \( \lfloor 11/3 \rfloor + \lfloor 11/9 \rfloor = 3 + 1 = 4 \)
- prime 5: \( \lfloor 11/5 \rfloor = 2 \)
- prime 7: \( \lfloor 11/7 \rfloor = 1 \)
- prime 11: \( \lfloor 11/11 \rfloor = 1 \)

So prime factorization of 11! is:

\[ 11! = 2^8 \cdot 3^4 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 7^1 \cdot 11^1 \]

We want to find smallest integer \( b > 1 \) such that:

- There exists \( k \) with \( 11! = k b^2 \) and \( b \nmid k \);
- But for \( b^1 \), no such \( k \) with \( 11! = k b \) and \( b \nmid k \).

In practice, \( b^2 \mid 11! \) and the factorization of \( b \) squared is included in \( 11! \). Also, \( b^1 \mid 11! \) but the quotient k is divisible by \( b \), i.e. \( b \mid k \).

Equivalently, \( b^2 \) divides \( 11! \) but \( b^3 \nmid 11! \).

Because if \( b^3 \mid 11! \), then \( m=2 < 2 \) is false, but if possible one could have \( f = k b^3 \) with \( b \nmid k \).

Putting it all together: the largest power of \( b \) dividing \( 11! \) is exactly 2.

So we want \( b \) such that the exponent of \( b \) in \( 11! \) is exactly 2.

We want to find the minimal \( b > 1 \) whose square divides \( 11! \) but the cube does not.

Enumerate \( b \) composed from prime factors with exponents at most the exponents in 11! factorization.

To check:

- exponent of prime \( p \) in \( b \) is \( e_p \)
- for \( b^2 \) to divide 11!, we need for each \( p \), \( 2 e_p \leq \) exponent of \( p \) in \( 11! \).
- for \( b^3 \nmid 11! \), for some \( p \), \( 3 e_p > \) exponent of \( p \) in \( 11! \).

So:

- For each prime \( p \), \( e_p \leq \lfloor \frac{exp_p}{2} \rfloor \), else \( b^2 \nmid 11! \).
- For \( b^3 \nmid 11! \), there exists \( p \) with \( 3 e_p > exp_p \).

We can write a program to generate all such \( b \) from the factorization primes, with exponents meeting these constraints:

- For primes \( [(2,8),(3,4),(5,2),(7,1),(11,1)] \)
- Max exponent \( e_p \) in \( b \) is \( \leq \lfloor \frac{exp_p}{2} \rfloor \)
- But at least one prime satisfies \( 3 e_p > exp_p \) (i.e., the cube is not dividing).

We search over all possible exponent tuples \( e_p \).

We select minimal \( b > 1 \) from candidates.

The following Python script enumerates candidates and prints them immediately, then prints minimal satisfying answer.

```python
# Enumerate all b = product p_i^{e_i} with constraints:
# 1) for all i: 2*e_i <= exp_p_i in 11!
# 2) exists i: 3*e_i > exp_p_i in 11!
# 3) b > 1
# Print each candidate b immediately.
# At end print minimal candidate.

def main():
    from math import prod

    primes_exp = [(2,8),(3,4),(5,2),(7,1),(11,1)]

    # For each prime p with exponent ep in 11!:
    # Possible exponents for b: from 0 up to ep//2
    max_ebs = [ep//2 for p,ep in primes_exp]

    candidates = []

    def backtrack(idx, cur_exp):
        if idx == len(primes_exp):
            # Check conditions
            if all(e ==0 for e in cur_exp):
                return  # b=1 invalid
            # Check b^2 divides 11! (automatically yes since e_i <= ep_i//2)
            # Check there exists i with 3*e_i > ep_i
            if any(3*cur_exp[i] > primes_exp[i][1] for i in range(len(cur_exp))):
                # compute b
                b = 1
                for i,(p,_) in enumerate(primes_exp):
                    b *= p**cur_exp[i]
                print(b)
                candidates.append(b)
            return

        p, ep = primes_exp[idx]
        max_e = ep//2
        for e in range(max_e+1):
            cur_exp.append(e)
            backtrack(idx+1, cur_exp)
            cur_exp.pop()

    backtrack(0, [])

    if candidates:
        ans = min(candidates)
        print("Minimal b:", ans)
    else:
        print("No b found")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
