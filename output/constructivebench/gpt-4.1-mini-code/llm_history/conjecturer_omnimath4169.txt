open Function Real

noncomputable abbrev omnimath4169_answer : ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath4169 (f : ℝ → ℝ) :
  (∀ x y, f (x - f y) = f (f y) + x * f y + f x - 1) ↔ f = omnimath4169_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Candidates f(x) = a*x + b that satisfy the eq (approx.):

Summary: Candidate functions found:

Among candidates, the function f(x) = x + 1 satisfies all tested points, suggesting it as a potential unique solution.. Expected Answer Type: ℝ → ℝ
<<<fun x => x + 1>>>
