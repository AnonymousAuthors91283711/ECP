Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {70, 110}
<<<None>>>
Since the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's intentionally left undefined in the proof assistant), we cannot verify whether the proposed answer {70, 110} is equivalent to it. The problem involves trigonometric identities and solving for x in a specific range, but without knowing the intended solution, we cannot confirm equivalence.
