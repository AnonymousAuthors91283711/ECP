The problem appears to involve two production rates \( w_1 \) and \( w_2 \) with certain constraints. We want to find natural numbers \( w_1, w_2 \) satisfying:
- \(100 w_1 = 300\) and \(100 w_2 = 200\)
- \(2 \times 60 \times w_1 = 240\) and \(2 \times 60 \times w_2 = 300\)
- Then compute \(3 \times 50 \times w_2\)

We will enumerate possible \( w_1, w_2 \) satisfying these linear equations approximately by dividing the constants, since the equations might be inconsistent or designed to cross-check. We will check all natural numbers \( w_1, w_2 \) up to some reasonable limit (e.g., 10) to look for exact matches or near matches to the equations, then print the resulting possible values of \( 3 \times 50 \times w_2 \).

```python
# Enumerate possible w1, w2 to solve given linear constraints and compute target expression

def check_conditions(w1, w2):
    cond1 = (100 * w1 == 300) and (100 * w2 == 200)
    cond2 = (2 * 60 * w1 == 240) and (2 * 60 * w2 == 300)
    return cond1, cond2

def main():
    limit = 10
    print("Enumerating possible (w1, w2) with conditions and computing 3*50*w2:")
    for w1 in range(1, limit+1):
        for w2 in range(1, limit+1):
            cond1, cond2 = check_conditions(w1, w2)
            if cond1:
                val = 3 * 50 * w2
                print(f"w1={w1}, w2={w2} satisfy cond1; 3*50*w2={val}")
            if cond2:
                val = 3 * 50 * w2
                print(f"w1={w1}, w2={w2} satisfy cond2; 3*50*w2={val}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This will help identify feasible values of \( w_1, w_2 \) and the resulting expression values for further insight.
