The problem involves finding the sum of the digits (in base 10) of the product of the numbers 11, 101, 111, and 110,011. We want to enumerate the product and its digit sum to identify the answer.

```python
# Enumerate the product of given numbers and sum of its digits
def digit_sum(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

numbers = [11, 101, 111, 110011]
product = 1
for num in numbers:
    product *= num

print(f"Numbers: {numbers}")
print(f"Product: {product}")
print(f"Digit sum: {digit_sum(product)}")
```
