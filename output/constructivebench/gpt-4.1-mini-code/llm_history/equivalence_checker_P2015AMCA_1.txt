noncomputable abbrev P2015AMCA_1_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem P2015AMCA_1 :
  (5 * ((2^0 - 1 + 5^2 - 0)^(-1 : ℝ)) = P2015AMCA_1_answer) :=
sorry

Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: 5 / 25
Let me analyze this carefully.

The problem presents a mathematical expression and asks to evaluate it. The expression is:

5 * ((2^0 - 1 + 5^2 - 0)^(-1 : ℝ))

Let's break this down step by step:

1. Inside the parentheses:
   - 2^0 = 1
   - 1 (subtracted)
   - 5^2 = 25 (added)
   - 0 (subtracted)
   So we have: 1 - 1 + 25 - 0 = 25

2. The exponent (-1 : ℝ) means we're taking the reciprocal (since x^(-1) = 1/x)

3. So the expression becomes: 5 * (25)^(-1) = 5 * (1/25) = 5/25

The proposed answer is exactly 5/25, which matches our calculation. 

The ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (a placeholder in Lean), so we can't compare it directly, but based on the mathematical evaluation, the proposed answer is correct.
