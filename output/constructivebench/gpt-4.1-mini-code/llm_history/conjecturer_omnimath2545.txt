abbrev omnimath2545_answer : ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath2545 : 
  (∑ k in Finset.range 9, if k ≥ 4 then (choose 8 k : ℚ) * (1/2)^8 else 0) = omnimath2545_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating sum of C(8, k)*(1/2)^8 for k≥4:
k=4, term=C(8,4)*(1/2)^8 = 35/128 (~0.273438), partial sum = 35/128 (~0.273438)
k=5, term=C(8,5)*(1/2)^8 = 7/32 (~0.218750), partial sum = 63/128 (~0.492188)
k=6, term=C(8,6)*(1/2)^8 = 7/64 (~0.109375), partial sum = 77/128 (~0.601562)
k=7, term=C(8,7)*(1/2)^8 = 1/32 (~0.031250), partial sum = 81/128 (~0.632812)
k=8, term=C(8,8)*(1/2)^8 = 1/256 (~0.003906), partial sum = 163/256 (~0.636719)
Answer (exact fraction): 163/256
Answer (decimal approx): 0.636719. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
<<<163/256>>>
