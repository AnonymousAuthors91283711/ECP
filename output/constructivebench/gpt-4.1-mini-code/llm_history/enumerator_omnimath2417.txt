The problem seems to be about computing the sum \(\sum_{n=1}^{99} (n^3 + 3n^2 + 3n)\), which can be tackled by enumerating and summing up the values for \(n = 1\) to \(99\). I will print each partial term and the cumulative sum to assist in conjecturing the answer.

```python
# Enumerate the sum of n^3 + 3*n^2 + 3*n for n=1 to 99
def main():
    total = 0
    for n in range(1, 100):
        term = n**3 + 3*n**2 + 3*n
        total += term
        print(f"n={n}, term={term}, cumulative_sum={total}")
    print(f"Final sum (answer): {total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
