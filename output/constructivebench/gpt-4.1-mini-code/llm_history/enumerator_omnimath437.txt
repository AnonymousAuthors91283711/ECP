The problem defines a sequence \( a_n \) over natural numbers with initial values \( a_1 = 1 \), \( a_9 = 7 \), and a recursive relation for \( n \geq 2 \):

\[
a_{n+1} = \frac{a_n^2 - a_{n-1} + 2a_n}{a_{n-1} + 1}
\]

We want to find the value of \( a_5 \) consistent with these conditions.

Since \( a_9 = 7 \) and \( a_1=1 \) are fixed but \( a_2 \) is not given explicitly, we can try to enumerate possible initial values \( a_2 \) and generate sequences to check which yield \( a_9=7 \). Then we report the corresponding \( a_5 \).

Below is a Python script to attempt reasonable floating initial values for \( a_2 \) from 0 to 10 with small steps (e.g. 0.1), compute all terms up to \( a_9 \), check if \( a_9 \approx 7 \) within a small tolerance, and print the found \( a_5 \).

```python
# Enumerate possible a_2 values, generate sequence with recursion,
# check for a_9 close to 7, and print corresponding a_5.

def sequence_vals(a2):
    a = [1, a2]  # a_1=1, a_2 variable
    for n in range(2, 9):  # compute up to a_9 (index 8)
        prev = a[n-2]
        curr = a[n-1]
        numerator = curr**2 - prev + 2*curr
        denominator = prev + 1
        if abs(denominator) < 1e-12:  # avoid division by zero
            return None
        next_val = numerator / denominator
        a.append(next_val)
    return a

eps = 1e-6
found = []

for i in range(0, 101):  # 0, 0.1, ..., 10
    a2 = i / 10.0
    seq = sequence_vals(a2)
    if seq is None:
        continue
    a9 = seq[8]
    if abs(a9 - 7) < eps:
        a5 = seq[4]
        print(f'a_2 = {a2:.2f}, a_5 = {a5}, a_9 = {a9}')
        found.append((a2, a5, a9))

if found:
    # Print extremal values for a_5 found
    a5_vals = [x[1] for x in found]
    print(f'Min a_5 found: {min(a5_vals)}')
    print(f'Max a_5 found: {max(a5_vals)}')
else:
    print('No a_2 in [0,10] yields a_9 close to 7.')
```

Run this by `python enumerator.py`. It prints each candidate immediately, allowing inspection. The code balances coverage with output length. Adjust the search range or step if no candidates found.
