Ground Truth Answer: 4 * sqrt 2
Proposed Answer: 2 * Real.sqrt 2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves summing sine terms from π/18 to 8π/18 and dividing by a product of cosine terms.

2. The ground truth answer is 4√2 (4 * sqrt 2).

3. The proposed answer is 2√2 (2 * Real.sqrt 2).

4. These are clearly different values since 4√2 = 2 * (2√2), meaning the proposed answer is exactly half of the correct value.

5. There's no ambiguity in the values - they are distinct numerical quantities.

Therefore, the proposed answer is incorrect.
