The problem statement involves real numbers \(x, y, \varepsilon\) with \(x > y > 0\) and \(\varepsilon > 0\). The inequality to analyze is 
\[
(x + \varepsilon) - (y - \varepsilon) > x - y,
\]
which simplifies to
\[
x + \varepsilon - y + \varepsilon > x - y \implies 2\varepsilon > 0,
\]
which is always true since \(\varepsilon > 0\). The task is to enumerate parameters and confirm this and potentially related inequalities or properties to assist in conjecturing and proving the statement.

We will:
- Iterate over small sample values \(x > y > 0\) and \(\varepsilon > 0\),
- Check the inequality,
- Print exactly when it holds,
- Print parameters used with each check.

```python
# Enumerate small samples for x, y, epsilon with x > y > 0 and epsilon > 0
# Check inequality: (x + ε) - (y - ε) > x - y, which simplifies to 2ε > 0

def approx_equal(a, b, tol=1e-12):
    return abs(a - b) < tol

def main():
    # Samples for y in (0.1, 1.0, 2.0)
    # For each y, x in (y+δ) with δ in (0.1, 0.2)
    # epsilon in (0.01, 0.1, 0.5)
    ys = [0.1, 1.0, 2.0]
    deltas = [0.1, 0.2]
    epsilons = [0.01, 0.1, 0.5]

    for y in ys:
        for delta in deltas:
            x = y + delta
            for eps in epsilons:
                lhs = (x + eps) - (y - eps)
                rhs = x - y
                holds = lhs > rhs
                # Output partial results immediately
                print(f"x={x}, y={y}, ε={eps} : LHS={lhs}, RHS={rhs}, Inequality holds? {holds}")
                # Exactly check lhs - rhs == 2*eps numerically
                if approx_equal(lhs - rhs, 2*eps):
                    print(f"Verified: lhs - rhs ≈ 2*ε = {2*eps}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
