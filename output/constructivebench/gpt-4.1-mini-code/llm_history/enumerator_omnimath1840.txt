The problem involves understanding the set of digits appearing in the decimal representation of 2^41 and counting its cardinality. We'll print the digits appearing and their count.

```python
# Enumerate the digits appearing in 2^41 and print each digit found and the final count.
def digits_of_n(n):
    return [int(d) for d in str(n)]

def main():
    n = 2**41
    print(f"Number: 2^41 = {n}")
    digits = set(digits_of_n(n))
    for d in sorted(digits):
        print(f"Digit found: {d}")
    print(f"Number of distinct digits: {len(digits)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
