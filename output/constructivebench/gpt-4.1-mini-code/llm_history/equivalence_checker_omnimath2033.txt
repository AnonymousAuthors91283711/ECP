Ground Truth Answer: 222480
Proposed Answer: (Nat.factorial 5) * 309
Let me analyze this problem and the answers:

1. The problem is counting the number of injective functions from Fin 5 to Fin 6 × Fin 6 where:
   - The first component is injective
   - The second component is injective
   - For each i, the first and second components are different

2. The ground truth answer is 222480

3. The proposed answer is (5!) * 309 = 120 * 309 = 37080

4. Calculation:
   - 222480 / 120 = 1854, not 309
   - So the proposed answer is incorrect

5. The structure of the proposed answer (factorial times something) makes sense since we're dealing with permutations, but the multiplier is wrong.
