Ground Truth Answer: 95
Proposed Answer: 4583
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for two things:
   - First, to verify that 6/7 + 5/49 * (1/(1-1/49)) is indeed the greatest rational number r satisfying certain conditions
   - Second, to compute the sum of the numerator and denominator when this rational number is simplified

2. The ground truth answer is 95, which suggests that when we simplify r, we get a fraction where numerator + denominator = 95.

3. The proposed answer is 4583, which is vastly different from 95.

4. Let's compute r:
   - The geometric series part ∑' (1/49)^n = 1/(1-1/49) = 49/48
   - So r = 6/7 + 5/49 * 49/48 = 6/7 + 5/48
   - Common denominator is 336: r = (288 + 35)/336 = 323/336
   - 323 + 336 = 659, not 95 or 4583

Wait, this contradicts both answers. However, looking back at the problem statement, the expression is more complex:
r = A/7 + B/49 + (A/7 + B/49)*(49/48)
For the maximal case (A=6, B=5):
r = 6/7 + 5/49 + (6/7 + 5/49)*(49/48)
= (42/49 + 5/49) + (47/49)*(49/48)
= 47/49 + 47/48
= (47*48 + 47*49)/(49*48)
= 47*97/2352
This simplifies to 4559/2352
4559 + 2352 = 6911, which still doesn't match either answer.

Given this analysis, neither answer matches our calculations. However, the ground truth answer (95) is much closer to reasonable values we might expect in such problems, while 4583 seems completely off.
