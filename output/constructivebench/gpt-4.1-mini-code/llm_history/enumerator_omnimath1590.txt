The problem asks about the cardinality of the set of integers \( n \) satisfying 
\[
1 + \lfloor \frac{100n}{101} \rfloor = \lceil \frac{99n}{100} \rceil.
\]
We want to count how many such integers \( n \) satisfy this equality.

We'll enumerate \( n \) in a reasonable range (say, 0 to 10,000) to find all solutions and observe any patterns. This should help conjecture the cardinality.

```python
import math

# Enumerate n and check the condition:
# 1 + floor(100*n/101) == ceil(99*n/100)
# We'll check n in [0..10_000] and print solutions immediately.
# After enumeration, print the count.

solutions = []
for n in range(0, 10001):
    lhs = 1 + math.floor(100*n / 101)
    rhs = math.ceil(99*n / 100)
    if lhs == rhs:
        print(n)
        solutions.append(n)

print("Count of solutions:", len(solutions))
# For negative n, symmetry is less obvious, so let's check [-10000..-1]
for n in range(-10000, 0):
    lhs = 1 + math.floor(100*n / 101)
    rhs = math.ceil(99*n / 100)
    if lhs == rhs:
        print(n)
        solutions.append(n)
print("Total count including negatives:", len(solutions))
```
