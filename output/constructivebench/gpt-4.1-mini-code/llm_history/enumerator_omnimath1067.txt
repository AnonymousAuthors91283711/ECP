The problem involves counting 3x3 matrices with natural number entries subject to divisibility and fixed corner constraints. We'll enumerate candidate matrices \( M \) where \( M_{0,0} = 1 \), \( M_{2,2} = 2009 \), and for \( i,j < 2 \), \( M_{i,j} > 0 \), divides \( M_{i,j+1} \), and divides \( M_{i+1,j} \). The matrix entries outside these constraints are unrestricted natural numbers.

We focus on the 2x2 top-left submatrix since there the conditions \( M_{i,j} \mid M_{i,j+1} \) and \( M_{i,j} \mid M_{i+1,j} \) apply, with the first row and column limited by \( M_{0,0} = 1 \).

The plan:

- Fix \( M_{0,0} = 1 \).
- Enumerate positive divisors of 2009 for the bottom-right corner.
- For \( M_{0,1} \), \( M_{1,0} \), and \( M_{1,1} \), enumerate possible values compatible with the divisibility rules.
- Use constraints to reduce search space.
- Print each qualifying matrix.

This enumeration will help synthesize the count and potentially the explicit answer.

```python
# Enumerate 3x3 matrices M with M[0,0]=1, M[2,2]=2009,
# and for i,j<2: M[i,j]>0, M[i,j] divides M[i,j+1] and M[i+1,j]

from math import gcd

def divisors(n):
    divs = []
    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5)+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divs.append(i)
            if i*i != n: divs.append(n//i)
    return sorted(divs)

# Fixed corners
M00 = 1
M22 = 2009

# Precompute divisors of 2009 for entries in last row/col as candidates
div_2009 = divisors(M22)

count = 0
print(f"Enumerating matrices with M00={M00} and M22={M22}")

# Constraints for M are on the 2x2 block top-left:
# M[0,0]=1 divides M[0,1] and M[1,0]
# M[i,j] divides M[i,j+1] and M[i+1,j] for i,j<2
# So:
# M00=1 divides M01, M10
# M01 divides M02, M11
# M10 divides M11, M20
# M11 divides M12, M21

# We fix M20, M21, M02, M12 arbitrary positive; only M22 fixed to 2009
# But problem only requires the conditions for i,j<2

# Since conditions apply only for i,j<2 (positions (0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1))
# We'll try possible values for M01, M10, M11 respecting divisibility and positivity

# We start enumerating M01 and M10 >0:
# Since M00=1 divides M01 and M10, no constraint other than positive integers

# To reduce search space, limit M01 and M10 to divisors of 2009 (since M11 should be multiple)
for M01 in div_2009:
    for M10 in div_2009:
        # M01 divides M02 and M11
        # M10 divides M11 and M20
        # We'll choose M11 divisible by both M01 and M10
        # So M11 % M01 == 0 and M11 % M10 ==0
        # so M11 is multiple of lcm(M01,M10)
        # M11 must be >0 and divides M12 and M21 (but i,j<2 so no condition there)
        # For simplicity only check divisibility condition on 2x2 block
        from math import lcm
        base = lcm(M01, M10)
        # M11 must divide something next, no conditions for outside 2x2 block given
        # So only constrained by M11 multiple of base, and M11 divides M12 and M21 - undefined here, so no constraint
        # We'll try multiples of base that divide 2009 (to limit)
        for M11 in div_2009:
            if M11 % base == 0:
                # Check M01 divides M11 and M10 divides M11 
                # Given above, true
                # M00=1 divides M01 and M10, OK
                # M01 divides M02 and M11 - only check post here M01 divides M11 (true)
                # M10 divides M11 and M20 - check divides M11 (true)
                # Conditions fulfilled for 2x2 block
                count += 1
                print(f"Matrix top-left 2x2 block:")
                print(f"  M[0,0]={M00} M[0,1]={M01}")
                print(f"  M[1,0]={M10} M[1,1]={M11}")
                # M02, M12, M20, M21 unconstrained, M22 fixed to 2009
