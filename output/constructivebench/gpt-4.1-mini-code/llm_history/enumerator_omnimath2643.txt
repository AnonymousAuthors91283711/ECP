The problem seems to involve two real variables \( w, l \), related by \( l = 3w \), and two constraints on \( k \):
\[
2(l + w) = k \quad \text{and} \quad lw = k,
\]
with \( k > 0 \).

From \( l = 3w \), the perimeter condition becomes
\[
2(3w + w) = 2(4w) = 8w = k,
\]
and the area condition becomes
\[
3w \cdot w = 3w^2 = k.
\]

Hence,
\[
8w = 3w^2 \implies 3w^2 - 8w = 0 \implies w(3w - 8) = 0.
\]
Since \(w > 0\), we get \(w = \frac{8}{3}\), and then \(k = 8w = \frac{64}{3}\).

The goal is to confirm this through enumeration with sample values, printing possible \(w, l, k\) satisfying the system approximately to verify the exact answer.

```python
# Enumerate possible (w,l,k) with l=3w, k=2(l+w) and k=lw >0,
# confirming the system k=8w=3w^2, print found candidates and k.

def feasible_candidates():
    w_vals = [i/10 for i in range(1, 101)]  # from 0.1 to 10 in steps of 0.1
    for w in w_vals:
        l = 3 * w
        perimeter = 2 * (l + w)
        area = l * w
        # Check if perimeter == area approximately, within tiny tolerance
        if abs(perimeter - area) < 1e-6 and area > 0:
            print(f"w={w:.4f}, l={l:.4f}, k={area:.6f}")
            yield area

def main():
    print("Enumerating (w,l,k) with l=3w and k=2(l+w)=lw>0:")
    ks = list(feasible_candidates())
    if ks:
        min_k = min(ks)
        print(f"Minimal k found: {min_k:.6f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
