The problem asks for the sum of the infinite series ∑ (fib(n+1))/4^(n+2), where fib is the Fibonacci sequence. To conjecture the exact value, we can enumerate partial sums up to some n, then try to recognize a pattern or exact closed form by comparing ratios and exact rational values.

We'll:
- Compute fib(n+1) for n from 0 up to some N (~20).
- Compute partial sums of fib(n+1)/4^(n+2).
- Print each partial sum as a rational number using Python's fractions module.
- This helps conjecture the exact value of the infinite sum.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Precompute Fibonacci numbers (fib(0)=0, fib(1)=1)
fib = [0, 1]
for _ in range(2, 25):
    fib.append(fib[-1] + fib[-2])

partial_sum = Fraction(0,1)
print("n, fib(n+1), partial sum of ∑ fib(n+1)/4^(n+2):")
for n in range(20):
    term = Fraction(fib[n+1], 4**(n+2))
    partial_sum += term
    print(f"{n}, {fib[n+1]}, {partial_sum} ≈ {float(partial_sum)}")
```
