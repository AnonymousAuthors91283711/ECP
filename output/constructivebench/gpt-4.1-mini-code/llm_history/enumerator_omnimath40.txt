The problem involves a 40-periodic real sequence \(a_i\) with zero sum and bounded consecutive differences. We want to explore possible values of 
1. \(s_1 = a_9 + a_{19} + a_{29} + a_{39}\),
2. \(s_2 = a_9 a_{19} + a_{29} a_{39}\).

To enumerate possible values under the constraints efficiently:
- We simulate \(a\) with length 40, enforce \(a_{40} = a_0\),
- sum zero: \(\sum a_i = 0\),
- \(|a_i - a_{i+1}| \leq 1\) for all \(i\),
- try integer values for \(a_0\) and small integer incremental differences \(d_i = a_{i+1} - a_i\) with \(|d_i| \leq 1\),
- reconstruct \(a\), check sum zero, compute \(s_1\) and \(s_2\),
- print values found.

We limit exploration by:
- fixing \(a_0=0\) to reduce degrees of freedom (translating sequence won't change differences),
- exploring difference vectors \(d_i \in \{-1,0,1\}\),
- ensure total telescopes to zero: \(\sum d_i = 0\),
- recompute \(a_i\) as cumulative sum,
- filter by sum zero,
- print candidates.

This should give an idea about possible maxima or patterns.

# Enumerate sequences (a0,...,a39) with |a_i - a_{i+1}| â‰¤ 1, sum zero, a40=a0.
# Compute s1 = a9+a19+a29+a39 and s2 = a9*a19 + a29*a39.
# Print found (s1,s2) pairs to conjecture max values.
