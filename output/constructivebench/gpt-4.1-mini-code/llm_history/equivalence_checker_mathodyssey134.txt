Ground Truth Answer: 512
Proposed Answer: 2^9
<<<True>>>
The problem is asking for the greatest number k of subsets of a 10-element set where:
1. Any two distinct subsets in the collection are not disjoint (they share at least one common element)
2. For any subset not in the collection, there exists a subset in the collection that is disjoint with it

This describes a maximal family of intersecting subsets where each subset outside the family has a disjoint counterpart inside. For a set of size n, the maximum size of such a family is known to be 2^(n-1) = 512 when n=10 (since 2^9 = 512). The proposed answer 2^9 is exactly equal to 512, so they are equivalent.
