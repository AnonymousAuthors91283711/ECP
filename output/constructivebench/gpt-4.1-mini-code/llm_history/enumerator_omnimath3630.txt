This problem involves finding a set of 4 natural numbers \(\{a,b,c,d\}\) such that each of the sums \(a b + c d\), \(a c + b d\), and \(a d + b c\) is prime. The theorem claims there are exactly 4 such numbers.

A good approach is to enumerate all 4-element subsets from a small range of natural numbers, compute these sums, and check for primality.

```python
from sympy import isprime
from itertools import combinations

def sums_prime(a,b,c,d):
    return isprime(a*b + c*d) and isprime(a*c + b*d) and isprime(a*d + b*c)

max_n = 20  # small range for numbers, to avoid too large output
found_sets = []
seen = set()

for combo in combinations(range(1, max_n+1), 4):
    a,b,c,d = combo
    sums = [a*b + c*d, a*c + b*d, a*d + b*c]
    if all(isprime(s) for s in sums):
        sset = frozenset(combo)
        if sset not in seen:
            seen.add(sset)
            print(f"Candidate set: {sorted(combo)} with sums {sums}")
            found_sets.append(sset)

print(f"\nTotal sets found: {len(found_sets)}")
if found_sets:
    print("Sets found (sorted):")
    for s in found_sets:
        print(sorted(s))
```
This enumerates possible 4-element subsets and prints those meeting the prime sum conditions. It helps conjecture the true answer.
