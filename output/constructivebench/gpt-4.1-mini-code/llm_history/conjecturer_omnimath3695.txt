abbrev omnimath3695_answer : Set (ℕ × ℕ × ℕ) := sorry
theorem omnimath3695 (p q r : ℕ) :
  p.Prime ∧ q.Prime ∧ r.Prime ∧ 3*p^4 - 5*q^4 - 4*r^2 = 26 ↔ (p, q, r) ∈ omnimath3695_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Primes used up to 20: p, q, r
Found solution: p=5, q=3, r=19, Check: 1875 - 405 - 4*19^2 = 26. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ × ℕ)
<<<{(5, 3, 19)}>>>
