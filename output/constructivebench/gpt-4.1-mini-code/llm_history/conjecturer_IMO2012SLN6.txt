theorem IMO2012SLN6 (x : ℕ) (hx : 0 < x) :
  (∀ (y n : ℕ), 0 < y → 0 < n → (2^n * y + 1) ∣ (x^(2 * n) - 1)) ↔ x = IMO2012SLN6_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing x from 1 to 50 with y,n in [1..6]
x = 1 satisfies divisibility for tested y,n
Minimal candidate x = 1. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
