[write_program]
The problem involves two players, Ben and Jamie, each with a set of possible outcomes. We want to find the probability that their sums equal 50. The program enumerates all pairs, prints pairs that sum to 50, and computes the probability as a rational number.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def main():
    ben_outcomes = [5, 10, 20]
    jamie_outcomes = [30, 40]

    total_outcomes = [(b, j) for b in ben_outcomes for j in jamie_outcomes]
    favorable = [(b, j) for (b, j) in total_outcomes if b + j == 50]

    for pair in favorable:
        print(f"Favorable pair: {pair}, sum={sum(pair)}")

    total = len(total_outcomes)
    fav = len(favorable)
    prob = Fraction(fav, total)
    print(f"Total outcomes: {total}")
    print(f"Favorable count: {fav}")
    print(f"Probability (rational): {prob}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
