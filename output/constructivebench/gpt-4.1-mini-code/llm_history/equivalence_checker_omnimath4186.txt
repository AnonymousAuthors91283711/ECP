    (∀ x y, f (x + g y) = x * f y - y * f x + g x) ↔

Ground Truth Answer: fun t => 
    (fun x => t * (x - t) / (t + 1), 
     fun x => t * (x - t))
Proposed Answer: fun t : ℝ =>
  let f := fun x => t * x
  let g := fun x => (1 + t) * x
  (f, g)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is a functional equation relating f and g, asking for all pairs (f,g) that satisfy the given condition.

2. The ground truth answer provides:
   - f(x) = t*(x - t)/(t + 1)
   - g(x) = t*(x - t)

3. The proposed answer provides:
   - f(x) = t*x
   - g(x) = (1 + t)*x

Let's test if the proposed solution satisfies the original equation:
Take f(x) = t*x and g(y) = (1 + t)*y
Then f(x + g(y)) = t*(x + (1 + t)*y) = t*x + t*(1 + t)*y
But the right side of the equation would be:
x*f(y) - y*f(x) + g(x) = x*(t*y) - y*(t*x) + (1 + t)*x = t*x*y - t*x*y + (1 + t)*x = (1 + t)*x
This doesn't match t*x + t*(1 + t)*y unless t=0, which would be a special case.

The proposed answer doesn't satisfy the original functional equation except in trivial cases, while the ground truth answer does satisfy it for all t ≠ -1.
