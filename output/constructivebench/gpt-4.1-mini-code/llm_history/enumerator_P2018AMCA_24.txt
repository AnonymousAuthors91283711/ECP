The problem involves finding the greatest \( c \in [0,1] \) maximizing the two-dimensional volume (Lebesgue measure) of the set of points \((x,y) \in [0,1]\times[1/2,2/3]\) for which \( c \) lies strictly between \( x \) and \( y \).

This means counting the measure of:
\[
\{(x,y) \in [0,1]\times[1/2, 2/3]: (x < c < y) \text{ or } (y < c < x)\}
\]
Equivalently, points where \(c\) is strictly between \(x\) and \(y\).

We want to guess the maximizing \(c\).

Note:
- \(x \in [0,1]\)
- \(y \in [1/2, 2/3]\)
- Since \(y \in [0.5, 0.666\ldots]\), \(c\) near that interval may give larger volume.

The set has two parts:
- \(x < c < y\)
- \(y < c < x\)

For fixed \(c\), volume is:
\[
\mathrm{vol}(c) = \int_{x=0}^1 \int_{y=1/2}^{2/3} \mathbb{1}_{(x < c < y) \text{ or } (y < c < x)} dy dx
\]

We can compute it by integrating and enumerating candidate \(c\) in [0,1] with reasonable step, printing volumes to conjecture max.

We'll discretize intervals uniformly.

```python
# Enumerate c in [0,1] step 0.01, compute measure of {(x,y) in [0,1]x[0.5,2/3]: c between x,y}
# Volume = double integral over x,y of indicator of (x < c < y) or (y < c < x)
# print c and volume immediately

def volume_between(c, x_low=0.0, x_high=1.0, y_low=0.5, y_high=2/3, n=1000):
    # Use 1D integration by measure arguments to avoid heavy loops
    # For fixed y, set of x such that (x<c<y) or (y<c<x):
    # Two cases:
    # If c<y: x in [0,1], condition x < c < y => x < c (i.e. x < c)
    # But "or" also includes (y < c < x)
    # Break into two parts:
    # Part1: x < c < y  => if c<y, then x in [0,c), y fixed
    # Part2: y < c < x  => if y<c, then x in (c,1]
    # So for fixed y:
    # x satisfies condition iff x < c< y  or y < c< x
    # Which means:
    # if c < y, x in [0,c)
    # if y < c, x in (c,1]
    # Therefore:
    # volume for fixed c = integral over y in [y_low,y_high] of measure of x = length of x satisfying condition:
    # length_x = (c if c<y else 0) + (1 - c if y < c else 0)
    # So length_x = (c if c<y else 0) + (1 - c if y < c else 0)
    # So for y in [y_low,y_high]:
    # - When y < c : length_x = 1 - c
    # - When y > c : length_x = c
    # When y = c, length_x = 0 (c is not strictly between)
    # So volume = integral over y of length_x dy
    # = integral_y_low^c (1 - c) dy + integral_c^y_high c dy
    # but if c < y_low, then integral_c^y_high c dy doesn't start until c
    # or if c > y_high second integral is empty
    # So handle cases:
    
    if c <= y_low:
        # For all y in [y_low, y_high]: y>c => length_x = c
        length_y = y_high - y_low
        vol = c * length_y
    elif c >= y_high:
        # For all y in [y_low, y_high]: y < c => length_x = 1 - c
        length_y = y_high - y_low
        vol = (1 - c) * length_y
    else:
        # y_low < c < y_high
        vol = (c) * (y_high - c) + (1 - c) * (c - y_low)
        
    return vol

print("c\tvolume")
best_c = None
best_vol = -1
for i in range(0, 101):
    c = i / 100
    vol = volume_between(c)
    print(f"{c:.2f}\t{vol:.6f}")
    if vol > best_vol:
        best_vol = vol
        best_c = c
print(f"Maximum volume {best_vol:.6f} achieved at c = {best_c:.2f}")
```
This will enumerate volumes at steps 0.01 and print the best. Since the expression is exact, no approximation is needed.
