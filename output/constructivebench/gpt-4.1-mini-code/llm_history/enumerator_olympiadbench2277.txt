The problem looks for natural numbers \(r, q, p\) satisfying:
- \(q = 2r\)
- \(q = p - 4\)
- \(\frac{p + q + r}{3} = 13\)

From these equations:
- \(q = 2r\)
- \(p = q + 4 = 2r + 4\)
- \(\frac{p + q + r}{3} = 13 \implies p + q + r = 39\)

Substituting:
\[
p + q + r = (2r + 4) + 2r + r = 5r + 4 = 39 \implies 5r = 35 \implies r = 7
\]

So \(r=7\), \(q=14\), and \(p=18\).

The Python program below enumerates natural values of \(r\) from 1 to 20, computes corresponding \(q, p\), checks if the average equals 13, and prints all such tuples to aid conjecture.

```python
# Enumerate triples (r,q,p) satisfying given relations and average condition
for r in range(1, 21):  # sample small natural numbers up to 20
    q = 2 * r
    p = q + 4
    total = p + q + r
    if total % 3 == 0 and total // 3 == 13:
        print(f"r={r}, q={q}, p={p}, average={(total//3)}")
```
