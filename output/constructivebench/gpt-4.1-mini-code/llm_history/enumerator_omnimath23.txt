This appears to be a functional equation problem on integer lattice points. The function \( f: \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \to [0,1] \) satisfies \( f(x,y) = \frac{f(x-1,y) + f(x,y-1)}{2} \) for all integers \(x,y\).

To gain insight, we will enumerate possible functions on a small grid, respecting the averaging condition and range. We fix sample values on the boundaries to trigger the recursion. This approach helps conjecture the family of solutions.

```python
# Enumerate functions f: ZxZ -> [0,1] satisfying f(x,y) = (f(x-1,y) + f(x,y-1))/2
# on a small grid x,y in {0,1,2}, with boundaries f(0,y) and f(x,0) given in {0,0.5,1}.
# Print each candidate function as a 3x3 grid.

import itertools

def avg_eq(f, x, y):
    return abs(f[(x,y)] - (f[(x-1,y)] + f[(x,y-1)])/2) < 1e-8

def valid_function(bound_x, bound_y):
    # bound_x: dict x->value for f(x,0)
    # bound_y: dict y->value for f(0,y)
    f = {}
    # Set borders
    for x in range(3):
        f[(x,0)] = bound_x[x]
    for y in range(3):
        f[(0,y)] = bound_y[y]
    # Compute inner values by averaging equations
    for x in range(1,3):
        for y in range(1,3):
            f[(x,y)] = (f[(x-1,y)] + f[(x,y-1)])/2
            if not (0 <= f[(x,y)] <=1):
                return None
    # Verify all points satisfy the equation and [0,1] bounds
    for x in range(3):
        for y in range(3):
            if not (0 <= f[(x,y)] <=1):
                return None
            if x>0 and y>0 and not avg_eq(f,x,y):
                return None
    return f

vals = [0, 0.5, 1]
count = 0
print("Enumerated candidate functions on grid {0,1,2}x{0,1,2} with boundary values in {0,0.5,1}:")
for bound_x_vals in itertools.product(vals, repeat=3):
    for bound_y_vals in itertools.product(vals, repeat=3):
        f = valid_function(dict(enumerate(bound_x_vals)), dict(enumerate(bound_y_vals)))
        if f is not None:
            count += 1
            print(f"Candidate {count}:")
            for y in range(3):
                row = [f[(x,y)] for x in range(3)]
                print(" ".join(f"{v:.3f}" for v in row))
            print()
print(f"Total candidates found: {count}")
```
