The problem states that for all real \( x \), the average \(\frac{1 + 3 + x}{3} = 3\). We want to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies this equation.

By the equation:
\[
\frac{1 + 3 + x}{3} = 3 \implies 1 + 3 + x = 9 \implies x = 9 - 4 = 5
\]

So the answer is \( x = 5 \).

To assist in conjecturing this for a wider range of examples and verify correctness for similar expressions, the Python program below enumerates values of \( x \) satisfying \(\frac{1 + 3 + x}{3} = 3\). It only prints values that satisfy the equality exactly.

```python
# Enumerate real numbers (within a small integer range) x satisfying (1+3+x)/3 = 3 exactly
# Since 1,3 are fixed, x = 3*3 - 4 = 5
# We will verify this by checking x in range -10 to 10

print("Checking values of x in -10 to 10:")
target_average = 3
fixed_sum = 1 + 3

for x in range(-10, 11):
    avg = (fixed_sum + x) / 3
    if avg == target_average:
        print(f"x = {x} satisfies (1 + 3 + x)/3 = 3")

# Verifying for float values with decimal steps near the integer 5 for completeness
print("Checking decimal values near 5:")
for i in range(40, 61):
    x = i / 10
    avg = (fixed_sum + x) / 3
    if abs(avg - target_average) < 1e-9:
        print(f"x = {x} satisfies (1 + 3 + x)/3 = 3")
```
