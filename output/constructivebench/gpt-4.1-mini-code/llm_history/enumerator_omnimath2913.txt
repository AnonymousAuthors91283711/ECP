The problem can be simplified first: from the given equations 3 + x = 5 and -3 + y = 5, we can solve for x and y, then find x + y.

```python
# Enumerate values satisfying 3 + x = 5 and -3 + y = 5,
# then print x + y results.

def main():
    # Solve for x: 3 + x = 5 -> x = 2
    x = 2
    # Solve for y: -3 + y = 5 -> y = 8
    y = 8
    result = x + y
    print(f"x = {x}, y = {y}")
    print(f"x + y = {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
