The problem seems to relate three natural numbers \( S, Q, D \) with the equation \(\frac{4DS}{Q} = \text{some function of } S, Q, D\). The goal is to understand the function \( P2018AMCB_6\_answer(S, Q, D) \).

I'll write a Python program which enumerates values of \(S, Q, D\) with \(Q \neq 0\), then prints the exact value of \(\frac{4 D S}{Q}\) (when it is an integer). This may help to conjecture the function \(P2018AMCB_6\_answer\).

I will test \(S, Q, D\) all in the range 1 to 10 for brevity and clarity, printing out all exact integral values of \(\frac{4DS}{Q}\).

```python
# Enumerate values of S, Q, D ∈ [1..10], Q ≠ 0
# For each, print when (4*D*S)/Q is a natural number (integer >= 0)

def main():
    max_val = 10
    for S in range(1, max_val+1):
        for Q in range(1, max_val+1):  # Q != 0, Q ∈ [1..10]
            for D in range(1, max_val+1):
                numerator = 4 * D * S
                if numerator % Q == 0:  # exact division
                    val = numerator // Q
                    print(f"S={S}, Q={Q}, D={D} => (4*D*S)/Q = {val}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
