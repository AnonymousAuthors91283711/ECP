[write_program]
The problem asks whether there exist six odd natural numbers whose squares sum to 1986. The program below enumerates six odd numbers with squares summing to 1986, printing them when found. It first prints parameters (limit for odd numbers considered), then each sextuple found. Finally, it prints whether any solution exists.

```python
# Enumerate six odd natural numbers (1,3,5,...) such that their squares sum to 1986.
# Immediately print each solution found and finally print total solutions.

def main():
    target = 1986
    max_odd = 45  # Since 45^2=2025 > 1986, max odd number needed <=45
    odds = [i for i in range(1, max_odd+1, 2)]
    print(f"Parameters: target={target}, max_odd={max_odd}, odds_count={len(odds)}")
    
    solutions = 0
    # To reduce search space, use sorted sextuples a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d ≤ e ≤ f for uniqueness
    # Nested loops with pruning by partial sums
    for a in odds:
        a2 = a*a
        if a2 > target: break
        for b in odds:
            if b < a: continue
            b2 = b*b
            if a2 + b2 > target: break
            for c in odds:
                if c < b: continue
                c2 = c*c
                sum3 = a2 + b2 + c2
                if sum3 > target: break
                for d in odds:

                            f2 = f*f
                            s = sum5 + f2
                            if s == target:
                                print(f"Found: {a},{b},{c},{d},{e},{f}")
                                solutions += 1
                            elif s > target:
