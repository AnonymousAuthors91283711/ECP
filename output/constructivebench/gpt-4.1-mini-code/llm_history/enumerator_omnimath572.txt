The problem defines a sequence \( A_n \) with initial values \( A_0=0, A_1=1, A_2=2 \) and recursion
\[
A_{n+3} = \frac{A_{n+2} + A_{n+1} + A_n}{3} + \frac{1}{(n+3)^4 - (n+3)^2}.
\]
We want to find the limit \(\lim_{n\to\infty} A_n\).

Approach:
- Enumerate \(A_n\) for \(n\) up to some large \(N\).
- Since denominators grow fast, the added term tends to zero, so the sequence should converge.
- Print each \(A_n\) exactly (as fraction if possible) or as float to track convergence.
- Output the final approximate limit after the last term.

We will use Python's `Fraction` to keep exact rational terms for the recursion and print float values to track convergence clearly.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def main():
    # Initial values A_0=0, A_1=1, A_2=2 as Fractions
    A = [Fraction(0), Fraction(1), Fraction(2)]
    print(f"A_0 = {A[0]} = {float(A[0])}")
    print(f"A_1 = {A[1]} = {float(A[1])}")
    print(f"A_2 = {A[2]} = {float(A[2])}")

    N = 50  # Number of terms to enumerate
    for n in range(N):
        denom = (n+3)**4 - (n+3)**2  # (n+3)^4 - (n+3)^2
        term = (A[n+2] + A[n+1] + A[n]) / 3 + Fraction(1, denom)
        A.append(term)
        print(f"A_{n+3} = {term} = {float(term):.10f}")

    # Print last term as approximate limit candidate
    print(f"\nCandidate limit â‰ˆ {float(A[-1]):.10f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This enumerates the sequence exactly using fractions and prints float approximations to observe convergence, aiding conjecture of the limit.
