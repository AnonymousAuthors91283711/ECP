abbrev omnimath1429_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath1429 :
  let p_H := (1 : ℝ)/4
  let p_M := (1 : ℝ)/2
  let p_T := (1 : ℝ)/4
  -- Expected length calculation using Markov chain expectations
  let E := 1 + p_H * E + p_M * (1 + p_H * E + p_M * 0 + p_T * E) + p_T * E
  E = omnimath1429_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Using probabilities p_H=1/4, p_M=1/2, p_T=1/4
Constant term on right side: 3/2 (exact)
Coefficient of E on right side: 3/4 (exact)
Denominator (1 - coefficient): 1/4 (exact)
Expected value E = 6 (exact fraction)
Expected value E ≈ 6.000000. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<6>>>
