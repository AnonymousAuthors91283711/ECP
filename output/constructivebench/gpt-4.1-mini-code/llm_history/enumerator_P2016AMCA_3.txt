[write_program]
The problem seems to involve a function \( P2016AMCA_3\_answer \) that takes a pair of rational numbers and returns a rational number, with a known evaluation for a specific input. Since the actual function and theorem are not given, I'll write a Python program that enumerates pairs \((x,y)\) of rational numbers with small denominators (e.g., denominators up to 5), evaluates a placeholder function for these pairs, and prints the results. This can help conjecture properties or the form of \( P2016AMCA_3\_answer \).

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Placeholder for the actual function P2016AMCA_3_answer(x,y)
# Since the function is not defined, we'll try some sample functions involving rationals
# to see if any match the example P2016AMCA_3_answer(3/8, -2/5) = -1/40.
# For demonstration, try candidates based on arithmetic of x and y.

def candidates(x, y):
    # Try some sample functions that combine x and y rationally
    yield x + y
    yield x - y
    yield y - x
    yield x * y
    # Try (x*y)/(x+y) if denominator != 0
    if x + y != 0:
        yield (x * y) / (x + y)
    # Try (x - y) / (x + y) if denominator != 0
    if x + y != 0:
        yield (x - y) / (x + y)
    # Try x**2 - y**2
    yield x**2 - y**2
    # Try x**2 * y
    yield x**2 * y
    # Try x * y**2
    yield x * y**2

def enum_rationals(max_den=5):
    # Enumerate rational numbers with numerator between -max_den and max_den (excluding 0/0) and denominators 1..max_den
    rationals = []
    for d in range(1, max_den + 1):
        for n in range(-max_den, max_den + 1):
            frac = Fraction(n, d)
            # reduce fraction by construction, so no duplicates
            if frac not in rationals:
                rationals.append(frac)
    return rationals

# Given example pair for reference
x_ref = Fraction(3, 8)
y_ref = Fraction(-2, 5)
target = Fraction(-1, 40)

print(f"Reference input: x={x_ref}, y={y_ref}, expected output = {target}")

# Enumerate rationals with small denominators
rationals = enum_rationals(5)

found_exact = False

for x in rationals:
    for y in rationals:
        for val in candidates(x, y):
            if val == target:
                print(f"Match found: P2016AMCA_3_answer({x}, {y}) = {val}")
                found_exact = True
            else:
                # Print some sample evaluations selectively if close numerically
                # but keep output concise to meet token limits, so only print for few values
                continue

if not found_exact:
    print("No exact match to target found for candidate functions in enumerated domain.")
```
