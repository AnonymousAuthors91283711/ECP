The problem asks for the greatest natural number \(n\) such that \((n!)!\) is divisible by \(2004!\).

Key points:
- \(2004! \mid ((n!)!)!\)
- We want the largest \(n\) with this property.

Intuition:
- Factorials grow fast and their factorials even faster.
- The divisibility depends on prime factorization and valuations.
- To simplify enumeration, try small \(n\), check if \(((n!)!)!\) divisible by \(2004!\) by comparing prime valuations.
- Since 2004! is very large, this is infeasible directly; instead, test smaller values and inspect the growth pattern.

We'll test small \(n\) values, compute \(v_p((n!)!)!\) for primes \(p\) up to 2004, compare to \(v_p(2004!)\).

However, enumerating all primes up to 2004 is heavy; we'll prioritize some key primes or test if \(n\) less than some bounds is plausible.

The program will:
- Define factorial and prime factors.
- Define Legendre's formula for valuation of primes in factorial.
- Implement a function valuation_factorial(n, p) returning \(v_p(n!)\).
- Implement valuation_factorial_factorial(n, p) for \(v_p((n!)!)!\).
- For small \(n\) (e.g., from 1 to 10), check if for all primes \(p\) up to 20 (sample primes), \(v_p((n!)!)! \geq v_p(2004!)\).
- Print the values and the result.

This approach only samples primes up to 20 and small \(n\), based on given constraints and complexity.
