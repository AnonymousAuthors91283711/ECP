Let's enumerate the values of Ea, Eb, Ec exactly using rational arithmetic to verify the relationship and calculate Ec. We will print the exact fractions for each step.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

def main():
    # Sum and count of dice faces
    faces = range(1, 7)
    s = sum(faces)
    n = len(faces)

    # Compute Ea = (1+2+...+6)/6 exactly
    Ea = Fraction(s, n)
    print(f"Ea = {Ea} = {float(Ea)}")

    # Compute Eb = Ea * (1+2+...+6)/6 exactly
    Eb = Ea * Fraction(s, n)
    print(f"Eb = Ea * (1+2+...+6)/6 = {Eb} = {float(Eb)}")

    # Compute Ec = Eb * (1+2+...+6)/6 exactly
    Ec = Eb * Fraction(s, n)
    print(f"Ec = Eb * (1+2+...+6)/6 = {Ec} = {float(Ec)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
