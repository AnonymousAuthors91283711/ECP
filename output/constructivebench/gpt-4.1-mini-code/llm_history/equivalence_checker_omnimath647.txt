abbrev omnimath647_answer : ℝ × ℝ → ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath647 (a b : ℝ) :
    Collinear ℝ ({![1, a, b], ![a, 2, b], ![a, b, 3]} : Set (Fin 3 → ℝ)) ↔ omnimath647_answer (a, b) = 4 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun (a, b) => a + b
Proposed Answer: fun p : ℝ × ℝ => p.1 * p.2 + p.1 + p.2
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about collinearity of three vectors in ℝ³, which can be determined by checking if the determinant of the matrix formed by these vectors is zero.

2. The ground truth answer suggests that the condition simplifies to a + b = 4.

3. The proposed answer suggests a*b + a + b = 4.

4. These are clearly different conditions. For example:
   - When a=1, ground truth gives b=3, proposed gives b=3/2
   - When a=2, ground truth gives b=2, proposed gives b=2/3

The proposed answer is incorrect as it doesn't match the ground truth condition for collinearity.
