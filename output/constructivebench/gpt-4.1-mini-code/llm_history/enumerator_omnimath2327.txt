This appears to be a problem about computing the last 8 digits of the product \(11 \times 101 \times 1001 \times 10001 \times 100001 \times 1000001 \times 111\). The task is to find the exact last 8 digits without full expansion, likely modulo \(10^8\).

We will multiply these numbers modulo \(10^8\), printing intermediate results to observe the sequence and confirm the final answer.

```python
# Compute product modulo 10^8, print intermediate results
mod = 10**8
factors = [11, 101, 1001, 10001, 100001, 1000001, 111]

product = 1
for i, f in enumerate(factors, 1):
    product = (product * f) % mod
    # Print step number, factor and current product mod 10^8
    print(f"After multiplying factor #{i} ({f}): {product:08d}")

print("\nFinal product mod 10^8:", f"{product:08d}")
```
