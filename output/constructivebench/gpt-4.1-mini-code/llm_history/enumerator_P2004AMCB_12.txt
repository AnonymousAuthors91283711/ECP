The problem involves a recursive sequence defined as:
f(0) = 2001,
f(1) = 2002,
f(2) = 2003,
and for k ≥ 0,
f(k+3) = f(k+1) + f(k) - f(k+2).

We want to understand the behavior of f(n-1) for n ≥ 3, presumably to find a closed form or pattern. This Python code will compute f(k) for k up to some max value for example n, printing each value immediately to help conjecture a formula.

```python
def f_sequence(max_k):
    f = [2001, 2002, 2003]  # base cases
    print(f"f(0) = {f[0]}")
    print(f"f(1) = {f[1]}")
    print(f"f(2) = {f[2]}")
    for k in range(3, max_k + 1):
        val = f[k - 2] + f[k - 3] - f[k - 1]
        f.append(val)
        print(f"f({k}) = {val}")

# We test for some n values starting at 3, up to 20 (arbitrary small range).
for n in range(3, 21):
    print(f"\nComputing f(n-1) for n={n}:")
    f_sequence(n - 1)
```
This will print values of f(k) up to k = n-1 for multiple n, streaming all values to observe patterns for conjecture.
