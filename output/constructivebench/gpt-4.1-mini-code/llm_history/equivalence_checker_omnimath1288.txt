Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (n^n - (n-1)^n) / (n^(n-1))
Proposed Answer: fun n => (∑ k in Finset.range n, (Nat.choose n k) * (k + 1) ^ n) / (n ^ n : ℚ)
Let me analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer.

The problem involves calculating the average number of distinct values in a random function from Fin n to [1..n]. 

Ground truth answer: (n^n - (n-1)^n)/(n^(n-1)) simplifies to n - (n-1)^n/n^(n-1) = n - (1-1/n)^(n-1)*n

Proposed answer: Uses a sum involving binomial coefficients and powers, which appears to be counting all possible functions with different numbers of distinct values.

While both expressions involve n^n terms, they are structurally different. The ground truth uses a clever inclusion-exclusion approach (total functions minus functions missing at least one value), while the proposed answer uses an explicit enumeration of all possible cases.

After careful consideration, these are not equivalent expressions. The proposed answer is more complex and doesn't simplify to the ground truth answer.
