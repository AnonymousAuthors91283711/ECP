Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: 20
Since the problem involves solving a system of equations with given conditions, and the proposed answer is a concrete numerical value (20), but the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (indicating it's not provided or known), I cannot verify the equivalence of the proposed answer with the ground truth. 

However, I can analyze whether the proposed answer (20) is consistent with the given conditions. Let's solve the system step-by-step:

1. From `hT : T = 1 / 40`, we get `T = 0.025`.
2. From `hx2y2 : x^2 - y^2 = 1 / T`, substituting `T` gives `x^2 - y^2 = 40`.
3. From `hxy : x + y = 5`, we can express `y = 5 - x`.
4. Substitute `y` into the equation from step 2: `x^2 - (5 - x)^2 = 40`.
   Simplifying: `x^2 - (25 - 10x + x^2) = 40` → `10x - 25 = 40` → `10x = 65` → `x = 6.5`.
5. From `hxz : x - z = -7`, substituting `x = 6.5` gives `6.5 - z = -7` → `z = 13.5`.
6. Finally, `x + z = 6.5 + 13.5 = 20`.

The proposed answer (20) is correct based on the given conditions. However, since the ground truth is not provided, I cannot confirm equivalence.
