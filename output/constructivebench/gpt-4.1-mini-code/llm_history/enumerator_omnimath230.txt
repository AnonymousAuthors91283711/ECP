The problem involves finite sets S of positive integers with a uniqueness condition on gcd-divisors: for each s in S and each positive divisor d of s, there is a unique t in S such that gcd(s,t) = d. We want to understand possible sizes |S| meeting this condition.

To explore this, I'll write a Python program to enumerate small sets S of positive integers, verify the condition, and print their cardinalities and sample sets. We'll limit to small integers and small cardinalities to keep output concise. This can help conjecture the possible values in omnimath230_answer.

```python
from math import gcd
from itertools import combinations

def divides(d, n):
    return n % d == 0

def has_unique_t(S, s):
    # For each positive divisor d of s,
    # check exactly one t in S satisfies gcd(s,t) = d
    divisors = [d for d in range(1, s+1) if divides(d, s)]
    for d in divisors:
        count = 0
        for t in S:
            if gcd(s, t) == d:
                count += 1
            if count > 1:
                return False
        if count != 1:
            return False
    return True

def check_S(S):
    # Check all s in S satisfy the condition
    for s in S:
        if s <= 0:
            return False
        if not has_unique_t(S, s):
            return False
    return True

max_val = 10
max_card = 5

print("Testing sets S with elements in [1..{}], max size {}".format(max_val, max_card))
found_cardinalities = set()
for card in range(1, max_card+1):
    # print("Checking sets of size", card)
    for S in combinations(range(1, max_val+1), card):
        if check_S(S):
            found_cardinalities.add(card)
            print(f"S={S}, |S|={card}")

print("Possible cardinalities found:", sorted(found_cardinalities))
if found_cardinalities:
    print("Minimum cardinality:", min(found_cardinalities))
    print("Maximum cardinality:", max(found_cardinalities))
```
