Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (2 * n)! * 2^(n^2)
Proposed Answer: fun n => (2^(n * (n + 1)) : ‚Ñï)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about counting certain types of functions (ùíÆ) that map pairs of Fin (n+1) to subsets of Fin (2*n) with specific cardinality and monotonicity conditions.

2. The ground truth answer is (2 * n)! * 2^(n^2), which suggests:
   - A factorial component (2n)! which grows very rapidly
   - An exponential component 2^(n¬≤) which also grows rapidly

3. The proposed answer is 2^(n*(n+1)), which is purely exponential.

Comparing the growth rates:
- For n=1: 
  - Ground truth: 2! * 2^1 = 4
  - Proposed: 2^(1*2) = 4
- For n=2:
  - Ground truth: 4! * 2^4 = 24*16 = 384
  - Proposed: 2^(2*3) = 64
- For n=3:
  - Ground truth: 6! * 2^9 = 720*512 = 368640
  - Proposed: 2^(3*4) = 4096

The answers only match at n=1 and diverge rapidly afterwards. The proposed answer grows much slower than the ground truth answer.
