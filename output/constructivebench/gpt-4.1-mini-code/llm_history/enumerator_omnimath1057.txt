The problem is about counting 4-tuples (s0,s1,s2,s3) of positive integers summing to 16 with the constraint s_i ≤ sum of other three components. We want the count (encard) of the set S:

S = { s : Fin 4 → ℕ | 
      ∀ i, s_i > 0, 
      sum_i s_i = 16,
      ∀ i, s_i ≤ 16 - s_i 
    }
Rewrite the last constraint as: s_i ≤ 8 for each i.

So the problem is: count positive integer quadruples summing to 16, each at most 8.

We will enumerate all positive quadruples with sum 16, and filter those max(s_i) ≤ 8.

Print all such quadruples and count them.

This enumeration will give candidates; the count is the answer.

```python
# Enumerate positive integers quadruples (s0,s1,s2,s3) summing to 16,
# with each s_i ≤ 8.

def main():
    total_sum = 16
    max_val = 8
    count = 0
    # s0,s1,s2,s3 > 0 and ≤ 8, s0+s1+s2+s3=16
    for s0 in range(1, max_val+1):
        for s1 in range(1, max_val+1):
            for s2 in range(1, max_val+1):
                s3 = total_sum - (s0 + s1 + s2)
                if s3 < 1 or s3 > max_val:
                    continue
                # print the quadruple
                print((s0,s1,s2,s3))
                count += 1
    print("Total count:", count)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
