[write_program]
The problem seems to relate to identifying certain real numbers in a finite set that satisfy a condition, presumably involving polynomial roots or similar. To assist understanding and exploration, I'll write a Python program that enumerates these candidate values and checks various conditions for each to help conjecture which one(s) qualify as solutions.

```python
# Enumerate candidates to identify special values from the given set
candidates = [-1, -2/3, 2/3, 1, 14/3]

def check_condition(x):
    # Placeholder for the condition to verify for each candidate
    # Since the original problem is missing, let's check some example properties:
    # For instance, calculate a polynomial value that might relate to these answers
    # Example polynomial: f(x) = 3x^3 - 4x^2 + x - 2 (arbitrary choice for demo)
    return 3*x**3 - 4*x**2 + x - 2

print("Candidates and their check values:")
for x in candidates:
    val = check_condition(x)
    print(f"x = {x}, f(x) = {val}")

# This output should help identify which candidate satisfies the problem's real condition.
# In a real scenario, replace check_condition() with the exact problem condition for verification.
```
