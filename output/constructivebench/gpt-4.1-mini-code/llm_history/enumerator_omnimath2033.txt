This problem counts the number of injective functions \( f: \{1,...,5\} \to \{1,...,6\} \times \{1,...,6\} \) such that the first and second components of the image are both injective separately, and for each \( i \), the two components differ.

We want to enumerate such functions \( f \). Translating:

- \( f \) assigns to each \( i \in \{1,...,5\} \) a pair \((x_i,y_i)\), with \( x_i,y_i \in \{1,...,6\} \).
- The map \(i \mapsto x_i\) is injective.
- The map \(i \mapsto y_i\) is injective.
- For each \( i \), \( x_i \neq y_i \).

So, \(x\) and \(y\) are injective sequences of length 5 from 6 elements, with no coordinate where \(x_i = y_i\).

We want to count the number of pairs of injective functions \( (x,y): [5] \to [6] \times [6] \) with \(x\), \(y\) injective, and \(x_i \neq y_i\).

We can enumerate all injective sequences \(x\), and for each count suitable injective \(y\).

Let's write a program that enumerates all permutations of 5 elements chosen from 6 for \(x\), then for each finds permutations for \(y\) disjoint from \(x\) in the sense \(y_i \neq x_i\).

We will print each count found per \(x\), then the total sum.

```python
from itertools import permutations

def main():
    n = 6
    k = 5
    elements = list(range(1, n+1))
    total = 0
    # enumerate injective sequences x (permutations of length k)
    for x in permutations(elements, k):
        # for y, must be length k injective with y_i != x_i
        count_y = 0
        # we try all possible y permutations of length k
        for y in permutations(elements, k):
            # check y_i != x_i for all i
            if all(y[i] != x[i] for i in range(k)):
                count_y += 1
        print(f"x = {x}, valid y count = {count_y}")
        total += count_y
    print(f"Total number of such functions f: {total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
This enumerates all cases and prints the count for each \(x\), then the total. This matches the problem constraints and will help conjecture the answer.
