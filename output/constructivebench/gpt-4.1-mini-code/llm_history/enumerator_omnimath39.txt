The problem is about finding positive integers \( a \) and 6-element integer sets \( X \) such that for every integer \( k \) in [1,36], there exist \( x,y \in X \) with \( 37 \mid a x + y - k \).

We want to enumerate candidate values of \( a \) and sets \( X \subseteq \mathbb{Z} \) of size 6, that satisfy this property. Since the problem involves divisibility by 37, it makes sense to consider elements of \( X \) modulo 37, and \( a \) modulo 37.

We can:
- Try small positive integers \( a \) from 1 to some small bound.
- For each \( a \), try subsets \( X \subseteq \{0, \ldots, 36\} \) of size 6.
- For each \( k \in [1..36] \), check if there exist \( x,y \in X \) with \( a x + y \equiv k \pmod{37} \).
- Print each \( (a,X) \) that works immediately.

We limit the search for efficiency.

Below is a Python enumerator script that implements this approach:

```python
from itertools import combinations

# Modulus
M = 37

def check(a, X):
    # Precompute all values of a*x + y mod M for x,y in X
    values = set((a*x + y) % M for x in X for y in X)
    # Check coverage of all k in 1..36
    for k in range(1, 37):
        if k not in values:
            return False
    return True

def main():
    # We try a in [1..10] for speed
    for a in range(1, 11):
        print(f"Trying a={a}")
        # All subsets of size 6 from 0..36
        for X in combinations(range(M), 6):
            if check(a, X):
                print(f"Found a={a}, X={X}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This enumerator prints partial results as found, showing candidate \( a \) and \( X \) sets. The output will aid conjecturing the true answer set.
