This problem asks to find \( e \times f \) given \( \frac{e}{f} = \frac{3}{4} \) and \( \sqrt{e^2 + f^2} = 15 \).

We can start by enumerating possible integer values of \(e\) and \(f\) close to the ratio 3:4, compute their norm, and check which satisfy the second condition. Then print \( e \times f \).

```python
# Enumerate possible integer values e,f with e/f = 3/4 and sqrt(e^2+f^2) = 15
# Actually, since e/f = 3/4 => e = 3k, f = 4k for some k.
# Then sqrt((3k)^2 + (4k)^2) = sqrt(9k^2 + 16k^2) = sqrt(25k^2) = 5k = 15 => k=3
# So e=9, f=12 and e*f=108. Let's verify by enumeration too.

print("Enumerating integer multiples of ratio 3:4 and checking norm = 15")

for k in range(1, 10):
    e = 3*k
    f = 4*k
    norm = (e**2 + f**2)**0.5
    if abs(norm - 15) < 1e-9:
        product = e * f
        print(f"Found e={e}, f={f}, norm={norm:.9f}, e*f={product}")

print("Conjectured answer: 108")
```
