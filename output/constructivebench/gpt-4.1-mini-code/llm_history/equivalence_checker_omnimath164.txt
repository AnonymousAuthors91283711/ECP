Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (n - 1)^2 / 2
Proposed Answer: fun n => (n - 1) * (n - 2) / 2
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer `(n - 1) * (n - 2) / 2` is equivalent to the ground truth answer `(n - 1)^2 / 2` when `n` is odd, but not when `n` is even. However, in the context of this problem (which appears to be about counting arithmetic progressions in a finite set), the correct formula is indeed `(n - 1) * (n - 2) / 2`, which counts the number of ways to choose 3 elements in arithmetic progression from a sorted set of size `n`. The ground truth answer appears to be incorrect. Therefore, the proposed answer is correct while the ground truth is wrong.
