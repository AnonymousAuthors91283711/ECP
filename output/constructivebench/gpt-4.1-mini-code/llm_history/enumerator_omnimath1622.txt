This Lean snippet talks about a property `omnimath1622_answer` defined on natural numbers and a theorem that states it holds for all positive natural numbers. Since the actual property is missing ("sorry"), we can't analyze the exact statement. 

To assist your exploration, I will write a Python enumerator that tries several small natural numbers n > 0, and, for demonstration, we can define some sample property predicates that might be relevant in such questions (like "n is prime", "n has a certain divisor", etc.). The goal is to print small values n with some sample properties, assisting in conjecturing the actual property.

This is a generic enumerator; you can edit or add predicates to explore.

```python
# Enumerate natural numbers n > 0 up to a small bound,
# and print values satisfying some sample candidate properties.

def is_prime(k):
    if k < 2: return False
    for i in range(2, int(k**0.5)+1):
        if k % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def has_digit_1(k):
    return '1' in str(k)

def is_perfect_square(k):
    r = int(k**0.5)
    return r*r == k

def main():
    MAX_N = 30  # small range to keep output short
    print("Enumerating n in [1..{}] with some sample properties:".format(MAX_N))
    for n in range(1, MAX_N+1):
        # Each line states n and which sample properties it satisfies
        props = []
        if is_prime(n):
            props.append("prime")
        if has_digit_1(n):
            props.append("has_digit_1")
        if is_perfect_square(n):
            props.append("perfect_square")
        if props:
            print(f"n={n}: " + ", ".join(props))
        else:
            print(f"n={n}: no tested properties")

if __name__=="__main__":
    main()
```
