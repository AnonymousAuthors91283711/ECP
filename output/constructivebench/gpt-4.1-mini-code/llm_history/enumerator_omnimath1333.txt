The problem concerns finding the sum over complex numbers \( z \) for which there exists \( y \) such that \( z + y = 1 \) and \( z^{20} + y^{20} = 20 \). We want to sum \(\text{Re}(z^2 + (1 - z)^2)\) over all such \( z \).

Since \( y = 1 - z \), the condition is \( z^{20} + (1 - z)^{20} = 20 \). The set is finite because the equation represents a polynomial constraint.

We enumerate complex solutions by considering roots on the complex plane, but since roots are complex and hard to enumerate exactly, we can consider the polynomial \( P(z) = z^{20} + (1 - z)^{20} - 20 \) and find its roots numerically. Then sum the real parts of \( z^2 + (1 - z)^2 \) for roots.

We print partial roots and their partial sums as found to identify patterns.

```python
import cmath

# We enumerate approximate roots of z^20 + (1 - z)^20 = 20
# which can be rewritten as f(z) = z^20 + (1 - z)^20 - 20 = 0

# Use numpy polynomial roots with complex coefficients to find roots of high-degree polynomials would be hard here.
# Instead, note that the polynomial is degree 20 in z, but (1-z)^20 expands as sums of powers of z.

# Let's construct coefficient of the polynomial p(z) = z^20 + (1 - z)^20 - 20
# We'll represent p(z) as sum_{k=0}^{20} coeff_k z^k

# Use binomial theorem for (1 - z)^20 = sum_{k=0}^20 C(20,k) * 1^{20-k} * (-z)^k = sum_{k=0}^{20} C(20,k)(-1)^k z^k

from math import comb

coeffs = [0]*21
coeffs[20] = 1  # z^20 term

# Add coefficients for (1-z)^20
for k in range(21):
    coeffs[k] += comb(20,k)*((-1)**k)

# Subtract 20 for the constant term
coeffs[0] -= 20

# coeffs represents polynomial p(z) = 0

# numpy poly1d expects highest degree first
import numpy as np

poly = np.poly1d(coeffs[::-1])  # reverse because numpy expects descending powers

roots = poly.r

sum_real = 0
count = 0

for z in roots:
    val = z**2 + (1 - z)**2
    real_part = val.real
    print(f"Root {count+1}: {z}, contributes real part: {real_part:.10f}")
    sum_real += real_part
    count += 1

print(f"Sum of real parts over all {count} roots: {sum_real:.10f}")
```
