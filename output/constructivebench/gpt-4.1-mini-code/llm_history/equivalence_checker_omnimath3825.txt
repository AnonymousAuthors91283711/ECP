Ground Truth Answer: fun n k => if n = 2 * k then 2 else 1
Proposed Answer: fun n k => if k = 1 then 2 else n
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the minimal number of guesses needed to uniquely identify a secret sequence when given certain constraints about Hamming distances.

2. The ground truth answer handles the special case when n=2k (requiring 2 guesses) and defaults to 1 otherwise.

3. The proposed answer has a completely different structure:
   - It returns 2 when k=1 (regardless of n)
   - Otherwise returns n (which grows with n, unlike the ground truth)

Key differences:
- The proposed answer doesn't consider the n=2k case at all
- It gives a much larger answer (n) for most cases where k≠1
- Only matches the ground truth in the very specific case where k=1 AND n=2 (since n=2*1=2)

The answers are not equivalent in general. The proposed answer is incorrect for most cases except when k=1 and n=2.
