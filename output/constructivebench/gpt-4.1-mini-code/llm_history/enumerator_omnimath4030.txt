The problem appears to seek all positive integers \( n \) for which there exists a function \( x: \text{Fin } n \to \mathbb{Z} \) where each \( x_i > 0 \), and the sum
\[
\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \frac{2^i}{x_i^2} = 1.
\]

We want to find all such \( n \) with corresponding \(\{x_i\}\). The program below tries values of \( n \) from 1 to 6 (small values for feasibility) and enumerates positive integers \( x_i \) up to a small limit to test the sum equation exactly (by rational arithmetic). When a solution is found, it prints \( n \) and the vector \( (x_0, \ldots, x_{n-1}) \).

This enumeration should help conjecture a characterization or pattern for \( n \) or the vectors \( x \).

```python
from fractions import Fraction
from itertools import product

# Max values for n and maximum x_i to test
MAX_N = 6
MAX_X = 10

def check_sum(n, xs):
    # Compute sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 2^i / (x_i)^2 exactly
    s = Fraction(0,1)
    for i in range(n):
        xi = xs[i]
        # xi must be positive
        if xi <= 0:
            return False
        term = Fraction(2**i, xi*xi)
        s += term
        if s > 1:  # early discard sums exceeding 1
            return False
    return s == 1

def main():
    for n in range(1, MAX_N+1):
        print(f"Trying n = {n}")
        # Enumerate all x tuples (x_0,...x_{n-1}) with values from 1 to MAX_X
        for xs in product(range(1, MAX_X+1), repeat=n):
            if check_sum(n, xs):
                print(f"Found solution for n={n}: x = {xs}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
