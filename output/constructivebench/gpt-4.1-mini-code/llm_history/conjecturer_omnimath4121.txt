abbrev omnimath4121_answer : ℚ → ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath4121 (f : ℚ → ℚ) :
  (∀ x y : ℚ, 0 < x → 0 < y → f (f x^2 * y) = x^3 * f (x * y)) ↔ f = omnimath4121_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: f(q) = 1 * q^-1 satisfies the equation.

Candidate functions found:
f(q) = 1 * q^-1. Expected Answer Type: ℚ → ℚ
<<<fun q : ℚ => q⁻¹>>>
