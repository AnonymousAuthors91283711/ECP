The problem seeks the greatest real number \( C \) such that for every integer \( n \geq 2 \), there exists a function \( x \colon \{0,\ldots,n-1\} \to [-1,1] \) with the product of all differences \( (x_i - x_j) \) for \( i<j \) at least \( C^{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}} \).

This relates to maximizing the product of pairwise differences (Vandermonde determinant like) on the interval \([-1,1]\). Classical equidistant points or Chebyshev nodes achieve large products of pairwise distances. Let's enumerate for small \( n \) the maximum product of pairwise differences of points in \([-1,1]\), checking grids of points, then compute the corresponding base \( C \) from the product:

\[
C_n = \left(\prod_{0 \leq i < j < n} (x_j - x_i)\right)^{\frac{2}{n(n-1)}}
\]

We print \( n \), candidate points \( x \), product of differences, and computed \( C_n \). The maximum \( C \) over \( n \) should give a conjectural value for the theorem's answer.

import itertools
from math import comb

def product_diff(xs):
    prod = 1.0
    n = len(xs)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1,n):
            diff = xs[j]-xs[i]
            if diff <= 0:
                return 0  # strictly increasing order needed or positive differences
            prod *= diff
    return prod

def linspace(a, b, m):
    step = (b - a) / (m - 1)
    return [a + i*step for i in range(m)]

def enumerate_points(n, grid_size=10):
    # Generate grid points in [-1,1]
    grid = linspace(-1,1,grid_size)
    # Enumerate non-decreasing n-tuples from grid to reduce duplicates and keep order
    # but we need strictly increasing sequences to have positive differences strictly.
    # So enumerate strictly increasing subsets
    for xs in itertools.combinations(grid,n):
        yield xs

def main():
    max_C = 0
    for n in range(2,6):  # small n to keep output short
        max_prod = 0
        max_xs = None
        total_pairs = comb(n,2)
        for xs in enumerate_points(n,15):
            prod = product_diff(xs)
            if prod > max_prod:
                max_prod = prod
                max_xs = xs
        if max_prod > 0:
            C_n = max_prod ** (2 / (n*(n-1)))
            print(f"n={n}, points={max_xs}, product={max_prod:.6f}, C_n={C_n:.6f}")
            if C_n > max_C:
                max_C = C_n
    print(f"Conjectured max C â‰¥ {max_C:.6f}")
