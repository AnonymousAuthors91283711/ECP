The problem asks to count pairs (a, b) with 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 57 such that (a² mod 57) < (b² mod 57). I will enumerate all such pairs and print each qualifying pair to help analyze their count, then print the total count as the answer candidate.

```python
# Enumerate pairs (a,b), 1 ≤ a < b ≤ 57,
# print pairs where (a² mod 57) < (b² mod 57) and the total count

def main():
    n = 57
    count = 0
    # To improve speed, precompute squares mod 57
    squares_mod = [ (i*i) % n for i in range(n+1) ]
    for a in range(1, n):
        sa = squares_mod[a]
        for b in range(a+1, n+1):
            sb = squares_mod[b]
            if sa < sb:
                print(f"({a}, {b}) with {sa} < {sb}")
                count += 1
    print(f"Total count of pairs meeting condition: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
