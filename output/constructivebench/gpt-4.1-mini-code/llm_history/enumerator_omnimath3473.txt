The problem involves rational arithmetic: proving that (110/100) * 500 equals some rational number omnimath3473_answer. To assist, I'll enumerate the exact values of (110/100)*n for a range of n, including 500, to see the output in rational number form.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Enumerate values of (110/100)*n for n in a sample range including 500
numerator = 110
denominator = 100
fraction = Fraction(numerator, denominator)

sample_values = [490, 495, 500, 505, 510]

for n in sample_values:
    result = fraction * n
    print(f"({numerator}/{denominator}) * {n} = {result} = {float(result)}")
```
This code prints exact rational values and their float approximations for a few values near 500 to support conjecture and proof.
