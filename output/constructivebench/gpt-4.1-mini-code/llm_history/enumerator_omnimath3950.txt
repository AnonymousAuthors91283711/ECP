The problem involves analyzing sets \( S \subseteq \mathbb{N} \) such that every element \( m \in S \) has no nontrivial \( n \)-th power divisors (i.e., if \( k^n \mid m \), then \( k^n = 1 \)) and \( S \) is infinite with cardinality \( N \). The goal is to find the maximal \( N \) for each \( n \geq 2 \).

The condition means each \( m \) is \( n \)-th-power-free: no prime factor appears with exponent \(\geq n\). The infinite set \( S \) consists of \( n \)-th-power-free numbers, and we want to understand the largest such set cardinality possible, under set equivalence or some encoding \(\mathrm{encard} = N\).

I'll enumerate small natural numbers and count how many are \( n \)-th-power-free up to some bound, to get candidates for \( N \). This experimental approach may hint at \( \text{omnimath3950\_answer}(n) \).

```python
# Enumerate infinite subsets of n-th-power-free numbers and count their cardinality
# Here, for testing, we only look at initial segments to infer patterns.
# We print the count of n-th-power-free numbers within a range, for sample n = 2,3,4.

def nth_power_free_numbers(n, limit):
    # Returns all numbers ≤ limit that are n-th-power-free:
    # No prime factor to power n or more dividing the number.
    # We rely on factorization to test.
    from math import isqrt
    def prime_factors(x):
        factors = {}
        for p in range(2, isqrt(x)+1):
            while x % p == 0:
                factors[p] = factors.get(p,0)+1
                x //= p
        if x > 1:
            factors[x] = factors.get(x,0)+1
        return factors
    result = []
    for m in range(1, limit+1):
        fcts = prime_factors(m)
        if all(e < n for e in fcts.values()):
            result.append(m)
    return result

def main():
    Ns = [2,3,4]
    limit = 100  # limit for enumeration
    for n in Ns:
        free_nums = nth_power_free_numbers(n, limit)
        print(f"n = {n}, n-th-power-free numbers ≤ {limit}, count = {len(free_nums)}")
        print("Sample values:", free_nums[:10])
        # Print some partial results immediately for insight
        # We won't find exact "greatest" N from finite > infinite sets,
        # but this enumeration helps conjecture the form of the answer.
main()
```
This code enumerates \( n \)-th-power-free numbers up to 100 for n=2,3,4 and prints counts and samples to aid in conjecturing \(\text{omnimath3950\_answer}(n)\).
