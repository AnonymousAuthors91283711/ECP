The problem involves a quartic polynomial with integer coefficients and roots, with conditions on the roots being negative integers, and a specific linear relation on coefficients summing to 2009. We want to explore integer coefficient quartic polynomials of the form

f(x) = x^4 + a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d

with integer roots r_i < 0 (so roots are negative integers), and such that a + b + c + d = 2009.

By Viète's formulas for polynomial roots r1, r2, r3, r4:

- a = -(r1 + r2 + r3 + r4)
- b = sum of pairwise products: r1*r2 + r1*r3 + ... + r3*r4
- c = - sum of triple products: r1*r2*r3 + r1*r2*r4 + ...
- d = product r1 * r2 * r3 * r4

All r_i are negative integers. We want to enumerate possible quadruples (r1, r2, r3, r4) with negative integer roots, compute a,b,c,d, then check if a + b + c + d = 2009, and print candidates including d.

Approach:

- Enumerate (r1, r2, r3, r4) with negative integers, say from -1 down to a negative limit (e.g., -20), allowing repeats.
- For each root tuple compute a,b,c,d via Viète's.
- Check if a+b+c+d == 2009.
- Print the tuple of roots, coefficients, and sum.
- Because roots are all negative integer roots, avoid duplicates by enforcing r1 ≤ r2 ≤ r3 ≤ r4 to reduce work.

We print each found solution's roots and corresponding d (constant term).

We will choose a small limit for roots (e.g., -1 to -10) to avoid too many computations. Printing each found candidate immediately.

```python
# Enumerate integer quartic polynomials with negative integer roots r_i < 0
# For roots r1 ≤ r2 ≤ r3 ≤ r4 in [-10,-1], compute coefficients by Viète's
# Check if a + b + c + d == 2009 and print solutions
