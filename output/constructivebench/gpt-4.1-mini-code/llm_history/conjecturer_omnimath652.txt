theorem omnimath652 (x y : ℕ) : 
  3^x * 4^y = 2^(x + y) + 2^(2*(x + y) - 1) ↔ (x, y) ∈ omnimath652_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Checking solutions to 3^x * 4^y = 2^(x+y) + 2^(2(x+y)-1) for x,y in [0..30]
Solution found: x=0, y=1
Solution found: x=1, y=1
Solution found: x=2, y=2. Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ)
<<<{(0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 2)}>>>
