The problem is to find the smallest natural number \( n \) such that for every function \( f: \text{Fin}(n) \to \text{Fin}(2) \), there exists a 3-element subset \( s \subseteq \text{Fin}(n) \) on which \( f \) is constant.

This is a Ramsey-type problem. Here, \(\text{Fin}(n)\) is just \(\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}\), and \(f\) colors each element either 0 or 1. We want the minimal \( n \) so that any 2-coloring of \( \{0,\ldots,n-1\} \) contains a monochromatic subset of size 3.

We will enumerate \( n \) starting from 1 upwards, and for each \( n \), enumerate all functions \( f: \{0,\ldots,n-1\} \to \{0,1\} \). For each such function, check if there exists a 3-element subset all of the same color.

If for all \( f \) such a subset exists, print \( n \) as a candidate answer.

Output each \( n \) immediately when confirmed.

We limit to \( n \leq 7 \) for efficiency and since the classical Ramsey number \( R(3,3) = 6 \) suggests the answer is 6.

```python
from itertools import product, combinations

def has_monochromatic_3_subset(f):
    # f is a list of length n, values 0 or 1
    n = len(f)
    for s in combinations(range(n), 3):
        vals = {f[i] for i in s}
        if len(vals) == 1:
            return True
    return False

def check_n(n):
    # Enumerate all f: [0..n-1] -> {0,1}
    # Return True if all f have a monochromatic 3-subset
    for f in product([0,1], repeat=n):
        if not has_monochromatic_3_subset(f):
            return False
    return True

def main():
    print("Enumerating n and checking all functions f: Fin(n)->Fin(2)")
    for n in range(1,8):
        if check_n(n):
            print(f"All functions on n={n} have monochromatic 3-subset.")
        else:
            print(f"Counterexample exists for n={n}.")
    # From output, minimal n with no counterexample is minimal answer
    # Filter n with all functions satisfying property:
    minimal = min(n for n in range(1,8) if check_n(n))
    print(f"Minimal n = {minimal}")

    main()
