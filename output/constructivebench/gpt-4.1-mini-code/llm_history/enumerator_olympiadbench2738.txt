The problem involves finding real positive numbers x such that log x = (3 + floor((log x)^2)) / 4, with the logarithm base 10 implied by the context. The set of such x is finite. We want to find the product of all such x, expressed as 10^y, and find y.

To enumerate, note that letting t = log x, we have:
t = (3 + floor(t^2)) / 4

Let m = floor(t^2), so:
t = (3 + m)/4

We want to find integers m â‰¥ 0 such that t satisfies floor(t^2) = m.

We can try integer values of m in a feasible range (try m=0 to 10) and check if t=(3+m)/4 satisfies floor(t^2)=m.

For each valid m, x = 10^t.

We will print all such x and their logs (t), the product P and y = log_10(P) = sum of t.

```python
# Enumerate solutions to t = (3 + floor(t^2)) / 4 for t > 0
# floor(t^2)=m => t=(3+m)/4, check floor(t^2)=m integer equality

def main():
    solutions_t = []
    for m in range(0,20):
        t = (3 + m) / 4
        if int(t**2) == m:
            solutions_t.append(t)
            x = 10**t
            print(f"m={m}, t={t}, x=10^{t}={x}")

    # Compute product P = product of x = 10^{sum t}
    y = sum(solutions_t)
    from math import prod
    # product direct from logs
    P = 10**y
    print()
    print(f"Number of solutions: {len(solutions_t)}")
    print(f"Product P = 10^{y} = {P}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
