. Enumerated answers: Enumerating m and factorizations for m^2 - m + 11 with ≥4 prime factors:
m = 132, value = 17303, prime factors = [11, 11, 11, 13]
m = 253, value = 63767, prime factors = [11, 11, 17, 31]
m = 275, value = 75361, prime factors = [11, 13, 17, 31]
m = 353, value = 124267, prime factors = [11, 11, 13, 79]
m = 418, value = 174317, prime factors = [11, 13, 23, 53]
Minimum m found with ≥4 prime factors in m^2 - m + 11 is: 132. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<132>>>
