The problem concerns counting valid paths on a 2D grid and expressing the probability in lowest terms. The total number of paths is \(4^6\) and valid paths are given by the complicated combinatorial expression. We want to enumerate values for various components, compute the probability \( \frac{validPaths}{totalPaths} \) as a reduced fraction \( \frac{m}{n} \), and print all intermediate values and the reduced fraction, finally printing \(m+n\).

```python
from math import comb
from fractions import Fraction

def main():
    total_paths = 4**6
    print(f"Total paths: {total_paths}")

    # Compute each component separately to understand validPaths
    c1 = comb(6, 3)
    c2 = comb(3, 1)
    part1 = 2 * c1 * c2
    print(f"2 * choose(6,3) * choose(3,1) = {part1}")

    c3 = comb(6, 1)
    c4 = comb(5, 2)
    part2 = 2 * c3 * c4
    print(f"2 * choose(6,1) * choose(5,2) = {part2}")

    c5 = comb(6, 0)
    c6 = comb(6, 3)
    part3 = 2 * c5 * c6
    print(f"2 * choose(6,0) * choose(6,3) = {part3}")

    valid_paths = part1 + part2 + part3
    print(f"Valid paths = {valid_paths}")

    # Reduce fraction valid_paths / total_paths
    frac = Fraction(valid_paths, total_paths)
    m, n = frac.numerator, frac.denominator
    print(f"Probability = {m}/{n} in lowest terms")
    print(f"Sum m + n = {m + n}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
