theorem P2011AMCA_5 : 
  P2011AMCA_5_answer = (30 : ℚ) / (100 - 25) * 100 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 40
Proposed Answer: (2 : ℚ) / 5 * 100
Let's analyze the problem and the answers step by step.

1. The problem is asking to evaluate the expression (30 : ℚ) / (100 - 25) * 100
2. First, calculate the denominator: 100 - 25 = 75
3. So the expression becomes (30/75)*100
4. Simplify 30/75 to 2/5 (dividing numerator and denominator by 15)
5. Now we have (2/5)*100 = 40

The ground truth answer is 40, which matches our calculation.

The proposed answer is (2 : ℚ) / 5 * 100, which is exactly the simplified form of the expression that evaluates to 40.

Therefore, the proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer, just written in a different (simplified) form.
