This problem asks whether there exists a sequence of 1985 distinct natural numbers whose squares sum to a perfect cube \( y^3 \) and whose cubes sum to a perfect square \( z^2 \).

To investigate, we can test smaller sequences with distinct values, compute sum of squares and sum of cubes, and check for perfect cube and perfect square conditions respectively.

We'll try small lengths \( n \) (up to say 10), enumerate combinations of distinct natural numbers from a small range, print cases where sums-of-squares is a perfect cube and sums-of-cubes is a perfect square. This might help conjecture about existence or non-existence for the large case \( n=1985 \).

```python
import math
from itertools import combinations

def is_perfect_square(x):
    r = int(math.isqrt(x))
    return r*r == x

def is_perfect_cube(x):
    # integer cube root test
    r = int(round(x ** (1/3)))
    return r**3 == x or (r+1)**3 == x or (r-1)**3 == x

def main():
    max_n = 10 # small subsets for experimentation
    max_val = 20 # max number considered for elements

    for n in range(2, max_n+1):
        print(f"Testing sequences of length {n}")
        # Generate combinations of distinct numbers from 1 to max_val
        for combo in combinations(range(1, max_val+1), n):
            s_sq = sum(x**2 for x in combo)
            s_cb = sum(x**3 for x in combo)
            if is_perfect_cube(s_sq) and is_perfect_square(s_cb):
                print(f"Found combo: {combo}")
                print(f"Sum squares = {s_sq} (cube = {round(s_sq ** (1/3))})")
                print(f"Sum cubes = {s_cb} (square = {int(math.isqrt(s_cb))})")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
