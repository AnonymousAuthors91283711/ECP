The problem compares two very fast-growing functions involving iterations of factorials and powers of two. Our goal is to find the smallest natural number \( n \) such that:
\[
\left( \text{iterate } (x \mapsto x!) \text{ applied } 100 \text{ times to } 100! \right)! < \text{iterate } (x \mapsto 2^x) \text{ applied } n \text{ times to } 2.
\]

Since these numbers are astronomically large, the key intuition is how fast these iterated functions grow:

- Iterating factorial 100 times starting at \(100!\) leads to a huge number, call it \(F\).
- Taking the factorial of \(F\) yields an even larger number.
- The right side is \(2\) iterated with \(n\)-fold exponentiation.
  
We want to find the minimal \(n\) such that 
\[
F! < 2^{2^{\cdot^{\cdot^{2}}}} \quad \text{(with \(n\) twos).}
\]

Because even a few iterations of \(2^{x}\) grow faster than factorial on very large numbers, we can try to test for small values of \(n\) to get some sense where the inequality flips.

The program enumerates over increasing \(n\) and compares simplified approximations (using logs or simplified reasoning) since direct factorial or power tower calculations are impossible. We print candidates and try to locate the minimum \(n\).

```python
# Enumerate candidates for n to find minimal n s.t. (iterate factorial 100 times on 100!)! < iterate 2^x n times starting at 2.
# Use logarithms and exponents to estimate growth instead of exact numbers.

import math

def log_factorial(x):
    # Stirling's approximation for log(x!)
    if x < 1e6:
        # Direct sum for smaller x to get exact logs
        return sum(math.log(i) for i in range(1, int(x) + 1))
    # Stirling's formula: log(n!) ~ n log n - n + 0.5 log(2 pi n)
    return x * math.log(x) - x + 0.5 * math.log(2 * math.pi * x)

def iter_factorial(x, times):
    # Compute log of iterated factorial 'times' starting at x
    # Since factorial grows super-exponentially, we use log-factorial repeatedly.
    val = x
    for i in range(times):
        val = math.exp(log_factorial(val))  # val = factorial(val)
        # But this is huge, math.exp() likely overflow; use logs only
        # So we rewrite:
        # Instead let's keep val as log value of number after iteration
        # Initially val is log(x), so:
        # after iteration: log(factorial(val_exp)) ~ val_exp * log(val_exp) - val_exp + ...
        # We will keep val as log_val = log(val)
        # So let's represent val now as log(val)
        # On first iteration val is a number, take log
        # On next iterations, val is log_val of huge number, so factorial grows extremely
        # for simplification, after 1 iteration, val ~ log(val!)
        # But we can't do exact, so approximate logarithm of factorial of exp(val)
        # So approximate factorial of exp(val) == exp(val!', hard to do exactly)
        # To avoid complexity, let's only compute log factorial once since 100! is fixed
        
        # So due to complexity, we will do a simplified approximation:
        return None  # can't continue this deeper in finite code
    
def iter_power_of_two(n):
    # Compute 2 ^^ n (tetration base 2 n times, i.e. power tower of 2 height n)
    # Numbers grow too fast for any float, so use logarithms iteratively.
    # log2 of the value after n iterations:
    # n=1: 2, log2=1
    # n=2: 2^2=4, log2=2
    # n=3: 2^4=16, log2=4
    # n=4: 2^16=65536, log2=16
    # So 2 ^^ n has log2 equal to 2 ^^ (n-1)
    val = 1  # log2(2) = 1
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        val = 2 ** val  # val = 2^(previous log2)
    return val

    # We only can try to locate minimal n where iterated power tower beats iterated factorial factorial
    # Because direct computations impossible, we print candidates and explanations

    # Note: 100! ~ 9.3e157 (exact 158-digit number)
    # Iterating factorial once: (100!)! ~ huge
    # Iterating factorial 100 times is incomputable â€” astronomically large, with logs unimaginably large
    # So its factorial is larger than iterated factorial 100 times.

        # log(L) ~ unknown huge value, call it V
        # For approximation, treat as infinite for smaller n

    # This dwarfs factorial towers at high iterations.
