Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {(2, 1, 2)}
Since the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's intentionally left undefined in Lean), we cannot verify the correctness of the proposed answer {(2, 1, 2)} against any concrete ground truth. 

However, we can check if the proposed answer satisfies the given condition:
For (x,y,z) = (2,1,2):
3² - 5¹ = 9 - 5 = 4 = 2²
This satisfies all conditions (x>0, y>0, z>0 and the equation).

Since we don't know if there are other solutions (the ground truth is unspecified), we can't determine if this is the complete solution set. But the given solution is correct.
