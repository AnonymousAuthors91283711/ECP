[write_program]
The given mathematical problem is to find the sum of all two-digit numbers \(x\) such that \(10 \leq x \leq 99\) and \(109 \mod x = 4\).

We will write a Python program to enumerate all two-digit numbers in the range \(10\) to \(99\). For each number \(x\), we will check if the remainder when dividing 109 by \(x\) is 4. If so, we will print the value of \(x\) and also keep track of the sum to print the final sum after enumeration.

```python
def main():
    total_sum = 0
    print("Numbers x where 10 ≤ x ≤ 99 and 109 % x = 4:")
    for x in range(10, 100):
        if 109 % x == 4:
            print(x)
            total_sum += x
    print("Sum of such numbers:", total_sum)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
