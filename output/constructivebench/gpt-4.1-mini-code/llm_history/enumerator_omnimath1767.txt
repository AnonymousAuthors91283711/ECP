The problem is a classic: find the smallest number greater than 1729 expressible as the sum of two positive cubes in two distinct ways with all four numbers positive and distinct from each other accordingly.

We know 1729 = 1^3 + 12^3 = 9^3 + 10^3. We must find the smallest n > 1729 having two distinct representations as sums of two cubes, with the pairs differing in at least the 'a' term.

Our program will enumerate sums a^3 + b^3 with a,b positive and a â‰¤ b (to avoid double counting), storing sums and the pairs that produce them. We then find sums with at least two such pairs, distinct in the sense described, and print all sums > 1729 found (with their pairs). Then we print the minimal sum found.

We'll limit search up to a certain max, say 100, to keep output short and to meet tokens limit.

```python
# Enumerate sums of two positive cubes a^3 + b^3 with 1 <= a <= b <= max_a,
# store sums and pairs, then output sums >1729 with two distinct representations.
# Print all such sums found and their pairs, then print the minimum sum found.

max_a = 100
sums = dict()
limit = 1729

for a in range(1, max_a+1):
    a3 = a**3
    for b in range(a, max_a+1):
        s = a3 + b**3
        if s > limit:
            if s not in sums:
                sums[s] = []
            # Store pair (a,b)
            sums[s].append((a,b))

# Now find sums with at least two distinct pairs (a,b) and (c,d),
# where pairs are distinct in the sense that at least a != c and a != d
# (implying the pairs are different).

# Print all such sums with the pairs
candidates = []
for s, pairs in sums.items():
    if len(pairs) < 2:
        continue
    # Check if there exist two pairs that satisfy conditions
    found = False
    for i in range(len(pairs)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(pairs)):
            (a,b), (c,d) = pairs[i], pairs[j]
            if a != c and a != d and b != c and b != d:
                print(f"n = {s} = {a}^3 + {b}^3 = {c}^3 + {d}^3")
                candidates.append(s)
                found = True
                break
        if found:
            break

if candidates:
    minimum = min(candidates)
    print(f"Minimum n > 1729 with required property: {minimum}")
else:
    print("No such number found up to max_a =", max_a)
```
