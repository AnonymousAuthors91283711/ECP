The problem involves a functional equation for \( f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) positive on positive reals, satisfying
\[
f(x \cdot f(x + y)) = y \cdot f(x) + 1 \quad \forall x,y > 0.
\]
We want to explore possible \( f \) candidates numerically for small positive values to guess the form of \( f \).

We'll fix small sample values for \( x, y \), and try some function candidates to see which satisfy the relation approximately. This might help conjecture \( f \).

```python
# Enumerate and test candidate functions f: (0,∞) -> (0,∞) on small positive samples x,y
def check_equation(f, xs, ys):
    # Check if f satisfies f(x*f(x+y)) == y*f(x) + 1 approximately on samples
    for x in xs:
        for y in ys:
            lhs = f(x * f(x + y))
            rhs = y * f(x) + 1
            if abs(lhs - rhs) > 1e-8:
                return False
    return True

# Candidate functions to test
def candidate1(t):  # f(t) = 1/t, positive and decreasing
    return 1/t

def candidate2(t):  # f(t) = constant c, for c>0
    return 2

def candidate3(t):  # f(t) = 1/(t+c) try with c=1
    return 1/(t+1)

def candidate4(t):  # f(t) = a*t + b, try a=1, b>0
    return t + 1

def candidate5(t): # f(t) = k/t + m try k=1,m=0
    return 1/t

# Sample points
xs = [0.5, 1.0, 2.0]
ys = [0.1, 0.5, 1.0]

candidates = {
    "1/t": candidate1,
    "constant_2": candidate2,
    "1/(t+1)": candidate3,
    "t+1": candidate4,
}

for name, f in candidates.items():
    result = check_equation(f, xs, ys)
    print(f"Function {name} satisfies equation on sample? {result}")

# Enumerate f(x) = 1/(a*x + b) for a,b in small integers and test
from math import isclose
for a in [1, 2]:
    for b in [0, 1]:
        def f(t, a=a, b=b):  # capture parameters
            return 1/(a*t + b)
        ok = True
        for x in xs:
            for y in ys:
                lhs = f(x * f(x + y))
                rhs = y * f(x) + 1
                if not isclose(lhs, rhs, abs_tol=1e-8):
                    ok = False
                    break
            if not ok:
                break
        if ok:
            print(f"Function f(t) = 1/({a}*t + {b}) satisfies equation on sample.")
```
