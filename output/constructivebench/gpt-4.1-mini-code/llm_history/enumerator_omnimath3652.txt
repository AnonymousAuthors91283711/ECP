The problem defines a set of real-valued functions \( f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) satisfying a functional equation involving three variables \( x,y,z \):
\[
f(f(x) + f(y) + f(z)) = f(f(x) - f(y)) + f(2xy + f(z)) + 2f(xz - yz).
\]

Given its complexity, we try candidate function types (constant, linear, quadratic) for small numerical tests and print those consistent with sampled inputs.

```python
# Enumerate possible solutions to the given functional equation by testing candidate functions.
# We'll test various simple functional forms and check the equation on a grid of sample points.
# This code prints candidates immediately when satisfying test points, aiding conjecture development.

def test_f(f, samples):
    # Test f on all triples (x,y,z) in samples
    for x in samples:
        for y in samples:
            for z in samples:
                L = f(f(x)+f(y)+f(z))
                R = f(f(x)-f(y)) + f(2*x*y + f(z)) + 2*f(x*z - y*z)
                if abs(L-R) > 1e-8:
                    return False
    return True

    samples = [-1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 2.0]

    # Candidate: constant functions: f(x) = c
    for c in [-1, 0, 1]:
        f = lambda x, c=c: c
        if test_f(f, samples):
            print(f"Constant function f(x) = {c} works")

    # Candidate: linear f(x) = a*x + b, scan small integers for a,b
    for a in range(-2,3):
        for b in range(-2,3):
            f = lambda x, a=a,b=b: a*x + b
            if test_f(f, samples):
                print(f"Linear function f(x) = {a}*x + {b} works")

    # Candidate: quadratic f(x) = a*x^2 + b*x + c
    for a in range(-1,2):
