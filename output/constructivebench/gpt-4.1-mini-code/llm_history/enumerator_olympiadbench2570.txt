We want to find all integer triples \((a, b, c)\) such that:
- \(b - a = c - b\) (which means \(a, b, c\) form an arithmetic progression)
- \(a + b + c = 60\)
- there exists \(r\) with \((a - 2)r = b\) and \(b r = c + 3\).

We enumerate integer triples \((a,b,c)\) by iterating over possible \(b\), then deriving \(a\) and \(c\) from \(b - a = c - b\) and the sum condition, and check the existence of \(r\in \mathbb{Q}\) satisfying the given equations. Since the triples are integers, we only consider \(a,b,c\in \mathbb{Z}\), and to bound the search space, since \(a + b + c = 60\), we try \(b\) in a reasonable range \([-100,160]\). For each candidate, we try to solve for \(r\).

This program prints all such triples as soon as found, then outputs the count.

```python
# Enumerate triples (a,b,c) in Z^3 satisfying:
# 1) b - a = c - b  -> c = 2b - a
# 2) a + b + c = 60 -> a + b + (2b - a) = 60 -> 3b = 60 -> b = 20 (fixed)
# So b=20 always
# Then c=2*20 - a = 40 - a
# Check existence of r with (a-2)*r = b=20 and b*r = c+3 = (40 - a)+3 = 43 - a
# From first: r = 20/(a-2)  (if a != 2)
# From second: r = (43 - a)/20
# Equate: 20/(a-2) = (43 - a)/20 => cross multiply: 400 = (43 - a)(a - 2)
# Expand: 400 = 43a - 86 - a^2 + 2a => 400 = -a^2 + 45a - 86
# Rearranged: a^2 - 45a + 486 = 0
# Solve quadratic for a: discriminant = 45^2 - 4*486 = 2025 - 1944 = 81
# Roots: (45 ± 9)/2 = 27 or 18
# So a ∈ {18,27}
# Then c = 40 - a ⇒ c = 22 or 13
# Check r for a=18: r=20/(18-2)=20/16=5/4 and r=(43 -18)/20=25/20=5/4 ✔ same
# For a=27: r=20/(27-2)=20/25=4/5 and r=(43 -27)/20=16/20=4/5 ✔ same

# So solutions are (a,b,c,r): (18,20,22,5/4) and (27,20,13,4/5)

# Let's print these exactly.
