The problem involves three people mowing lawns at given rates, and asks to find the total lawns mowed after 2 hours. We can enumerate the integral lawns mowed for small time intervals and output the total lawns values with the given rates.

```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

# Rates as fractions: lawns per minute
# Dennis: 60/48 lawns/hour = 5/4 lawns/hour = 5/240 lawns/minute
# Edward: same as Dennis
# Shawn: 60/24 lawns/hour = 5/2 lawns/hour = 5/120 lawns/minute

# We'll use fractions (numerators and denominators) to avoid floating errors

from fractions import Fraction

dennis_rate = Fraction(60, 48)  # lawns per hour
edward_rate = Fraction(60, 48)
shawn_rate = Fraction(60, 24)

total_rate = dennis_rate + edward_rate + shawn_rate  # lawns per hour

hours = 2

# total lawns = total_rate * hours

total_lawns = total_rate * hours

# Print exact total lawns

print(f"Total lawns mowed in {hours} hours: {total_lawns} lawns")

# Enumerate all possible lawns mowed in increments of 15 minutes (0.25 hours) up to 2 hours

time_steps = [Fraction(i, 4) for i in range(0, 9)]  # 0, 0.25, ..., 2 hours

print("Time (hours) - Lawns mowed:")

for t in time_steps:
    lawns = total_rate * t
    if lawns.denominator == 1:
        # exact integer lawns mowed
        print(f"{float(t):.2f} hrs - {lawns.numerator} lawns (exact integer)")
    else:
        print(f"{float(t):.2f} hrs - {lawns} lawns (fraction)")

```
