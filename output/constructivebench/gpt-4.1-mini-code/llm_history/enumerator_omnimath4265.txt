The problem involves exploring natural numbers \( n \) for which there exists a polynomial \( P \) over integers such that, for all positive \( m \), the size of the image modulo \( n \) of iterating \( P \) starting at 1 equals \(\lceil n / 2^m \rceil\).

We will test small values \( n \) to enumerate possible candidates for the set `omnimath4265_answer`. For each \( n \), we'll try small degrees and simple polynomials (like linear \(P(x)=ax+b\) with small integer coefficients) to see if the condition might hold for \( m=1,2,3 \) (limiting \( m \) to keep computations feasible).

We print candidates \( n \) when a polynomial \( P \) is found matching the condition for all tested \( m \).

```python
# Enumerate n up to 20, try linear polynomials P(x)=a*x+b with small integers a,b
# Check for m=1..3 if the size of {P iterated m times starting at 1 mod n} matches ceil(n / 2^m)

def iterates(P, n, m):
    # P is a function int->int
    x = 1
    seq = set()
    for _ in range(m):
        x = P(x) % n
        seq.add(x)
    return len(seq)

def ceil_div(a,b):
    return (a + b - 1)//b

print("Testing n in 1..20, linear polynomials P(x)=a*x+b with a,b in -3..3, excluding a=0")
for n in range(1,21):
    found = False
    for a in range(-3,4):
        if a == 0:
            continue
        for b in range(-3,4):
            # Define polynomial P
            def P(x, a=a, b=b):
                return a*x + b
            ok = True
            for m in range(1,4):
                rems = set()
                x = 1
                for _ in range(m):
                    x = P(x) % n
                    rems.add(x)
                if len(rems) != ceil_div(n, 2**m):
                    ok = False
                    break
            if ok:
                print(f"n={n}, P(x)={a}*x+{b} matches for m=1..3")
                found = True
                break
        if found:
            break
