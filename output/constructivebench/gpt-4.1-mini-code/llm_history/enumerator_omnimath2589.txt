This problem involves solving a nonlinear system of three equations in three real variables \(x, y, z\) and then computing \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\). Since the problem is from a high-school level competition, solutions are likely manageable.

To assist in conjecturing the true answer, I'll enumerate potential solutions for integer or rational values of \(x, y, z\) within a small range and check which satisfy the system (or approximately satisfy it), printing their corresponding \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\).

The approach:
- Iterate over \((x,y,z)\) in a small grid (e.g. integers \(-5\) to \(5\)).
- Check the three equations exactly or up to a small tolerance for floating.
- Print every triplet that satisfies the system with \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\).
- From them, we can conjecture the true answer.

```python
# Enumerate integer candidates for (x,y,z) in a small range,
# check the nonlinear system, print x²+y²+z² for solutions.
# This helps conjecture omnimath2589_answer.

def close(a, b, eps=1e-8):
    return abs(a - b) < eps

def system(x, y, z):
    eq1 = 2*x + y + 4*x*y + 6*x*z
    eq2 = y + 2*z + 2*x*y + 6*y*z
    eq3 = x - z + 2*x*z - 4*y*z
    return eq1, eq2, eq3

def main():
    print("Enumerating candidates (x,y,z) with integer coords from -5 to 5:")
    for x in range(-5, 6):
        for y in range(-5, 6):
            for z in range(-5, 6):
                eq1, eq2, eq3 = system(x, y, z)
                if close(eq1, -6) and close(eq2, 4) and close(eq3, -3):
                    s = x*x + y*y + z*z
                    print(f"Solution found: x={x}, y={y}, z={z} => x²+y²+z²={s}")
