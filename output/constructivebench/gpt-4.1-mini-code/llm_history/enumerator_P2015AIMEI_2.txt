The problem involves a total of 9 people from three countries: Mexico (2), Canada (3), and America (4). We pick 3 sleepers, and need to find the probability that exactly two are from the same country.

The expression for the number of favorable cases involves summing the combinations "choose 2 from one nationality and choose 1 from the rest", for each nationality.

We want to enumerate the value of the probability as a simplified fraction numerator/denominator.

```python
from math import comb
from fractions import Fraction

# Parameters
total = 9
mexican = 2
canadian = 3
american = 4
sleepers = 3

# total combinations
total_combinations = comb(total, sleepers)

# function to compute favorable count for exactly two from same country
def favorable(m, c, a):
    # choose 2 from the country, 1 from rest
    return (comb(m,2)*(total - m) + comb(c,2)*(total - c) + comb(a,2)*(total - a))

favorable_count = favorable(mexican, canadian, american)
prob = Fraction(favorable_count, total_combinations)
print(f"Favorable count: {favorable_count}")
print(f"Total combinations: {total_combinations}")
print(f"Probability (fraction): {prob.numerator}/{prob.denominator}")
```
