theorem omnimath4162 (a b n p : ℕ) (hp : Nat.Prime p) :
  2^a + p^b = n^(p-1) ↔ (a, b, n, p) ∈ omnimath4162_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: {(3, 0, 3, 3)}
Proposed Answer: {(a, b, n, p) : ℕ × ℕ × ℕ × ℕ | p = 2 ∧ n = 2^a + 2^b}
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem asks for solutions to the equation 2^a + p^b = n^(p-1) where p is prime.

2. The ground truth answer provides one specific solution: (3,0,3,3) which satisfies:
   2^3 + 3^0 = 8 + 1 = 9 = 3^(3-1) = 3^2 = 9

3. The proposed answer suggests all solutions where p=2 and n=2^a+2^b. However:
   - For p=2, the equation becomes 2^a + 2^b = n^(2-1) => 2^a + 2^b = n
   - While this is algebraically correct, it's not equivalent to the ground truth
   - The proposed answer misses the (3,0,3,3) solution and includes many other solutions not in the ground truth
   - The ground truth only includes one specific solution, not a general form

The answers are not equivalent because:
1. They describe different solution sets
2. The proposed answer is more general but incorrect for this specific problem
3. The ground truth provides a concrete solution while the proposed answer gives a general form that doesn't match
