The problem describes a work-rate scenario with two time intervals and asks to find the finishing time. The code below tries candidate finishing times in minutes after the first interval and checks the condition numerically.

```python
def minutes_since_midnight(h, m):
    return h * 60 + m

def time_add(h, m, add_mins):
    total = minutes_since_midnight(h, m) + add_mins
    return total // 60, total % 60

# Given
start = (8, 30)
first_interval = (11, 10)
first_work = 1/3
total_work = 1

start_m = minutes_since_midnight(*start)
first_m = minutes_since_midnight(*first_interval)
first_time = first_m - start_m

work_rate = first_work / first_time  # work per minute in first interval
remaining_work = total_work - first_work

# We'll enumerate finishing times after 11:10 up to 4 hours (arbitrary threshold)
max_add = 4 * 60  
for add in range(1, max_add + 1):
    # time difference for second interval is add (in minutes)
    # work done during second interval = work_rate * add
    if abs(work_rate * add - remaining_work) < 1e-10:
        finish = time_add(*first_interval, add)
        print(f"Possible finishing time: {finish[0]:02d}:{finish[1]:02d}")

# Since work_rate * add = remaining_work,
# minimal add = remaining_work / work_rate
min_add = remaining_work / work_rate
finish_min = time_add(*first_interval, round(min_add))
print("\nEstimated finishing time (rounded): {}:{}".format(finish_min[0], str(finish_min[1]).zfill(2)))
```
