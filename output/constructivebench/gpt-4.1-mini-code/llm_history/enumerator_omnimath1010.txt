The problem concerns the number of triples \( (x, y, z) \) in \(\mathbb{R}^3\) satisfying a system with sign functions applied to sums of components. Since the sign depends only on whether sums are positive, zero, or negative, the sums \(y+z\), \(z+x\), and \(x+y\) take a critical role.

Because the signs involve \( y+z, z+x, x+y \) and these sums appear symmetrically in the equations for \(x,y,z\), it's natural to enumerate triplets of signs for the sums, then solve for consistent values of \(x,y,z\).

We'll try all combinations of sign outputs \(-1,0,1\) for the sums, then attempt to solve the system:
\[
\begin{cases}
x = 2018 - 2019 \cdot \text{sign}(y+z),\\
y = 2018 - 2019 \cdot \text{sign}(z+x),\\
z = 2018 - 2019 \cdot \text{sign}(x+y).
\end{cases}
\]

Because of the symmetry, and since \( \text{sign}(\alpha) \in \{-1,0,1\} \), there are only \(3^3=27\) sign patterns to check. For each pattern \((s_1, s_2, s_3)\) in \(\{-1,0,1\}^3\), set:
\[
x = 2018 - 2019 s_1,\quad y = 2018 - 2019 s_2,\quad z=2018 - 2019 s_3,
\]
then verify if the assumed signs equal the sign of the corresponding sums.

The program enumerates these cases, verifies consistency, prints each exact solution found, and finally prints the total count.

```python
# Enumerate all possible sign triples for sums y+z, z+x, x+y
# For each, solve for x,y,z and check if signs match the sums

SIGN_VALUES = [-1,0,1]

def sign(x):
    if x >0: return 1
    if x ==0: return 0
    return -1

def main():
    count = 0
    for s1 in SIGN_VALUES:
        for s2 in SIGN_VALUES:
            for s3 in SIGN_VALUES:
                x = 2018 - 2019*s1
                y = 2018 - 2019*s2
                z = 2018 - 2019*s3
                # Check consistency of signs for sums
                cond1 = (sign(y+z) == s1)
                cond2 = (sign(z+x) == s2)
                cond3 = (sign(x+y) == s3)
                if cond1 and cond2 and cond3:
                    count +=1
                    print(f"Solution #{count}: x={x}, y={y}, z={z}, signs=({s1},{s2},{s3})")
    print(f"Total number of solutions: {count}")

if __name__=="__main__":
    main()
```
