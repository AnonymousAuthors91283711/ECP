The problem involves counting functions \( f: \mathbb{Z} \to \{true, false\} \) that are periodic with period 22 and have no two adjacent `true` values spaced by 2 units. This equates to counting 22-periodic Boolean sequences with no two `true` elements at positions \( i \) and \( i+2 \) modulo 22 simultaneously.

We want to enumerate all length-22 Boolean sequences \( (b_0, \dots, b_{21}) \) with no pair \( (b_i, b_{i+2}) = (true, true) \) for any \( i \) modulo 22.

To assist conjecture, we will:
- Enumerate all length-22 Boolean sequences.
- Check the condition.
- Print each valid sequence or just a count (to keep output short).
- Print the total count at the end.

We emphasize exact counting and stream partial results (e.g., print the sequence index and sum so far).
To keep output manageable, we'll print just counts every 1000 sequences.

```python
# Enumerate 22-bit sequences with no two 'true' bits 2 apart mod 22.
# Count total such sequences.

def has_no_adjacent_true_2_apart(seq):
    n = len(seq)
    for i in range(n):
        if seq[i] and seq[(i+2)%n]:
            return False
    return True

def main():
    n = 22
    total = 0
    # There are 2^22 sequences ~4 million, feasible with pruning might take some seconds.
    # We'll enumerate integers from 0 to 2^22 -1 representing sequences
    # Print progress count every 100000 checked sequences to keep output short
    
    limit = 2**n
    report_interval = 100000
    
    for num in range(limit):
        if num % report_interval == 0:
            print(f"Checked {num} sequences, found {total} valid so far")
        # Translate to bit array
        seq = [(num >> i) & 1 == 1 for i in range(n)]
        if has_no_adjacent_true_2_apart(seq):
            total += 1
            # Print each valid found sequence in binary form (shortened print)
            print(f"Valid #{total}: {bin(num)[2:].rjust(n,'0')}")
    print(f"Total valid sequences = {total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
