[write_program]
The problem seeks a unique pair \((a,b) \in \mathbb{R}^2\) with \(a,b>0\) satisfying the system:
\[
\begin{cases}
a \cdot 3^b = 2.75 \\
a \cdot 6^b = 3.75
\end{cases}
\]

We can solve the system by elimination or substitution. For the enumeration, I'll try to numerically explore possible \(b\) values and compute \(a\), then check both equations' closeness.

```python
import math

print("Enumerating solutions (a,b) with a,b > 0 for:")
print("a * 3^b = 2.75 and a * 6^b = 3.75")

# We search for b in a reasonable positive range
# Because 3^b and 6^b grow fast, try b from 0.1 to 2 with step 0.01
# For each b, compute candidate a1 from first eq and a2 from second eq, print if close

def close(x, y, tol=1e-6):
    return abs(x - y) < tol

for b in [i * 0.01 for i in range(1, 201)]:
    a1 = 2.75 / (3 ** b)
    a2 = 3.75 / (6 ** b)
    if close(a1, a2):
        a = a1  # close enough
        print(f"a = {a:.8f}, b = {b:.8f}, check1={a * 3**b:.8f}, check2={a * 6**b:.8f}")

# Optionally print the unique solution found by solving analytically:
# From the two equations: 
# a * 3^b = 2.75 => a = 2.75 / 3^b
# a * 6^b = 3.75 => (2.75 / 3^b) * 6^b = 3.75
# => 2.75 * (6/3)^b = 3.75
# => 2.75 * 2^b = 3.75
# => 2^b = 3.75 / 2.75 = 1.36363636
# => b = log2(1.36363636) = math.log(1.36363636, 2)
b_exact = math.log(3.75 / 2.75, 2)
a_exact = 2.75 / (3 ** b_exact)
print(f"Exact solution: a = {a_exact}, b = {b_exact}")
print(f"Verification: a*3^b = {a_exact * 3**b_exact}, a*6^b = {a_exact * 6**b_exact}")
```
