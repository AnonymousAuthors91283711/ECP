This problem involves finding the least real part of a complex number \( x \) such that there exist complex numbers \( x, y \) satisfying the system

\[
\begin{cases}
    x + 2y^2 = x^4 \\
    y + 2x^2 = y^4 \\
    z = \Re(x)
\end{cases}
\]

We want to enumerate pairs \((x,y)\) (with \(x,y \in \mathbb{C}\)) that satisfy these equations and print the real parts of such \( x \) values.

Since the problem is very difficult to solve symbolically, we can try a numerical approach by enumerating \( x \) and \( y \) on a grid with small integer or rational values near the real axis, checking approximate solutions (up to some tolerance), and outputting the real parts of \( x \).

The code will:

- Iterate over a range of real and imaginary parts for \( x \) and \( y \).
- For each pair, check the system equations.
- If the residuals are small, print the real part of \( x \).

Because the output must be within 400 tokens, we limit the search range and granularity.

```python
# Enumerate candidate (x,y) ∈ ℂ² with small integer parts
# Check the system:
# x + 2*y^2 ≈ x^4
# y + 2*x^2 ≈ y^4
# Print Re(x) for approximate solutions found

def complex_eq_approx(a, b, tol=1e-3):
    return abs(a.real - b.real) < tol and abs(a.imag - b.imag) < tol

def power(c, n):
    r = 1 + 0j
    for _ in range(n):
        r *= c
    return r

def main():
    # Search range on real and imag parts for x and y
    vals = [i * 0.5 for i in range(-6,7)]  # from -3 to 3 in steps 0.5
    tol = 1e-2
    found = set()
    for xr in vals:
        for xi in vals:
            x = complex(xr, xi)
            x2 = x*x
            x4 = x2*x2
            for yr in vals:
                for yi in vals:
                    y = complex(yr, yi)
                    y2 = y*y
                    y4 = y2*y2
                    left1 = x + 2*y2
                    if abs(left1 - x4) > tol:
                        continue
                    left2 = y + 2*x2
                    if abs(left2 - y4) > tol:
                        continue
                    # Approximate solution found
                    xr_rounded = round(xr,3)
                    if xr_rounded not in found:
                        found.add(xr_rounded)
                        print(f"Possible Re(x) = {xr_rounded}")

    main()
