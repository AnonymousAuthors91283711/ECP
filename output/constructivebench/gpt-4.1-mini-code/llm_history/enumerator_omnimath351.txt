This problem involves pairs (x, y) of real numbers satisfying the constraint sin x * cos y - sin y * cos x = 1, and we look for the greatest z = sin x * cos y + sin y * cos x achievable under this constraint.

We'll enumerate samples for x and y in a small range, verify the constraint approximately, and record values of z, printing each found pair. This helps conjecture the maximum z under the given condition.

To reduce complexity, we'll test rational multiples of π in a discrete grid and filter by the constraint with a small tolerance.

```python
import math

# We'll test x,y over multiples of pi/12 in [0, 2pi]
step = math.pi / 12
tol = 1e-9

print("Enumerating (x,y,z) with sin x * cos y - sin y * cos x ≈ 1:")

max_z = None
max_points = []

for i in range(24):
    x = i * step
    sinx = math.sin(x)
    cosx = math.cos(x)
    for j in range(24):
        y = j * step
        siny = math.sin(y)
        cosy = math.cos(y)

        lhs = sinx * cosy - siny * cosx
        if abs(lhs - 1) < tol:
            z = sinx * cosy + siny * cosx
            print(f"x={x:.3f}, y={y:.3f}, z={z:.9f}")
            if max_z is None or z > max_z:
                max_z = z
                max_points = [(x, y)]
            elif abs(z - max_z) < tol:
                max_points.append((x, y))

if max_z is not None:
    print("\nMaximum z found:")
    for (x, y) in max_points:
        print(f"x={x:.3f}, y={y:.3f}, z={max_z:.9f}")
    print(f"Conjectured omnimath351_answer = {max_z:.9f}")
else:
    print("No solutions found.")
