theorem P2017AMCB_17
  (pA pB : ℝ)
  (hpA : pA = (2 / 3) ^ 3 + (1 / 3) ^ 3)
  (hpB : pB = 2 * (2 / 3) ^ 2 * (1 / 3) ^ 2) :
  pA - pB = P2017AMCB_17_answer :=
sorry
. Enumerated answers: a = 2/3, b = 1/3
pA = a^3 + b^3 = 2/3^3 + 1/3^3 = 1/3
pB = 2 * a^2 * b^2 = 2 * 2/3^2 * 1/3^2 = 8/81
Difference pA - pB = 19/81
Numerical approx = 0.234568
. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<19 / 81>>>
