[write_program]
The problem involves studying the set of natural numbers \( n \) such that the quadratic polynomial 
\[ f(n) = 2n^2 - k n + 77 \]
(where \( k = 21 + 2T \) for some natural number parameter \( T \)) is positive and prime. We want to find the greatest \( n \) with positive prime \( f(n) \).

I will write a Python program to enumerate possible \( n \) for various small \( T \), compute \( f(n) \), check primality, ensuring \( f(n) > 0 \), and print all such \( n \). This can help conjecture the maximum \( n \) and how it depends on \( T \).

Since values can grow quickly, we'll limit \( n \) for each \( T \) to a reasonable interval around \( k/(4) \) where the parabola achieves its minimum or zero crossing, as beyond that \( f(n) \) grows large but it's less likely to be prime.

```python
import math

def is_prime(m):
    if m < 2: return False
    if m in (2,3): return True
    if m % 2 == 0: return False
    r = int(math.isqrt(m))
    for d in range(3, r+1, 2):
        if m % d == 0:
            return False
    return True

def f(n, k):
    return 2 * n * n - k * n + 77

def enumerate_primes_for_T(T):
    k = 21 + 2*T
    results = []
    # f grows like 2n^2, but for primality often small values are more interesting.
    # The quadratic is positive for large n, its minimum at n = k/(4)
    approx_min = k / 4
    # We'll check n from max(0, int(approx_min)-10) to int(approx_min)+30 to find primes,
    # this range is heuristic.
    start = max(0, int(approx_min) - 10)
    end = int(approx_min) + 30
    for n in range(start, end + 1):
        val = f(n, k)
        if val > 0 and is_prime(val):
            print(f"T={T}, n={n}, f(n)={val} prime")
            results.append(n)
    if results:
        max_n = max(results)
        print(f"Maximum n for T={T} is {max_n}")
    else:
        print(f"No n with prime f(n)>0 found for T={T}")

def main():
    # Test for small sample values of T
    for T in range(5):  # small values 0..4 to keep output small
        enumerate_primes_for_T(T)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
