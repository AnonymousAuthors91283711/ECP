Ground Truth Answer: 7 * 2023
Proposed Answer: 119^2
Let's analyze this carefully:

1. The problem asks for the smallest positive natural number n that is both a perfect square (n = k²) and divisible by 2023.

2. First, factorize 2023: 2023 = 7 × 17 × 17

3. For n to be a perfect square divisible by 2023, it must include all prime factors of 2023 with even exponents. Currently we have:
   - 7¹ (needs another 7)
   - 17² (already good)

4. The smallest such number would be 7² × 17² = (7 × 17)² = 119² = 14161

5. The ground truth answer is 7 × 2023 = 14161
6. The proposed answer is 119² = 14161

Both answers evaluate to the same number (14161), just expressed differently. The proposed answer is mathematically equivalent to the ground truth answer.
