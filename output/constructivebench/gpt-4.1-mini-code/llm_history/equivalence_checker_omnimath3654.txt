Ground Truth Answer: fun n => n * (n + 1) / 2
Proposed Answer: fun n => n * n + (n - 1) * (n - 1)
Let me analyze the two answers:

1. Ground truth: n*(n+1)/2 = (n² + n)/2
2. Proposed: n*n + (n-1)*(n-1) = n² + n² - 2n + 1 = 2n² - 2n + 1

Let's test with small values of n:
- For n=1:
  - Ground truth: 1*2/2 = 1
  - Proposed: 1 + 0 = 1
- For n=2:
  - Ground truth: 2*3/2 = 3
  - Proposed: 4 + 1 = 5
- For n=3:
  - Ground truth: 3*4/2 = 6
  - Proposed: 9 + 4 = 13

The answers only match when n=1 but diverge for n>1. The proposed answer grows quadratically but with a different coefficient and offset than the ground truth.
