theorem olympiadbench2257 (i j : ℕ) (hi : i ≥ 1) (hj : j ≥ 1) :
  olympiadbench2257_answer (i, j) = 4 + 3 * (i - 1) + (3 + 4 * (i - 1)) * (j - 1) := by sorry

-- Example usage for 50th row and 40th column:
example : olympiadbench2257_answer (50, 40) = 4090 := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun (i, j) => 4 + 3 * (i - 1) + (3 + 4 * (i - 1)) * (j - 1)
Proposed Answer: fun p : ℕ × ℕ => 4 + 3 * (p.1 - 1) + (3 + 4 * (p.1 - 1)) * (p.2 - 1)
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. Both answers define a function that takes a pair of natural numbers (i, j) and returns the value 4 + 3*(i-1) + (3 + 4*(i-1))*(j-1). The only difference is in syntax: the ground truth answer uses pattern matching directly on (i, j) while the proposed answer uses p.1 and p.2 to access the components of the pair. The mathematical expressions are identical.
