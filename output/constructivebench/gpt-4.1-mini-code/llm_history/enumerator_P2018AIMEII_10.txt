The problem asks for counting functions \( f: \{0,1,2,3,4\} \to \{0,1,2,3,4\} \) such that for every \( x \), 
\[
f(f(x)) = f(f(f(x))).
\]
We interpret \( f \) over a 5-element set (indexed 0 to 4).

In Python, we can enumerate all functions from a 5-element set to itself (there are \(5^5=3125\) total) and check this condition for each. The program prints all functions that satisfy the condition as tuples, and finally prints their count.

```python
# Enumerate functions f: {0..4} -> {0..4} satisfying f(f(x)) = f(f(f(x))) for all x

def main():
    n = 5
    count = 0
    # Represent f as tuple of length n, where f[i] = f(i)
    for f in range(5**n):
        # Decode function f from integer to base-5 digits
        func = []
        x = f
        for _ in range(n):
            func.append(x % 5)
            x //= 5
        # func[i] = f(i) as int
        # Check condition for all x: f(f(x)) == f(f(f(x)))
        # Precompute f(f(x)) and f(f(f(x)))
        ff = [func[func[i]] for i in range(n)]
        fff = [func[func[func[i]]] for i in range(n)]
        if all(ff[i] == fff[i] for i in range(n)):
            print(tuple(func))
            count += 1
    print("Total count:", count)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
