The problem is about a function \( P: \mathbb{Z}/268\mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z} \) satisfying certain sum constraints on consecutive blocks of length 20 and some fixed values at three points. We want to find \( P(210) \).

We can attempt to enumerate all candidate integer functions \(P\) satisfying the given conditions on a small sample (e.g., mod 268), but since this is huge (268 elements, many constraints), we will try a simplified approach:
- Since P is on mod 268, sum over each block of length 20 is 75.
- We know values at indices 17, 83, 144.
- We'll attempt to solve the system by walking over the indices and deducing values from overlapping equations.
- We print candidate values for P[210] when found.

Given the complexity, let's do a constraint propagation approach:
- The sums impose linear equations on consecutive blocks.
- The system looks like a cyclic convolution-type system with a window sum constraint.

We can use the difference of sums to find relations between consecutive P[i]:
- Since sum_{j=i}^{i+19} P[j] = 75 for all i,
- sum_{j=i+1}^{i+20} P[j] = 75,
- subtracting these gives P[i] = P[i+20].

Thus P is periodic with period dividing 20.

But since 20 does not divide 268, and the indexing is modulo 268, more careful analysis is needed.

So P(i) satisfies P[i] = P[i+20 (mod 268)] for all i.

Therefore P is periodic with period equal to the gcd of 20 and 268 = 4.

So P[i] = P[i+4].

Thus the function is 4-periodic.

We can check this periodicity constraint:

- P[17] =3,
- P[17+4] = P[21] =3,
- P[83] =4,
- P[83 + 4]= P[87]=4,
- etc.

Let's enumerate P[0], P[1], P[2], P[3], which define the entire function.

Then sum over 20 terms starting at i is sum over P[(i + j)%4], with each period repeating 5 times (since 20/4=5).

Sum over P[(i + j) mod 4], j=0..19 = 5 * sum P[(i mod 4) to ...], but since the 4 repeats every 4 steps.

The sum over one block is 5 times sum of P over indices in 4 steps, which must be 75.

Therefore, 5 * (P_0 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3) = 75 → (P_0 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3) = 15.

We can then enumerate all integer quadruples with sum 15, consistent with known values.

Known values at indices 17, 83, 144:

- 17 mod 4 = 1 → P_1 = 3,
- 83 mod 4 = 3 → P_3 = 4,
- 144 mod 4 = 0 → P_0 = 9.

Sum is P_0 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3 = 9 + 3 + P_2 + 4 = 16 + P_2 = 15 → P_2 = -1.

Hence P_2 = -1.

Now P is fully determined:

P_0=9, P_1=3, P_2=-1, P_3=4.

We want P[210]:

210 mod 4 = 2 → P_2 = -1.

We should write a program reflecting this deduction and enumerating correspondingly, printing the quadruple sums and P[210].

```python
# The function P satisfies:
# - sum over any 20 consecutive values = 75
# - indices mod 268
# From sum constraints:
# P[i] = P[i+20 mod 268],
# so P is periodic with period dividing gcd(20,268)=4.

# So define P_0, P_1, P_2, P_3 integers with:
# 5*(P_0 + P_1 + P_2 + P_3) =75 → sum=15
# Given P[17]=3 → 17 mod 4=1 → P_1=3
# Given P[83]=4 → 83 mod 4=3 → P_3=4
# Given P[144]=9 → 144 mod 4=0 → P_0=9
# Then sum: 9 + 3 + P_2 + 4 = 16 + P_2 = 15 ⇒ P_2=-1

# We print the candidate quadruple and the value P[210]=P_2 = -1

def main():
    P0 = 9
    P1 = 3
    P3 = 4
    sum_target = 15

    # P2 = sum_target - P0 - P1 - P3
    P2 = sum_target - P0 - P1 - P3

    print(f"P_0 = {P0}")
    print(f"P_1 = {P1}")
    print(f"P_2 = {P2}")
    print(f"P_3 = {P3}")
    print("---")
    i = 210 % 4
    Pi = [P0, P1, P2, P3][i]
    print(f"P(210) = P_{i} = {Pi}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
