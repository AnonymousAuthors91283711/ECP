The problem describes a set \( S \subseteq \mathbb{R} \) such that:
- \(1 \in S\), and
- for any \(x, y \in S\) with \(x > y\), \(\sqrt{x^2 - y^2} \in S\).

We want to understand the structure of all such sets \(S\).

A good way to explore this is to attempt enumerations starting from \(\{1\}\), generate values by applying the rule, and see what elements appear. If the set is closed under this operation, it may generate recognizable sequences or structures.

We will:
- start with \(S = \{1\}\),
- repeatedly add \(\sqrt{x^2 - y^2}\) for all \(x,y \in S\), \(x>y\), until no new elements appear (up to some floating-point tolerance),
- print all new elements as they are discovered,
- observe the generated numbers.

If we suspect the set forms something specific, printing the values will help conjecture and ultimately prove the structure.

```python
# enumerator.py
import math

def close_enough(a, b, eps=1e-12):
    return abs(a - b) < eps

def main():
    S = {1.0}
    frontier = {1.0}  # newly added in last iteration
    print("Starting set S = {1}")
    iteration = 0
    while frontier:
        iteration += 1
        new_frontier = set()
        S_list = sorted(S)
        for x in S_list:
            for y in S_list:
                if x > y:
                    val = math.sqrt(x**2 - y**2)
                    # check if val already in S (within tolerance)
                    if not any(close_enough(val, s) for s in S):
                        # add new value
                        new_frontier.add(val)
        if not new_frontier:
            break
        print(f"Iteration {iteration}: found {len(new_frontier)} new values")
        for v in sorted(new_frontier):
            print(f"{v:.12f}")
        S.update(new_frontier)
        frontier = new_frontier

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
