The problem seeks triples of positive integers \( (a, b, c) \) with \( a + b + c = 10 \) satisfying:
\[
a b c + 9 = a b + b c + c a.
\]

We want to enumerate all such triples and count their number.

```python
# Enumerate triples (a,b,c) of positive integers with sum 10 satisfying:
# a*b*c + 9 = ab + bc + ca

def valid_triples():
    for a in range(1, 9):       # a > 0, max 8 because b,c >0 and sum 10
        for b in range(1, 10 - a):
            c = 10 - a - b
            if c <= 0:
                continue
            lhs = a * b * c + 9
            rhs = a * b + b * c + c * a
            if lhs == rhs:
                print(f"Found triple (a,b,c) = ({a},{b},{c})")
                yield (a, b, c)

triples = list(valid_triples())
print(f"Number of triples found: {len(triples)}")
```
