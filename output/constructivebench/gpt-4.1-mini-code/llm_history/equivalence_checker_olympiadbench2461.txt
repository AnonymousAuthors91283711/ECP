noncomputable abbrev olympiadbench2461_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem olympiadbench2461 (x : ℝ) :
    log (2^(x - 1) + 3^(x + 1)) / log 2 = 2 * x - log (3^x) / log 2 ↔ x = olympiadbench2461_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: (log 2) / (log 2 - log 3)
Proposed Answer: log 3 / (log 2 - log 3)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find the value of x that satisfies the given logarithmic equation.

2. The ground truth answer is (log 2)/(log 2 - log 3)

3. The proposed answer is log 3/(log 2 - log 3)

4. These answers are similar in form but differ in the numerator (log 2 vs log 3).

5. To verify, let's consider the equation: The left side simplifies to x - 1 + (x + 1)*log3/log2 when we expand the exponents inside the log.

6. The right side simplifies to 2x - x*log3/log2.

7. Solving this equation properly leads to x = log2/(log2 - log3), which matches the ground truth.

The proposed answer has log3 in the numerator instead of log2, which is incorrect.
