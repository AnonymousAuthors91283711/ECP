The formal statement corresponds to finding a natural number `omnimath2905_answer` such that

2 * 2 * 3 * 3 * 5 * 6 = 5 * 6 * omnimath2905_answer²,

or equivalently,

(2*2*3*3*5*6) / (5*6) = omnimath2905_answer².

Simplifying,

(4 * 9 * 5 * 6) / (5 * 6) = (4 * 9) = 36 = omnimath2905_answer²,

so omnimath2905_answer = 6.

To assist in conjecturing this, the program will enumerate natural numbers n and check if n² equals the left term divided by (5 * 6), printing exact matches immediately.

```python
# Enumerate natural numbers n and check if n^2 equals (2*2*3*3*5*6)/(5*6) = 36
def main():
    numerator = 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 * 5 * 6
    denominator = 5 * 6
    target = numerator // denominator  # Use integer division as all are integers

    print(f"Numerator = {numerator}, Denominator = {denominator}, Target = {target} (target should be perfect square)")

    # We search for n such that n^2 = target
    # We'll check n from 1 to target (or a bit beyond)
    for n in range(1, target + 1):
        sq = n * n
        if sq == target:
            print(f"Found n: {n}, n^2 = {sq}")
        elif sq > target:
            break  # no further needed

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
