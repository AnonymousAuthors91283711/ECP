The problem involves a function \(a(n,k)\) defined on integers, with some boundary conditions and a recurrence inside the interval \(1 \le k \le n-1\). Specifically:

- \(a(n,0) = 1\),
- \(a(n,n) = 1\),
- for \(1 \le k \le n-1\): \(a(n,k) = a(n-1,k) - a(n-1,k-1)\).

We want to determine \(\sum_{k=0}^n a(n,k)\) for \(n=2018\).

To explore this combinational recurrence, we can enumerate the values of \(a(n,k)\) for small \(n\), sum them, and observe patterns.

Notice this pattern resembles binomial coefficients with alternating signs or a difference operator applied. Let's enumerate values for small \(n\) from 0 up to 10, print the \(a(n,k)\) rows and the sums, and try to conjecture the answer for \(n=2018\).

```python
# Enumerate values of a(n,k) as per the recurrence and sum them for small n
def compute_row(n):
    a = [0]*(n+1)
    a[0] = 1  # boundary condition a(n,0) =1
    a[-1] = 1 # boundary condition a(n,n) =1
    # For n=0, a has just one element =1
    if n == 0:
        return a
    # Compute inner values by recurrence:
    # a(n,k) = a(n-1,k) - a(n-1,k-1), for 1 <= k <= n-1
    prev = compute_row(n-1)
    for k in range(1,n):
        a[k] = prev[k] - prev[k-1]
    return a

def main():
    print("Enumerating sums of a(n,k) for n=0..10")
    for n in range(11):
        row = compute_row(n)
        s = sum(row)
        print(f"n={n}, row={row}, sum={s}")

    # Check sum pattern for sample n
    # Next test for n=2018 by approximate pattern
    # If pattern suggests sum=1 for all n, print
    # Otherwise, print candidates below threshold (like n<=10)

main()
```

This code will print complete rows and sums for small n and help us conjecture the value for large n=2018.
