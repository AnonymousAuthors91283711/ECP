The problem involves finding the greatest natural number \( m \) such that there exists an injective order-preserving sequence \( P \) of length \( m+2 \) in \(\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}\) with strictly increasing first and second coordinates, and distinctness conditions on coordinates. The constraints resemble finding the longest chain of points in the plane with increasing coordinates and no repeated first or second components.

To assist with conjecturing the maximum possible \( m \) for small \( n \), the Python program below enumerates all possible sequences \( P : \{0, \ldots, m+1\} \to \{0, \ldots, n-1\} \times \{0, \ldots, n-1\} \) that satisfy:
- distinctness of points,
- strictly increasing first components,
- strictly increasing second components,
- no duplicate first or second coordinates among points.

Since \( m+2 \) points with such constraints correspond to strictly increasing sequences in both coordinates of length \( m+2 \), and the available coordinates range from 0 to \( n-1 \), the program prints all valid sequence lengths \( m \) found, for sample values \( n=2,3,4 \).

```python
# Enumerate sequences P: {0,..,m+1} -> N x N with:
# - P injective
# - first and second coords strictly increasing
# - distinct first coords
# - distinct second coords
# Goal: find max m with sequence length m+2
