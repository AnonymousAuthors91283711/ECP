We have a geometric progression: terms \(a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, ar^4\) with product \(a \cdot ar \cdot ar^2 \cdot ar^3 \cdot ar^4 = 32\), and the fourth term is \(a r^3 = 17\).

From the product, \((a)^5 (r^{0+1+2+3+4}) = a^5 r^{10} = 32\).
We know \(a r^3 = 17\).

We want to find \(a r\).

By substituting \(a = \frac{17}{r^3}\):
\[
a^5 r^{10} = \left(\frac{17}{r^3}\right)^5 r^{10} = 17^5 r^{-15} r^{10} = 17^5 r^{-5} = 32.
\]

So, \(r^5 = \frac{17^5}{32}\).

Thus,
\[
a r = \frac{17}{r^3} \cdot r = 17 r^{-2} = 17 \left(\frac{1}{r^2}\right).
\]

Using \(r^5\), \(r = \left(\frac{17^5}{32}\right)^{1/5} = \frac{17}{2^{32/5 \text{th root}}}\), but we want to explore numerically to conjecture the exact value or simplified expression for \(a r\).

Below is a Python program enumerating \(r\) as the real positive 5th root of \(17^5 / 32\), then calculates \(a r\), \(a\), and verifies the given conditions. We also print the intermediate values and potential expressions for \(a r\).

```python
# Enumerate values for r based on r^5 = 17^5 / 32, compute corresponding a,r and check conditions.

def fifth_root(x):
    # compute real positive fifth root
    return x ** (1 / 5)

def main():
    from math import isclose

    # Given values
    product = 32
    fourth_term = 17

    # Compute r^5
    numerator = 17 ** 5
    denominator = 32
    r_5 = numerator / denominator

    # Compute r as positive fifth root
    r = fifth_root(r_5)

    # Compute a from a r^3 = 17 => a = 17 / r^3
    a = fourth_term / (r ** 3)

    # Compute a r
    a_r = a * r

    # Print data
    print(f"Computed r^5 = {r_5}")
    print(f"Computed r = {r}")
    print(f"Computed a = {a}")
    print(f"Computed a*r = {a_r}")

    # Check product of terms: a * a r * a r^2 * a r^3 * a r^4 = a^5 * r^{10}
    lhs = a ** 5 * r ** 10
    print(f"Check product a^5 * r^{10} = {lhs}, expected 32")

    # Check fourth term: a r^3
    fourth = a * r ** 3
    print(f"Check fourth term a*r^3 = {fourth}, expected 17")

    # Show exact symbolic expressions as rational powers
    print(f"Exact expressions:")
    print(f"r = (17^5 / 32)^(1/5) = 17 / 2^{(5/5)} = 17 / 2^{1} = 17/2 ??? (check)")
    # Actually 2^{(10/5)} = 2^{2} since r^5 = 17^5 / 32 = (17/2^{32/5})^5? We clarify by logs below.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The above code helps verify values and relations numerically to assist proving or conjecturing the explicit value of \(a r\).
