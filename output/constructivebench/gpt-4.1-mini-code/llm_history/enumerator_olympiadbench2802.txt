The problem is about the measure (area) of a set S defined by two inequalities involving x and y. We want to find the volume (area) of 
S = { (x,y) ∈ ℝ² | x² + y² ≥ T and |x| + |y| ≤ √(2T) }
with T=256.

This is the region inside the diamond |x| + |y| ≤ √(2T), but outside the circle x² + y² = T. 

We will enumerate points (x,y) on a grid inside the diamond and check if x² + y² ≥ T, then calculate the approximate area by counting lattice points. Since T=256, √(2T) = √512 ~ 22.627. We'll iterate integer x,y in [-22,22]. We'll approximate the area by counting lattice points times 1 (unit squares), which approximates area with an error. We print these points to conjecture the shape and area.

```python
import math

T = 256
R = math.sqrt(2 * T)  # ~22.627

count = 0
points = []
print(f"Parameters: T={T}, R={R:.3f}")

# We'll use a fine grid to approximate area but print some partial sums.
# Since area is continuous, approximations help conjecture exact answer.

step = 0.1
area_estimate = 0.0
# We'll do a discrete sum over points in the bounding box of the diamond.
# Only keep points in diamond and outside circle.

# For efficiency count points and print partial sums after each 50,000 points approx.
x_vals = [round(-R + i * step, 2) for i in range(int((2*R)/step)+1)]

points_checked = 0
for x in x_vals:
    for y in x_vals:
        if abs(x) + abs(y) <= R:
            if x*x + y*y >= T:
                area_estimate += step*step
        points_checked += 1
        # Print intermediate results occasionally
        if points_checked % 50000 == 0:
            print(f"Checked {points_checked} points, approx area={area_estimate:.2f}")

print(f"Approximate area (T={T}): {area_estimate:.2f}")
```

This program prints partial results and area estimate for the set. It helps conjecture the shape measure. From this, one can suspect the area equals the diamond's area minus the circle's area inside the diamond. The diamond area is 2*R^2, circle area π*T, so approximate answer ~ 2*512 - π*256. This program does not state the exact formula, only enumerates approximation+parameters.
