The problem involves permutations of the set {65, 66, 67, 68, 69} and counting how many permutations have no two adjacent elements such that the difference is Â±1. The task is to enumerate all permutations of these 5 numbers and print those that satisfy the given adjacency condition, then count them.

We'll generate all permutations of [65,66,67,68,69], filter according to the rule, print each valid permutation, and then print the total count.

```python
from itertools import permutations

nums = [65, 66, 67, 68, 69]
count = 0

print("Parameters: nums =", nums)
print("Permutations without adjacent heights differing by 1:")

for p in permutations(nums):
    # Check the adjacency condition: no adjacent pair differ by exactly 1
    if all(abs(p[i] - p[i + 1]) != 1 for i in range(len(p) - 1)):
        count += 1
        print(p)

print("Total count =", count)
```
