Ground Truth Answer: fun (a, b, c, d, e) => c
Proposed Answer: fun t => t.2.2.1
Let's analyze the problem and answers:

1. The problem asks for a function that returns the greatest value among {a, b, c, d, e} given certain constraints.

2. From the constraints:
   - h1: b + d > a + d ⇒ b > a
   - h2: c + e > b + e ⇒ c > b
   - h3: b + d = c
   - h4: a + c = b + e

3. From h3 and h1, we know c = b + d > a + d ⇒ c > a (since b > a)
4. From h2, we know c > b
5. The relationships between c and d/e aren't directly comparable from given constraints

The ground truth answer claims c is always the greatest. The proposed answer `fun t => t.2.2.1` is accessing the third element of the tuple (which is c), since:
- t.1 = a
- t.2.1 = b
- t.2.2.1 = c
- t.2.2.2.1 = d
- t.2.2.2.2 = e

Both answers return c, so they are equivalent.
