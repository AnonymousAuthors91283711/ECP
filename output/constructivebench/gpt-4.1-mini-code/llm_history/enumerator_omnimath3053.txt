The problem appears to seek real values \( g \) satisfying \( g^2 - 6^2 = 45 \), i.e., \( g^2 - 36 = 45 \) or \( g^2 = 81 \). Since \( g > 0 \), the solution is \( g = 9 \).

Below is a Python program enumerating possible integer and rational values \( g \) satisfying the equation for \( g > 0 \), printing exact values immediately.

```python
# Enumerate positive real g where g^2 - 6^2 = 45, i.e. g^2 = 81.
# Check integers and rational candidates with denominator up to 10 for demonstration.

from fractions import Fraction

def check_g(g):
    lhs = g**2 - 6**2
    if lhs == 45:
        print(f"g = {g}")

print("Checking integers g > 0 (1 to 20)...")
for g_int in range(1, 21):
    check_g(g_int)

print("\nChecking rational g = n/d with n,d <= 20 and g > 0...")
for d in range(1, 21):
    for n in range(1, 21 * d):
        g = Fraction(n, d)
        if g > 0:
            if (g**2 - 36) == 45:
                print(f"g = {g} (exact)")

print("\nExtremal positive solution satisfying g^2 - 36 = 45 is g = 9")
```
