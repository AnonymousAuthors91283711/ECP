Ground Truth Answer: 50
Proposed Answer: 0
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem describes a scenario with two people (Amrita and Zhang) using a kayak with different speeds for paddling and swimming. We need to find the kayak's idle time in minutes.

2. The ground truth answer is 50 (minutes), which suggests the kayak has significant idle time.

3. The proposed answer is 0, meaning the kayak has no idle time at all.

4. From the problem setup:
   - The equations must balance the distances covered by both people
   - The kayak idle time is calculated as total_time - (t₁ + (total_time - t₂))
   - For idle time to be 0, we'd need t₁ = t₂, but the speed constraints make this impossible (since paddle speed ≠ swim speed)

5. The proposed answer of 0 contradicts the ground truth and doesn't satisfy the problem's constraints. The correct idle time should be positive.
