Ground Truth Answer: (7 + 2 * sqrt 7) / 2
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the maximum value of w = x*y*z given three nonlinear equations involving x, y, z.

2. The ground truth answer is (7 + 2 * sqrt 7)/2 ≈ 5.64575 (when calculated numerically)

3. The proposed answer is 4, which is significantly smaller than the ground truth answer.

4. For this to be equivalent, we'd need (7 + 2 * sqrt 7)/2 = 4, but:
   - 7 + 2 * sqrt 7 ≈ 7 + 5.2915 ≈ 12.2915
   - 12.2915/2 ≈ 6.14575 ≠ 4

Since the proposed answer (4) is clearly different from and smaller than the ground truth answer (≈5.64575), they are not equivalent.
