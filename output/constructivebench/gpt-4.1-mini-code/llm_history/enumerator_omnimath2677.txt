The problem appears to want to evaluate the expression \(\frac{3 + 6}{3 \times 6}\) as a rational number. We will enumerate and print the result exactly and as a float.

```python
# Enumerate and print the exact rational value and its decimal approximation
from fractions import Fraction

def enumerate_expression():
    numerator = 3 + 6
    denominator = 3 * 6
    result = Fraction(numerator, denominator)
    print(f'Exact rational result: {result}')        # Print as fraction
    print(f'Decimal approximation: {float(result)}')# Print decimal approx

if __name__ == '__main__':
    enumerate_expression()
```
