abbrev olympiadbench2568_answer : Set ℝ := sorry
theorem olympiadbench2568 (k : ℝ) (hk : k ≠ 0) :
    (∃ x, k * x^2 + (5 * k + 3) * x + (6 * k + 5) = 0 ∧
        2 * k * x + (5 * k + 3) = 0) ↔ k ∈ olympiadbench2568_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing k values (fractions) for which x is root and critical point:
k = -9, x = -7/3
k = -1, x = -1
k = -9, x = -7/3
k = -1, x = -1
k = -1, x = -1
k = -1, x = -1
k = -1, x = -1
k = -1, x = -1
k = -1, x = -1
k = -1, x = -1
k = -1, x = -1
k = -1, x = -1

Candidates for k are fractions as above, possibly infinitely many.. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
<<<{k | k = -1 ∨ k = -9}>>>
