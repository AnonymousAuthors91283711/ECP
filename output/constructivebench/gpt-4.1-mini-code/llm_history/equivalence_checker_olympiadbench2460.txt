Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: {(1, 1006), (3, 331), (11, 31)}
<<<None>>>
Since the ground truth answer is marked as "sorry" (meaning it's intentionally left undefined in Lean), we cannot verify whether the proposed answer {(1, 1006), (3, 331), (11, 31)} is equivalent to the actual solution set. The proposed answer appears to contain plausible solutions to the equation a³ + 2ab = 2013 with a, b > 0, but without knowing the complete solution set, we cannot determine equivalence.
