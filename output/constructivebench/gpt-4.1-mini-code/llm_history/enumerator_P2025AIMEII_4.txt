The problem suggests finding positive coprime integers \(m, n\) such that the product \(\prod_{k=0}^9 (2^{2^k} + 1) = \frac{m}{n}\) and then finding \(m + n\). Presumably, the product is an integer (since each term is an integer), so we expect \(n = 1\). Let's enumerate the product values explicitly to confirm this and compute the sum \(m+n\).

```python
# Enumerate the product of (2^(2^k) + 1) for k=0 to 9 and print partial results.
# At the end, print m, n, and m+n. Since terms are integers, n=1.

def main():
    import math

    product = 1
    for k in range(10):
        term = 2 ** (2 ** k) + 1
        product *= term
        print(f"k={k}, term={term}, partial_product={product}")

    m = product
    n = 1
    print(f"\nFinal values:")
    print(f"m = {m}")
    print(f"n = {n}")
    print(f"m + n = {m + n}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
