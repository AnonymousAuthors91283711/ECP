[write_program]
The problem asks whether there exist odd arithmetic progressions of length 8 with odd first term and difference, such that applying the bit-reversal operation `r` to each term also produces an odd arithmetic progression with odd first term and difference. I'll write a Python program to enumerate candidate sequences with odd `a` and `d` values within a small range, then check the conditions. This helps conjecture if such sequences exist or not.

```python
def r(n):
    # Reverse bits in binary representation of n
    bits = bin(n)[2:]
    rev_bits = bits[::-1]
    return int(rev_bits, 2)

def is_odd(x):
    return x % 2 == 1

def check_seq(a, d):
    # seq(i) = a + (i-1)*d for i=1..8
    seq = [a + (i-1)*d for i in range(1,9)]
    if not all(is_odd(x) for x in seq):
        return False
    # Now check r(seq(i)) form arithmetic progression with odd b,k
    rseq = [r(x) for x in seq]
    if any(not is_odd(x) for x in rseq):
        return False
    diffs = [rseq[i+1]-rseq[i] for i in range(7)]
    if len(set(diffs)) != 1:
        return False
    b = rseq[0]
    k = diffs[0]
    if b <= 0 or k <= 0:
        return False
    if not is_odd(b) or not is_odd(k):
        return False
    # Output the found sequence parameters and its r-sequence
    print(f"a={a}, d={d}, seq={seq}, rseq={rseq}, b={b}, k={k}")
    return True

def main():
    # Try small odd a,d values up to 49
    found_any = False
    for a in range(1, 50, 2):
        for d in range(1, 50, 2):
            if d == 0:
                continue
            if check_seq(a, d):
                found_any = True
    if not found_any:
        print("No such sequences found with a,d up to 49.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
