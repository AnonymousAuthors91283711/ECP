Ground Truth Answer: {(4, 4, 4), (-4, -4, -4)}
Proposed Answer: {(a, b, c) | (a = 4 ∧ b = 4 ∧ c = 4) ∨ (a = -4 ∧ b = -4 ∧ c = -4)}
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. Both specify exactly the same two points in ℝ³: (4,4,4) and (-4,-4,-4). The proposed answer uses set builder notation with explicit conditions, while the ground truth uses explicit enumeration, but they describe identical solution sets.
