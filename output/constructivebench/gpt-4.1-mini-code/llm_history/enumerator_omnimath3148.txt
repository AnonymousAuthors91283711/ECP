The problem seems to involve constructing a sequence (indexed by natural numbers) taking values in real numbers, for which the sequence tends to zero. Since the formal statement does not specify the exact formula, let's explore sequences tending to zero with different decay rates (e.g., geometric, harmonic, factorial reciprocals). The code will print values of these sample sequences for small n, demonstrating convergence to zero.

```python
# Enumerate candidate sequences tending to zero.
# For n from 1 to 20, print several sequences:
# 1/n (harmonic)
# 1/n^2 (p-series with p=2)
# (1/2)^n (geometric decay)
# 1/factorial(n) (super-exponential decay)

from math import factorial

N = 20
print("n, 1/n, 1/n^2, (1/2)^n, 1/factorial(n)")
for n in range(1, N+1):
    v1 = 1/n
    v2 = 1/(n**2)
    v3 = 0.5**n
    v4 = 1/factorial(n)
    print(f"{n}, {v1:.6g}, {v2:.6g}, {v3:.6g}, {v4:.6g}")
```
