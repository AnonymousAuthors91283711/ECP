The problem appears to be to evaluate the expression \(2^3 - 2 + 3\) and conjecture about the answer. We'll enumerate the value by computing the expression directly and printing intermediate values.

```python
# Enumerate the calculation of 2^3 - 2 + 3 step-by-step
def enumerate_expression():
    base = 2
    exp = 3
    part1 = base ** exp
    print(f"2^{exp} = {part1}")
    
    part2 = part1 - 2
    print(f"2^{exp} - 2 = {part2}")
    
    result = part2 + 3
    print(f"2^{exp} - 2 + 3 = {result}")

enumerate_expression()
```
