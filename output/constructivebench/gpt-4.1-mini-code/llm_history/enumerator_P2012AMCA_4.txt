The problem involves integers \(b, r\) with \(b+r > 0\) and conditions \(b = \frac{3}{5}(b+r)\), \(r = (b+r) - b\). Then a new situation with \(newb = b\), \(newr = 2r\), and \(newtotal = newb + newr\) is considered, to find the ratio \(\frac{newr}{newtotal}\).

The code below enumerates integer values \(b, r\) that satisfy the conditions for total \(b+r\) up to 20, prints exact fractions for \(\frac{newr}{newtotal}\), and gives a conjecture about the answer.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Enumerate totals up to 20 for tractability
max_total = 20

print("Considering totals (b+r) from 1 to", max_total)
seen = set()
for total in range(1, max_total + 1):
    # b should be exactly 3/5 of total, so total*3 must be divisible by 5
    if (3 * total) % 5 != 0:
        continue
    b = (3 * total) // 5
    r = total - b
    if b < 0 or r < 0 or b + r == 0:
        continue
    newb = b
    newr = 2 * r
    newtotal = newb + newr
    ratio = Fraction(newr, newtotal)
    if ratio not in seen:
        print(f"b={b}, r={r}, total={total} => ratio(newr/newtotal) = {ratio} ≈ {float(ratio):.4f}")
        seen.add(ratio)
print("Conjectured ratio (newr/newtotal): 4/7 ≈ 0.5714")
```
