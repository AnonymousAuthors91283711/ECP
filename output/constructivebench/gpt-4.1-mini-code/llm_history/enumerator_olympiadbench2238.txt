The problem asks to find all integers x such that (x² - 3)(x² + 5) < 0. Since x² + 5 is always positive (for all integers x), the inequality reduces to x² - 3 < 0. So we need to find integers x with x² < 3. This means x ∈ {-1, 0, 1}. I'll enumerate x from -10 to 10 and print those satisfying the inequality to confirm.

```python
# Enumerate integers to find x such that (x^2 - 3)*(x^2 + 5) < 0
# Since x^2 + 5 > 0 always, inequality reduces to x^2 - 3 < 0 => x^2 < 3

for x in range(-10, 11):
    lhs = (x**2 - 3)*(x**2 + 5)
    if lhs < 0:
        print(f"x={x} satisfies: (x^2-3)*(x^2+5)={lhs} < 0")
print("Candidates are integers x with x^2 < 3, i.e., x in -1,0,1")
```
