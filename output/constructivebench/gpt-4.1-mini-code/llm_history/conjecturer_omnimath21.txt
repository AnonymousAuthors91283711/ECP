. Enumerated answers: Searching solutions for 2^x * 3^y - 5^z * 7^w = 1 with exponents <= 20
Solution found: (x,y,z,w) = (1,0,0,0)
Solution found: (x,y,z,w) = (1,1,1,0)
Solution found: (x,y,z,w) = (2,2,1,1)
Solution found: (x,y,z,w) = (3,0,0,1). Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ × ℕ × ℕ)
<<<{(1, 0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1, 0), (2, 2, 1, 1), (3, 0, 0, 1)}>>>
