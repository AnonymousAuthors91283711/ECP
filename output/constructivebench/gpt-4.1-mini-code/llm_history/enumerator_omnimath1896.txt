The problem counts the number of functions \( f: \{0,1,2\} \times \{0,1,2,3\} \to \{0,1,2\} \) satisfying a certain condition forbidding a "rectangle" of equal values as specified.

To assist in conjecturing this count, we enumerate all such functions and print those that satisfy the condition.

We'll represent \( f \) by a list of length 12 (3*4), each element in \{0, 1, 2\}. The condition says: for all \( x_1 < x_2 \in \{0,1,2\} \) and \( y_1 < y_2 \in \{0,1,2,3\} \), it is NOT the case that all three of

\[
f(x_1,y_1) = f(x_1,y_2), \quad f(x_2,y_1) = f(x_2,y_2), \quad f(x_1,y_1) = f(x_2,y_1)
\]

hold.

In other words, no "rectangle" of points \((x_1,y_1), (x_1,y_2), (x_2,y_1), (x_2,y_2)\) where the four function values form a rectangle with \(f(x_1,y_1)\) repeated 3 times as above.

We'll enumerate all functions (3^12 = 531441) and check the condition for each, count and print the valid ones. To keep output short, we'll only print a sample of valid functions and count them.

To meet the output limit and efficiency, we sample parameters (like \( |X|=3, |Y|=4, |Z|=3 \)) as given, print partial results, and at the end print the count.

```python
# Enumerate functions f: (3x4) -> 3 avoiding forbidden rectangles
# f indexed as f[x*4 + y], values in {0,1,2}

def check_condition(f):
    # f: list of length 12, values in {0,1,2}
    for x1 in range(3):
        for x2 in range(x1+1,3):
            for y1 in range(4):
                for y2 in range(y1+1,4):
                    v11 = f[x1*4 + y1]
                    v12 = f[x1*4 + y2]
                    v21 = f[x2*4 + y1]
                    v22 = f[x2*4 + y2]
                    # Check if forbidden rectangle appears:
                    # f(x1,y1) = f(x1,y2) and f(x2,y1) = f(x2,y2) and f(x1,y1) = f(x2,y1)
                    if v11 == v12 and v21 == v22 and v11 == v21:
                        return False
    return True

    # There are 3^12 = 531441 functions

    max_print = 10
    printed = 0
