The problem involves finding the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that the Fibonacci number \( F_m \equiv 0 \pmod{127} \) and the next Fibonacci number \( F_{m+1} \equiv 1 \pmod{127} \). The Fibonacci sequence is defined with \( F_0 = 0 \), \( F_1 = 1 \), and \( F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \) for \( n \geq 2 \).

We want to find all such \( m \) up to some threshold, print them, and finally print the smallest. The problem is related to Pisano periods modulo 127.

```python
# Enumerate Fibonacci indices m > 0 where F(m) % 127 == 0 and F(m+1) % 127 == 1.
# Print all found m up to a reasonable max to conjecture minimum.

MOD = 127
MAX_M = 200  # upper bound for search

def fib_mod_sequence(mod, length):
    f0, f1 = 0, 1
    for i in range(length + 2):
        yield f0
        f0, f1 = f1, (f0 + f1) % mod

def find_candidates(mod, max_m):
    fibs = list(fib_mod_sequence(mod, max_m+1))
    candidates = []
    for m in range(1, max_m+1):
        if fibs[m] == 0 and fibs[m+1] == 1:
            print(f"Found m={m} with F(m)%{mod}=0 and F(m+1)%{mod}=1")
            candidates.append(m)
    return candidates

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(f"Searching for m with F(m) ≡ 0 (mod {MOD}) and F(m+1) ≡ 1 (mod {MOD}) up to {MAX_M}")
    candidates = find_candidates(MOD, MAX_M)
    if candidates:
        minimum = min(candidates)
        print(f"Smallest such m is {minimum}")
    else:
        print("No candidates found up to the threshold.")
```
