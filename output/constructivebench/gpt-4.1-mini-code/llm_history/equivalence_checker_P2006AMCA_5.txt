Ground Truth Answer: 4
Proposed Answer: 14
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer step by step.

1. Given values:
   - totalSlices = 8
   - plainCost = 8
   - anchovyCost = 2
   - anchovySlices = 8/2 = 4
   - plainSlices = 8-4 = 4

2. Consumption:
   - daveAteAnchovy = 4
   - daveAtePlain = 1
   - dougAtePlain = 4-1 = 3

3. Calculations:
   - davePayment = (1*8/8) + (4*(8+2)/4) = 1 + 10 = 11
   - dougPayment = 3*8/8 = 3
   - davePayment - dougPayment = 11-3 = 8

The ground truth answer is 4, but based on the calculations above, the correct difference should be 8. The proposed answer of 14 is incorrect.

<<<False>>>
