The problem describes functions \( f: \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} \) satisfying two conditions:

1. For all \( x,y \in \mathbb{N} \), \( f(f(x) + y) \) divides \( x + f(y) \).
2. For all \( x \in \mathbb{N} \), \( f(x) > 0 \).

We want to enumerate possible functions \(f\) that meet these conditions.

To tackle this computationally, we can:
- Limit \( \mathbb{N} \) to small finite sets for \( x,y \) (say 0 to 4).
- Enumerate all candidate functions \( f: \{0,\ldots,4\} \to \{1,\ldots,M\} \) for some small \(M\), since \(f\) must be positive.
- Check the divisibility condition for all pairs \( x,y \in \{0,\ldots,4\} \).
- Print any \( f \) that satisfy the condition on this finite domain, as partial evidence toward conjectures.

We use a small \(M\) like 5 for range and domain to avoid explosion.

This enumeration suggests plausible functions and helps conjecture their form. We will print all candidates found.

```python
# Enumerate functions f: {0..4} -> {1..5} with f(x)>0
# Check divisibility condition: for all x,y in {0..4}, f(f(x)+y) divides x + f(y)
# Since f is defined on {0..4}, f(x)+y may be up to 5+4=9 -- out of range.
# To handle this, we extend function definition by zero outside domain (infeasible),
# or restrict to f(x)+y <= 4, hence f(x) in {1..0} impossible.
# To resolve this, we consider f defined on domain up to max argument needed: maximum f(x)+y
# Let's choose domain {0..9}, then range {1..9} to keep manageable.

# We'll iterate over all f:[0..9]->[1..9], which is 9^10 ~ 3.5e9 huge; infeasible.
# Instead, random sampling or heuristic needed.

# For feasibility, do f:[0..4]->[1..5], but only check pairs (x,y) with f(x)+y<=4.
# Or precompute f(x)+y for all x,y and skip if out of domain.

# Let's implement partial enumeration with pruning.

from itertools import product

DOMAIN = list(range(5))
RANGE = list(range(1,6))

def satisfies(f):
    # f is a list mapping x->f[x]
    for x in DOMAIN:
        for y in DOMAIN:
            arg = None
            # f(x)+ y can be >4, skip such pairs as we can't evaluate f(arg)
            arg = f[x] + y
            if arg > 4:
                continue  # skip, cannot check divisibility outside domain
            lhs = f[arg]
            rhs = x + f[y]
            if rhs % lhs != 0:
                return False
    return True

def f_str(f):
    return '[' + ','.join(str(v) for v in f) + ']'

print("Enumerating candidate functions f: {0..4} -> {1..5} with divisibility condition on partial domain:")

count = 0
for f in product(RANGE, repeat=5):
    if satisfies(f):
        count +=1
        print(f"Candidate #{count}: f = {f_str(f)}")

print(f"Total candidates found (partial domain): {count}")
```
