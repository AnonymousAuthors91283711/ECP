Ground Truth Answer: 2
Proposed Answer: 6
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the smallest natural number c such that there exist natural numbers a and b where:
   - a < b < c
   - b - a = c - b (arithmetic progression)
   - c * a = b²

2. The ground truth answer is 2, but let's check:
   - For c=2, possible pairs (a,b) would be (1,1.5) but b must be natural, so invalid
   - The smallest valid solution is actually (a,b,c) = (4,6,9):
     - 4 < 6 < 9
     - 6-4 = 9-6 = 2
     - 9*4 = 36 = 6²
   - Therefore, the correct answer should be 9, not 2

3. The proposed answer is 6:
   - For c=6, possible pairs would be (a,b) where b²=6a
   - Trying b=3: 9=6a ⇒ a=1.5 (not natural)
   - b=6: 36=6a ⇒ a=6 (but a must be < b)
   - No valid natural solutions

Conclusion:
- Ground truth answer (2) is incorrect
- Proposed answer (6) is also incorrect
- The correct answer should be 9
