theorem P2004AMCA_2 : 
  IsLeast {n : ℕ | n ≤ 17 ∧ n * 6 + 8 * 5 / 2 ≥ 100} P2004AMCA_2_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating n <= 17 with n*6 + 20.0 >= 100:
n = 14, n*6 + 20 = 104.0
n = 15, n*6 + 20 = 110.0
n = 16, n*6 + 20 = 116.0
n = 17, n*6 + 20 = 122.0
Minimal n satisfying the condition is 14. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
