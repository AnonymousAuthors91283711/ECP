. Enumerated answers: Looking for pairs (m,n) with m > 0, n > 0 and (m + n)/2 = 5, i.e. m + n = 10
Found pair: m=1, n=9
Found pair: m=2, n=8
Found pair: m=3, n=7
Found pair: m=4, n=6
Found pair: m=5, n=5
Found pair: m=6, n=4
Found pair: m=7, n=3
Found pair: m=8, n=2
Found pair: m=9, n=1
All n found: [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
Maximum n with such m: 9. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
