The problem hints at finding the exact sum of the cubes of the first four natural numbers. Let's enumerate cubes of numbers from 1 to 4 and their sum.

```python
# Enumerate cubes of numbers from 1 to 4 and sum them
def cubes_sum(n):
    total = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        cube = i**3
        print(f"{i}^3 = {cube}")
        total += cube
    print(f"Sum of cubes from 1 to {n} = {total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = 4
    print(f"Enumerating cubes from 1 to {n}:")
    cubes_sum(n)
```
