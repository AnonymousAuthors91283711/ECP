abbrev omnimath4158_answer : Set ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath4158 (n : ℕ) :
  n ∈ omnimath4158_answer ↔
  ∃ (lines : Set (Finset ℕ)),
    (∀ l ∈ lines, l.card = 3) ∧
    (∀ l₁ ∈ lines, ∀ l₂ ∈ lines, l₁ ≠ l₂ → (l₁ ∩ l₂).card = 1) ∧
    (∀ s₁ s₂ : ℕ, s₁ ≠ s₂ → ∃! l ∈ lines, s₁ ∈ l ∧ s₂ ∈ l) ∧
    lines.Nonempty := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating candidate numbers of points (v):
v=7 fits projective plane parameters with order q=2 and line size 3
Total lines b=7, each line size=3
Conjecture: The valid number of points is 7 corresponding to the projective plane of order 2.. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
