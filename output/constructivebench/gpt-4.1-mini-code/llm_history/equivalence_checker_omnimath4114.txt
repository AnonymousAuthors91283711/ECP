abbrev omnimath4114_answer : â„• := sorry
theorem omnimath4114 : 
  let L := (10^2022 - 1) / 9
  (digits 10 (9 * L^2 + 2 * L)).sum = omnimath4114_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 4044
Proposed Answer: 2 * (2022 + 1)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem involves a number L which is a repunit (number consisting of all 1's) with 2022 digits, since L = (10^2022 - 1)/9.

2. The expression 9*L^2 + 2*L can be rewritten as:
   (10^2022 - 1)^2 /9 + 2*(10^2022 - 1)/9
   = (10^4044 - 2*10^2022 + 1 + 2*10^2022 - 2)/9
   = (10^4044 - 1)/9

3. This is another repunit, but with 4044 digits of '1's.

4. The sum of digits of this number is therefore 4044 (since each digit is 1).

The ground truth answer correctly gives 4044 as the sum of digits.

The proposed answer gives 2*(2022 + 1) = 4046, which is incorrect.
