The problem is to find the set of real numbers \(x\), excluding \(x=-2\) and \(x=-\frac{9}{2}\) (to avoid division by zero), for which the inequality
\[
\frac{x+1}{x+2} > \frac{3x+4}{2x+9}
\]
holds.

We want to enumerate possible \(x\) values that satisfy this, focusing on rational candidates for \(x\), especially near the excluded points and a few test points, to conjecture the solution set.

```python
# Enumerate x values near excluded points and some rational test points to test the inequality
# For x â‰  -2, -9/2, check if (x+1)/(x+2) > (3x+4)/(2x+9)
# Print x and whether inequality holds, to conjecture solution set boundaries

def lhs(x): return (x+1)/(x+2)
def rhs(x): return (3*x+4)/(2*x+9)

excluded = [-2, -9/2]
# Sample test points around excluded and arbitrary points
test_points = [-5, -4.5, -4, -3, -2.1, -1.9, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]

print("Testing inequality (x+1)/(x+2) > (3x+4)/(2x+9) at sample points:")
for x in test_points:
    if x in excluded:
        continue
    try:
        val_lhs = lhs(x)
        val_rhs = rhs(x)
        if val_lhs > val_rhs:
            print(f"x = {x}: True  ({val_lhs:.4f} > {val_rhs:.4f})")
        else:
            print(f"x = {x}: False ({val_lhs:.4f} <= {val_rhs:.4f})")
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print(f"x = {x}: Undefined (division by zero)")

# Additional step to find the critical points where equality holds by cross multiplication
# Solve (x+1)/(x+2) = (3x+4)/(2x+9) => (x+1)(2x+9) = (3x+4)(x+2)

from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve, Rational

x = symbols('x', real=True)
eq = Eq((x+1)/(x+2), (3*x+4)/(2*x+9))
solutions = solve(eq, x)

print("\nSolutions where (x+1)/(x+2) = (3x+4)/(2x+9):")
for sol in solutions:
    if sol not in excluded:
        print(f"x = {sol.evalf()} (exact: {sol})")
```
