The problem involves integer counts of coins \( p, n, d, q \) representing pennies (1 cent), nickels (5 cents), dimes (10 cents), and quarters (25 cents). We have two average values:

\[
\frac{p + 5n + 10d + 25q}{p + n + d + q} = 20,
\quad
\frac{p + 5n + 10d + 25(q+1)}{p + n + d + q + 1} = 21.
\]

We need to find all possible integer solutions for \( p, n, d, q \) and deduce \( d \).

The program below enumerates small values of \( p, n, d, q \) to satisfy the average equations exactly in integers, printing each candidate and the corresponding \( d \). This helps conjecture the value or pattern of \( d \).

```python
# Enumerate integer solutions (p,n,d,q) for given average conditions
# Average1 = (p + 5n + 10d + 25q) / (p+n+d+q) = 20 (exact)
# Average2 = (p + 5n + 10d + 25(q+1)) / (p+n+d+q+1) = 21 (exact)

max_coin = 20  # Limit search space for efficiency
for p in range(max_coin+1):
    for n in range(max_coin+1):
        for d in range(max_coin+1):
            for q in range(max_coin+1):
                total_coins = p + n + d + q
                if total_coins == 0:
                    continue
                total_val = p + 5*n + 10*d + 25*q
                # Check first average equals 20 exactly
                if total_val * 1 == 20 * total_coins:
                    # Check second average equals 21 exactly
                    total_coins2 = total_coins + 1
                    total_val2 = total_val + 25
                    if total_val2 * 1 == 21 * total_coins2:
                        print(f"p={p}, n={n}, d={d}, q={q} => d = {d}")
```
