The problem is to find all integer pairs \((m,n)\) satisfying \(m^5 - n^5 = 16 mn\).

We want to enumerate integer pairs \((m,n)\) where \(|m|,|n|\) are small (to keep computations manageable) and check the equation exactly. We'll check values in a range such as \(-10 \le m,n \le 10\).

```python
# Enumerate integer pairs (m,n) with |m|,|n| <= 10 satisfying m^5 - n^5 = 16*m*n
# Print each pair immediately when found.

def main():
    limit = 10
    for m in range(-limit, limit+1):
        for n in range(-limit, limit+1):
            lhs = m**5 - n**5
            rhs = 16 * m * n
            if lhs == rhs:
                print(f"({m}, {n})")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
