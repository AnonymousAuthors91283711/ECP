[write_program]
This describes a tiling problem on a 12x12 grid with sets P of special pentomino-like shapes. There are four distinct shape types, each covering 5 cells. The collection P tiles the grid exactly with these shapes, non-overlapping.

We want to:
- Enumerate candidate tilings P of the 12x12 grid using these shapes,
- Count how many distinct P exist,
- Conjecture omnimath782_answer = that count.

Due to the complexity, I'll try smaller grids (like 4x4 or 6x6), print parameters and some sample coverings using these shapes, to observe patterns and count perfect coverings; this can hint at the answer for 12x12.

We'll:
- Define the 4 shape patterns as sets of relative (dx, dy) coords,
- For chosen small grids, generate all valid placements,
- Backtrack to find all tilings with these shapes,
- Print tilings found (or counts) as we find them,
- Print final count.

We prioritize exact matches (no approximations). The program outputs streaming results.

```python
# Enumerate tilings of an n x n grid by 4 pentomino-shaped tiles defined by the problem.
# Due to complexity, we choose small n like 4 or 6.
# Print parameters and incremental counts.
