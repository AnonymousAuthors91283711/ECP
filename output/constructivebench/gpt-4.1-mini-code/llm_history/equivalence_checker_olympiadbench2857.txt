Ground Truth Answer: fun T => (T + 1) * T^4 - (T + 1) * T - (T + 1) * choose T 2 * (2 * T^3 - 3 * T^2 + T)
Proposed Answer: fun T : ℕ => let k := T + 1; k * (k - 1)^4 - (k + k * (k - 1) * ((k - 1)^3 - (k - 2)^3))
Let's analyze the equivalence between the proposed answer and the ground truth answer.

1. First, let's expand the proposed answer:
   - k = T + 1
   - The expression is: k*(k-1)^4 - [k + k*(k-1)*((k-1)^3 - (k-2)^3)]

2. Now let's expand the ground truth answer:
   - (T+1)*T^4 - (T+1)*T - (T+1)*choose T 2*(2*T^3 - 3*T^2 + T)

3. Let's compare term by term:
   - The first term k*(k-1)^4 in proposed answer equals (T+1)*T^4 in ground truth
   - The remaining terms:
     * Proposed: -[k + k*(k-1)*((k-1)^3 - (k-2)^3)]
     * Ground truth: -[(T+1)*T + (T+1)*T*(T-1)/2*(2*T^3 - 3*T^2 + T)]

4. The key difference is in the binomial coefficient:
   - choose T 2 = T*(T-1)/2
   - The proposed answer doesn't have this division by 2, making it different from the ground truth

5. The proposed answer is close but missing the division by 2 factor that appears in the ground truth answer's combinatorial term.
