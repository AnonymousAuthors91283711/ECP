The problem is to find the unique rational number \(w\) such that \(\frac{3}{5} w = \frac{1}{3}\). This is a straightforward linear equation in rationals. We'll enumerate possible values of \(w\) expressed as fractions with small integer numerators and denominators, check the condition, and print the exact values that satisfy the equality.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# We want to find w such that (3/5)*w = 1/3
# So w = (1/3) * (5/3) = 5/9 exactly.
# But we enumerate fractions w = n/d with small |n|, |d| to confirm.

target = Fraction(1, 3)
multiplier = Fraction(3, 5)

print("Enumerating rational candidates w = n/d with denominators and numerators from -10 to 10:")

for d in range(1, 11):
    for n in range(-10, 11):
        w = Fraction(n, d)
        if multiplier * w == target:
            # Found a w that satisfies (3/5)*w = 1/3
            print(f"w = {w} (fraction), approx = {float(w):.6f}")

print("Unique solution w =", target / multiplier)
```
