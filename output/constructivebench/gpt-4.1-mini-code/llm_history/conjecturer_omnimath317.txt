The error stems from the misuse of ∧ (logical and) inside the lambda expression defining f. The expression:

fun x => a * x ^ 2 + b * x + c ∧ a = 0 ∧ b = 0 ∧ c = 0

is interpreted by Lean as a function returning a Prop (proposition) rather than ℝ, because ∧ connects propositions, not real values. The condition a=0 ∧ b=0 ∧ c=0 should be outside the function definition, not conjoined inside it.

Moreover, since you say you want the set of functions f : ℝ → ℝ satisfying the condition, the natural way is to characterize f via parameters and impose conditions on those parameters, e.g.:

{f | ∃ a b c, (∀ x, f x = a*x^2 + b*x + c) ∧ ... parameter conditions ...}

Given the problem statement and enumerated answers (zero quadratic coefficients giving zero functions, rational functions, constants), the final closed form should be:

omnimath317_answer :=
{f | ∃ c : ℝ, ∀ x, f x = c} ∪                          -- constant functions
{f | ∃ a b : ℝ, ∀ x ≠ 0, f x = a / x + b} ∪          -- functions of form a/x + b
{f | ∀ x, f x = 0}                                    -- zero function (special quadratic with a=b=c=0)

From enumerated answers, the quadratic term is zero (a=0), so we don't really have a quadratic polynomial solution other than the zero function.

Hence, the correct Lean expression for the answer set is:

<<<
{f | ∃ c : ℝ, ∀ x, f x = c} ∪
{f | ∃ a b : ℝ, ∀ x ≠ 0, f x = a / x + b} ∪
{f | ∀ x, f x = 0}
