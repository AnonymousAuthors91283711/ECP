Ground Truth Answer: Icc (-9/2) (-2) ∪ Ioo ((1 - sqrt 5)/2) ((1 + sqrt 5)/2)
Proposed Answer: (Ioo (-(9/2)) (1/2 - Real.sqrt 5 / 2)) \ {-2} ∪ Ioi (1/2 + Real.sqrt 5 / 2)
Let me analyze the two answers carefully:

1. The ground truth answer consists of two parts:
   - Closed interval from -9/2 to -2 (Icc (-9/2) (-2))
   - Open interval from (1-√5)/2 to (1+√5)/2 (Ioo ((1 - sqrt 5)/2) ((1 + sqrt 5)/2))

2. The proposed answer consists of:
   - Open interval from -9/2 to (1/2 - √5/2) excluding -2
   - Open interval from (1/2 + √5/2) to infinity

Key observations:
- The proposed answer misses the interval between (1/2 - √5/2) and (1/2 + √5/2) which is part of the ground truth
- The proposed answer includes points greater than (1/2 + √5/2) which shouldn't be included
- The exclusion of -2 is already handled by the hypothesis hx1 in the theorem
- The expressions (1 - sqrt 5)/2 and 1/2 - sqrt 5/2 are equivalent, as are (1 + sqrt 5)/2 and 1/2 + sqrt 5/2

The proposed answer is incorrect because:
1. It includes values that shouldn't be included (x > (1+√5)/2)
2. It misses values that should be included ((1-√5)/2 < x < (1+√5)/2)
3. The exclusion of -2 is unnecessary as it's already excluded by hypothesis
