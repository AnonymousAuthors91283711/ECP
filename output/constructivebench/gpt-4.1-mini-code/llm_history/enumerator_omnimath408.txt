The problem asks to find the probability (normalized volume) that two real numbers \(x,y \in [0,120]\) satisfy \(|x-y| \leq 15\). The region is the unit square scaled to side 120, and the condition restricts points near the diagonal within a band of width 15.

To assist, we enumerate integer grid points in \([0..120]^2\) satisfying the condition and approximate the ratio of counts, then consider a refined grid to better estimate the ratio. This discrete approximation will help conjecture the exact mathematical answer.

```python
# Enumerate integer points (x,y) in [0..120]^2 and count ones with |x-y| ≤ 15
# Then refine using half-integers for better approximation
N = 120
count_int = 0
total_int = (N+1)*(N+1)
for x in range(N+1):
    for y in range(N+1):
        if abs(x - y) <= 15:
            count_int += 1
print(f"Integer grid points satisfying |x-y| ≤ 15: {count_int}/{total_int} ≈ {count_int/total_int:.4f}")

# Refine by checking midpoints to get a finer sampling
step = 0.5
vals = [i*step for i in range(int(N/step)+1)]
count_half = 0
total_half = len(vals)*len(vals)
for x in vals:
    for y in vals:
        if abs(x - y) <= 15:
            count_half += 1
print(f"Half-integer grid points satisfying |x-y| ≤ 15: {count_half}/{total_half} ≈ {count_half/total_half:.4f}")

# Candidates seem close to (120*2*15 - 15*15)/(120*120) ratio = (3600-225)/14400 = 3375/14400 = 0.234375
print("Conjectured exact ratio = ((2*120*15) - 15*15)/(120*120) = 0.234375")
```
