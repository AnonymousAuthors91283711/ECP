The problem is to find the unique real number \(x\) such that
\[
x \cdot \lfloor x \cdot \lfloor x \cdot \lfloor x \cdot \lfloor x \rfloor \rfloor \rfloor \rfloor = 122.
\]
We want to enumerate possible \(x\) values and their computed values in the expression.

We'll try rational values \(x = \frac{p}{q}\) for small integers \(p, q\), compute the nested floor expression, and check if the product equals 122 exactly. We print all matches and at the end print the unique candidate(s).

```python
import math
from fractions import Fraction

# Compute the nested floor expression step by step
def nested_floor(x):
    # Start with floor(x)
    f0 = math.floor(x)
    f1 = math.floor(x * f0)
    f2 = math.floor(x * f1)
    f3 = math.floor(x * f2)
    # Finally compute x * f3
    return x * f3

# We want x * floor(x * floor(x * floor(x * floor(x)))) = 122
# For each x, compute nested_floor(x) and multiply by x again
# Check if equal to 122 exactly (as a fraction)

# We'll scan x in range ~ (1, 10), with denominators up to 20 for rationals
max_den = 20
min_num = 1
max_num = 200

matches = []
seen = set()

print("Searching rationals x = p/q with denominators <= 20 and numerators roughly in [1..200]")
for q in range(1, max_den+1):
    for p in range(min_num, max_num+1):
        x = Fraction(p, q)
        if x in seen:
            continue
        seen.add(x)
        # Compute nested steps using Fraction to keep exactness
        f0 = x.numerator // x.denominator  # floor(x)
        t1 = (x * f0)
        f1 = t1.numerator // t1.denominator
        t2 = x * f1
        f2 = t2.numerator // t2.denominator
        t3 = x * f2
        f3 = t3.numerator // t3.denominator

        prod = x * f3  # product without last multiplication by x? Actually problem says multiply by x again:

        val = x * f3  # equals x * floor(x * floor(x * floor(x * floor(x))))

        # Check if val == 122 exactly
        if val.denominator == 1 and val.numerator == 122:
            print(f"Found solution x = {x} with expression = 122")
            matches.append(x)

if matches:
    print("\nAll solutions found:")
    for sol in matches:
        print(sol)
    print("Unique solution (if exists):", matches[0])
else:
    print("No exact rational solutions found with denominators <= 20")
```
This program enumerates rationals \(x\) with denominators up to 20 and checks the condition exactly. It prints all \(x\) that satisfy the expression exactly equal to 122, assisting in conjecturing the true answer.
