The problem describes a finite set \( S \) and a sequence of 100 subsets \( X_i \subseteq S \) with properties:
- Each \( X_i \) is nonempty.
- The \( X_i \) are pairwise distinct.
- For each \( i < 99 \), \( X_i \) and \( X_{i+1} \) are disjoint.
- For each \( i < 99 \), \( X_i \cup X_{i+1} \neq S \).

We want to find the minimal size of \( S \), i.e. \( |S| \geq \text{omnimath265_answer} \), for which such \(X_i\) exist.

I'll enumerate small finite sets \( S \) and try to build sequences \( X_i \) obeying those constraints, to estimate \(\text{omnimath265_answer}\).

```python
# Enumerate possible answers by constructing example sequences X_i for small S.
# Using Python sets and bitmasks for efficiency.

def subsets(n):
    """Generate all nonempty subsets of an n-element set, represented as bitmasks."""
    for mask in range(1, 1 << n):
        yield mask

def is_disjoint(a, b):
    return (a & b) == 0

def is_union_full(a, b, full):
    return (a | b) == full

def test(n):
    full = (1 << n) - 1
    # We want a sequence X_0,...X_99 with:
    # Each X_i nonempty subset of [n].
    # X_i distinct.
    # For 0 ≤ i < 99,
    #   X_i and X_{i+1} disjoint,
    #   X_i ∪ X_{i+1} != full
    # Try greedy or DFS search to build sequence.
    from collections import deque

    subs = [mask for mask in subsets(n)]

    # We'll do BFS building sequences
    # States: (sequence of masks)
    # Start with each one-element sequence
    queue = deque(( [s], {s} ) for s in subs)
    max_len = 0
    found_len_100 = False
    while queue:
        seq, used = queue.popleft()
        if len(seq) == 100:
            found_len_100 = True
            print(f"n={n}: Found sequence of length 100!")
            break
        last = seq[-1]
        # Try to extend by subs j s.t.
        # distinct, disjoint from last, union != full
        for nxt in subs:
            if nxt not in used and is_disjoint(last, nxt) and not is_union_full(last, nxt, full):
                new_seq = seq + [nxt]
                new_used = used | {nxt}
                queue.append((new_seq,new_used))
        # Limit queue size for performance
        if len(queue) > 10000:
            break
        max_len = max(max_len, len(seq))
    if found_len_100:
        print(f"n={n} is possible")
    else:
        print(f"n={n}: No sequence length 100 found, max length={max_len}")

def main():
    # Test n from small to larger until we find a sequence length 100 or conclude none
    # Problem suggests card S >= omnimath265_answer for existence
    for n in range(1, 12):
        print(f"Testing n={n}")
        test(n)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code tries to build the required sequences for set sizes \( n=1..11 \); it will print when sequences of length 100 are found or the maximum length achievable, assisting in conjecturing the minimal |S|.
