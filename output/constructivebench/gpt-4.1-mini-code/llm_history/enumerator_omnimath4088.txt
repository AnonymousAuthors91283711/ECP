The problem involves maximizing the product \(x \cdot y \cdot z\) with constraints \(x \geq 20\), \(y \geq 40\), \(z \geq 1675\), and \(x + y + z = 2015\). We'll enumerate values for \(x, y, z\) over the feasible integer range, and print product values. Since the problem involves real numbers, but to keep enumeration feasible, test integer values with steps and find max product under constraints.

```python
# Enumerate possible integer triples (x,y,z) with given constraints and sum
# x>=20, y>=40, z>=1675, x+y+z=2015
# Print products immediately, then print max product found.

def main():
    min_x, min_y, min_z = 20, 40, 1675
    total = 2015

    max_product = -1
    max_triple = None

    print(f"Enumerating with constraints: x≥{min_x}, y≥{min_y}, z≥{min_z}, x+y+z={total}")
    # x can range from 20 up to total - (40+1675) = 2015 - 1715 = 300
    for x in range(min_x, 301):
        # y can range from 40 up to total - x - 1675
        y_min = min_y
        y_max = total - x - min_z
        if y_max < y_min:
            continue
        for y in range(y_min, y_max+1):
            z = total - x - y
            if z < min_z:
                continue
            product = x * y * z
            print(f"x={x}, y={y}, z={z}, product={product}")
            if product > max_product:
                max_product = product
                max_triple = (x, y, z)
    print(f"Maximum product found: {max_product} for x,y,z = {max_triple}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
