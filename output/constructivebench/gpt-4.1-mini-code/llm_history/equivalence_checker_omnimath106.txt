Ground Truth Answer: fun m n r s => (min (m : ℝ) (n : ℝ)) ^ (1/r - 1/s)
Proposed Answer: fun (m n : ℕ) (r s : ℝ) => (m : ℝ)^(1/r) * (n : ℝ)^(1/s)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the maximum value of a certain ratio involving matrix norms with exponents r and s.

2. The ground truth answer suggests the maximum is related to the minimum of m and n, raised to (1/r - 1/s).

3. The proposed answer suggests a product of m^(1/r) and n^(1/s).

Key observations:
- The exponents (1/r - 1/s) vs (1/r and 1/s separately) are fundamentally different
- The ground truth uses min(m,n) while the proposed answer uses both m and n multiplicatively
- The proposed answer grows much faster than the ground truth answer as m and n increase
- The ground truth answer correctly captures the limiting behavior when one dimension dominates the other

The answers are not equivalent in any meaningful way. The proposed answer is incorrect.
