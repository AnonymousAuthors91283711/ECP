[write_program]
The problem asks to find all triples of positive integers \((x,y,z)\) such that \(3^x - 5^y = z^2\). I will write a Python program that enumerates triples \((x,y,z)\) with small \(x,y\) and checks the condition exactly, printing any solutions found.

```python
# Enumerate positive integers x,y,z with small upper bound to find solutions of 3^x - 5^y = z^2
# Print each triple immediately, no approximations.
MAX_EXP = 10  # small limit for exponents to keep output short

def is_perfect_square(n):
    if n < 0:
        return False
    r = int(n**0.5)
    return r*r == n

def main():
    print("Enumerating triples (x,y,z) with x,y in 1..10 such that 3^x - 5^y = z^2:")
    for x in range(1, MAX_EXP+1):
        three_pow = 3 ** x
        for y in range(1, MAX_EXP+1):
            five_pow = 5 ** y
            diff = three_pow - five_pow
            if diff > 0 and is_perfect_square(diff):
                z = int(diff**0.5)
                print(f"Found: x={x}, y={y}, z={z} with 3^{x} - 5^{y} = {z}^2")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
