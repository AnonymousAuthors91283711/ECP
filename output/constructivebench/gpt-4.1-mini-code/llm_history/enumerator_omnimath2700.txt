[write_program]
The problem gives conditions on real numbers \(x, y, z\): \(x=3\), \(y=2x\), \(z=3y\). The task is to find \(z\).

The program enumerates sample values for \(x\) (here fixed as 3), computes \(y=2x\), \(z=3y\), and prints the results.

```python
# Enumerate values according to the problem: x=3, y=2*x, z=3*y
def main():
    x = 3
    y = 2 * x
    z = 3 * y
    print(f"x = {x}, y = {y}, z = {z}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
