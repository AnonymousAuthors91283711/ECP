Ground Truth Answer: (Icc (-1) 1, Icc 0 1)
Proposed Answer: (Icc (-1 : ℝ) 1, Icc (0 : ℝ) 1)
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer. The only difference is the explicit type annotation `: ℝ` in the proposed answer, which doesn't change the mathematical meaning since the context already establishes we're working with real numbers. Both answers specify the interval [-1, 1] for the first component and [0, 1] for the second component.
