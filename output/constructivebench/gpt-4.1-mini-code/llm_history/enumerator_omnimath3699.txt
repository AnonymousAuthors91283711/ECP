The problem is about finding the smallest natural number \( A \) such that:
- \( A > 0 \)
- The number of digits of \( A \) in base 10 is odd
- There exists a \( B \) where:
  - \( B \) has exactly one fewer digit than \( A \)
  - \( B \)'s digits almost form \( A \)'s digits except with exactly one digit \( d \) inserted at some position \( k \) in \( B \)'s digit list to form \( A \)
- Both \( A \) and \( B \) are divisible by 2018.

We want to find candidate values of \( A \) and \( B \) meeting these constraints and identify the minimum \( A \).

We will enumerate \( A \) with an odd number of digits from small to some upper limit and for each try all \( B \) with one fewer digit. For each \( B \), we'll try inserting one digit \( d \) at all positions \( k \) and check if the resulting number equals \( A \) and both divisible by 2018.

To avoid inefficiency, we'll:
- Iterate over odd digit lengths \( n \), starting from 1, up to 7 (up to 7 digits is enough for illustration).
- For each \( n \), enumerate \( B \) with \( n-1 \) digits.
- Generate \( A \) by inserting one digit \( d \in [0..9] \) in \( B \) at all possible positions.
- Check divisibility conditions.

Printing each found \( A, B, k, d \) immediately upon discovery.

```python
# omnimath3699 enumerator
def digits(n):
    return list(map(int, str(n)))

def from_digits(ds):
    return int(''.join(map(str, ds)))

def test():
    DIV = 2018
    # Iterate over odd lengths of A digits: 1,3,5,7 (limit to 7 digits)
    for A_len in [1,3,5,7]:
        B_len = A_len - 1
        if B_len <= 0:
            # no valid B with negative length
            continue
        # B range: all B_len-digit numbers (leading digit !=0)
        b_start = 10**(B_len - 1)
        b_end = 10**B_len
        for B in range(b_start, b_end):
            if B % DIV != 0:
                continue
            Bd = digits(B)
            # Try inserting digits d 0..9 at all positions k in B digits
            for k in range(B_len+1):
                for d in range(10):
                    Ad = Bd[:k] + [d] + Bd[k:]
                    # Skip if leading digit zero in A
                    if Ad[0] == 0:
                        continue
                    A = from_digits(Ad)
                    if A % DIV == 0:
                        print(f"A={A} (digits={A_len}) B={B} k={k} d={d}")
                        # Because we enumerate from small to large A, first found is min A
                        return

if __name__=="__main__":
    test()
```
This script prints candidates as soon as found, and promptly terminates after the smallest \( A \) due to sorting by ascending \( B \) and insertion positions. We print all info to help insight. Adjust the max digit length if needed.
