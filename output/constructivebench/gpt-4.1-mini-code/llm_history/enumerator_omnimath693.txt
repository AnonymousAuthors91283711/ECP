The problem appears to involve computing the value of an expression: starting with acc = 1, fold over the list [580, 570, ..., 10, 0] (from List.range 58 mapped to (580 - 10*k)) plus an extra element 9, applying acc = acc * b - 2 at each step, then taking the result modulo 100. We want to discover the final result modulo 100. The code enumerates the fold step by step and prints intermediate values modulo 100.

```python
# Enumerate the folded values modulo 100 for b in [580, 570, ..., 10, 0, 9]
def main():
    bs = [580 - 10*k for k in range(58)] + [9]  # The list of values b
    acc = 1
    print("Starting acc =", acc)
    for i, b in enumerate(bs):
        acc = acc * b - 2
        acc_mod = acc % 100
        # Print step, b, exact acc (large), and acc modulo 100
        print(f"Step {i+1}: b={b}, acc (exact)={acc}, acc mod 100={acc_mod}")
    print("Final answer mod 100 =", acc_mod)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
