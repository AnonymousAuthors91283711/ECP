The problem involves 100 variables \( x_i \geq 0 \) with constraints \( x_i + x_{i+1} + x_{i+2} \leq 1 \) cyclically, and we seek to maximize the sum \(\sum x_i x_{i+2}\).

To assist in conjecturing the maximum, I'll write a Python program to enumerate feasible vectors \(x\) for smaller \(n\) (like \(n=5,6,7\)) with the same cyclic constraints, and print the achieved sums of \(x_i x_{i+2}\). We use a discretization of values from 0 to 1 in steps (like 0.1) for speed.

This enumeration will print all possible sums found and report the maximum sum for each tested \(n\), which helps guessing the pattern for \(n=100\).

```python
# Enumerate small cases of the problem with parameters n and step
# For each assignment x_i >= 0 in increments, check constraints:
#   x_i + x_{i+1} + x_{i+2} <= 1 (indices mod n)
# Print all sums x_i * x_{i+2} found; also print max sum for each n

import itertools

def enumerate_sums(n, step=0.25):
    values = [round(i*step, 5) for i in range(int(1/step)+1)]
    max_sum = -1
    print(f"n={n}, step={step}")
    for x in itertools.product(values, repeat=n):
        # Check constraints
        if all(x[i] + x[(i+1)%n] + x[(i+2)%n] <= 1 + 1e-9 for i in range(n)):
            s = sum(x[i] * x[(i+2)%n] for i in range(n))
            print(f"S = {s:.5f} for x = {x}")
            if s > max_sum:
                max_sum = s
    print(f"Max S for n={n}, step={step} is {max_sum:.5f}\n")

def main():
    for n in [5, 6, 7]:
        enumerate_sums(n, step=0.25)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
