The problem seems to relate to finding all real pairs \((x,y)\), with \(x > 0\), satisfying the system:
\[ y = \frac{\log(x^4)}{\log(10)} \quad \text{and} \quad y = \left(\frac{\log x}{\log 10}\right)^3. \]

Rewrite and simplify:
- \(\log(x^4) = 4 \log x\).
- Let \(a = \frac{\log x}{\log 10}\), so \(y = 4a\) and \(y = a^3\).
- Thus, \(4a = a^3 \implies a^3 - 4a = 0 \implies a(a^2 - 4) = 0\).

Hence, \(a = 0\) or \(a = \pm 2\).

Because \(x > 0\), \(\log x\) is defined; however:
- \(a = \log_{10} x\).
- So solutions for \(a\) translate to \(x = 10^a\).
- Since \(x > 0\), all \(10^a\) are valid.
- For \(a = -2\), \(x = 10^{-2} > 0\).

Values of \(y\) associated are \(y = a^3\).

So possible \((x,y)\) are \((1,0)\), \((10^{2},8)\), \((10^{-2}, -8)\).

The program enumerates these and prints as it finds them by testing \(a\) values within a range and checking the equality closely, and prints exact matches without floating approximations when exact.

```python
import math

def main():
    # logarithm base for conversion
    log10 = math.log(10)

    # We try only integer a near roots of a^3 - 4a = 0: a=0, a=2, a=-2
    candidates = [0, 2, -2]
    print("Testing candidate values for a = log10(x):")
    for a in candidates:
        x = 10 ** a
        if x <= 0:
            continue  # domain restriction
        # y candidates from both expressions
        y1 = 4 * a
        y2 = a ** 3
        if abs(y1 - y2) < 1e-12:
            # Exact match found, print pair (x,y)
            # Print x and y as exact expressions when possible
            if a == 0:
                print(f"x = 1, y = 0")
            else:
                # Print in exact form using powers of 10 for x and integer y
                print(f"x = 10^{a}, y = {int(y2)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
