[write_program]
The problem involves recognizing the value of the expression 
\(8 \times 10^5 + 4 \times 10^3 + 9 \times 10 + 5\).
A simple enumeration program computes this value explicitly and prints it.

```python
# Compute and print the value of the given expression
def main():
    value = 8 * 10**5 + 4 * 10**3 + 9 * 10 + 5
    print(value)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
