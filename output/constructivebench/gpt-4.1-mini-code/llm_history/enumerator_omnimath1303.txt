The problem is to find the value of the sum:  
\[
\sum_{k=0}^{99} \frac{1}{2 \lfloor \sqrt{k+1} \rfloor + 1}
\]

The Python program below will enumerate terms, print each partial term with the denominator, and accumulate the sum with exact fractions (`Fraction`) for precision. We'll identify the sequence of denominators, print each term, and the final sum at the end.

```python
from fractions import Fraction
from math import sqrt, floor

total = Fraction(0)
print("k, floor_sqrt(k+1), denominator, term")

for k in range(100):
    f = floor(sqrt(k + 1))
    denom = 2 * f + 1
    term = Fraction(1, denom)
    total += term
    print(f"{k}, {f}, {denom}, {term}")

print("Sum =", total)
```
