. Enumerated answers: Enumerating values satisfying constraints:
a = 42, b = 47, c = 7, |a - b| = 5

Testing close values of b around 47 (not necessarily satisfying all constraints):
a=42, b=47, c=7, sum=96, |a - b|=5

Extremal answer based on exact constraints:
|a - b| = 5. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
<<<5>>>
