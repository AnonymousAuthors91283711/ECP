The equation is \(x^2 - 2009y + 2y^2 = 0\) for integers \(x, y\). We want to find all integer pairs \((x,y)\) satisfying this.

Rewrite as a quadratic in \(x\): \(x^2 = 2009y - 2y^2\).

For \(x\) integer, the RHS must be a perfect square \(\geq 0\).

We'll enumerate integer values of \(y\) in a reasonable range, check if \(2009y - 2y^2\) is a perfect square, then print solutions.

Try \(y\) around 0 to 2010 (since for \(y>1004\), \(2009y - 2y^2 < 0\), so no solutions).

Print each pair immediately to assist conjecture.

```python
import math

# Enumerate candidate integer pairs (x,y) where x^2 = 2009y - 2y^2 >= 0
# y range limited to 0..2010 since for large y the quadratic becomes negative

def is_perfect_square(n):
    if n < 0:
        return False
    root = int(math.isqrt(n))
    return root * root == n

print("Enumerating integer solutions (x,y) to x^2 = 2009*y - 2*y^2:")

for y in range(0, 2011):
    val = 2009 * y - 2 * y * y
    if val < 0:
        continue
    if is_perfect_square(val):
        x = int(math.isqrt(val))
        # x can be Â±sqrt(val)
        # print both if distinct
        print(f"x = {x}, y = {y}")
        if x != 0:
            print(f"x = {-x}, y = {y}")
```
