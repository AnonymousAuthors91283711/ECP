The problem is to find the greatest natural number \( d \) that divides the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{16} (n \cdot k + 1)\) for every integer \( n \) from 1 to 2016.

A direct approach is to:
- Enumerate divisors \( d \).
- For each candidate divisor, check if it divides the product for all \( n \).
- Optimize by focusing on prime factors that appear in every such product.

We will:
- Print encountered divisors during enumeration.
- Use primes up to a reasonable limit for factor checks.
- Output all candidates up to a certain threshold, then output the maximum found.

```python
from math import gcd
from sympy import primerange

MAX_N = 2016
K = 17  # Number of terms: k = 0 to 16

def product_sequence(n):
    prod = 1
    for k in range(K):
        prod *= (n * k + 1)
    return prod

def common_divisor_candidates():
    # Initialize gcd_candidate as product for n=1
    gcd_candidate = product_sequence(1)
    # Compute gcd with products for n=2..MAX_N to find common divisor
    for n in range(2, MAX_N+1):
        p = product_sequence(n)
        gcd_candidate = gcd(gcd_candidate, p)
        if gcd_candidate == 1:
            # No common divisor greater than 1
            break
    return gcd_candidate

def divisors(n):
    divs = set()
    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5)+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divs.add(i)
            divs.add(n//i)
    return sorted(divs)

def main():
    print(f"Parameters: n from 1 to {MAX_N}, product over k=0..{K-1}: (n*k+1)")
    gcd_candidate = common_divisor_candidates()
    print(f"Common gcd after checking all n: {gcd_candidate}")

    divs = divisors(gcd_candidate)
    print(f"Divisors of common gcd (up to 40 displayed):")
    for d in divs[:40]:
        print(d)
    if len(divs) > 40:
        print("...")

    print(f"Maximum divisor dividing all products: {gcd_candidate}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
