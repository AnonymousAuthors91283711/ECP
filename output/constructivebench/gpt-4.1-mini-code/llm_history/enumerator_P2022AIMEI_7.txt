The problem is to find pairs of positive coprime integers \((m,n)\) such that for distinct integers \(a,b,c,d,e,f',g,h,i\) from 1 to 9, the fraction \(\frac{abc - def'}{ghi} = \frac{m}{n} > 0\). We want to find the pairs \((m,n)\) that appear from such configurations, focusing on those with small values and coprime \(m,n\).

The approach is:
- Enumerate all injective functions \(f : \{0,\ldots,8\} \to \{1,\ldots,9\}\) which is permutation of 1 to 9.
- For each permutation, compute numerator = \(a*b*c - d*e*f'\), denominator = \(g*h*i\).
- Skip zero or negative results.
- Reduce fraction \(\frac{numerator}{denominator}\) to lowest terms.
- Print each fraction pair \((m,n)\) when found.
- Stop after a threshold of enumerations to limit output.

We can reuse Python's itertools.permutations to generate permutations and fractions module to simplify fractions.

```python
from itertools import permutations
from math import gcd
from fractions import Fraction

# We'll iterate over permutations of 1..9 assigning slots a,b,c,d,e,f',g,h,i
digits = list(range(1,10))
seen = set()
count = 0
max_print = 50  # limit output lines to avoid overflow

print("Enumerating fractions (m,n) from permutations with positive value:")

for p in permutations(digits):
    a,b,c,d,e,f_,g,h,i = p
    numerator = a*b*c - d*e*f_
    denominator = g*h*i
    if denominator == 0:
        continue
    if numerator <= 0:
        continue
    # reduce fraction
    common = gcd(numerator, denominator)
    m = numerator // common
    n = denominator // common
    if (m,n) in seen:
        continue
    # check coprime
    if gcd(m,n) != 1:
        continue
    print(f"m={m}, n={n}")
    seen.add((m,n))
    count += 1
    if count >= max_print:
        break

# Find minimal (m,n) by m/n value
min_frac = None
for (m,n) in seen:
    f = Fraction(m,n)
    if (min_frac is None) or (f < min_frac):
        min_frac = f

if min_frac:
    print(f"Minimal fraction found: {min_frac.numerator}/{min_frac.denominator}")
```
