This problem involves analyzing the roots of a polynomial formed by the sum of two quadratic polynomials. The expression is:  
\[ (X - 4)(X - 2) + (X - 2)(X - 6) = 0 \]  
which simplifies to a quadratic polynomial whose roots we want to find. Then, we want to check the product of these roots. I'll write a Python enumerator to:  
- Define the polynomial \( (X - a)(X - b) + (X - b)(X - c) \) for some \(a,b,c\).  
- Compute the roots exactly (symbolically) for small samples \(a,b,c\), including the ones in the problem (4,2,6).  
- Print the roots and their product to form a conjecture.  
- Show only rational roots and exact product when possible.  

```python
from sympy import symbols, Rational, simplify, roots, Poly

# Define the polynomial (X - a)(X - b) + (X - b)(X - c)
X = symbols('X')

def poly_sum_roots(a, b, c):
    # Polynomial expression
    P = (X - a)*(X - b) + (X - b)*(X - c)
    P = simplify(P)
    # Get roots with multiplicity
    rts = roots(Poly(P, X))
    # roots returns a dict {root: multiplicity}
    # For product, multiply roots raised to multiplicity
    prod = Rational(1)
    for r, m in rts.items():
        prod *= r**m
    return P, rts, simplify(prod)

# Sample values: given a=4, b=2, c=6 and few other samples
samples = [
    (4, 2, 6),
    (1, 2, 3),
    (0, 1, 2),
    (2, 3, 5),
]

for a, b, c in samples:
    P, rts, prod = poly_sum_roots(Rational(a), Rational(b), Rational(c))
    print(f"Polynomial ((X - {a})(X - {b}) + (X - {b})(X - {c})) = {P}")
    print("Roots (with multiplicity):")
    for root, mult in rts.items():
        print(f"  {root} multiplicity {mult}")
    print(f"Product of roots: {prod}\n")
```
This code enumerates the exact roots and product for each sample; the key sample is (4,2,6) as in the problem statement. This will help conjecture the value of `omnimath3403_answer`.
