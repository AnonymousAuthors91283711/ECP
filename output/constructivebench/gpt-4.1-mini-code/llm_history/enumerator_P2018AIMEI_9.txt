The problem is to find the number of 4-element subsets \( S \) of \(\{0, 1, \ldots, 20\}\) such that \(S\) contains two distinct elements that sum to 16 and two (possibly other) distinct elements that sum to 24.

The approach:
- Enumerate all subsets \(S\) of size 4 from 0 to 20.
- Check if \(S\) contains a pair summing to 16.
- Check if \(S\) contains a pair summing to 24.
- Count and print all such subsets and count the total.

We print each found subset immediately (partial results). Also print the final count.

Using itertools.combinations and sets for efficient checks.

```python
# Enumerate 4-element subsets of {0,...,20} with pairs summing to 16 and 24
from itertools import combinations

def has_pair_sum(S, target):
    s = set(S)
    for x in S:
        if (target - x) in s and (target - x) != x:
            return True
    return False

count = 0
n = 21
elements = list(range(n))

for S in combinations(elements, 4):
    # Check pairs summing to 16
    if not has_pair_sum(S, 16):
        continue
    # Check pairs summing to 24
    if not has_pair_sum(S, 24):
        continue
    count += 1
    print(f"Subset meeting criteria: {S}")

print(f"Total count: {count}")
```
