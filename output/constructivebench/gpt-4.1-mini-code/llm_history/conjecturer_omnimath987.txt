<<<6>>> 
Explanation: The problem describes a tournament (a directed complete graph) where every triple (A,B,C) has exactly one cyclic triple edge pattern. Such a structure is known as a "regular tournament" with a strict 3-cycle condition. The enumerated solutions show valid edge constructions for n=3,4,5,6 but no larger n. The maximal n with this property is 6.
