The problem is about finding a 3-element distinct subset (no duplicates) from the list [2, 3, 4, 6] whose elements sum to 11, and their product equals some answer we want to find. We want to find all such subsets and print their products.

We will:
- Enumerate all 3-element subsets of [2, 3, 4, 6].
- Filter those whose sum is 11.
- Print those subsets and their product.
- Then print the product answer(s).

```python
from itertools import combinations
from math import prod

# Given list
nums = [2, 3, 4, 6]

print("Looking for 3-element subsets from", nums, "with sum 11:")

answers = []
for combo in combinations(nums, 3):
    if sum(combo) == 11:
        p = prod(combo)
        print(f"Subset: {combo}, Sum: {sum(combo)}, Product: {p}")
        answers.append(p)

if answers:
    print("Possible product answer(s):", answers)
    print("Unique product answer(s):", sorted(set(answers)))
else:
    print("No subsets found with sum 11.")
```
