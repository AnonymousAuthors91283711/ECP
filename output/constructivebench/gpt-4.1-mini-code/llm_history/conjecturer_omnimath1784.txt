noncomputable abbrev omnimath1784_answer : ℝ := sorry
theorem omnimath1784 : 
  IsGreatest {b : ℝ | ∃ a m n p r s t : ℝ, 
    r + s + t = -a ∧ 
    r*s + s*t + t*r = b ∧ 
    r*s*t = 1 ∧
    (∀ x, x^3 + m * x^2 + n * x + p = (x - r^2) * (x - s^2) * (x - t^2)) ∧
    (-1)^3 + m * (-1)^2 + n * (-1) + p = -5} 
  omnimath1784_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating (r,s,t) with r*s*t=1, small rationals, checking conditions and printing b:
No b found satisfying constraints.. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
