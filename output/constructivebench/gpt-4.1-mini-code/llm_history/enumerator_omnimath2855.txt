[write_program]
The problem appears to involve evaluating \((x+1)^3\) at \(x = -2\). I will write a Python program that evaluates \((x+1)^3\) for some sample values of \(x\) around \(-2\), printing the exact cube and looking at the value at \(x = -2\).

```python
# Enumerate values of (x+1)^3 for some sample x, focusing on x=-2
def cube_val(x):
    return (x + 1) ** 3

print("Evaluating (x+1)^3 for sample x values including x=-2:\n")

# Sample x values including -2 and nearby
x_values = [-3, -2, -1, 0, 1]

for x in x_values:
    val = cube_val(x)
    print(f"x = {x}: (x+1)^3 = {val}")

print("\nConjecture: At x = -2, (x + 1)^3 =", cube_val(-2))
```
