The given problem involves a functional equation of the form:  
f(x * (x + f(y))) = (x + y) * f(x) for all real numbers x and y.  
We want to understand which real functions f satisfy this equation.

To assist, I'll write a Python program that tries various candidate functions f (constant, linear, quadratic forms, etc.) and checks whether the functional equation holds for a selected grid of x and y values. The program will enumerate functions that work on this grid, which could guide conjectures about the correct general form.

```python
# Enumerate candidate functions f: ℝ → ℝ and test the functional equation:
# f(x*(x+f(y))) == (x + y)*f(x) for various x,y.
# Print candidates that satisfy the equation on a sample grid.

def constant(c):
    return lambda t: c

def linear(a, b):
    return lambda t: a*t + b

def quadratic(a, b, c):
    return lambda t: a*t**2 + b*t + c

def identity():
    return lambda t: t

def zero_func():
    return lambda t: 0

def check_feq(f, xs, ys, tol=1e-9):
    # Check equation on grid, allowing small floating tolerance
    for x in xs:
        fx = f(x)
        for y in ys:
            lhs_arg = x * (x + f(y))
            lhs = f(lhs_arg)
            rhs = (x + y) * fx
            if abs(lhs - rhs) > tol:
                return False
    return True

def main():
    xs = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]
    ys = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]

    print("Testing constant functions c:")
    for c in range(-3,4):
        f = constant(c)
        if check_feq(f,xs,ys):
            print(f"Candidate: f(x) = {c}")

    print("\nTesting linear functions a*x + b:")
    for a in range(-3,4):
        for b in range(-3,4):
            f = linear(a,b)
            if check_feq(f,xs,ys):
                print(f"Candidate: f(x) = {a}*x + {b}")

    print("\nTesting quadratic functions a*x^2 + b*x + c:")
    for a in range(-2,3):
        for b in range(-2,3):
            for c in range(-2,3):
                f = quadratic(a,b,c)
                if check_feq(f,xs,ys):
                    print(f"Candidate: f(x) = {a}*x^2 + {b}*x + {c}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
