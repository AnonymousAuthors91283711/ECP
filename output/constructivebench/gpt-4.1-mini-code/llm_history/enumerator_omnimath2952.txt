The problem appears to be a simple function evaluation: given \( f(x) = x - 5 \), find \( f(0) \). We will enumerate the function for a range of x values around 0 to confirm and print the outputs, then explicitly print the answer for \( x=0 \).

```python
# Enumerate f(x) = x - 5 for x in [-5,5] and print results
def f(x):
    return x - 5

print("Enumerating f(x) = x - 5 for x in [-5,5]:")
for x in range(-5, 6):
    y = f(x)
    print(f"f({x}) = {y}")

# Print explicitly the value at x=0
print("\nThe value at x=0 is:")
print(f"f(0) = {f(0)}")
```
