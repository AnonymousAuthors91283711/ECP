Explanation: Setting \( a = (x, y, z) \) with positive entries satisfying \( 2(x^2+1)=3(y^2+1) \) and \( 3(y^2+1)=4(z^2+1) \) implies \( 2(x^2+1) = 3(y^2+1) = 4(z^2+1) = k \). Expressing \(x,y,z\) in terms of \(k\), positivity and the linear equations yield \(x=3/2, y=1, z=1/2\). The sum equals \(P2025HMMTfeb_algnt_7_answer = x + y + z = 3\).[refine_answer] Formal Problem Statement: import Mathlib

The given problem asks for a unique triple \( a = (a_1, a_2, a_3) \in \mathbb{R}^3 \) satisfying certain conditions on positivity, quadratic equalities, and linear relations. The theorem statement concludes with \( a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = P2025HMMTfeb_algnt_7_answer \), so the required answer is a single real number (the sum of the three components of \( a \)).

Your proposed answer expression is a triple \((3/2, 1, 1/2)\), but the expected type for `P2025HMMTfeb_algnt_7_answer` is just a real number \(\mathbb{R}\), not a triple \(\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}\). This is why Lean complains about a type mismatch.

The problem boils down to this: define `P2025HMMTfeb_algnt_7_answer : ℝ` as the sum of the components of the unique triple \(a\). The positioned candidate solution is \((3/2, 1, 1/2)\), whose sum is

\[
\frac{3}{2} + 1 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{2}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3
\]

Hence, the real number answer should be `3`.

I propose that the closed-form answer Lean expects is just the numeric sum of the given triple, `3`. This matches the problem setup perfectly, respects the type requirements, and fits the uniqueness claim.
