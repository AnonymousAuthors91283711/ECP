The problem is to find how many integers \( n \) between 1 and 2500 have exactly 3 divisors \( d \) with \( d \neq n \) and \( d < 50 \). We'll enumerate numbers from 1 to 2500, count their divisors less than 50 (except \( n \) itself if less than 50), and count how many have exactly 3 such divisors.

```python
def divisors_less_than_50(n):
    count = 0
    for d in range(1, min(50, n)):
        if n % d == 0:
            count += 1
    return count

count_valid = 0
for n in range(1, 2501):
    c = divisors_less_than_50(n)
    if c == 3:
        print(n)
        count_valid += 1
print("Total numbers with exactly 3 divisors <50 and â‰ n:", count_valid)
```
