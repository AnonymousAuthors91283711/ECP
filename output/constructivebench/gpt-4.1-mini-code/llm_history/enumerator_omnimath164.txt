The problem involves a set \( s \) of \( n \) real numbers with strictly increasing order and counting the number of 3-element arithmetic progressions (APs) contained in \( s \). The question is to find the maximum number of 3-term APs possible in such a set.

To explore this, I'll:
- Select small \( n \) values (e.g., 3 to 7).
- Enumerate all strictly increasing sets of integers (for simplicity) of size \( n \) within a reasonable range.
- Count all 3-element arithmetic progressions in each set.
- Print the sets and their count of 3-APs to conjecture the maximum count.

```python
from itertools import combinations

def count_3_aps(s):
    s = sorted(s)
    s_set = set(s)
    count = 0
    for a, b in combinations(s, 2):
        d = b - a
        c = b + d
        if c in s_set:
            count += 1
    return count

def main():
    max_n = 7
    max_val = 15  # limit search space to keep output small

    for n in range(3, max_n + 1):
        max_aps = 0
        print(f"n = {n}")
        # Enumerate strictly increasing subsets of {1,...,max_val}
        for s in combinations(range(1, max_val + 1), n):
            aps = count_3_aps(s)
            if aps > 0:
                print(f"Set: {s} -> 3-APs: {aps}")
            if aps > max_aps:
                max_aps = aps
        print(f"Max 3-APs for n={n}: {max_aps}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script identifies the maximum number of 3-term APs in sets of size \( n \) sampled from 1 to 15. It prints all sets with at least one 3-AP and the maximum found per \( n \), helping identify candidates for the maximum count.
