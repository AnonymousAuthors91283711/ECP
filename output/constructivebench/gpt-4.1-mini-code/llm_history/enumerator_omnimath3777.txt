The problem involves finding the greatest natural number \( n \) such that there exists \( k \) with the property: for all \( m < n \), \( k + m + 1 > 25 \) and \( k + m + 1 \) can be expressed as the sum of two distinct primes \( p \) and \( q \). To explore this, I'll enumerate candidates for \( n \), \( k \), and verify the conditions using small primes and sums.

```python
from sympy import primerange, isprime

def primes_up_to(n):
    return list(primerange(2, n+1))

def is_sum_of_two_distinct_primes(x, prime_list):
    for p in prime_list:
        q = x - p
        if q != p and q > 1 and isprime(q):
            return True
    return False

max_checked_n = 30  # Search up to here for demonstration
primes = primes_up_to(100)

# We'll search for pairs (n,k)
for n in range(1, max_checked_n + 1):
    # Try k from 0 up to some reasonable bound to ensure k+m+1 > 25 for m<n
    # k + n - 1 + 1 = k + n > 25  => k > 25 - n
    min_k = max(0, 26 - n)  # k must be > 25 - n
    found_k = False
    for k in range(min_k, 50):
        valid = True
        for m in range(n):
            val = k + m + 1
            if val <= 25 or not is_sum_of_two_distinct_primes(val, primes):
                valid = False
                break
        if valid:
            print(f"n={n}, k={k} satisfies all conditions")
            found_k = True
            # no break to print all k's that work for given n
    if not found_k:
        print(f"No k found for n={n}")

# Summary guess based on output could be the greatest n found with a valid k
```
This enumerates n and k to find sequences starting above 25 where each value is sum of two distinct primes, printing all pairs `(n,k)` that work. From this output, one can conjecture the maximal such n (and k).
