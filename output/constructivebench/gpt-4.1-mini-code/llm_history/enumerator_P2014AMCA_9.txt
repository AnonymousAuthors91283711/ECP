The problem involves two averages of consecutive integers starting from a and from b, with b defined as the average of five consecutive integers starting from a. We want to explore the expression involving b and find a function or pattern P2014AMCA_9_answer(a, b).

To help conjecture the pattern, the Python program below enumerates values of a, calculates b as the average of 5 consecutive integers starting from a, then computes the average of 5 consecutive integers starting from b, and prints the result immediately for each a.

```python
# Enumerate and print the average of 5 consecutive integers starting from b,
# where b is the average of 5 consecutive integers starting from a.
# This helps conjecture the form of P2014AMCA_9_answer(a, b).

def average_of_five(start):
    return (start + (start + 1) + (start + 2) + (start + 3) + (start + 4)) // 5

print("a, b = average_of_five(a), result = average_of_five(b)")
for a in range(0, 11):  # sample a from 0 to 10
    b = average_of_five(a)
    result = average_of_five(b)
    print(f"{a}, {b} = {result}")
```
