This problem involves real numbers \(x, y > 0\) with given algebraic constraints. We'll enumerate candidate solutions by sampling values of \(y\), computing \(x\) from \(y^3 = x^2\) as \(x = \sqrt{y^3}\), checking whether \((y - x)^2 = 4 y^2\) holds, and then print \(x+y\) when the conditions are met. This helps conjecture the exact value of \(x+y\). We'll try small positive \(y\) values and print exact values when possible.

```python
import math

# We want to find x,y >0 such that
# y^3 = x^2  => x = sqrt(y^3)
# (y - x)^2 = 4*y^2

# Equivalent to: (y - sqrt(y^3))^2 = 4*y^2

def approx_equal(a,b,eps=1e-12):
    return abs(a-b) < eps

print("Enumerating candidates for (x,y) with y in (0,10] in steps:")

# We'll try rational values for y to get exact or near-exact counts.
# Also try y=1,2,...5 for exact sqrt values.

for numerator in range(1,21):
    # y = numerator/5 from 0.2 to 4.0 (positive)
    y = numerator / 5
    x = math.sqrt(y**3)
    lhs = (y - x)**2
    rhs = 4*(y**2)
    if approx_equal(lhs, rhs):
        # Print exact or approximate results
        print(f"y={y:.3f}, x=sqrt({y}^3)={x:.6f}, (y-x)^2={lhs:.6f}, 4y^2={rhs:.6f}")
        print(f"x + y = {x + y:.6f}")

# Also test integer y = 1 to 5
for y_int in range(1,6):
    y = y_int
    x = math.sqrt(y**3)
    lhs = (y - x)**2
    rhs = 4*(y**2)
    if approx_equal(lhs, rhs):
        print(f"y={y}, x={x}, (y-x)^2={lhs}, 4y^2={rhs}")
        print(f"x + y = {x + y}")

print("\nAlso check the case y=x (since x and y positive):")
# Try y=x: then y^3 = x^2 => y^3 = y^2 => y=1 or y=0
# y=1,x=1 checking second eq:
y = 1
x = 1
eq2 = (y - x)**2 == 4*y**2
print("y = x = 1:", eq2, "sum =", x+y)

# The outputs help conjecture the value(s) of x+y.
```
