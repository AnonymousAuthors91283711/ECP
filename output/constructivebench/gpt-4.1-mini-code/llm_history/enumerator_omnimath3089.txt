This problem counts integer pairs (p1, p2) with p2 = 4 * p1 + 3, p1 in (25, 75), and p2 in (120, 250).

To enumerate such pairs:
- p1 must be integer strictly between 25 and 75,
- p2 = 4 * p1 + 3,
- p2 strictly between 120 and 250.

We will enumerate p1 within the range and test conditions to print pairs and count them.

```python
# Enumerate all integer pairs (p1, p2) with p2 = 4*p1+3,
# p1 between 25 and 75 (exclusive),
# p2 between 120 and 250 (exclusive).
# Print each pair and finally print the count.

def main():
    count = 0
    print("Enumerating pairs (p1, p2):")
    for p1 in range(26, 75):  # integers strictly between 25 and 75
        p2 = 4 * p1 + 3
        if 120 < p2 < 250:
            print(f"({p1}, {p2})")
            count += 1
    print(f"Total count: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
