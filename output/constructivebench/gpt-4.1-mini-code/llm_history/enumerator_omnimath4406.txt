The problem involves finding integer values \( m \) such that the real number \( x = \text{omnimath4406\_answer}(m) \) satisfies the given trigonometric equation:

\[
\sin^3 x (1 + \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}) + \cos^3 x (1 + \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}) = \cos 2x.
\]

We want to enumerate possible values of \( m \) and compute \( x \) accordingly. Since the exact form of \(\text{omnimath4406\_answer}\) is unknown ("sorry"), we can start guessing and testing integer values \( m \) in a small range and check if their \( x \) values satisfy the equation numerically, printing candidate \( m \) and \( x \) values that nearly satisfy the equation.

The code will:
- For integer \( m \) in \([-10, 10]\),
- Choose some \( x(m) \) hypotheses, e.g., multiples of \(\pi/4\), or try \( x = m \cdot \pi/4 \),
- For each \( x \), compute the left and right sides,
- Check if their difference is close to zero (within tolerance),
- Print candidates with their \( m, x \), LHS, RHS, and difference.

This will allow conjecturing the form of \(\text{omnimath4406\_answer}\) and the exact solutions.

```python
import math

# We'll try integer m in [-10, 10], setting x = m * (pi/4) as a hypothesis.
# For each x, test the equation:
# sin^3 x * (1 + cos x / sin x) + cos^3 x * (1 + sin x / cos x) ?= cos 2x

def lhs(x):
    # Handle possible division by zero by checking sine and cosine
    s = math.sin(x)
    c = math.cos(x)
    if abs(s) < 1e-14 or abs(c) < 1e-14:
        return None
    term1 = s**3 * (1 + c / s)
    term2 = c**3 * (1 + s / c)
    return term1 + term2

def rhs(x):
    return math.cos(2 * x)

def main():
    print("Testing x = m * pi/4 for integer m in [-10,10]")
    tol = 1e-12
    for m in range(-10, 11):
        x = m * math.pi / 4
        left = lhs(x)
        if left is None:
            # Avoid division by zero
            continue
        right = rhs(x)
        diff = left - right
        if abs(diff) < tol:
            print(f"m={m}, x={x:.12f}, lhs={left:.12f}, rhs={right:.12f}, diff={diff:.3e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
