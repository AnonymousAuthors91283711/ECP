The main issue is that in the definition of P2011AIMEII_5_answer, r is not in scope. Since P2011AIMEII_5_answer is defined outside the theorem, it cannot refer to variables a, r, or hr. Instead, the answer should be an expression parametrized by a and r, or better, the final formula expressing the sum ∑ k ∈ range 6033 a * r^k in terms of the given sums ∑ k ∈ range 2011 a * r^k = 200 and ∑ k ∈ range 4022 a * r^k = 380.

Recall that ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} a r^k = a (1 - r^n) / (1 - r).

So:

S_2011 = a * (1 - r^{2011}) / (1 - r) = 200

S_4022 = a * (1 - r^{4022}) / (1 - r) = 380

The question is to find:

S_6033 = a * (1 - r^{6033}) / (1 - r) = ?

From these, if we define q := r^{2011}, then:

S_2011 = a * (1 - q) / (1 - r) = 200

S_4022 = a * (1 - q^2) / (1 - r) = 380

Let c := a/(1 - r), then:

c (1 - q) = 200

c (1 - q^2) = 380

From these two:

Divide the second by the first:

(1 - q^2) / (1 - q) = 380 / 200 = 19 / 10 = 1.9

But (1 - q^2)/(1 - q) = 1 + q

So,

1 + q = 1.9 ⇒ q = 0.9

Now,

c (1 - q) = 200

c (1 - 0.9) = 200

c * 0.1 = 200 ⇒ c = 2000

Therefore,

S_6033 = c (1 - q^3) = 2000 * (1 - 0.9^3)

0.9^3 = 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.729

1 - 0.729 = 0.271

S_6033 = 2000 * 0.271 = 542

Hence, the value is 542.

We can express that in Lean as: (200 * (1 - r^(6033))) / (1 - r^(2011))

since q = r^{2011}, so r^{6033} = q^3

So the expression is:

200 * (1 - r^{6033}) / (1 - r^{2011})

But now to put this in Lean, which variables are in scope?

Since r is not in scope in the definition outside the theorem, the best is to define P2011AIMEII_5_answer as a function of r: ℝ → ℝ, or better as an inside-theorem let-binding.

Alternatively, define it inside the theorem.

Given the problem statement, I will fix the expression replacement as a function taking a, r.

But per request, final answer is to be a closed form with no free variables, usable in the theorem.

As an explicit number for the answer:

542

So the answer is 542.

Hence the closed-form answer is 542.

So in Lean:

noncomputable abbrev P2011AIMEII_5_answer : ℝ := 542

This avoids the scoping problem and is correct according to the algebra.
