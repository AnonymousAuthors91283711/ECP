Problem analysis:
We have two strictly increasing integer sequences \(a_n\), \(b_n\) with \(a_1 = b_1 = 1\), \(a_2 \leq b_2\), and some \(n\) with \(a_n b_n = 2010\). The problem asks for the greatest such \(n\).

We want to enumerate pairs \((a_n, b_n)\) with \(a_n < a_{n+1}\), \(b_n < b_{n+1}\), \(a_1 = b_1 = 1\), \(a_2 \leq b_2\) and find \(n\) with \(a_n b_n = 2010\).

We seek greatest such \(n\), so let's enumerate:

- Divisors of 2010 = \(1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30, 67, 134, 201, 335, 402, 670, 1005, 2010\).
- For fixed \(n\), \(a_n b_n = 2010\) means \(a_n\) and \(b_n\) is a divisor pair.
- Sequences are strictly increasing with first term = 1.
- \(a_2 \leq b_2\).
- We'll try to find the largest \(n\) where \(a_n b_n = 2010\) for some increasing sequences.

To simplify enumeration, let's fix \(a_n\), \(b_n = 2010 / a_n\) both integers.

Enumerate candidate \(n\) from 1 up to some max (say 20), and possible \(a_n\), \(b_n\) pairs.

We try to construct sequences starting with 1, then stepping up to \(a_n, b_n\) at position \(n\) for each divisor pair and check all monotone constraints and \(a_2 \le b_2\).

We'll print all usable \(n\) and at the end print max.

```python
# Enumerate possible n with a_n * b_n = 2010 and sequences a, b strictly increasing,
# starting with a_1 = b_1 = 1, a_2 <= b_2. Print all found solutions and max n.

def divisors(n):
    divs = []
    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5)+1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divs.append(i)
            if i*i != n:
                divs.append(n//i)
    return sorted(divs)

def check_seq(a2, b2, n, an, bn):
    # sequences a, b must be strictly increasing integers starting at 1
    # a_1=1, b_1=1, a_2 = a2, b_2 = b2 with a2 <= b2
    if not (1 < a2 <= b2):  
        return False
    # For n=1, a_1*b_1=1*1=1 !=2010 no
    # For n=2 check if a2 * b2 == 2010 (or later n)
    # We'll assume monotone increments from 1 to a2 and 1 to b2 then to an and bn at n:
    # We can have strictly increasing sequences like:
    # a:1 < a2 < ... < an
    # b:1 < b2 < ... < bn
    # with a_n * b_n = 2010

    # To ensure a, b strictly increasing integer sequences between indices,
    # minimal increments are steps of 1.

    # minimal length for strictly increasing from 1 to an is (an - 1 + 1) (value steps)
    # similarly for b.

    # Number of steps needed to reach an from a2 is an - a2 (if n>2)
    # Similarly for b.

    # To reach position n from 2, need enough steps for increments:
    # n-2 steps to increase from a2 to an >= n -2
    if an <= a2 or bn <= b2:
        return False
    # We can always define monotone sequences if differences are large enough
    # So final check for sequence plausibility:
    # length n >= max(an -1, bn -1)+1 to ensure possible increments
    # Since we only enumerate small n, check n >= max(an, bn)
    # Let's relax and accept if an and bn >= n (since sequences are increasing from 1)
    if an < n or bn < n:
        return False
    return True
