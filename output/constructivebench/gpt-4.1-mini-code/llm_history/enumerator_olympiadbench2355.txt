This problem involves two rolls. The first roll picks a face from `initialFaces`. The second roll updates the faces depending on the parity of the first roll's result.

We want to enumerate all pairs `(x, y)` where `x` is from `initialFaces` and `y` is from `updateFaces(x)`, then count how many pairs have `y = 2`.

We'll print the pairs that yield the second roll `2`, along with counts and the fraction.

```python
# Enumerate pairs (x, y) where x in initialFaces, y in updateFaces(x)
# Print pairs where y == 2, count them and total pairs, then print fraction

initialFaces = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8]

def updateFaces(x):
    if x % 2 == 1:
        return [2*y if y % 2 == 1 else y for y in initialFaces]
    else:
        return [y//2 if y % 2 == 0 else y for y in initialFaces]

count_favorable = 0
total = 0

for x in initialFaces:
    faces = updateFaces(x)
    for y in faces:
        total += 1
        if y == 2:
            count_favorable += 1
            print(f"First roll: {x}, Second roll: {y}")

print(f"Favorable outcomes: {count_favorable}")
print(f"Total outcomes: {total}")
print(f"Fraction favorable = {count_favorable}/{total} = {count_favorable/total}")
```
