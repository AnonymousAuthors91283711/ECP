Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: { (p, x, y) : ℕ × ℕ × ℕ | p = 2 ∧ x > 0 ∧ y > 0 ∧ ∃ a : ℕ, x + y = 2 ^ a }

The proposed answer is mostly correct but incomplete. It correctly identifies the case when p=2 (which simplifies the equations significantly since p-1=1), but it doesn't cover other prime values of p. The ground truth answer would need to include solutions for all primes p, not just p=2. The proposed answer is correct for the p=2 case but misses other possible solutions.
