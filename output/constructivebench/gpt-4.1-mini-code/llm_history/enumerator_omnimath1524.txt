[write_program]
The problem is to count natural numbers n such that 0 < n < 1998 and gcd(n,1547) = 1. We want the size of the set {n : 0 < n < 1998, gcd(n,1547)=1}.

Since 1547 is fixed, let's factor it to find its prime factors. Then use inclusion-exclusion to count numbers up to 1997 coprime with 1547.

The program will:
- Factor 1547 (small number).
- Enumerate values n from 1 to 1997.
- Check gcd(n,1547) = 1 and print each such n.
- Finally, print the count.

Output is limited to 400 tokens, so limit printingâ€”just print counts and sample coprime values.

```python
from math import gcd

def factor(n):
    # Trial division for factorization
    factors = []
    d = 2
    while d*d <= n:
        cnt = 0
        while n % d == 0:
            n //= d
            cnt += 1
        if cnt > 0:
            factors.append((d,cnt))
        d += 1
    if n > 1:
        factors.append((n,1))
    return factors

def main():
    N = 1998
    m = 1547
    print(f"Parameters: N={N}, m={m}")
    fs = factor(m)
    ps = [p for p,_ in fs]
    
    count = 0
    # Enumerate numbers coprime to m below N
    for n in range(1, N):
        if gcd(n,m) == 1:
            print(f"Coprime: {n}")
            count += 1
            if count >= 20:
                print("... (only first 20 coprimes shown)")
                break
    # To ensure correctness: use Euler's totient function formula
    phi = m
    for p in ps:
        phi -= phi // p
    # Count coprime numbers < 1998 = from 1 to 1997
    # Total cycles: floor((1997)//m) * phi + remainder coprime count in last partial cycle
    div, mod = divmod(N-1,m)
    # Count coprime numbers in partial cycle [1, mod]
    partial_count = 0
    for r in range(1,mod+1):
        if gcd(r,m) == 1:
            partial_count += 1
    total_count = div * phi + partial_count
    print(f"Count of n with 0<n<{N} and gcd(n,{m})=1: {total_count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
