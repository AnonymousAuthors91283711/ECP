The problem asks for the least natural number \( x \) such that the average of six numbers (including \( x \)) is at least 3 greater than the average of the first five numbers. This boils down to enumerating values of \( x \) that satisfy the inequality:

\[
\frac{90 + 80 + 70 + 60 + 85 + x}{6} \geq \frac{90 + 80 + 70 + 60 + 85}{5} + 3
\]

We compute the fixed average of the first five numbers and then try increasing values of \( x \) to find the smallest \( x \) where the inequality holds.

```python
# Enumerate the smallest x making the average jump by at least 3 after adding x
def main():
    scores = [90, 80, 70, 60, 85]
    sum5 = sum(scores)
    avg5 = sum5 / 5
    target = avg5 + 3
    print(f"Average of first five: {avg5}")
    print(f"Target average with x: {target}")

    # x >= 0 integers, find least x with avg6 >= target
    for x in range(200):  # range ample for natural x
        avg6 = (sum5 + x) / 6
        if avg6 >= target:
            print(f"Found x = {x} with average {(sum5 + x)}/6 = {avg6}")
            break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
