The problem appears related to simplifying or expressing \(3 \log_7 23\) possibly as a nice number or in terms of known constants. Since \(\log_7 23\) is irrational, we can try close rational approximations.

We will attempt to find simple rational approximations \(\frac{p}{q}\) to \(\log_7 23\) by enumerating small \(p,q\), then compute \(3 \times \frac{p}{q}\) and check how close \(7^{p/q}\) is to 23. This might suggest a neat expression for \(3 \log_7 23\).

The program will print the fractions \(\frac{p}{q}\), the value \(3 \times \frac{p}{q}\), and \(7^{p/q}\) to find candidates, focusing on small numerators and denominators for manageable output.

```python
# Enumerate rational approximations p/q to log_7(23), print 3*(p/q) and 7^(p/q)
# to guess an exact form or nice approximation for 3*log_7(23).

from math import log

base = 7
val = 23
log_val = log(val, base)  # exact log base 7 of 23
target = 3 * log_val

print(f"log_7(23) ≈ {log_val:.10f}")
print(f"3 * log_7(23) ≈ {target:.10f}")

max_denom = 10
threshold = 0.01  # print only good approximations

for q in range(1, max_denom+1):
    # Try p near log_val * q
    p_approx = int(round(log_val * q))
    for p in range(p_approx - 1, p_approx + 2):
        if p <= 0:
            continue
        # fraction approximation to log_7(23)
        approx = p / q
        error = abs(log_val - approx)
        if error < threshold:
            val_approx = base ** approx
            val_3log = 3 * approx
            print(f"p/q={p}/{q} ≈ {approx:.6f}, 7^(p/q)={val_approx:.6f}, 3*(p/q)={val_3log:.6f}, error={error:.6f}")
```
