The problem is about finding three distinct integers \(a, b, c\) that form an arithmetic progression (since \(b - a = c - b\)), their product is 17955, and satisfy a ratio condition with an integer \(r\). Then we want to find their sum \(a+b+c\).

Key constraints:
- \(a,b,c\) distinct integers
- \(b - a = c - b = d\), so \(b = a + d\), \(c = a + 2d\)
- \(a \cdot b \cdot c = 17955\)
- There exists \(r\) integer such that:
  \((3b + c) = r(3a + b)\), and \((3c + a) = r(3b + c)\)
- Then output \(a + b + c\)

We will:
- Iterate over integer \(d\) from -50 to 50 (excluding 0)
- Iterate over integer \(a\) within a reasonable range (-50 to 50)
- Check product and ratio conditions
- Print candidate triples and their sums when conditions hold

This will help conjecture the answer.

```python
# Enumerate integer triples (a,b,c) in arithmetic progression with product 17955
# and check ratio condition with integer r.

def main():
    product_target = 17955
    limit = 50  # range for a and d

    for d in range(-limit, limit+1):
        if d == 0:
            continue
        for a in range(-limit, limit+1):
            b = a + d
            c = a + 2*d
            if a == b or b == c or a == c:
                continue
            if a * b * c != product_target:
                continue

            # Check for integer r satisfying:
            # (3b + c) = r (3a + b), (3c + a) = r (3b + c)
            lhs1 = 3*b + c
            rhs1 = 3*a + b
            if rhs1 == 0:
                continue
            if lhs1 % rhs1 != 0:
                continue
            r = lhs1 // rhs1

            lhs2 = 3*c + a
            rhs2 = 3*b + c
            if rhs2 == 0:
                continue
            if lhs2 != r * rhs2:
                continue

            total = a + b + c
            print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, r={r}, sum={total}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The original program attempts to find all integer triples (a,b,c) in arithmetic progression whose product is 17955, satisfying certain ratio conditions involving r and the sum a+b+c. It enumerates a and common difference d in a range -50 to 50 and checks the conditions. The program prints all satisfying tuples.

The given output is empty, indicating no solutions found in that range. The problem likely has solutions outside that range, because the product 17955 is quite large, and the factors (a,b,c) may be larger in magnitude than ±50. So the search space used is too small to find any solutions.

Further, the program skips the case d=0, which is correct since a,b,c must be distinct. The checks for integer r are correct.

Thus, the main fix is to increase the search bounds considerably to find solutions. But increasing unboundedly could explode runtime, so we should factor the target product to get likely bounds.

17955 factors as 3 * 5 * 7 * 171 = 3*5*7*3*3*19 = 3^3 * 5 * 7 * 19, so the factors could be large.

Also, since a,b,c are in arithmetic progression: (a,b,c) = (a, a+d, a+2d) with d ≠ 0.

Their product is: a * (a+d) * (a+2d) = 17955.

We can try iterating over d and solve for integer a.

But to limit computations, we can iterat d over factors of 17955, since large d will be unlikely.

Alternatively, we can iterate over all divisors of 17955, and check arithmetic progressions accordingly.

Therefore, an efficient approach is:

- Iterate over d in a reasonable range, e.g. test all integer divisors ± factors of 17955.

- For each d ≠ 0, find all integer a where a*(a+d)*(a+2d)=17955.

- Solve the cubic equation for a and check if integer solutions exist.

Another approach is to note product and arithmetic progression:

Let midpoint be b = a + d

Since a,b,c in AP: b = (a + c)/2

Sum = a + b + c = 3b, so total sum = 3b.

Further, the ratios involve r satisfying (3b + c)

The original "program" is essentially empty; it only contains problem description and no actual Python code to enumerate or check solutions. Therefore, it cannot be accepted.

The problem is to find distinct integers \(a,b,c\) such that:

- \(a \neq b \neq c \neq a\)
- \(abc = 17955\)
- \(b - a = c - b\) (the three integers are in arithmetic progression)
- There exists an integer \(r\) such that 
  \[
  3b + c = r(3a + b),\quad 3c + a = r(3b + c)
  \]
- Determine \(a + b + c\).

We are asked for \(a+b+c\) that satisfies the above.

Because of the arithmetic progression condition, if the common difference is \(d\), then \(b = a + d\), and \(c = a + 2d\). Substituting that, the product is:
\[
a (a + d) (a + 2d) = 17955
\]

We need integers \(a,d\neq 0\) (to ensure distinctness) satisfying the above, and also the \(r\) condition.

The \(r\) condition is a bit tricky, but from the equalities:
\[
3b + c = r (3a + b) \\
3c + a = r (3b + c)
\]

If we denote \(A = a, B = a+d, C = a+2d\), substitute and try to find integer \(r\).

Because this problem is complicated, I will write an enumerator that simply tries reasonable \(a,d\) in some range and tests these conditions.

Judging the original (empty) "program": It just returns "Error: Program is empty".

Thus, <<<False>>> is appropriate.

I will provide a corrected program that enumerates possible integer triples \(a,b,c\) in arithmetic progression with product 17955, tests the \(r\) condition, and prints each valid \((a,b,c,a+b+c)\).

Due to the problem magnitude, to keep runtime feasible, only search within a reasonable range for \(a,d\).

# Find integers a,b,c distinct in arithmetic progression with product 17955,
