theorem P2003AMCA_8 :
  let factors := {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ n ∣ 60}
  let favorable := {n ∈ factors | n < 7}
  (Set.ncard favorable : ℚ) / Set.ncard factors = P2003AMCA_8_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Divisors of 60:
Favorable divisor: 1
Favorable divisor: 2
Favorable divisor: 3
Favorable divisor: 4
Favorable divisor: 5
Favorable divisor: 6
Other divisor: 10
Other divisor: 12
Other divisor: 15
Other divisor: 20
Other divisor: 30
Other divisor: 60
Ratio favorable/total = 6/12 = 1/2. Expected Answer Type: ℚ
<<<(6 : ℚ) / 12>>>
