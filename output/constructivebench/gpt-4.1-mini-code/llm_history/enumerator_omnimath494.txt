The problem asks to find the cardinality of the set of tuples \((x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2)\) where \(x_1,x_2 \in \text{Fin }5\) and \(y_1,y_2 \in \text{Fin }6\), and such that \(x_1 < x_2\) and \(y_1 < y_2\).

This is the count of strictly increasing pairs in each coordinate, so the number of such tuples is \(\binom{5}{2} \times \binom{6}{2}\).

Let's write a program enumerating all such tuples and counting them:

```python
# Enumerate all tuples (x1,y1,x2,y2) with x1,x2 in [0..4], y1,y2 in [0..5]
# such that x1 < x2 and y1 < y2, print them and count total.

def main():
    count = 0
    for x1 in range(5):
        for x2 in range(5):
            if x1 >= x2:
                continue
            for y1 in range(6):
                for y2 in range(6):
                    if y1 < y2:
                        print(f"(x1={x1}, y1={y1}, x2={x2}, y2={y2})")
                        count += 1
    print("Total count:", count)
    from math import comb
    print("Check with combination formula:", comb(5,2)*comb(6,2))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
