The problem involves enumerating pairs of outcomes from given discrete probability distributions for English and History, then summing probabilities where a certain weighted average condition is met. The English and History weights and probabilities are provided. The goal is to enumerate all contributing pairs and compute the sum of their probabilities satisfying the inequality involving their scores.

To explore and conjecture the answer, I'll write a Python program to:
- Use the given discrete distributions
- Enumerate all pairs (e, h)
- Check the condition and sum probabilities if it holds
- Print each pair with its probability contribution immediately
- Print the total at the end

```python
# Enumerate pairs from English and History discrete distributions,
# sum and print probabilities where average score condition holds.
def main():
    english_probs = [(4, 1/6), (3, 1/4), (2, 5/12)]
    history_probs = [(4, 1/4), (3, 1/3), (2, 5/12)]
    
    total_prob = 0.0
    # Constants in the inequality: (4 + 4 + e + h)/4 >= 7/2  ->  (8 + e + h)/4 >= 3.5
    # Multiply both sides by 4: 8 + e + h >= 14  ->  e + h >= 6
    # So we need pairs (e, h) with e + h >= 6
    for e_score, e_prob in english_probs:
        for h_score, h_prob in history_probs:
            s = e_score + h_score
            if s >= 6:
                contrib = e_prob * h_prob
                print(f"e={e_score}, h={h_score}, prob={contrib:.6f}")
                total_prob += contrib
    print(f"Total probability sum: {total_prob:.6f}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
