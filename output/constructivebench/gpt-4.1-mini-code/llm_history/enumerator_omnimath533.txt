The problem asks to find all triples of natural numbers \((a, b, c)\) such that \(2^a + 2^b = c!\). To assist in formulating a conjecture, we enumerate plausible triples by scanning over small values of \(a, b, c\) and print all solutions found.

```python
from math import factorial

# Enumerate triples (a,b,c) with a,b,c <= 15 (arbitrary small bound)
# and check if 2^a + 2^b = c!
# Print each found triple immediately.

max_val = 15

for c in range(0, max_val + 1):
    f = factorial(c)
    # Generate all pairs (a,b) with a,b in [0, max_val] and a<=b for uniqueness
    for a in range(0, max_val + 1):
        # Since 2^a <= 2^b (if a <= b), and sum grows quickly, break early
        if 2**a > f:  # no need to continue if 2^a already exceeds factorial
            break
        for b in range(a, max_val + 1):
            s = 2**a + 2**b
            if s > f:
                break
            if s == f:
                print(f"Found: 2^{a} + 2^{b} = {c}! = {f}")
```
