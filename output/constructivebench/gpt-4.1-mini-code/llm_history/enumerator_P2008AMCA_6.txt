The problem seems to involve a system of equations with real variables sticker_price, rebate_A, and rebate_B defined as linear expressions involving sticker_price. The condition rebate_B - rebate_A = 15 should determine sticker_price.

We want to find sticker_price values satisfying the equation, then print out candidates.

Since the relationships are linear and involve decimals, solving exactly and enumerating close integers or rational numbers near the solution might help observe the pattern or conjecture the exact value.

Given rebate_A = 0.85 * sticker_price - 90 and rebate_B = 0.75 * sticker_price,

rebate_B - rebate_A = 15 expands to:

0.75 * sticker_price - (0.85 * sticker_price - 90) = 15

=> 0.75 * sticker_price - 0.85 * sticker_price + 90 = 15

=> -0.10 * sticker_price + 90 = 15

=> -0.10 * sticker_price = -75

=> sticker_price = 750 exactly.

Our enumerator will try sticker_prices around this value (integers) to verify.

```python
# Enumerate sticker prices around the expected solution to verify rebate_B - rebate_A = 15
def rebate_A(sticker_price): return 0.85 * sticker_price - 90
def rebate_B(sticker_price): return 0.75 * sticker_price

print("Enumerating sticker_price values and rebate_B - rebate_A values:")

for sp in range(740, 761):  # 740 to 760 inclusive
    diff = rebate_B(sp) - rebate_A(sp)
    if abs(diff - 15) < 1e-9:
        print(f"Exact match: sticker_price={sp}, rebate_B - rebate_A={diff}")
    else:
        print(f"sticker_price={sp}, rebate_B - rebate_A={diff:.5f}")

print("\nExact solution from algebra:")
# Calculate exact sticker_price as a Fraction for exactness
from fractions import Fraction
sticker_fraction = Fraction(75, 0.10)  # 75 / 0.10 = 750
print(f"sticker_price = {float(sticker_fraction)} (exactly {sticker_fraction})")
```
