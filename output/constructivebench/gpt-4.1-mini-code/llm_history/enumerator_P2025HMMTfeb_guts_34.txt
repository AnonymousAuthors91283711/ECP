The problem asks to find how many prime numbers \( n \) satisfy:
- \( 2^8 \leq n \leq 9^8 \)
- All digits of \( n \) in base 10 are between 2 and 9 inclusive
- All digits are distinct
- \( n \) is prime

We will enumerate all such numbers by:
- Generating digit sets from {2,...,9} with distinct digits
- Constructing numbers from these digits (ensure no leading zeroâ€”no zeros allowed anyway)
- Check if they are in range and prime
- Print each prime found
- Finally print how many such primes exist

We must prioritize exact values, print progressively and stay under 400 tokens. We use sympy for prime checking for simplicity.

```python
from sympy import isprime

def digits_to_num(digs):
    return int("".join(map(str, digs)))

def main():
    low = 2**8      # 256
    high = 9**8     # 43046721
    digits = [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

    found = []
    # We try all permutations of distinct digits length 3 to 8 (since 2^8=256 is 3-digits, 9^8=8-digits)
    from itertools import permutations
    print(f"Searching primes with digits 2-9 distinct in [{low}, {high}]")

    for length in range(3, 9):
        for p in permutations(digits, length):
            n = digits_to_num(p)
            if n < low or n > high:
                continue
            if isprime(n):
                print(n)
                found.append(n)
    print("Count:", len(found))

if __name__=="__main__":
    main()
```
