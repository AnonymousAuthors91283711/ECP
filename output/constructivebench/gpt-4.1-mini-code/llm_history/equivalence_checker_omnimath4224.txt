Ground Truth Answer: fun a b => (a + b) / Nat.gcd a b
Proposed Answer: fun a b => 2 * (b - a + 1)
Let me analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about finding the minimal positive integer k such that iterating a certain function k times brings 0 back to 0. The function adds 'a' when below/at midpoint M, and subtracts 'b' when above M.

2. The ground truth answer uses gcd(a,b), which makes sense because the periodicity of such problems often relates to the least common multiple or gcd of the parameters.

3. The proposed answer is linear in (b-a), which doesn't account for the relationship between a and b through gcd. For example:
   - When a=2, b=4: gcd=2 → answer=3, proposed gives 2*(4-2+1)=6
   - When a=3, b=5: gcd=1 → answer=8, proposed gives 2*(5-3+1)=6

The answers clearly disagree in these cases, and the proposed answer doesn't match the pattern we'd expect from such problems.
