The problem counts natural numbers b between 1 and 41 such that 1 < b, b^1 ≤ 41, and 41 < b^2; equivalently, b > 1, b ≤ 41, and b^2 > 41. We want to enumerate such b and print them as we find them.

```python
# Enumerate integers b where 1 < b <= 41 and b^2 > 41
# Then count and display the list
def main():
    limit = 41
    found = []
    for b in range(2, limit + 1):
        if b**2 > limit:
            print(f"b = {b} (since {b}^2 = {b**2} > {limit})")
            found.append(b)
    print(f"Total count: {len(found)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
