(a,b) = (6,8). Expected Answer Type: Set (ℕ × ℕ)
The error in the provided Lean expression is due to an incomplete and incorrect use of a backslash `\` character followed by `∧ b = 2 * k + 4`. This is a syntax error in Lean.

From the enumerated answers (5,12) and (6,8), and the problem conditions that \( b > a > 0 \) and \( 2 \mid ab \), as well as \( x y = \frac{a b}{2} \) with \( x+2=a \) and \( y+2=b \), it suggests the pairs \((a,b)\) are characterized by \(a, b\) of the forms \(a = 2k+1, b=4k+4\) or \(a=2k, b=2k+4\) for some positive \(k\).

The corrected Lean set expression should write those two sets properly with no syntax error and with the required conditions:

<<<
{(a, b) | ∃ k : ℕ, k > 0 ∧ a = 2 * k + 1 ∧ b = 4 * k + 4} ∪ {(a, b) | ∃ k : ℕ, k > 0 ∧ a = 2 * k ∧ b = 2 * k + 4}
