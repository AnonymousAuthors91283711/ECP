The problem relates to finding the smallest integer M such that any set of M Boolean functions on an N-element domain contains an N-sized subset "monochromatic" in some coordinate. To explore this, we'll enumerate sets of Boolean functions and check this property for small N. We print candidate M values that suffice.

```python
from itertools import product, combinations

def monocolor_subset(flags, N):
    # flags: list of functions from {0..N-1} to {0,1}
    # Check if there exists c in {0,1} so that for all i in [0..N-1],
    # exists f in subset with f(i) == c
    for c in [0,1]:
        if all(any(f[i] == c for f in flags) for i in range(N)):
            return True
    return False

def is_sufficient(M, N):
    # Check if for every flags set of size M (subset of all 2**N functions),
    # there exists subset s of size N fulfilling the condition
    funcs = list(product((0,1), repeat=N))
    # Enumerate all subsets of size M of funcs
    # Check that for every such flags, there is s subset of size N with monochromatic coverage
    # Too large for exhaustive; test random or partial enumeration.
    # Here, we test some large random samples and also partial enumeration for small values.
    from random import sample
    tries = 0
    max_tries = 500
    total = len(funcs)
    if M > total:
        return True
    # Early test: For small N, do full check if feasible (M small)
    if N <= 4 and M <= 8:
        from itertools import combinations
        for flags in combinations(funcs, M):
            # For this flags, check no suitable s of size N exists => fail
            # We check all s of size N subsets of flags
            if not any(monocolor_subset(s, N) for s in combinations(flags, N)):
                return False
        return True
    # Else random checks
    while tries < max_tries:
        flags = sample(funcs, M)
        if not any(monocolor_subset(s, N) for s in combinations(flags, N)):
            return False
        tries += 1
    return True

def enumerate_candidates():
    # We test small N from 4 to 6, search minimal M satisfing
    for N in range(4,7):
        funcs_count = 2**N
        print(f"N = {N}, total funcs = {funcs_count}")
        for M in range(N, funcs_count+1):
            if is_sufficient(M, N):
                print(f"Minimal M for N={N} might be {M}")
                break

if __name__=="__main__":
    enumerate_candidates()
```
