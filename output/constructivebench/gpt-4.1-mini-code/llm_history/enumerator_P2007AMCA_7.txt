The problem involves five integers \(a,b,c,d,e\) forming an arithmetic progression with common difference \(r = b - a\). The conditions state that \(b - a = c - b = d - c = e - d\), meaning \(a,b,c,d,e\) are in arithmetic progression with common difference \(r\). The sum condition is \(a+b+c+d+e=30\).

We want to find the value of \(c\) that satisfies these conditions. Since the sequence is arithmetic,

\[
a, a+r, a+2r, a+3r, a+4r
\]

and the sum is

\[
5a + 10r = 30 \implies a + 2r = 6
\]

Because \(c = a + 2r\), this means \(c = 6\).

I will write a Python program enumerating small integer values for \(a\) and \(r\), printing the tuples and checking the sum, and then printing the corresponding \(c\).

```python
# Enumerate integer arithmetic sequences (a,a+r,a+2r,a+3r,a+4r)
# with sum 30 and print the middle term c=a+2r
for a in range(-10, 11):
    for r in range(-10, 11):
        seq = [a + i*r for i in range(5)]
        s = sum(seq)
        if s == 30:
            c = a + 2*r
            print(f"a={a}, r={r} -> sequence={seq}, sum={s}, c={c}")
```
