The problem describes a finite set of points with "lines" as 3-element subsets satisfying:
- Each line has exactly 3 points.
- Any two distinct lines intersect in exactly one point.
- Every pair of distinct points belongs to a unique line.
- At least one line exists.

This structure matches a finite projective plane of order \( n \), where:
- Number of points \( v = n^2 + n + 1 \).
- Lines are subsets of size 3 means \( n+1 = 3 \) so \( n=2 \).
- Hence, the problem's solution likely corresponds to \( n = 7 \) points.

I will enumerate candidate values of \( n \) (total points), check if they fit the known projective plane constraints with lines of size 3. 
For lines of size 3, \( n+1 = 3 \Rightarrow n=2 \), then total points \( = 7 \), total lines \( =7 \).
We can generate and verify properties for small \( n \) and print candidates.

```python
# Enumerate candidate values for the number of points n in a set forming lines of size 3
# with each pair of points in exactly one line of three points,
# and each pair of distinct lines intersecting in exactly one point.
# These are parameters of a projective plane of order q, where q+1 = 3 => q=2.
# So total points v = q^2 + q + 1 = 7. We test small v to see if conditions hold.

def valid_parameters(v):
    # For projective plane order q:
    # v = q^2 + q + 1
    # line size k = q + 1 = 3
    # number of lines b = v
    # each point on r = q + 1 = 3 lines
    # any two lines intersect in exactly one point
    # number of pairs of points: C(v,2)
    # number of pairs in all lines: b*C(k,2) = v * 3
    # each pair of points lies in exactly one line

    # Check if v-1 is divisible by 2
    # since q^2+q+1 = v, q satisfies q^2+q+1=v
    # We try q in range 1..5 and compute v and check if matches input v

    for q in range(1,6):
        if q**2 + q + 1 == v and q+1 ==3:
            return True, q
    return False, None

def main():
    max_v = 20  # small max to limit output
    print("Enumerating candidate numbers of points (v):")
    for v in range(3, max_v+1):
        valid, q = valid_parameters(v)
        if valid:
            print(f"v={v} fits projective plane parameters with order q={q} and line size {q+1}")
            print(f"Total lines b={v}, each line size={q+1}")
    # Output known solution
    print("Conjecture: The valid number of points is 7 corresponding to the projective plane of order 2.")
