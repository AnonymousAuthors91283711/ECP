The problem concerns counting integers \( k \) between 1 and 20 (inclusive) such that \(9\) divides \(k^2\). We know \(9 \mid k^2 \implies 3 \mid k\) because if a prime divides a square, it divides the base number. So \(k\) must be multiples of 3 between 1 and 20. We'll enumerate and count them.

```python
# Enumerate integers k in [1,20] with k^2 divisible by 9
# Note: 9|k^2 => 3|k
def divisible_by_9_square(max_n=20):
    count = 0
    for k in range(1, max_n+1):
        if (k*k) % 9 == 0:
            print(f"k={k}, k^2={k*k} divisible by 9")
            count += 1
    print(f"Total count = {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    divisible_by_9_square()
```
