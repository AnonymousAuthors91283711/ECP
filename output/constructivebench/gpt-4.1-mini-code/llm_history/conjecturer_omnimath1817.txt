theorem omnimath1817 : 
  IsGreatest {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ (Finset.sum (Finset.range (n + 1)) (fun k => (digits 10 k).sum)) - 1 = 10000} omnimath1817_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: No n found with the sum of digits sum equals 10001. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
The sum of digits function over the range [0..n] seems to never reach 10001 minus 1 = 10000 exactly; the set is empty, so no n satisfies it, and the greatest element would default to 0.
