[write_program]
The problem seems to involve a polynomial \(P\) satisfying a functional equation relating \(P(x+1)\) and \(P(x)\), along with a condition on values at specific points. To explore potential answers for \(P\left(\frac{7}{2}\right)\), I will write a Python program that tries small-degree polynomials to find those satisfying the functional equation and the numeric condition, then computes \(P(3.5)\).

```python
from sympy import symbols, Poly, Eq, solve, Rational

# We use small degrees to find polynomials P(x) satisfying:
# (x - 1) * P(x + 1) = (x + 2) * P(x),
# and P(2)^2 == P(3).

x = symbols('x')
max_degree = 5  # small degrees only for efficiency

def poly_expr(coeffs):
    # coeffs: list of coefficients [a0, a1, ..., an]
    return sum(c * x**i for i, c in enumerate(coeffs))

print("Trying polynomials up to degree", max_degree)
found = []

for deg in range(1, max_degree+1):
    # coefficients to solve for: a0,...,a_deg with a_deg != 0
    coeffs = symbols(' '.join(f'a{i}' for i in range(deg+1)))
    P = sum(c * x**i for i, c in enumerate(coeffs))

    # Form the functional equation (x-1)*P(x+1) - (x+2)*P(x) == 0 polynomial
    Px1 = P.subs(x, x+1)
    FE = (x - 1)*Px1 - (x + 2)*P

    # This should be the zero polynomial, so all coefficients 0
    poly_FE = Poly(FE, x)
    equations = [Eq(c,0) for c in poly_FE.all_coeffs()]

    # Add condition P(2)**2 == P(3)
    P2 = P.subs(x, 2)
    P3 = P.subs(x, 3)
    equations.append(Eq(P2**2 - P3, 0))

    # Solve the system
    sol = solve(equations, coeffs, dict=True)

    # filter out zero polynomial (all zeros)
    sol = [s for s in sol if any(s[c] != 0 for c in coeffs)]

    for s in sol:
        # Construct polynomial with solution
        p = poly_expr([s[c] for c in coeffs])
        val = p.subs(x, Rational(7,2))
        print(f"Degree {deg} polynomial coefficients: {[s[c] for c in coeffs]}")
        print(f"P(7/2) = {val}")
        found.append(val)

if found:
    # print unique answers found
    vals = list(set(found))
    print("\nDistinct candidate values for P(7/2):")
    for v in vals:
        print(v)
else:
    print("No nonzero polynomials found satisfying the conditions.")
```
