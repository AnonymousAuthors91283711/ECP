This problem involves functions f: ℤ → ℤ where for every integer n, f(n) is divisible by 23, and we want the smallest positive integer k such that f(n+k) ≡ f(n) (mod 23) for all n.

We can try enumerating candidate functions f(n) = 23 * a(n) where a(n) is an integer-valued function, and look for the smallest k > 0 such that f(n+k) ≡ f(n) (mod 23).

Because f(n) is always divisible by 23, differences are multiples of 23, so the congruence mod 23 is always 0 mod 23 for any k. Thus, the problem reduces to finding the least positive k such that f(n+k) ≡ f(n) (mod 23), but since f(n) is always divisible by 23, this is always true for k=1. The tricky part is the condition k > 0 and the definition of the set for IsLeast.

However, let's test this numerically for various small k and example functions. We'll define functions f over a domain, e.g., f(n) = 23 * (some function of n), and check values for k from 1 to some threshold.

We'll print candidate k that satisfy the required condition for sample functions.

```python
# Enumerate candidate k values for functions f: Z→Z with f(n) divisible by 23 
# and check the smallest k > 0 such that f(n+k) ≡ f(n) mod 23 for all n.

def check_period(f, k, sample_range):
    # Check if for all n in sample_range, (f(n + k) - f(n)) % 23 == 0
    for n in sample_range:
        if (f(n + k) - f(n)) % 23 != 0:
            return False
    return True

def main():
    print("Testing functions f(n) = 23 * a(n) with different a(n) and candidate k")
    sample_range = range(-10, 11)  # Sample domain values
    
    # Sample functions a(n):
    # 1. a(n) = n (linear)
    # 2. a(n) = n^2 (quadratic)
    # 3. a(n) = 0 (constant zero)
    # 4. a(n) = n mod p for some p (periodic)
    
    def f_linear(n): return 23 * n
    def f_quad(n): return 23 * (n*n)
    def f_zero(n): return 0
    def f_mod5(n): return 23 * (n % 5)
    
    functions = [("linear n", f_linear), ("quadratic n^2", f_quad), ("zero", f_zero), ("mod5 periodic", f_mod5)]
    
    # We'll test candidate k from 1 to 20 and print those for which the condition holds for all sample n.
