[write_program]
The problem involves finding the smallest \( n \in \mathbb{N} \) such that there exist functions \( a, b, c: \text{Fin } n \to [0,1] \) with certain counting conditions on sums being less than 1 and greater than 2 over triples in \(\text{Fin } n \times \text{Fin } n \times \text{Fin } n\).

To assist in conjecturing \( \text{omnimath79_answer} \), I will enumerate values of \( n \) starting from 1 upwards, and attempt to construct or find evidence of functions \( a, b, c \) meeting the problem constraints.

We only consider small \( n \) due to computational limits and print intermediate values and parameters used. The program will print candidates for \( n \) if it can find such functions or at least print attempts and counts.

```python
import numpy as np
from itertools import product

def check_conditions(n):
    # We try to find arrays a,b,c in [0,1]^n such that:
    # Count of triples (i,j,k) with a[i]+b[j]+c[k]<1 >=2018
    # and count of triples with a[i]+b[j]+c[k]>2 >=2018
    #
    # Since 2018 triples is large, try uniform grids on [0,1].
    # The number of triples n^3 must be at least 2018, so n>=13.
    # Check n from small to a reasonable upper bound.
    
    # For simplicity try equally spaced points on [0,1]
    a = np.linspace(0,1,n)
    b = np.linspace(0,1,n)
    c = np.linspace(0,1,n)
    
    # Compute all sums and count
    total = n**3
    sums = np.add.outer(np.add.outer(a,b),c).flatten()
    
    count_less_1 = np.sum(sums < 1)
    count_greater_2 = np.sum(sums > 2)
    
    # print counts for this n
    print(f"n={n}: count sums<1 = {count_less_1}, sums>2 = {count_greater_2}")
    
    if count_less_1 >= 2018 and count_greater_2 >= 2018:
        print(f"Candidate n={n} satisfies conditions.")
        return True
    return False

def main():
    for n in range(1,30):
        # Only check if n^3 >=2018 to have enough triples
        if n**3 < 2018:
            continue
        found = check_conditions(n)
        if found:
            print(f"Smallest n satisfying the problem constraints is at most {n}")
            break
