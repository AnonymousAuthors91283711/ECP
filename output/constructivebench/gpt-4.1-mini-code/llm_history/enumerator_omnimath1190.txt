The problem asks to count subsets \( C \subseteq \{0,1,\ldots,8\} \) of size 5, satisfying:
- \( C \) either contains both 0 and 1, or contains neither 0 nor 1.
- \( C \) contains neither 2 nor 3.

We want to enumerate all such subsets, print each found subset, then print the total count.

```python
from itertools import combinations

# Universe is {0,...,8}
U = set(range(9))

# Condition:
# - Either {0,1} ⊆ C or {0,1} ∩ C = ∅
# - {2,3} ∩ C = ∅
# - |C|=5

# Exclude 2,3 upfront
possible_elements = U - {2,3}

count = 0
print("Enumerating subsets meeting conditions:")

for C in combinations(possible_elements, 5):
    Cset = set(C)
    # Check (C ⊇ {0,1} or C ∩ {0,1} = ∅)
    cond1 = (0 in Cset and 1 in Cset) or (0 not in Cset and 1 not in Cset)
    if cond1:
        print(sorted(C))  # Print the subset immediately
        count += 1

print("Total subsets found:", count)
```
