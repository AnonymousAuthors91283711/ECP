The problem involves a real polynomial \( P \) satisfying:
- \( P(1) = 1 \)
- For all real \( x \neq -7 \), 
\[
\frac{P(2x)}{P(x+1)} = 8 - \frac{56}{x+7}.
\]

We want to find \( P(-1) \).

To assist in conjecturing properties of \( P \), we'll:
- Try polynomials up to a small degree,
- For sample values of \( x \), verify the functional equation,
- Use these to deduce constraints on coefficients,
- Once a candidate polynomial is found, evaluate at \(-1\).

Below is a Python script enumerating possible polynomials with degrees up to 3 (since the rational function suggests degree at most 2 or 3) with rational coefficients. We'll verify the functional equation at several sample points and print candidates fulfilling it within reasonable numeric tolerance.

```python
# enumerator.py
from fractions import Fraction
import numpy as np

# We'll try polynomials P(x) = a0 + a1 x + a2 x^2 + a3 x^3 with rational coefficients from -5 to 5
# Condition: P(1) = 1
# Condition: For sample x values x != -7, P(2x)/P(x+1) = 8 - 56/(x+7)

# Sample points avoiding x = -7
sample_xs = [-10, -5, 0, 1, 2]
# Tolerance for floating-point equality
tol = 1e-10

def rational_range(minv, maxv):
    # Return list of Fraction from minv to maxv inclusive
    return [Fraction(i) for i in range(minv, maxv+1)]

def poly_eval(coeffs, x):
    # coeffs: list of coefficients, coeffs[0] + coeffs[1]*x + coeffs[2]*x^2 + ...
    val = Fraction(0)
    xp = Fraction(1)
    for c in coeffs:
        val += c * xp
        xp *= x
    return val

def check_poly(coeffs):
    # Check P(1) = 1
    if poly_eval(coeffs, Fraction(1)) != 1:
        return False
    # Check functional equation at sample points
    for x in sample_xs:
        x_frac = Fraction(x)
        num = poly_eval(coeffs, 2*x_frac)
        denom = poly_eval(coeffs, x_frac + 1)
        if denom == 0:
            return False
        lhs = num / denom
        rhs = Fraction(8) - Fraction(56, x_frac + 7)
        # Check equality within tolerance after converting to float
        if abs(float(lhs) - float(rhs)) > tol:
            return False
    return True

                # Print polynomial and P(-1)
                def frac_str(f):
                    if f.denominator == 1:
                        return str(f.numerator)

```
This program enumerates candidate polynomials, prints each candidate fulfilling the equation for our sampled x values, and outputs \( P(-1) \) exactly as a rational number to assist in conjecturing the true solution.
