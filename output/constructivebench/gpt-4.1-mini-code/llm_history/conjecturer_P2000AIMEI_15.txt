n=10, process(original)=[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 6, 10, 8, 4], pos of 9 in original=9
n=12, process(original)=[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 2, 6, 10, 4, 12, 8], pos of 11 in original=11. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<1001>>> 
Explanation: The process separates odd and even positions, placing all odd numbers first in the processed list. The number 1999 is the 1000th odd number, so its position in the original list is 1001, making pos = 2000 - 1001 = 999, thus the answer matches 1001.
