Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: 5
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer step by step.

The problem presents a simple arithmetic expression: 8 - (6 / (4 - 2))

Let's evaluate it:
1. First, evaluate the denominator (4 - 2) = 2
2. Then perform the division: 6 / 2 = 3
3. Finally, perform the subtraction: 8 - 3 = 5

The proposed answer is indeed 5, which matches our calculation. Since this is a straightforward arithmetic problem with no special domains or constraints to consider, the proposed answer is correct.
