The problem concerns natural numbers \( n \) between 1 and 1000 such that \( n \) and \( n^2 \) have base-3 representations with no digit equal to 2. The task is to enumerate such numbers and count them.

We will write a Python program to:
- Convert numbers to base 3 digits,
- Check if digits contain no 2,
- Iterate from 1 to 1000 and check the property for \( n \) and \( n^2 \),
- Print each qualifying \( n \) immediately,
- Finally print the count of such numbers.

```python
def to_base3(n):
    # Convert integer n to base-3 digit list, least significant digit last
    if n == 0:
        return [0]
    digits = []
    while n > 0:
        digits.append(n % 3)
        n //=3
    digits.reverse()
    return digits

def no_digit_two(digits):
    return all(d != 2 for d in digits)

count = 0
print("Using n in [1..1000], with n and n^2 in base 3 digits without '2':")
for n in range(1,1001):
    dn = to_base3(n)
    if no_digit_two(dn):
        dn2 = to_base3(n*n)
        if no_digit_two(dn2):
            print(n)
            count += 1
print("Total count:", count)
```
