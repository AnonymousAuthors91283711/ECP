The problem references a specific ordering of 5 elements labeled "A", "B", "C", "D", and "E". To assist, let's enumerate all permutations of these 5 elements and print them immediately. This enumeration will help observe patterns or identify the specific ordering mentioned. Due to the problem's context, we'll focus on listing permutations rather than calculating or verifying the theorem directly.

```python
from itertools import permutations

elements = ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E"]

for perm in permutations(elements):
    print(perm)
```
