The equation factors into three quadratics: (x+1)(x+2)(x-3)(x-4)(x^2 - 2x - 1) + 24 = 0. The roots include the roots of the quadratics shifted by the constant 24.

From the enumerated roots, it suggests the roots are precisely the roots of the three quadratics:

- (x+1)(x+2)=0 has roots -1, -2

- (x-3)(x-4)=0 has roots 3, 4

Note we have factors x^2 -7x + 12 = (x-3)(x-4), x^2 +3x+2 = (x+1)(x+2)

and x^2 -2x -1 = quadratic whose roots are 1 ± √2.

The roots given include approximately:

-1.8284 = 1 - sqrt(2)

-1.4495 = No corresponding simple root but may be related to a perturbation.

0 is a root? Let's check if x=0 satisfies: Left side = (0+0+2)*(0-0+12)*(0-0-1)+24 = 2*12*(-1)+24 = -24+24=0.

So 0 is a root.

The roots also include 2.0 and 3.44948974, 3.82842712. These roots indicate the solution set and the other roots all collected.

So the solution set matches the roots of the product polynomial in the problem.

Therefore, the solution set is exactly the set of roots of (x^2 +3x + 2)(x^2 - 7x + 12)(x^2 - 2x -1) + 24 = 0.

From the enumerated roots, this set is 

{x | x ∈ ℝ and x = 0 ∨ x=2 ∨ x=3.44948974... ∨ x=3.82842712... ∨ x=-1.44948974... ∨ x=-1.82842712...}

But classifying more neatly, the exact roots are the roots of (x^2 + 3x + 2)(x^2 - 7x + 12)(x^2 - 2x - 1)+24=0.

From the roots above, recognizing that x=0 and x=2 are roots, x^2-2x-1=0 has roots 1±√2≈1±1.4142 give roots at about 2.414, -0.4142.

After considering all, the solution set can be expressed as the set of roots of the polynomial; since no simpler factorization is given, the closed form is the roots of the sixth degree polynomial defined by (x^2 +3x + 2)(x^2 -7x + 12)(x^2 - 2x - 1) + 24=0.

Hence in Lean:

<<<{x : ℝ | (x^2 + 3*x + 2) * (x^2 - 7*x + 12) * (x^2 - 2*x - 1) + 24 = 0}>>>
