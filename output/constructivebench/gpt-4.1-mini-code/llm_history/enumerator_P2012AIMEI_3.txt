[write_program]
The problem asks for the number of functions \( f: \{1,\dots,9\} \to \{0,1,2\} \) such that each value 0, 1, 2 appears exactly 3 times, and there is exactly one index \( i \) with \( f(i) = i \) (assuming indices are 1-based where \( i \in \{1,\dots,9\} \)).

To assist in solving this problem, we will enumerate all such functions by:
- Fixing which index \( i \) satisfies \( f(i) = i \).
- Assigning values 0, 1, 2 to the remaining 8 indices so that each value appears exactly 3 times in total (including the fixed \( f(i) \)).
- Printing each valid function and counting.

We will assume 0-based indexing (0 to 8) for the program, interpreting \( f(i) = i \) as \( f(i) = i \) with \( i \in \{0,\dots,8\} \).

```python
import itertools

# Enumerate functions f: {0,...,8} â†’ {0,1,2}
# with exactly 3 zeros, 3 ones, 3 twos,
# and exactly one index i with f[i] == i.

def main():
    n = 9
    values = [0,1,2]
    total_count = 0
    # For each possible fixed point index i
    for fixed_i in range(n):
        # f[fixed_i] == fixed_i (value fixed_i must be in {0,1,2})
        if fixed_i > 2:
            # Since codomain is {0,1,2}, f[i] = i impossible for i>2
            continue
        fixed_val = fixed_i
        # So one of the counts of fixed_val is fixed: count fixed_val assigned one in fixed_i
        # Remaining counts for each value:
        counts = {0:3,1:3,2:3}
        counts[fixed_val] -= 1

        # Positions other than fixed_i
        positions = [j for j in range(n) if j != fixed_i]

        # Generate all ways to assign values to positions with counts
        # Create pool of values reflecting counts left
        pool = []
        for val in values:
            pool += [val]*counts[val]

        # Generate permutations of pool assigned to positions
        # To avoid duplicates, generate unique permutations
        # Use itertools.permutations and convert to set (costly but manageable here)
        # For efficiency, use multiset permutations approach:
        from collections import Counter

        def unique_perms(seq):
            counter = Counter(seq)
            def backtrack(path, counter):
                if len(path) == len(seq):
                    yield tuple(path)
                    return
                for x in counter:
                    if counter[x] > 0:
                        counter[x] -= 1
                        path.append(x)
                        yield from backtrack(path, counter)
                        path.pop()
                        counter[x] += 1
            yield from backtrack([], counter)

        count_i = 0
        for arr in unique_perms(pool):
            # Check the condition: exactly one fixed point
            # We fixed the point fixed_i already (f[fixed_i] == fixed_i)
            # So no other position j != fixed_i can have f[j] == j
            fixed_points_other = sum(1 for pos,val in zip(positions, arr) if pos == val)
            if fixed_points_other == 0:
                # Construct full function f
                f = [None]*n
                f[fixed_i] = fixed_val
                for idx,pos in enumerate(positions):
                    f[pos] = arr[idx]
                print(f"Fixed point at {fixed_i}: f = {f}")
                count_i += 1
        print(f"Count with fixed point {fixed_i} = {count_i}")
        total_count += count_i

    print(f"Total count of functions = {total_count}")

This script enumerates all solutions explicitly and prints them, grouped by the chosen fixed point index \( i \). This will help to detect patterns or verify the count for the original problem.
