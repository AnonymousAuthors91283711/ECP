The problem involves finding the number of integers \( S \) that can be represented as the sum \(\sum_{n=-2019}^{2019} f(n)\), where \( f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) satisfies the functional equation: 
\[
f(x^2) + f(y^2) = (f(x+y))^2 - 2xy \quad \forall x,y \in \mathbb{R}.
\]

Instead of proving directly, we enumerate possible functions \( f \) for some simpler subsets and sums to conjecture what the answer might be.

Key points and approach:
- Try small symmetric intervals, e.g., from \(-m\) to \(m\) for small \(m\).
- Try to infer the general form of \( f \) by guessing forms that satisfy the equation.
- The equation is intricate, but we can first understand whether linear or quadratic forms suit.
- Print all sums that appear for different \( f \) and intervals.

We enumerate for smaller ranges first, like \(-3 \ldots 3\), to keep the output manageable and get clues.

```python
# Enumerate possible f for small intervals to conjecture sums S = sum_{n=-m}^m f(n)
import math

def check_eq(f, x, y, tol=1e-9):
    # Check if f satisfies f(x^2)+f(y^2) = (f(x+y))^2 - 2*x*y
    lhs = f(x*x)+f(y*y)
    rhs = (f(x+y))**2 - 2*x*y
    return abs(lhs - rhs) < tol

def generate_candidates(x_vals):
    # We try functions of form f(t) = a*t + b, or f(t) = c Â± sqrt(...), etc.
    # But this function is complex; here, we try to find all f on domain x_vals mapping to reals f(x)
    # satisfying the equation for all pairs x,y in x_vals.
    # We'll attempt linear functions first.

    candidates = []

    # Try linear functions f(t) = a*t + b for some small integer values of a,b
    for a in [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]:
        for b in [-5,-2,-1,0,1,2,5]:
            def f(t, a=a, b=b): return a*t + b
            if all(check_eq(f,x,y) for x in x_vals for y in x_vals):
                candidates.append(f)
                print(f"Found linear candidate: f(t) = {a}*t + {b}")

    # Try constant functions f(t) = c
    for c in [-2,-1,0,1,2]:
        def f(t,c=c): return c
        if all(check_eq(f,x,y) for x in x_vals for y in x_vals):
            candidates.append(f)
            print(f"Found constant candidate: f(t) = {c}")

    # We can also try small quadratic functions but that may be expensive, so skip for brevity.

    return candidates

def sum_on_interval(f, m):
    s = 0
    for n in range(-m,m+1):
        s += f(n)
    return s

            s = sum_on_interval(f,m)
            if s not in sums:
                sums.add(s)
