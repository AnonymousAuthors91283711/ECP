The problem seems to involve finding the greatest integer \( k \) less than \(\frac{N}{100}\), where \(N = 100^2 \sqrt{2}\). To explore this, we can try small values for the integer \(k\) and check which satisfy \(k < \frac{N}{100}\).

We will:
- Compute \(N = 100^2 \sqrt{2}\).
- Compute \(N/100\).
- Enumerate integers \(k\) near the value \(N/100\).
- Print each \(k\) fulfilling \(k < N/100\).
- Identify the greatest such \(k\).

```python
import math

# Compute N and N/100 based on the problem
N = 100**2 * math.sqrt(2)
threshold = N / 100

print(f"N = {N}")
print(f"N / 100 = {threshold}")

# Enumerate integers k near threshold
start = int(math.floor(threshold)) - 5  # start a bit lower
end = int(math.ceil(threshold)) + 1     # up to just above threshold

candidates = []
for k in range(start, end):
    if k < threshold:
        candidates.append(k)
        print(f"k = {k} < {threshold}")

# Print maximum candidate
if candidates:
    max_k = max(candidates)
    print(f"Greatest integer k with k < N/100 is {max_k}")
else:
    print("No integer k found less than N/100")
```
