Ground Truth Answer: 9
Proposed Answer: 3
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking for the minimal positive real number 'a' such that there exists a positive 'b' making the polynomial X³ - aX² + bX - a have all real roots, and then finding the corresponding unique 'b' value when a=3.

2. The ground truth answer is 9, which is the correct value of 'b' when a=3.

3. The proposed answer is 3, which appears to be the minimal 'a' value (as indicated in the theorem statement where IsLeast gives 3), not the 'b' value.

The answers are referring to different things:
- Ground truth answer (9) is the correct 'b' value
- Proposed answer (3) is the 'a' value

Therefore, they are not equivalent answers to the same question.
