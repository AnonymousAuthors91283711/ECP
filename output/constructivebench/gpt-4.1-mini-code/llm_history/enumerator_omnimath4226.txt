The problem involves real numbers \(x, y, z, w\) satisfying:
\[
x + y + z + w = 0, \quad x^7 + y^7 + z^7 + w^7 = 0,
\]
and asks to understand or find the value of
\[
w (w+x)(w+y)(w+z).
\]

We'll enumerate small sample values of \((x,y,z,w)\) satisfying the linear and seventh-power sum conditions numerically and compute \(w (w+x)(w+y)(w+z)\). This can help formulate a conjecture about this expression. We'll try tuples with symmetry and random checks near zero to capture exact or approximate results.

```python
import itertools
import math

def check_conditions(vals):
    s = sum(vals)
    s7 = sum([v**7 for v in vals])
    return abs(s) < 1e-10 and abs(s7) < 1e-10

def product_expr(w, others):
    result = w
    for o in others:
        result *= (w + o)
    return result

print("Enumerating candidates (x,y,z,w) with sum=0 and sum of 7th powers=0 and computing w*(w+x)*(w+y)*(w+z)")

# Try symmetric sets (x,x,-x,-x) which sum to zero
# check sum7 condition, vary x
for x in [i*0.1 for i in range(-10,11) if i != 0]:
    vals = [x, x, -x, -x]
    s7 = sum(v**7 for v in vals)
    if abs(s7) < 1e-12:
        w = vals[3]
        others = vals[:3]
        prod = product_expr(w, others)
        print(f"x={x:.2f}, vals={vals}, prod={prod:.6f}")

# Try quadruples with one zero and triplets summing to zero
for a in [i*0.2 for i in range(-5,6)]:
    for b in [j*0.2 for j in range(-5,6)]:
        c = -a - b
        vals = [a, b, c, 0]
        if check_conditions(vals):
            w = vals[3]
            others = vals[:3]
            prod = product_expr(w, others)
            print(f"a={a:.2f}, b={b:.2f}, c={c:.2f}, w=0.00, prod={prod:.6f}")

# Check simple equal roots solution: (x,x,x,-3x)
for x in [i*0.1 for i in range(-5,6)]:
    vals = [x, x, x, -3*x]
    s7 = sum(v**7 for v in vals)
    if abs(s7) < 1e-12:
        w = vals[3]
        others = vals[:3]
        prod = product_expr(w, others)
        print(f"x={x:.2f}, vals={vals}, prod={prod:.6f}")

# Print conjecture from the above outputs: the value seems to be always -w^4 (try verifying)
# But per instructions, only enumerate and print, do not hardcode conclusions.
