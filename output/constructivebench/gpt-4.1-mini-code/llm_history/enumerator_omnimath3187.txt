The problem is to find a natural number \( x \) such that \( 3x - 5 = 16 \).

We can enumerate candidates \( x \) and print those that satisfy the equation.

```python
# Enumerate natural numbers x such that 3*x - 5 = 16
# Rearranged: 3*x = 21 => x = 7
# We'll verify by enumerating small natural numbers.

for x in range(20):
    if 3 * x - 5 == 16:
        print(f"Found x = {x}")
```
