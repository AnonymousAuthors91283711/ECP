[write_program]
The problem is a classic probability setup: two independent uniform arrivals A and B in given intervals, and the event their appointment times overlap for at least some duration (here 45 minutes = 0.75 hours). We want to enumerate possible overlaps to estimate the probability of collision.

We will define intervals and check pairs for overlap. Since times are continuous, enumerating all pairs is impossible; instead, we discretize both intervals finely and count pairs (a, b) where the intervals [a, a+0.75] and [b, b+0.75] overlap. Then we estimate the probability by ratio of counts to total.

We pick discrete grids with a small step (e.g., 0.01 hours = 36 seconds). Smaller step is more precise but longer runtime.

Output:
- Print sampled pair parameters for illustration.
- Print pairs where intervals overlap (collision condition).
- After enumeration, compute and print approximate probability (count collision pairs / total pairs).
- Print approximate probability as float.

```python
# Enumerate discrete time pairs to estimate collision probability
def intervals_overlap(a, b, length=0.75):
    return max(a, b) < min(a + length, b + length)

def main():
    # Intervals for A and B
    A_start, A_end = 0.0, 5.5    # 9:00am to 2:30pm, length 5.5 hours
    B_start, B_end = 0.5, 3.5    # 9:30am to 12:30pm, length 3 hours
    step = 0.01                  # 0.01 hours step (36 sec)

    # Generate sample arrival times for A and B
    A_times = [A_start + i * step for i in range(int((A_end - A_start) / step) + 1)]
    B_times = [B_start + i * step for i in range(int((B_end - B_start) / step) + 1)]

    total_pairs = 0
    collision_count = 0

    print(f"Sampling with step={step}, sizes: A={len(A_times)}, B={len(B_times)}")

    # Enumerate and count collisions
    for a in A_times:
        for b in B_times:
            total_pairs += 1
            if intervals_overlap(a, b):
                collision_count += 1
                print(f"Collision pair: A={a:.2f}, B={b:.2f}")

            if total_pairs >= 2000:  # limit outputs to control output length
                break
        if total_pairs >= 2000:
            break

    # Continue counting without printing to improve estimate
    for a in A_times[len(A_times)//2:]:
        for b in B_times:
            total_pairs += 1
            if intervals_overlap(a, b):
                collision_count += 1

    probability = collision_count / total_pairs
    print(f"Estimated collision probability â‰ˆ {probability:.5f}")
