The problem appears to be a simple arithmetic identity: "2 * 3 + 2 * 3" equals some number omnimath2938_answer. To assist in conjecturing the true answer, the program will compute and print the value of the expression for given parameters (here fixed) and output intermediate results.

```python
# Enumerate the value of the expression 2*3 + 2*3 and check the sum.
def main():
    a, b = 2, 3
    term1 = a * b
    term2 = a * b
    result = term1 + term2
    print(f"term1 = {term1}")
    print(f"term2 = {term2}")
    print(f"Sum = {term1} + {term2} = {result}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
