The problem involves finding natural numbers \(a, b, c, d\) satisfying:
\[
a + b + c + d = 48, \quad a + 3 = b - 3, \quad b - 3 = 3c, \quad 3c = \frac{d}{3}.
\]
We want to enumerate all quadruples \((a,b,c,d)\) that satisfy the above and print them.

```python
# Enumerate natural numbers (including zero) a,b,c,d satisfying:
# a+b+c+d=48,
# a+3 = b-3,
# b-3 = 3c,
# 3c = d/3,
# then print solutions immediately.

def main():
    # From equations:
    # a+3 = b-3 => b = a + 6
    # b-3 = 3c => (a+6)-3=3c => a+3=3c => c = (a+3)/3
    # 3c = d/3 => d = 9c
    # sum: a + b + c + d = 48 => a + (a+6) + c + 9c = 48 => 2a + 6 + 10c =48
    # => 2a +10c = 42 => a +5c =21
    # Also c = (a+3)/3 must be integer.

    print("Enumerating solutions (a,b,c,d) with conditions:")

    for a in range(0, 49):
        # Check if (a+3) divisible by 3 (for c integer)
        if (a+3) % 3 !=0:
            continue
        c = (a+3)//3
        # a + 5c = 21
        if a + 5*c != 21:
            continue
        b = a + 6
        d = 9 * c
        # Check sum
        if a + b + c + d == 48:
            print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, d={d}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
