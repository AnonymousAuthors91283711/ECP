N = 2, reversed = (2, 1), minimal swaps = 1
N = 3, reversed = (3, 2, 1), minimal swaps = 3
N = 4, reversed = (4, 3, 2, 1), minimal swaps = 6
N = 5, reversed = (5, 4, 3, 2, 1), minimal swaps = 10
N = 6, reversed = (6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1), minimal swaps = 15
For N=16, reversed list inversion count = 120 (known formula for max inversions). Expected Answer Type: ℕ
