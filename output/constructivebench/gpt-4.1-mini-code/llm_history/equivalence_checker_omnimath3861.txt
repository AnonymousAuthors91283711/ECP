Ground Truth Answer: {f | ∃ k, ∀ a, f a = k * a ∧ 0 < f a}
Proposed Answer: {f | ∃ c : ℕ, c > 0 ∧ (∀ n, f n = c * n)}
Let's analyze the equivalence between the ground truth answer and the proposed answer:

1. Both answers describe functions of the form f(n) = k*n (or c*n in the proposed answer)
2. Both require the multiplicative constant to be positive (k > 0 in ground truth, c > 0 in proposed)
3. The ground truth explicitly states ∀a, 0 < f a, but this is already implied by c > 0 and n ∈ ℕ in the proposed answer since:
   - For n = 0: f(0) = c*0 = 0, but 0 < f(0) would be false
   - However, the problem statement requires 0 < b in the condition, so f(0) might not be relevant

The only potential difference is that the ground truth might implicitly require f(0) > 0 (though the problem condition only uses f on positive inputs), while the proposed answer allows f(0) = 0. However, since the problem's condition only applies when 0 < b, the behavior at 0 doesn't affect the solution.
