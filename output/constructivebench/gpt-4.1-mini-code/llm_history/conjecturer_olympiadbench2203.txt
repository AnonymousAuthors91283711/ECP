The error arises because `(a = b = c = ⅓)` is not a valid Lean expression. Lean does not support chaining equalities like that directly. We need to split it into `(a = b ∧ b = c ∧ c = ⅓)`. Also, the given solution set is a union of conditions where two variables are equal and the third is zero, or all three equal and equal to ⅓.

We can thus write:

```lean
{ (a, b, c) | (a = b ∧ c = 0) ∨ (a = c ∧ b = 0) ∨ (b = c ∧ a = 0) ∨ (a = b ∧ b = c ∧ c = 1/3) }
```

Note: `⅓` is Lean notation for `1/3` in rationals/real.

This fixes the syntax and should compile.
