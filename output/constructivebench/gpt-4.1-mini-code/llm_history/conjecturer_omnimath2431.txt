Average area of sampled triangles: 15.000
Expected area according to problem is 15. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The error message in Lean arises because the expression `60 / 4` involves the division operation on real numbers, which requires the `Real.instDivInvMonoid` instance and is noncomputable. To fix this, we can mark the definition as `noncomputable` or rewrite the value using multiplication by the inverse which might also require noncomputability, but since the problem is an abstract math problem, marking as `noncomputable` is acceptable.

Also, since `60 / 4 = 15`, we can simply express the answer as `15` to keep it straightforward and avoid division altogether.

Explanation:
The enumerated answers and problem statement give that the expected area of the triangle formed by three independent uniform points on the sides equals one quarter of the original right triangle's area, which is 60. Therefore, expected area is 15.

Hence the final answer in Lean should be:

Average area of sampled triangles: 15.000
Expected area according to problem is 15. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The problem involves the expected value of the area of a triangle formed by random points on the three sides of a right triangle with sides 8, 15, and 17, area 60. The known result and the sampled averages strongly suggest the expected area is one-fourth of 60, i.e., 15.

The Lean error is caused by using "noncomputable def" inside an "abbrev" which expects a term, not a definition. Also, "abbrev" cannot be used twice for the same name.

To fix the error, we should directly assign the value 15.0 to the abbreviation omnimath2431_answer as a real number literal, no "noncomputable def," just

abbrev omnimath2431_answer : ℝ := 15

This complies with Lean syntax and matches the expected answer from the sampling and problem statement.
