The problem defines two functions \( f, g : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) under two linear functional equations and asks for the set where \( f(x) = g(x) \). We'll enumerate possible solutions for \( x \) on a small range of integers to guess the solution set. Since the relations are linear and hold for all \( x \), we can solve the system exactly for \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) as functions of \( x \), then find roots for \( f(x) = g(x) \).

```python
# Enumerate candidates x where f(x)=g(x) given:
# f(x) + 3g(x) = x^2 + x + 6
# 2f(x) + 4g(x) = 2x^2 + 4

def f_and_g(x):
    # Let f(x) = a, g(x) = b
    # Two equations:
    # a + 3b = x^2 + x + 6
    # 2a +4b = 2x^2 + 4
    #
    # Multiply first eq by 2: 2a + 6b = 2x^2 + 2x + 12
    # Subtract second eq: (2a+6b) - (2a+4b) = (2x^2+2x+12) - (2x^2 +4)
    # 2b = 2x + 8 --> b = x + 4
    #
    # Then a = (x^2 + x + 6) - 3b = x^2 + x + 6 -3(x+4) = x^2 + x + 6 -3x -12 = x^2 -2x -6
    b = x + 4
    a = x**2 - 2*x - 6
    return a, b

print("Checking integers x in range -10 to 10 where f(x) = g(x):")
for x in range(-10, 11):
    a, b = f_and_g(x)
    if abs(a - b) < 1e-15:  # exact equality check
        print(f"x={x}: f(x)={a}, g(x)={b}, f(x)=g(x)")

# Let's also solve f(x) = g(x) algebraically:
# f(x) = g(x)
# x^2 - 2x - 6 = x + 4
# x^2 - 3x -10 = 0
# Roots by quadratic formula:
from math import sqrt
D = 9 + 40
r1 = (3 + sqrt(D))/2
r2 = (3 - sqrt(D))/2
print("\nRoots where f(x) = g(x):")
print(f"x = {r1}, x = {r2}")
