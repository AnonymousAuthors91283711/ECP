The problem boils down to calculating the gcd of two numbers of the form a^m - 1 and b^n - 1. We will enumerate gcd(4^8 - 1, 8^12 - 1) by computing values directly, printing intermediate gcd computations with divisors if helpful.

```python
# Enumerate gcd(4^8 - 1, 8^12 - 1) and print intermediate values
from math import gcd

def main():
    a, m = 4, 8
    b, n = 8, 12

    val1 = a**m - 1
    val2 = b**n - 1
    print(f"Parameters: a={a}, m={m}, b={b}, n={n}")
    print(f"{a}^{m}-1 = {val1}")
    print(f"{b}^{n}-1 = {val2}")

    # Direct gcd
    g = gcd(val1, val2)
    print(f"gcd({val1}, {val2}) = {g}")

    # Further factorization and common divisors enumeration (optional)
    # Let's check gcd(a^d - 1, b^d - 1) for divisors d of gcd(m,n)
    from math import gcd as mathgcd

    d = mathgcd(m, n)
    print(f"Since gcd(m,n) = {d}, gcd(a^{m}-1, b^{n}-1) divides gcd(a^{d}-1, b^{d}-1)")

    val3 = a**d - 1
    val4 = b**d - 1
    print(f"{a}^{d}-1 = {val3}")
    print(f"{b}^{d}-1 = {val4}")

    common = gcd(val3, val4)
    print(f"gcd({val3}, {val4}) = {common}")

    # Output the gcd found
    print(f"Final answer: {g}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
