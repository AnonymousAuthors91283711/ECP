This problem defines a sequence \(S(i)\) involving factorials and alternating signs and sums it over \(i=0\) to \(n\). The goal is to explore values of the sum for sample integer parameters \(k, m, n\) with \(k > 0 \le m \le n\).

We'll implement the formula for \(S(i)\) exactly using `math.factorial` and rational fractions (using `fractions.Fraction`), enumerate sums for small tuples, and print each sum immediately. This will allow conjecturing a closed form or pattern for the sum.

```python
from math import factorial
from fractions import Fraction

def S(k, m, n, i):
    # S(i) = (-1)^i / (n+k+i) * (m+n+i)! / (i! * (n - i)! * (m+i)!)
    if i > n or i < 0:
        return Fraction(0)
    sign = (-1) ** i
    numerator = factorial(m + n + i)
    denominator = (n + k + i) * factorial(i) * factorial(n - i) * factorial(m + i)
    return Fraction(sign * numerator, denominator)

def test_values():
    # Select sample k, m, n with conditions k>0, m>=k, n>=m
    samples = [
        (1,1,1),
        (1,2,3),
        (2,2,2),
        (2,3,3),
        (1,3,5),
        (3,4,5),
    ]
    for k,m,n in samples:
        s = Fraction(0)
        for i in range(n+1):
            val = S(k,m,n,i)
            print(f"S({k},{m},{n}; {i}) = {val}")
            s += val
        print(f"Sum S(i) i=0..{n} for (k,m,n)=({k},{m},{n}) is {s}\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_values()
```
