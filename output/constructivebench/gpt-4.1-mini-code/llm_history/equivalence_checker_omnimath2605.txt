Ground Truth Answer: 257/16
Proposed Answer: 4
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find the real value x ≥ 2 that satisfies the given equation involving square roots.

2. The ground truth answer is 257/16, which is approximately 16.0625.

3. The proposed answer is 4.

Let's test x=4 in the original equation:
Left side = 1/(√4 + √2) + 1/(√6 + √4) ≈ 1/(2+1.414) + 1/(2.449+2) ≈ 0.293 + 0.225 ≈ 0.518
Right side = 1/4 = 0.25
These are not equal, so x=4 is not a solution.

The ground truth answer 257/16 is correct (you can verify by plugging it in), while the proposed answer 4 is incorrect.

<<<False>>>
