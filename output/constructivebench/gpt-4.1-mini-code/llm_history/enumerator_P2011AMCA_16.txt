We want to count the number of functions f from Fin 5 = {0,1,2,3,4} to Fin 6 = {0,1,2,3,4,5} such that for all i,j in Fin 5, if the absolute difference |i-j| is 2 or 3 (since (i-j).val > 1 and <4), then f(i) ≠ f(j).

This means f must assign different values to pairs of indices which are distance 2 or 3 apart (indices modulo 5 would be enabled because Fin 5 is mod 5? But here it seems standard indices 0..4). The difference is considered modulo 5? Without mod, differences from 0..4 are just usual differences, and since i,j ∈ {0..4}, differences of 2 or 3 means pairs (0,2), (1,3), (2,4), and also (0,3) and (1,4) since 3 difference is allowed.

But the problem states (i-j).val >1 and <4 means difference is in {2,3}.

So pairs with distance 2 or 3 should not have same values.

We enumerate all functions f: {0..4}->{0..5}, 6^5=7776 functions, and count only those with f(i)≠f(j) whenever |i-j| in {2,3}.

We will write Python code to enumerate all such functions and print valid ones immediately along with the function values.

We cannot print everything (would overflow 400 tokens) so just print the count at the end.

The pairs to check are (0,2),(1,3),(2,4),(0,3),(1,4).

Plan: For each function f from [0..4] to [0..5], check all pairs, if passes, count +=1 and print info as possible within token limits (maybe print first 10 valid functions).

Print final count.

```python
# Enumerate functions f: {0..4} -> {0..5} s.t. for all i,j with |i-j|=2 or 3, f(i)!=f(j)

# Pairs of indices to check (i,j) with difference 2 or 3
pairs = [(0,2),(1,3),(2,4),(0,3),(1,4)]
count = 0
printed = 0

def valid(f):
    for i,j in pairs:
        if f[i] == f[j]:
            return False
    return True

def main():
    global count, printed
    # Since domain size 5, codomain size 6
    # Enumerate f as 5-digit base-6 number
    for num in range(6**5):
        f = []
        x = num
        for _ in range(5):
            f.append(x%6)
            x//=6
        # f[0] is least significant digit, reverse for index order
        f = f[::-1]
        if valid(f):
            count += 1
            if printed < 10:
                print("Valid f:", f)
                printed += 1
    print("Total valid functions count:", count)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
