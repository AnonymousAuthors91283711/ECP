[write_program]
The problem seems to be about finding all positive integers \( n \) such that there exists an integer \( m \) with \( 2^n - 1 \mid m^2 + 9 \). I will write a Python program to check for small values of \( n \), and for each \( n \), find if there exists an \( m \) with \( (m^2 + 9) \mod (2^n - 1) = 0 \).

I'll enumerate \( n \) from 1 to a small limit (say 20), and for each \( n \), check \( m \) from 0 to \( 2^n - 2 \) (since modulo \( 2^n - 1 \)) to see if \( m^2 + 9 \equiv 0 \pmod{2^n - 1} \). If a \( m \) is found, print \( n \) immediately.

```python
# Enumerate n with 0<n<=20 checking for existence of m with (m^2 + 9) divisible by 2^n - 1
def main():
    limit_n = 20
    for n in range(1, limit_n + 1):
        mod = 2**n - 1
        found = False
        for m in range(mod):
            if (m*m + 9) % mod == 0:
                print(f"n = {n}, m = {m} satisfies (m^2 + 9) divisible by {mod} (2^{n} - 1)")
                found = True
                break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
