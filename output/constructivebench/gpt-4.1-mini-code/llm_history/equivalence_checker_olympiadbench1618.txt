Ground Truth Answer: {(1, 8, 19), (2, 7, 13), (4, 5, 7)}
Proposed Answer: {(4, 5, 7), (5, 4, 7), (2, 7, 13), (7, 2, 13), (1, 8, 19), (8, 1, 19)}

The proposed answer includes all the correct solutions from the ground truth answer, but also includes additional symmetric pairs (e.g., (5,4,7) is the same as (4,5,7) with x and y swapped). While mathematically equivalent in terms of satisfying the equation, the problem might expect only one representative from each symmetric pair. Therefore, the proposed answer is mostly correct but includes redundant solutions.
