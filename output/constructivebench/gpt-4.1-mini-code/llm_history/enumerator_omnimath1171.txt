The problem involves three positive real numbers \(a, b, c\) such that:
\[
a + b + c = 26, \quad \frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c} = 28.
\]
We want to find values of the expression:
\[
S = \frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{c} + \frac{c}{a} + \frac{a}{c} + \frac{c}{b} + \frac{b}{a}.
\]

To conjecture and possibly prove the value, I'll write a Python program that iterates over positive triples \((a,b,c)\) satisfying \(a+b+c=26\) with rational values, checks the reciprocal sum condition closely, and prints the corresponding \(S\).

We will discretize \(a,b,c\) rationally with a small denominator to keep computations manageable and look for near equality in reciprocals. This enumeration approach helps identify exact or approximate values of \(S\).

```python
# Enumerate rational triples (a,b,c) with a,b,c >0, a+b+c=26
# Check if reciprocal sum is 28 within a small tolerance
# Print exact fraction approximations when found, then S value exactly

from fractions import Fraction

# step denominator for rationals
den = 8
total = 26
target_recip_sum = Fraction(28,1)
tolerance = Fraction(1, 1000)   # allowed error in reciprocal sum

def reciprocal_sum(a,b,c):
    return Fraction(1,a) + Fraction(1,b) + Fraction(1,c)

def S_value(a,b,c):
    # calculate the sum of ratios as per problem
    return Fraction(a,b) + Fraction(b,c) + Fraction(c,a) + Fraction(a,c) + Fraction(c,b) + Fraction(b,a)

# enumerate a,b with denominator den, c = 26 - a - b >0
# a,b in (0,26) with steps of 1/den
# limit a,b increments to keep output small

print("Enumerating triples (a,b,c) with denominator", den)

found_results = set()

for ai in range(1, total*den):    # a from 1/den up to 25 + 7/8, step 1/den
    a = Fraction(ai, den)
    for bi in range(1, total*den):
        b = Fraction(bi, den)
        c = Fraction(total) - a - b
        if c <= 0:
            continue
        rec_sum = reciprocal_sum(a,b,c)
        diff = abs(rec_sum - target_recip_sum)
        if diff <= tolerance:
            # close enough, print exact fractions and value S
            s_val = S_value(a,b,c)
            if s_val not in found_results:
                found_results.add(s_val)
                print(f"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}, 1/a+1/b+1/c={float(rec_sum):.4f}, S={float(s_val):.4f} exact={s_val}")

# The output may reveal a unique S value or multiple to conjecture the final answer
```
This brute force rational search may discover normalizations or exact values of \(S\) to support a conjecture or proof.
