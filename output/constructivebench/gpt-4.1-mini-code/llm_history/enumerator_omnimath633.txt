The problem is to find the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that the polynomial \( (X+1)^n - 1 \) can be expressed as 
\[
(X^2 + 1)P + 3Q
\]
for some integer polynomials \(P\) and \(Q\).

Requirements:
- \(n \in \mathbb{N}\), \(n > 0\).
- There exist \(P,Q \in \mathbb{Z}[X]\) satisfying the divisibility/congruence condition modulo the ideal generated by \(X^2 + 1\) and 3.

By the division algorithm in \(\mathbb{Z}[X]\), the remainder of dividing \((X+1)^n - 1\) by \(X^2 + 1\) is a polynomial \(R_n(X)\) of degree at most 1. The condition can be rewritten as:
\[
(X+1)^n - 1 \equiv (X^2 + 1)P + 3Q \equiv 0 \pmod{(X^2 +1, 3)}.
\]

Equivalently:
\[
(X+1)^n - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{(X^2 +1, 3)}.
\]

Working modulo 3 and modulo \(X^2+1\):

- Modulo 3 means coefficients are reduced mod 3.
- Modulo \(X^2 + 1 = 0 \implies X^2 \equiv -1\), so in \(\mathbb{F}_3[X]/(X^2+1)\) we identify \(X^2 \equiv 2\) (since \(-1 \equiv 2 \mod 3\)).

Thus the ring is isomorphic to \(\mathbb{F}_3[i]\) where \(i^2=2\) in \(\mathbb{F}_3\).

The problem reduces to finding the smallest \(n>0\) such that:
\[
(X+1)^n \equiv 1 \pmod{3 \text{ and } X^2+1}.
\]

In the field \(\mathbb{F}_3[i]\), find the order of \(X+1\).

We can write a program that works in the finite ring \(\mathbb{F}_3[X]/(X^2+1)\), represent elements as \(a + bX\) with \(a,b \in \{0,1,2\}\), and compute powers of \(X+1\) modulo 3 and \(X^2+1\), searching for the smallest positive \(n\) such that \((X+1)^n = 1\).

The program will:
- Define multiplication modulo \(X^2 + 1\) and modulo 3.
- Compute powers \( (X+1)^n\) for \( n=1,2,...\) until the result is equal to 1.
- Print every \(n\) checked and the result.
- Print the minimal \(n\) found.

This enumerates candidate answers from 1 up to a reasonable bound (like 20), printing each step, then outputs the minimal answer.

```python
# Enumerate smallest n > 0 such that (X+1)^n = 1 in F3[X]/(X^2+1).
# Elements represented as (a,b) = a + bX with a,b in {0,1,2}.
# Addition and multiplication modulo 3; multiplication modulo X^2+1 (so X^2 = -1 = 2 mod 3).

def add_poly(p1, p2):
    # p1, p2 = (a,b)
    return ((p1[0] + p2[0]) % 3, (p1[1] + p2[1]) % 3)

def mul_poly(p1, p2):
    # (a + bX)(c + dX) = (ac + bd X^2) + (ad + bc)X
    # X^2 = 2 (mod 3)
    a, b = p1
    c, d = p2
    ac = (a * c) % 3
    bd = (b * d) % 3
    ad = (a * d) % 3
    bc = (b * c) % 3
    # constant term: ac + bd*2 mod3
    const = (ac + 2*bd) % 3
    x_coeff = (ad + bc) % 3
    return (const, x_coeff)

def poly_eq(p1, p2):
    return p1[0] == p2[0] and p1[1] == p2[1]

# Base element: X+1 = (1,1)
base = (1,1)
one = (1,0)

print("Checking powers of (X+1) in F3[X]/(X^2+1):")
power = base
for n in range(1, 21):
    print(f"n={n}: (X+1)^{n} = {power[0]} + {power[1]}*X mod 3 and X^2+1")
    if poly_eq(power, one):
        print(f"Smallest n > 0 with (X+1)^n = 1 is {n}")
        break
    power = mul_poly(power, base)
else:
    print("No n â‰¤ 20 found with (X+1)^n = 1.")
```
This code prints each power, stopping at the minimal \(n\) that satisfies the condition. This enumerates candidate \(n\) verifying the minimal positive integer solution for the problem.
