[write_program]
The problem asks to evaluate the sum \(\sum d_i 4^{p_i}\) for given lists \(d = [1,0,2,0,1,2,1]\) and \(p = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6]\). The Python program below will compute this sum by enumerating the terms one by one, print partial sums immediately, and finally print the total sum as the answer.

```python
# Compute sum of d[i] * 4^p[i] for given lists d and p

d = [1,0,2,0,1,2,1]
p = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6]

total = 0
print("Enumerating terms:")
for i in range(len(d)):
    term = d[i] * (4 ** p[i])
    total += term
    print(f"Term {i}: {d[i]} * 4^{p[i]} = {term}, Partial sum = {total}")

print(f"Final answer (sum): {total}")
```
