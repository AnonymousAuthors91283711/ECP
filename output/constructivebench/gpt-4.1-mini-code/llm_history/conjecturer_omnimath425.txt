. Enumerated answers: Checking periods t for Fibonacci sequence starting with F(1)=1, F(2)=1
t=1: fails at n=2 with F(n)=1, F(n+t)=2
t=2: fails at n=1 with F(n)=1, F(n+t)=2
t=3: fails at n=1 with F(n)=1, F(n+t)=3
t=4: fails at n=1 with F(n)=1, F(n+t)=5
t=5: fails at n=1 with F(n)=1, F(n+t)=8
t=6: fails at n=1 with F(n)=1, F(n+t)=13
t=7: fails at n=1 with F(n)=1, F(n+t)=21
t=8: fails at n=1 with F(n)=1, F(n+t)=34
t=9: fails at n=1 with F(n)=1, F(n+t)=55
t=10: fails at n=1 with F(n)=1, F(n+t)=89
Conjecture: No positive t yields full equality F(n) = F(n+t) for all n. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
