The problem seeks the least value y for which there exists a function f: ℕ → ℕ satisfying the functional equation f(n² * f(m)) = m * (f(n))² for all m, n in ℕ, with y = f(1998).

To explore this, we sample candidate functions f and check the equation for various m,n. We'll try to deduce the behavior and enumerate possible values of f(1998) consistent with the relation.

```python
# Enumerate candidates for f: ℕ → ℕ satisfying f(n² * f(m)) = m * (f(n))²
# Focus on establishing potential values of f(1998).
# We'll try small values for f(1) as it can determine the scale of f.

def try_f1(f1):
    # f(1) = f1 assumed
    # From n=1: f(f(m)) = m * (f(1))^2 = m * f1^2
    # So f(f(m)) = m * f1^2
    # Setting m = 1: f(f(1)) = 1 * f1^2 = f1^2
    # Since f(1) = f1, then f(f1) = f1^2
    # So f(f1) = f1^2.

    # Try to find values for f(n) based on a pattern.
    # Try assume f(n) = c * n for some c or similar.

    candidates = set()
    max_n = 50
    # We'll try f is candidate if values can be consistent with the formula for all m,n up to max_n.
    # Since f is unknown, we enumerate possible f values for 1..max_n within some bounds.
    # But this is huge; instead, try closed form or direct checks for small values.

    # We know f(f(m)) = m * f1^2
    # So f is invertible on its image, and f^{-1}(x) = something related to x / f1^2.

    # Try to find possible values of f(1998):
    # Hypothesize f(n) = f1 * n (linear) and check the functional equation.

    # Check f(n^2 * f(m)) = m * (f(n))^2
    # Suppose f(n) = f1 * n
    # Left: f(n^2 * f(m)) = f(n^2 * f1 * m) = f1 * n^2 * f1 * m = f1^2 * n^2 * m
    # Right: m * (f(n))^2 = m * (f1 * n)^2 = m * f1^2 * n^2
    # They agree! So f(n) = f1 * n is a solution.

    # So for any f1, f(n) = f1 * n is a solution.

    # Then f(1998) = f1 * 1998.

    # Since f maps ℕ to ℕ, f1 ∈ ℕ\{0}

    # So f(1998) can be any multiple of 1998.

    # We seek least such y = f(1998),
    # so minimal f1 = 1 gives y = 1998.

    print(f"Trying f(1) = {f1}: f(1998) = {f1 * 1998}")
    return f1 * 1998

def main():
    # Try some small f1 values
    results = []
    for f1 in range(1, 5):
        y = try_f1(f1)
        results.append(y)

    print("Minimal candidate for f(1998) is", min(results))

    main()
