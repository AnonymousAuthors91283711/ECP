The problem hints at examining the product of (total_doctors - 1) and (total_nurses - 1), given total_doctors = 6 and total_nurses = 4. We'll enumerate products of d * n for small values around these given ones (e.g. total_doctors and total_nurses near these numbers) to check the product and build intuition.

```python
# Enumerate products of (total_doctors - 1) * (total_nurses - 1) for small samples around given values
max_doctors = 7  # go a bit beyond 6
max_nurses = 5   # go a bit beyond 4

print("Enumerating (total_doctors - 1) * (total_nurses - 1) for total_doctors in [1..{}], total_nurses in [1..{}]".format(max_doctors, max_nurses))
for total_doctors in range(1, max_doctors + 1):
    for total_nurses in range(1, max_nurses + 1):
        d = total_doctors - 1
        n = total_nurses - 1
        product = d * n
        print(f"total_doctors={total_doctors}, total_nurses={total_nurses} => (total_doctors-1)*(total_nurses-1) = {product}")
        
# Explicitly print the product at the given numbers
d = 6 - 1
n = 4 - 1
print(f"Special case: total_doctors=6, total_nurses=4 => (6-1)*(4-1) = {d * n}")
```
