The error arises because Lean's `Real` numbers require marking definitions involving division as `noncomputable` due to implicit use of classical logic/nonconstructive reasoning. To fix the error, we declare the answer as `noncomputable` and use the exact fraction form `96` to avoid floating-point issues.

Explanation:  
The equation `x / 90 - x / 120 = 16 / 60` simplifies algebraically to  
`x * (1/90 - 1/120) = 16/60`  
`x * (4/360 - 3/360) = 16/60`  
`x * (1/360) = 16/60`  
`x = (16/60) * 360 = 96`.

Hence the exact answer is `96`.

The problem is a straightforward linear equation:

x / 90 - x / 120 = 16 / 60.

Find x.

Simplifying the left side:

LCD of 90 and 120 is 360.

x / 90 = 4x / 360

x / 120 = 3x / 360

So the left becomes (4x - 3x)/360 = x / 360.

Thus, x / 360 = 16 / 60 = 4 / 15.

Multiply both sides by 360:

x = 360 * (4/15) = 24 * 4 = 96.

So the solution is 96.

In Lean, the error arises because you used `abbrev` but tried to write `noncomputable def` inside it, which is not allowed.

You should just write

`noncomputable def omnimath2988_answer : ℝ := 96`

or

`abbrev omnimath2988_answer : ℝ := 96`

since 96 is a rational number, Lean can handle it without noncomputability.

Alternatively, just write:

`abbrev omnimath2988_answer : ℝ := 96`

This will work fine as 96 is a numeral literal.

Hence the correct fixed answer is just:

<<<96>>>

Optionally:

`abbrev omnimath2988_answer : ℝ := 96`

But you asked only for the expression itself.

Hence, final proposed answer enclosed in <<< >>> is:

<<<96>>>
