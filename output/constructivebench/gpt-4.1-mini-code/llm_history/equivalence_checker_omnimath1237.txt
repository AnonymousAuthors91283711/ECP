Ground Truth Answer: 20
Proposed Answer: 16 * 7 - 3 * 42
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem presents a system of equations with variables a, b, x, y and asks for the value of a*x⁵ + b*y⁵.

2. The ground truth answer is 20.

3. The proposed answer suggests calculating 16*7 - 3*42 = 112 - 126 = -14.

4. Clearly, -14 ≠ 20, so the proposed answer is incorrect.

5. The correct approach would involve setting up recurrence relations or using Newton's identities to solve for higher powers, which would indeed lead to 20 as the correct answer.
