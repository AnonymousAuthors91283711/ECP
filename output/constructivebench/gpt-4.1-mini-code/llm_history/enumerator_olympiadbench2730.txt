The problem involves an arithmetic progression \(a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\) with given values \(a_{16} = 13\) and \(a_{30} = 20\). We want to understand for which indices \(k\) the value \(a_k\) equals some \(T\).

To assist, we'll:
- Deduce \(a_1\) and \(d\) from the conditions.
- Enumerate possible \(T\) values for indices \(k\) in a reasonable range (e.g., 1 to 50).
- For each \(T\), print possible \(k\)'s such that \(a_k = T\).

This enumeration will help conjecture the inverse function \(k = \text{olympiadbench2730\_answer}(T)\).

```python
# Arithmetic sequence: a_k = a_1 + (k-1)*d
# Given: a_16 = 13, a_30 = 20
# Find a_1, d, then enumerate a_k values for k=1..50, print each T with its k

def main():
    # Solve for a_1 and d
    # a_16 = a_1 + 15*d = 13
    # a_30 = a_1 + 29*d = 20
    # Subtract: 14*d = 7 => d = 0.5, a_1 = 13 - 15*0.5 = 5.5
    a1 = 13 - 15*0.5
    d = 0.5

    # We'll consider integer k from 1 to 50
    # a_k may be fractional; since a1 and d are halves, a_k will be integer if k is odd
    # because a_k = 5.5 + (k-1)*0.5 = (11 + k - 1)/2 = (k+10)/2
    # a_k is integer iff k+10 is even => k even
    # Actually, let's verify values.

    # Enumerate and store values T : list of indices k
    from collections import defaultdict
    T_to_ks = defaultdict(list)

    print(f"a_1 = {a1}, d = {d}\nEnumerating a_k for k=1..50:")
    for k in range(1, 51):
        T = a1 + (k - 1)*d
        # If T is integer, print mapping
        if T.is_integer():
            T = int(T)
            print(f"a_{k} = {T}")
            T_to_ks[T].append(k)

    print("\nEnumerated T with their indices k:")
    for T in sorted(T_to_ks):
        ks = T_to_ks[T]
        print(f"T={T}: k={ks}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
