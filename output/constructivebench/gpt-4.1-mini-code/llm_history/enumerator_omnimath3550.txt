The problem asks to find all integers \( m \) such that the polynomial 
\[ P(m) = x^4 - (2m + 4)x^2 + (m - 2)^2 \]
is factorable over the integers into nonzero polynomials \( A, B \) with integer coefficients.

We want to enumerate such integer values \( m \) and verify the factorization over \(\mathbb{Z}[x]\). Since factorization over integers for quartics can sometimes be checked by trying quadratic factors (or linear factorization attempts fail if constant term isn't a perfect power), a natural approach is to attempt to factor as a product of two quadratics:
\[
x^4 + a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d = (x^2 + p x + q)(x^2 + r x + s)
\]
for integer \( p, q, r, s \).

Since our polynomial has no \(x^3\) or \(x\) terms, \(a = 0, c = 0\) imposes conditions on \(p, q, r, s\).

We will test integer values \(m\) in a reasonable range (e.g., \(-20\) to \(20\)) to find all such \(m\). For each \(m\), check if \(P(m)\) factors as above.

```python
# Enumerate integer m where P(m) factors into two quadratics over Z
# P(m) = x^4 - (2m+4) x^2 + (m-2)^2
# Factor form: (x^2 + p x + q)(x^2 + r x + s) = x^4 + (p+r) x^3 + (pr + q + s) x^2 + (p s + q r) x + q s
# Given no x^3 and x terms: p + r = 0, p s + q r = 0
# Coefficients constraints:
# x^4 term: 1 (ok)
# x^3 term: p + r = 0 -> r = -p
# x^2 term: pr + q + s = -(2m+4)
# x term: p s + q r = 0
# constant: q s = (m-2)^2
