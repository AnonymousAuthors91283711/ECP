The problem gives a system of equations involving parameters \(a, b, x, y \in \mathbb{R}\):

\[
\begin{cases}
a x + b y = 3 \\
a x^2 + b y^2 = 7 \\
a x^3 + b y^3 = 16 \\
a x^4 + b y^4 = 42
\end{cases}
\]

and asks to find (or conjecture) \(a x^5 + b y^5\).

This is reminiscent of sequences satisfying linear recurrence relations, or expressing sums via linear combinations of powers. To get insight, we can enumerate possible values for small integer \(x, y, a, b\) that satisfy the equations (or approximate, given the constraints), and then output the corresponding \(a x^5 + b y^5\). This may help to guess the formula or value.

We'll:

- Try integer or small rational values for \(x, y\).
- Solve for \(a, b\) from the first two equations (or using least squares if overdetermined).
- Check if the remaining equations approximately hold (within some tolerance).
- If yes, print \(a x^5 + b y^5\).
- Limit search space to keep code output small.

Since the problem involves powers quickly growing, small integer ranges seem best.

```python
import itertools
import math

# We try x, y in range [-5,5] except zero (to avoid trivial zeros)
vals = [i for i in range(-5,6) if i != 0]

def close(u,v,eps=1e-6):
    return abs(u - v) < eps

def solve_ab(x,y):
    # Solve linear system:
    # a x + b y = 3
    # a x^2 + b y^2 = 7
    det = x * y**2 - x**2 * y
    if det == 0:
        return None
    a = (3 * y**2 - 7 * y) / det
    b = (7 * x - 3 * x**2) / det
    return (a,b)

print("Trying possible (x,y,a,b) to satisfy given equations:")
max_print = 10
count = 0

for x,y in itertools.product(vals, repeat=2):
    ab = solve_ab(x,y)
    if ab is None:
        continue
    a,b = ab
    # Check equations 3 and 4
    e3 = a * x**3 + b * y**3
    e4 = a * x**4 + b * y**4
    if close(e3,16) and close(e4,42):
        val = a * x**5 + b * y**5
        print(f"x={x}, y={y}, a={a:.5f}, b={b:.5f} => a x^5 + b y^5 = {val:.5f}")
        count +=1
        if count >= max_print:
            break
```
This enumerates candidates \((x,y,a,b)\) with integer \(x,y\) between -5 and 5 excluding zero, solves for \(a,b\), verifies the last two equations approximately, and prints the resulting \(a x^5 + b y^5\) for plausible solutions. This should help conjecture the exact answer or find a pattern.
