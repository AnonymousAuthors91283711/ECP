The problem appears to be a number theory and combinatorics puzzle: find the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that \( n = L + R \), \( 2L = R \), and with total games \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), splitting these total games into wins_L and wins_R so that \(5 \cdot wins_L = 7 \cdot wins_R\). The conditions imply that the total game number is split proportionally into wins satisfying certain linear relations.

To explore candidates, we:
- Let \( L, R \) be natural numbers, with \( R = 2L \), so \( n = 3L \).
- Total games = \( n(n-1)/2 \).
- We want integers \( wins_L, wins_R \) with \( wins_L + wins_R = total\_games \) and \( 5 \cdot wins_L = 7 \cdot wins_R \).

Because of the ratio, \( wins_L = 7k \), \( wins_R = 5k \), so total_games = \( 12k \), so \( 12 | total\_games \).

We will test increasing \( L \) and compute total_games. If \( total_games \) divisible by 12, print relevant info.

```python
# Enumerate candidates for L with R=2L, n=3L
# For each n, compute total_games = n(n-1)/2
# Check if total_games divisible by 12 to satisfy 5wins_L=7wins_R

for L in range(1, 30):
    R = 2 * L
    n = L + R  # which is 3L
    total_games = n * (n - 1) // 2
    if total_games % 12 == 0:
        k = total_games // 12
        wins_L = 7 * k
        wins_R = 5 * k
        print(f"L={L}, R={R}, n={n}, total_games={total_games}, wins_L={wins_L}, wins_R={wins_R}")
```
This will print all \( n \) candidates (multiples of 3) up to 87 with the required ratio divisibility, helping conjecture the smallest such \( n \).
