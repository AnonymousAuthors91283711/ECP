theorem P2024AIMEI_13 :
  IsLeast {p : ℕ | p.Prime ∧ ∃ n, 0 < n ∧ p^2 ∣ n^4 + 1} 17 ∧
  IsLeast {m : ℕ | 0 < m ∧ 17^2 ∣ m^4 + 1} P2024AIMEI_13_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Prime 17 with n=110 satisfies 17^2 divides n^4+1 = 146410001
Candidate prime: 17 with minimal n=110
Prime 41 with n=776 satisfies 41^2 divides n^4+1 = 362615934977
Candidate prime: 41 with minimal n=776
Minimal prime p with p^2|n^4+1 for some n is 17
Testing minimal n for prime 17:
Prime 17 with n=110 satisfies 17^2 divides n^4+1 = 146410001
Minimal n for p=17 is 110, with 17^2 dividing 110^4+1=146410001. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
<<<110>>>
