theorem P2003AMCB_12 : 
  IsGreatest {d : ℕ | ∀ n : ℕ, 0 < n → Even n → d ∣ n} P2003AMCB_12_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Testing all d from 1 to 20 for divisibility of even numbers up to 20:
d=1 divides all even numbers from 2 to 20
d=2 divides all even numbers from 2 to 20
The greatest d found is 2. Expected Answer Type: ℕ
