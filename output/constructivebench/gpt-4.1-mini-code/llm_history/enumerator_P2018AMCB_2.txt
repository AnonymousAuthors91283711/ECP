The problem involves a total distance of 96 km covered in three segments: the first two segments are covered at speeds of 60 km/h and 65 km/h for 30 minutes each, and the last segment covers the remaining distance in 30 minutes as well. We want to find the speed during the last 30 minutes (third segment) and confirm its value.

The approach:
- Calculate distances for first and second segments using speed Ã— time.
- Calculate the remaining distance for the third segment.
- Calculate the speed for the third segment using the remaining distance divided by the time.
- Enumerate these values and print them for conjecture.

```python
def main():
    total_distance = 96
    # Time interval in hours
    t = 30 / 60

    # Try small variations to see effects on last segment speed
    # But here, times are fixed; so just compute exact values

    first_speed = 60
    second_speed = 65

    first_distance = first_speed * t
    print(f"First distance: {first_distance} km")

    second_distance = second_speed * t
    print(f"Second distance: {second_distance} km")

    third_distance = total_distance - first_distance - second_distance
    print(f"Third distance: {third_distance} km")

    # Speed in third segment
    third_speed = third_distance / t
    print(f"Third speed: {third_speed} km/h")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
