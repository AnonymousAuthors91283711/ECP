Ground Truth Answer: 7^3
Proposed Answer: 343
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer "343" is equivalent to the ground truth answer "7^3" because 7^3 = 343. Both expressions represent the same numerical value, just in different forms (exponential vs. expanded). The problem context doesn't impose any constraints that would make these forms non-equivalent.
