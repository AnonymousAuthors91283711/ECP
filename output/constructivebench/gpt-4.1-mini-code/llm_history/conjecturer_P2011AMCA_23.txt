  P2011AMCA_23_answer := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Enumerating |b| values for selected a with |a|=1:

a = (1+0j) (|a|=1.00)
|b| = 1.0 with b = (1+0j) satisfies condition.
|b| = 1.0 with b = (1+0j) satisfies condition.
Range of |b| for a=(1+0j): min = 1.0, max = 1.0, difference = 0.0

a = 1j (|a|=1.00)
|b| = 1.0 with b = (1+0j) satisfies condition.
|b| = 1.0 with b = (1+0j) satisfies condition.
Range of |b| for a=1j: min = 1.0, max = 1.0, difference = 0.0

a = (-1+0j) (|a|=1.00)
|b| = 1.0 with b = (1+0j) satisfies condition.
|b| = 1.0 with b = (1+0j) satisfies condition.
Range of |b| for a=(-1+0j): min = 1.0, max = 1.0, difference = 0.0

a = -1j (|a|=1.00)
|b| = 1.0 with b = (1+0j) satisfies condition.
|b| = 1.0 with b = (1+0j) satisfies condition.
Range of |b| for a=-1j: min = 1.0, max = 1.0, difference = 0.0

a = (0.7071067811865476+0.7071067811865475j) (|a|=1.00)
No |b| found for a=(0.7071067811865476+0.7071067811865475j).
