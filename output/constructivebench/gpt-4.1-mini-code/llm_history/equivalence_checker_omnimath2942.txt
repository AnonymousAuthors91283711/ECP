abbrev omnimath2942_answer : ℕ := sorry
theorem omnimath2942 : 
  ∃ (k : ℕ), 3 + 11 * k = omnimath2942_answer := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: 113
Proposed Answer: 14
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is asking to find a natural number k such that 3 + 11*k equals some answer (omnimath2942_answer).

2. The ground truth answer is 113. Let's check:
   3 + 11*k = 113 => 11*k = 110 => k = 10 (which is a natural number)

3. The proposed answer is 14. Let's check:
   3 + 11*k = 14 => 11*k = 11 => k = 1 (which is also a natural number)

Both answers satisfy the equation with natural number k, but they are different solutions (k=10 vs k=1). The problem statement doesn't specify which solution is preferred or if uniqueness is required. 

However, since the ground truth is specifically 113 and the proposed answer is 14, they are different numerical values, so they are not equivalent.
