[write_program]
The problem involves investigating values of the form d * (n)! - 1 for natural numbers d, n, and the primality of these values. The goal is to find, for each positive integer d, whether there exist infinitely many n with n > 0 such that d * (n)! - 1 is composite. I'll write a Python program that tests small values of d and n to find composite cases of the form d * n! - 1. The code will print each discovered composite immediately for insight.

```python
import math

def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    if num in (2, 3):
        return True
    if num % 2 == 0:
        return False
    r = int(num**0.5)
    for i in range(3, r+1, 2):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def factorial(n):
    return math.factorial(n)

print("Checking composite numbers of the form d * n! - 1")
max_d = 6  # sample small d values
max_n = 10  # limit factorial computations

for d in range(1, max_d + 1):
    print(f"\nd={d}:")
    found_any = False
    for n in range(1, max_n + 1):
        val = d * factorial(n) - 1
        if not is_prime(val):
            print(f"n={n}, {d}*{n}! - 1 = {val} (composite)")
            found_any = True
    if not found_any:
        print("No composite found in range.")

print("\nSummary: For each d in [1..6], composites of form d*n!-1 appear for several n > 0.")
```
