The problem: Given nonnegative real numbers \(a,b,c,d\) summing to 100, we want to investigate the maximum possible value of
\[
S = \sqrt[3]{\frac{a}{b+7}} + \sqrt[3]{\frac{b}{c+7}} + \sqrt[3]{\frac{c}{d+7}} + \sqrt[3]{\frac{d}{a+7}}.
\]
We will enumerate values by discretizing \(a,b,c\) in steps and deducing \(d=100-(a+b+c)\), ensuring nonnegativity. For each quadruple, calculate \(S\) if denominators are positive (no division by zero issue since denominators have +7). Print each \(S\) and keep track of the maximum.

We'll use integer steps for \(a,b,c\) up to 100 with a small step (like 10 or 20) for performance and output limit. Print triples tested along with \(S\). At the end report the max or approximated max.

```python
# Enumerate quadruples (a,b,c,d) with a,b,c in [0,100] step 10, d=100-(a+b+c)
# Compute S = sum of cube roots of (a/(b+7)), etc.
# Print each found S with parameters, track max and print it last.

from math import pow

def cbrt(x):
    # cube root preserving sign for nonnegative inputs (all fractions nonnegative)
    return pow(x, 1/3)

max_S = -1e9
max_params = None

step = 10

print("Enumerations with step =", step)
for a in range(0, 101, step):
    for b in range(0, 101, step):
        for c in range(0, 101, step):
            d = 100 - (a + b + c)
            if d < 0 or d > 100:
                continue
            # denominators positive: b+7, c+7, d+7, a+7 all >=7 > 0
            try:
                S = cbrt(a/(b+7)) + cbrt(b/(c+7)) + cbrt(c/(d+7)) + cbrt(d/(a+7))
            except ZeroDivisionError:
                continue
            print(f"a={a},b={b},c={c},d={d},S={S:.6f}")
            if S > max_S:
                max_S = S
                max_params = (a,b,c,d)

print("\nMaximum S found:")
print(f"a={max_params[0]}, b={max_params[1]}, c={max_params[2]}, d={max_params[3]}, S={max_S:.6f}")
```
