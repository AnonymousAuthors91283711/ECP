theorem P2006AMCA_3 (aliceAge : ℕ) (h : aliceAge = 30) :
  ∃ maryAge, maryAge = P2006AMCA_3_answer aliceAge ∧ (maryAge : ℚ) / aliceAge = 3 / 5 := by sorry. Enumerated answers: Alice's age: 15
Mary's age: 9 (exact ratio 3/5)
Alice's age: 20
Mary's age: 12 (exact ratio 3/5)
Alice's age: 25
Mary's age: 15 (exact ratio 3/5)
Alice's age: 30
Mary's age: 18 (exact ratio 3/5)
Alice's age: 35
Mary's age: 21 (exact ratio 3/5). Expected Answer Type: ℕ → ℕ
