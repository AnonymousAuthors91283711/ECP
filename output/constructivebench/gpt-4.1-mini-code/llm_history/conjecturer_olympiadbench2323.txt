theorem olympiadbench2323 :
  {n : ℕ | 0 < n ∧ (n ^ 2 + n + 15) % n = 0} = olympiadbench2323_answer :=
sorry
. Enumerated answers: n values dividing 15 that satisfy the condition:
1
3
5
15
All such n are divisors of 15; thus the answer set is {1,3,5,15}.. Expected Answer Type: Set ℕ
<<<{n : ℕ | n ∣ 15 ∧ n > 0}>>>
