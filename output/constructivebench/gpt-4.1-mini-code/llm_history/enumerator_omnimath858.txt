The problem appears to count the number of involutive derangements (permutations of 10 elements with no fixed points and which are involutions, i.e., equal to their own inverse). We enumerate involutions on 10 elements with no fixed points.

```python
from math import comb
print("Enumerating involutive derangements for n=10")

n = 10
# An involution with no fixed points is a fixed-point-free involution,
# which can be represented as a perfect matching of n elements.
# Number of involutive derangements on n elements = number of perfect matchings = (n)!/(2^(n/2)*(n/2)!)

if n % 2 == 0:
    half = n // 2
    numerator = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        numerator *= i
    denominator = (2 ** half)
    for i in range(1, half + 1):
        denominator *= i
    answer = numerator // denominator
    print(f"Number of fixed-point-free involutions of {n} elements is: {answer}")
else:
    print(f"No fixed-point-free involutions possible for odd n={n}")
```
