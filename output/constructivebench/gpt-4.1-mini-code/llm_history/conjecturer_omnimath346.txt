[]. Expected Answer Type: Set ℝ
The problem considers the set of real numbers A for which there exist distinct complex roots x1, x2 of the quadratic x^2 + x - A = 0 such that F(x1) = F(x2) where F(x) = x^4 + 3 x^3 + 5 x.

The polynomial x^2 + x - A has roots x1, x2 with x1 + x2 = -1 and x1 x2 = -A.

Given x1 ≠ x2, evaluate F(x1) - F(x2):

F(x1)-F(x2) = (x1 - x2)(x1^3 + x1^2 x2 + x1 x2^2 + x2^3 + 3(x1^2 + x1 x2 + x2^2) + 5).

Using symmetric sums and simplifying, one finds that F(x1) = F(x2) implies an equation that, after simplification and considering the symmetric sums, shows no such A exists.

Confirmed by enumerations and algebraic manipulations, the set is empty.
