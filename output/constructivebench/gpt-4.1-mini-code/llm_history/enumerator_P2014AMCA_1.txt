The problem involves evaluating and analyzing the expression \( 10 \times \left( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{10} \right)^{-1} \). The program below will compute the exact value and print it, assisting in identifying the answer.

```python
# Enumerate the value of 10 * (1/2 + 1/5 + 1/10)^(-1) exactly and print it.

from fractions import Fraction as F

def main():
    # Define the sum of fractions
    s = F(1,2) + F(1,5) + F(1,10)
    print(f"Sum = {s} = {float(s)}")
    inv = 1 / s  # inverse
    print(f"Inverse = {inv} = {float(inv)}")
    val = 10 * inv
    print(f"Answer = 10 * inverse = {val} = {float(val)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
