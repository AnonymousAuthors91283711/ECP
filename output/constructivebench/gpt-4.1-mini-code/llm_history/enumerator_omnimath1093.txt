The problem is to find all gaps between consecutive 5-digit palindromic numbers. A 5-digit palindrome has the form abcba, with digits a â‰  0.

The program enumerates all 5-digit palindromes, sorts them, computes gaps between consecutive palindromes, prints each gap as found, then prints the minimum and maximum gap with their corresponding palindrome pairs.

```python
# Enumerate 5-digit palindromes and their gaps; print each gap immediately.
def palindromes_5digit():
    # 5-digit palindrome: abcba with a in 1..9, b,c in 0..9
    for a in range(1, 10):
        for b in range(0, 10):
            for c in range(0, 10):
                n = 10000*a + 1000*b + 100*c + 10*b + a
                yield n

def main():
    pals = list(palindromes_5digit())
    pals.sort()
    prev = pals[0]
    gaps = []
    for i in range(1, len(pals)):
        curr = pals[i]
        gap = curr - prev
        print(f"Gap {gap} between {prev} and {curr}")
        gaps.append((gap, prev, curr))
        prev = curr
    min_gap = min(gaps, key=lambda x: x[0])
    max_gap = max(gaps, key=lambda x: x[0])
    print(f"Minimum gap: {min_gap[0]} between {min_gap[1]} and {min_gap[2]}")
    print(f"Maximum gap: {max_gap[0]} between {max_gap[1]} and {max_gap[2]}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
