The problem involves finding the minimal natural number \( n \) such that for every pair of functions \( a, b : \{0, \dots, n-1\} \to \mathbb{Z} \), there is a vector \( x : \{0, \dots, n-1\} \to \mathbb{Z} \) with at least one component coprime to \( m \) satisfying certain modular linear equations. To explore this, we fix some small values of \( m \), and enumerate increasing values of \( n \). For each \( n \), we try to find \( a, b \) functions that fail the condition (or verify all pass), giving conjectures for the minimal \( n \). Due to complexity, we limit the enumeration to small \( m \) and \( n \), and print out candidate \( n \).

    # For all a,b: Fin n -> Z within small ranges
    # Check if exists x: Fin n -> Z with:
    # 1) at least one x[i] coprime to m
    # 2) sum_i a[i]*x[i] ≡ 0 mod m
    # 3) sum_i b[i]*x[i] ≡ 0 mod m
    # We test the existential condition by brute force over small x's in range [-m,m]
    # If for any a,b no such x exists, condition fails for this n
    R = range(-m,m+1)
    for a in product(range(-1,2), repeat=n):
        for b in product(range(-1,2), repeat=n):
            if all(ai==0 for ai in a) and all(bi==0 for bi in b):
                # trivial a,b=0,0 always satisfied with x=0
                continue

                return False
