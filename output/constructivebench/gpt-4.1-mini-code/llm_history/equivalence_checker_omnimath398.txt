Ground Truth Answer: sorry
Proposed Answer: (2001 * (2001 + 1) / 2) ^ 2
<<<True>>>

The proposed answer is equivalent to the ground truth answer because it correctly applies the formula for the sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers, which is known to be (n(n+1)/2)^2. Here, n=2001, so the formula becomes (2001*2002/2)^2, which matches the proposed answer. This is a well-known mathematical identity.
