abbrev omnimath3638_answer : ℕ → ℚ := sorry
theorem omnimath3638 (n : ℕ) :
  ∑ k in Finset.range (n + 1), (10^k - 1)/9 = omnimath3638_answer n := by sorry
Ground Truth Answer: fun n => (10^(n+1) - 10 - 9 * n) / 81
Proposed Answer: fun n : ℕ => if n = 0 then 0 else ((10 ^ n - 10) / 81 : ℚ)
Let me analyze the two answers:

1. Ground Truth: (10^(n+1) - 10 - 9 * n) / 81
2. Proposed: if n = 0 then 0 else ((10^n - 10)/81 : ℚ)

Let's test them for n=0:
- Ground Truth: (10^1 - 10 - 0)/81 = 0
- Proposed: 0 (from if clause)

For n=1:
- Ground Truth: (100 - 10 - 9)/81 = 81/81 = 1
- Proposed: (10 - 10)/81 = 0

The answers differ at n=1, and in fact for all n>0:
- Ground Truth for n: (10^(n+1) - 10 - 9n)/81
- Proposed for n>0: (10^n - 10)/81

These are clearly different expressions. The proposed answer is missing both the 10^(n+1) term (it has 10^n instead) and the -9n term.
