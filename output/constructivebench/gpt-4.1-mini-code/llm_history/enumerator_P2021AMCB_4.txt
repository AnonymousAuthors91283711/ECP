The problem is from a math contest (American Mathematics Competitions problem 4 from 2021 AIME I). It is given as a rational number expression: (3 * 84 + 4 * 70) / 7. The goal is to enumerate plausible answer values or verify the simplified exact value. Since the problem is straightforward arithmetic, we can compute the numerator (3*84 + 4*70), then divide by 7 and print the exact rational value.

```python
# Enumerate the exact rational value of (3*84 + 4*70)/7
from fractions import Fraction

def enumerate_fraction():
    numerator = 3 * 84 + 4 * 70
    denominator = 7
    frac = Fraction(numerator, denominator)
    print(f"Fraction numerator={frac.numerator}, denominator={frac.denominator}")
    print(f"Exact value = {frac} = {float(frac):.6f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    enumerate_fraction()
```
