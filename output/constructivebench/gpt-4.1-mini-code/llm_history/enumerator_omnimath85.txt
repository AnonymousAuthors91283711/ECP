The problem is to find the greatest size (cardinality) of a nonempty subset \( S \subseteq \{1, 2, \ldots, 108\} \) such that:

1. For every pair \(a,b \in S\), there exists \(c \in S\) with \(\gcd(a,c) = \gcd(b,c) = 1\).
2. For every pair \(a,b \in S\), there exists \(c' \in S,\ c' \neq a,b\) with \(\gcd(a,c') > 1\) and \(\gcd(b,c') > 1\).

We want to enumerate subsets \( S \) of \(\{1,\ldots,108\}\) meeting these conditions, prioritize larger sizes, and print found sizes immediately.

Since enumerating all subsets of size up to 108 is infeasible, I'll pick smaller testing parameters and then print candidates with increasing sizes to conjecture the maximum size.

This program enumerates candidates in smaller intervals like \(\{1,\ldots,20\}\) to identify largest sets. It checks the conditions and prints the sizes and example sets found.

```python
# We try small ranges to guess max size. Checking all subsets is expensive.
# Instead, we try incremental construction and print found sizes & sets.

from math import gcd
from itertools import combinations

def check_conditions(S):
    # Condition 1: For every a,b in S, ∃ c in S with gcd(a,c)=gcd(b,c)=1
    for a,b in combinations(S,2):
        if not any(gcd(a,c)==1 and gcd(b,c)==1 for c in S):
            return False
    # Condition 2: For every a,b in S, ∃ c' in S, c' != a,b with gcd(a,c')>1 and gcd(b,c')>1
    for a,b in combinations(S,2):
        if not any(c!=a and c!=b and gcd(a,c)>1 and gcd(b,c)>1 for c in S):
            return False
    return True

def main():
    max_n = 20  # smaller testing range from 1 to 20
    from time import time
    found_sizes = set()

    # For efficiency, test from largest sizes down to smaller sizes
    for size in range(max_n,0,-1):
        # To not produce too much output, limit to first 3 sets per size found
        count = 0
        for subset in combinations(range(1,max_n+1),size):
            S = set(subset)
            if check_conditions(S):
                print(f"Found set of size {size}: {sorted(S)}")
                found_sizes.add(size)
                count += 1
                if count >= 3:
                    break
        if count > 0:
            # After finding some sets for this size, no need to try smaller sizes here
            # (since smaller subsets are trivial and count would be smaller)
            # But let's continue to find all candidates for conjecturing
            continue

    if found_sizes:
        max_size = max(found_sizes)
        print(f"Maximum size found in range 1..{max_n} is: {max_size}")
    else:
        print(f"No sets satisfy the conditions in range 1..{max_n}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
