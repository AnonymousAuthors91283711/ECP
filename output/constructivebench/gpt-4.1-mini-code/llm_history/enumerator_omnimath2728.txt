The problem is to find how many integers \( a \) in the interval \([1,10]\) satisfy that \(5\) divides \(a^{2014} + a^{2015}\). Since the domain and exponent are fixed, we can check all \(a \in \{1, \ldots, 10\}\) and print those valid.

Key points:
- Check divisibility by 5 of \(a^{2014} + a^{2015} = a^{2014}(1 + a)\).
- If \(5 \mid a\), the expression is divisible by 5.
- Otherwise check if \(1 + a \equiv 0 \pmod{5}\).
- Enumerate all \(a\) from 1 to 10 and print each that satisfies the divisibility.
- Finally, print the count of such \(a\).

We'll use Python's pow with mod for efficiency.

```python
# Enumerate all a in [1..10] such that 5 divides a^2014 + a^2015

def main():
    count = 0
    mod = 5
    exp = 2014
    
    print("Checking a in [1..10]:")
    for a in range(1, 11):
        # Compute a^2014 mod 5
        a_exp = pow(a, exp, mod)
        val = (a_exp + (a_exp * a) % mod) % mod  # a^{2014} + a^{2015}
        if val == 0:
            print(f"a = {a}")
            count += 1
    print(f"Number of such a: {count}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
