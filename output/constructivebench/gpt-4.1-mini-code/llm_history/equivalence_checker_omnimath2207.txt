theorem omnimath2207 (n : ℕ) (hn : 1 ≤ n) :

Ground Truth Answer: fun n => choose (2 * n + 1) n
Proposed Answer: fun n => Nat.choose (2 * (n - 1)) (n - 1)
Let's analyze the problem and the answers:

1. The problem is about counting strictly decreasing functions from Fin n to Fin n under certain constraints.

2. The ground truth answer is the central binomial coefficient C(2n+1, n).

3. The proposed answer is C(2(n-1), n-1), which is equivalent to C(2n-2, n-1).

These are clearly different functions:
- For n=1: 
  - Ground truth: C(3,1) = 3
  - Proposed: C(0,0) = 1
- For n=2:
  - Ground truth: C(5,2) = 10
  - Proposed: C(2,1) = 2

The answers disagree for all n ≥ 1, and the proposed answer doesn't match the combinatorial interpretation of the problem.
