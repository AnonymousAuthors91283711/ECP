The problem involves real numbers \(a, b\) satisfying the system:
\[
20 = 4a^2 + 9b^2, \quad 20 + 12ab = (2a + 3b)^2.
\]
We want to find the possible values of \(a \cdot b\).

From the second equation: \(20 + 12ab = (2a+3b)^2 = 4a^2 + 12ab + 9b^2\).  
Rearranging:
\[
20 + 12ab = 4a^2 + 12ab + 9b^2 \implies 20 = 4a^2 + 9b^2,
\]
which is the same as the first equation, so the two are consistent and actually imply the same condition. Hence the second equation doesn't impose an additional constraint but confirms the first.

We will enumerate pairs \((a,b)\) such that \(4a^2 + 9b^2 = 20\). We'll limit to rational approximations by iterating over \(a\) and checking \(b\). For each \((a,b)\), we verify the second equation and print the product \(a \cdot b\).

```python
import math

# Enumerate (a,b) with a,b in rational steps, satisfying:
# 4a^2 + 9b^2 = 20 
# and 20 + 12ab = (2a + 3b)^2 (should be equivalent)
# Print ab when both hold

step = 0.1
threshold = 1e-9

print("Enumerating possible pairs (a,b) with 4a^2+9b^2=20...")

a_values = [x * step for x in range(-15, 16)]  # a in [-1.5,1.5]

found_products = set()

for a in a_values:
    val = 20 - 4 * a * a
    if val < 0:
        continue
    b_pos = math.sqrt(val / 9)
    for b_candidate in (b_pos, -b_pos):
        lhs = 20 + 12 * a * b_candidate
        rhs = (2 * a + 3 * b_candidate) ** 2
        if abs(lhs - rhs) < threshold:
            prod = a * b_candidate
            if not any(abs(prod - p) < threshold for p in found_products):
                found_products.add(prod)
                print(f"a={a:.3f}, b={b_candidate:.3f}, a*b={prod:.6f}")
```

This program will list candidate products \(a b\) under the given constraints.
