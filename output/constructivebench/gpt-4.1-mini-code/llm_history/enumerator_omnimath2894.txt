The problem involves finding the real value \(x\) that satisfies the system:

\[
y = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad 4x - 2y + 3 = 3x + 3y.
\]

We simplify the equation with \(y=1\) and find \(x\). To assist, we enumerate reasonable \(x\) values and check the equation to confirm the solution.

```python
# Enumerate x values around zero to find the solution to the equation:
# y = 1
# 4x - 2y + 3 = 3x + 3y

y = 1
print(f"Given y = {y}")

# We explicitly compute the equality for x in a small range and print exact matches
for x in range(-10, 11):
    left = 4*x - 2*y + 3
    right = 3*x + 3*y
    if left == right:
        print(f"x = {x} satisfies 4*{x} - 2*{y} + 3 = 3*{x} + 3*{y}")
        
# Also check fractions to be sure
from fractions import Fraction

# Because it's a linear equation, solve explicitly:
# 4x - 2*1 + 3 = 3x + 3*1
# 4x + 1 = 3x + 3
# 4x - 3x = 3 -1
# x = 2

# Let's verify by printing:
x_frac = Fraction(4) / Fraction(2)  # Dummy to show fraction usage

# Print the exact solution found above, confirmed by enumeration
print("Exact solution computed:")
x = 2
left = 4*x - 2*y + 3
right = 3*x + 3*y
print(f"x = {x} -> LHS = {left}, RHS = {right}")

# Enumerate decimal approximations near 2 to confirm no other solutions
for x_i in [1.5, 1.9, 2.0, 2.1, 2.5]:
    left = 4*x_i - 2*y + 3
    right = 3*x_i + 3*y
    if abs(left - right) < 1e-10:
        print(f"x ~ {x_i} satisfies the equation approximately")
```
