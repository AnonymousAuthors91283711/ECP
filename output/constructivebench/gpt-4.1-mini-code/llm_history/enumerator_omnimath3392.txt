To explore the value of the product \((1 - \frac{1}{3})(1 - \frac{1}{4})(1 - \frac{1}{5})\), we enumerate its exact value and partial products using rational arithmetic.

```python
from fractions import Fraction

# Define denominators for the product terms
denominators = [3, 4, 5]

prod = Fraction(1, 1)
print("Partial products:")

for d in denominators:
    term = Fraction(d - 1, d)
    prod *= term
    print(f"(1 - 1/{d}) = {term}  => partial product = {prod}")

print("\nExact product as a fraction:", prod)
print("Approximate product:", float(prod))
```
