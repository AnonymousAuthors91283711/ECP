The problem looks at integers \( b \) with \( 0 \leq b \leq 5 \) such that for some natural number \( m \),
\[ 50(5-b) + 75b = 100m. \]
This simplifies to checking which \( b \) values make
\[ 250 - 50b + 75b = 250 + 25b \]
divisible by 100. We'll enumerate \( b = 0,\ldots,5 \) and find those with \( 250 + 25b \equiv 0 \pmod{100} \).

```python
# Enumerate b in 0 to 5 and print sums divisible by 100 of the form 250+25b
for b in range(6):
    total = 50*(5 - b) + 75*b  # simplifies to 250 + 25b
    if total % 100 == 0:
        print(f"b={b}, total={total}")
```
