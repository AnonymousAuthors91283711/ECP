theorem olympiadbench2778 :

Ground Truth Answer: 1
Proposed Answer: (7 + 1 - 7) % 10
Let's analyze the problem and the proposed answer:

1. The problem asks for the last digit (mod 10) of the expression (23^2023 + 23^20 - 23^23).

2. To find the last digit, we can find each term modulo 10:
   - 23 mod 10 = 3, so we can work with powers of 3
   - The cycle of last digits for powers of 3 repeats every 4: 3, 9, 7, 1
   - 23^2023 mod 10 = 3^(2023 mod 4) = 3^3 = 7 (since 2023 mod 4 = 3)
   - 23^20 mod 10 = 3^(20 mod 4) = 3^0 = 1 (since 20 mod 4 = 0)
   - 23^23 mod 10 = 3^(23 mod 4) = 3^3 = 7 (since 23 mod 4 = 3)

3. The expression becomes (7 + 1 - 7) mod 10 = 1 mod 10 = 1

4. The proposed answer shows exactly this calculation: (7 + 1 - 7) % 10

The proposed answer correctly shows the intermediate steps that lead to the ground truth answer of 1. While it doesn't explicitly state the final answer, the calculation clearly results in 1.
