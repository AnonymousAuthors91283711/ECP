Theoretical combined mean (weighted average): 24.000000. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The problem involves two sequences \(x_s\) and \(y_s\) of lengths 20 and 30, with given means 30 and 20 respectively. The combined mean is the weighted average:

\[
\frac{20 \times 30 + 30 \times 20}{20 + 30} = \frac{600 + 600}{50} = 24.
\]

In Lean, division over real numbers requires `noncomputable` since Pi uses the `Real.instDivInvMonoid` which is noncomputable. We can mark the abbreviation as `noncomputable` so Lean will accept it.

Hence, the fixed answer is:

Theoretical combined mean (weighted average): 24.000000. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
Explanation:
The problem states the average of xs over 20 elements is 30, so ∑ xs = 20*30 = 600.
The average of ys over 30 elements is 20, so ∑ ys = 30*20 = 600.
Therefore, the sum ∑ xs + ∑ ys = 600 + 600 = 1200.
The combined mean over 50 elements is 1200 / 50 = 24.
This matches the enumerated answer and the theoretical weighted average.

The original error was including the keyword `noncomputable abbrev` which is syntactically invalid. Just use `abbrev` without `noncomputable` since the constant is just a rational number (Lean will coerce the numeral to `ℝ`).

Theoretical combined mean (weighted average): 24.000000. Expected Answer Type: ℝ
The problem gives two sequences xs and ys with fixed lengths 20 and 30, and means of 30 and 20 respectively. It asks for the combined mean of the concatenated sequence of length 50. The combined mean is the weighted average:

(20 * 30 + 30 * 20) / 50 = (600 + 600) / 50 = 1200 / 50 = 24

The issue in Lean is that the division with the literal numeral form `(600 + 600) / 50` relies on real division which involves typeclass inference and lacks computability unless marked `noncomputable`.

To fix this and make it compile nicely, the answer can be written using `1200 / 50` with floats or decimals, or better using the `(1200 : ℝ) / 50`, marking `noncomputable` if needed. Alternatively, we can provide the decimal value directly as `24` with the type `ℝ`.

Since 24 is exactly the value, writing

`(24 : ℝ)`

is concise and compiles without problems.

Therefore, the correct Lean expression is simply `24`.
