The problem involves two power series defined as infinite sums:

- fouryseries(x) = ∑ 4 * x^n
- fourierseries(x) = ∑ 4 * 10^n * x^n

The theorem states fourierseries(x) = 4 * fouryseries(x) if and only if x equals some special number omnimath2503_answer.

We want to enumerate some candidate values x > 0 and x < 0.1 and check for which values fourierseries(x) equals 4 * fouryseries(x).

Since both series are geometric series, let's compute their finite partial sums for various x in (0, 0.1) to approximate the equality. We'll enumerate some rational or simple decimal values and print candidates where the difference is small, also print exact results if any.

```python
# Enumerate x in (0, 0.1) and evaluate power series partial sums to find where
# fourierseries(x) = 4 * fouryseries(x).
# Here,
# fouryseries(x) = sum_{n=0}^∞ 4 * x^n = 4/(1 - x) for |x|<1
# fourierseries(x) = sum_{n=0}^∞ 4 * 10^n * x^n = 4 / (1 - 10x) for |10x|<1
# The equality is 4/(1 - 10x) = 4 * (4/(1-x)) => 1/(1 - 10x) = 4/(1-x)
# Solve: (1 - x) = 4(1 - 10x) => 1 - x = 4 - 40x => 39x = 3 => x = 3/39 = 1/13 ≈ 0.0769230769

# We'll enumerate x to see this value approximately printed

    return sum(4 * x**n for n in range(terms))

                fy = fouryseries_partial(x)
                fs = fourierseries_partial(x)
                val = 4 * fy
                diff = abs(fs - val)
                if diff < 1e-6:
                    print(f"x={x:.9f} fourierseries(x)={fs:.9f} 4*fouryseries(x)={val:.9f} diff={diff:.2e}")
