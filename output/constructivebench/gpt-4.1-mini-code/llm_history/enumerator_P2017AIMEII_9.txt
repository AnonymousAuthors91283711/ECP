The problem asks for the fraction p/q where p is the number of "good_hands" and q is the number of "valid_hands" from a 7x7 card deck with certain covering properties, and also the sum of numerator and denominator in lowest terms. To foster conjectures, we'll enumerate valid_hands and good_hands for smaller parameters (like 3x3 or 4x4) to see corresponding ratios. This can guide patterns toward the actual 7x7 problem.

We enumerate all 8-subsets for 3x3 deck (colors = numbers = 3) and check validity and goodness conditions, printing results as fractions and reduced forms.

```python
from itertools import combinations
from math import gcd
from collections import Counter

def covers_all_colors_numbers(hand, colors, numbers):
    hand_colors = set(c for c, n in hand)
    hand_numbers = set(n for c, n in hand)
    return hand_colors == colors and hand_numbers == numbers

def is_good(hand, colors, numbers):
    for x in hand:
        hand_prime = hand - {x}
        if covers_all_colors_numbers(hand_prime, colors, numbers):
            return True
    return False

def reduce_fraction(p, q):
    g = gcd(p, q)
    return p//g, q//g

def enumerate_ratio(k):  # k=3 or 4 maximal due to combinatorial growth
    colors = set(range(k))
    numbers = set(range(k))
    deck = {(c, n) for c in colors for n in numbers}
    hand_size = 2*k - 1  # For 7, it's 8; test smaller k accordingly
    valid_hands_count = 0
    good_hands_count = 0

    # Enumerate all subsets of size hand_size
    for comb in combinations(deck, hand_size):
        hand = set(comb)
        if covers_all_colors_numbers(hand, colors, numbers):
            valid_hands_count += 1
            if is_good(hand, colors, numbers):
                good_hands_count += 1
    if valid_hands_count == 0:
        return
    p, q = good_hands_count, valid_hands_count
    p_red, q_red = reduce_fraction(p, q)
    print(f"k={k}: p={p}, q={q}, p/q={p}/{q} â‰ˆ {p/q:.5f}, reduced={p_red}/{q_red}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Enumerate for k=3 and k=4 only to keep output manageable
    enumerate_ratio(3)
    enumerate_ratio(4)
```
