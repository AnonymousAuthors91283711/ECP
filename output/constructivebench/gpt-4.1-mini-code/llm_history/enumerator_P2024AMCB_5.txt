The problem is about finding the least cardinality \(k\) of a subset of a 2024-element set such that the sum of \(\pm 1\) assigned to each element (with -1 for elements in the subset and +1 otherwise) is negative. Equivalently, the sum is:

\[
\sum_{i=1}^{2024} (\text{if } i \in S \text{ then } -1 \text{ else } +1) = 2024 - 2|S|
\]

We want the smallest \(k = |S|\) such that this sum is negative:

\[
2024 - 2k < 0 \implies k > 1012
\]

The smallest such integer \(k\) is 1013. The program will enumerate all possible \(k\) and print them when the expression is negative.

Since enumerating all subsets is impossible due to size, we only enumerate \(k\) from 0 to 2024 and compute the sum directly.

```python
# Enumerate set sizes k for the problem.
# For each k, compute sum = 2024 - 2*k and print if sum < 0.
# Finally, print the minimal such k.

def main():
    n = 2024
    candidates = []
    for k in range(n + 1):
        sum_expr = n - 2 * k
        if sum_expr < 0:
            print(f"k={k}: sum={sum_expr} < 0")
            candidates.append(k)
    if candidates:
        minimal_k = min(candidates)
        print(f"Minimal k with negative sum: {minimal_k}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
