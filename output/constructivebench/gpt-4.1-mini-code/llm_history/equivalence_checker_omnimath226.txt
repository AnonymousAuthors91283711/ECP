Ground Truth Answer: fun x => 1 / x^2
Proposed Answer: fun x : ℚ => 1 / (x * x)
<<<True>>>
The proposed answer `fun x : ℚ => 1 / (x * x)` is equivalent to the ground truth answer `fun x => 1 / x^2` because `x * x` is mathematically the same as `x^2`. Both expressions represent the reciprocal of the square of x. The notation difference doesn't affect the mathematical meaning.
