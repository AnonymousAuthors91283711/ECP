[write_program]
The problem seems related to a traffic signal cycle with a repeating pattern and durations for green, yellow, and red lights. We want to analyze the ratio of change intervals to the entire cycle length. Let me write a Python program to enumerate and verify specific configurations of the cycle, the change intervals, and their ratios. We'll try some variations around the given values (30 and 3 seconds) to see the resulting ratio values.

```python
# Enumerate traffic signal cycles and change intervals, printing their ratio.
# cycle = green + yellow + red; change_intervals are yellow+red transitions durations.
# Given sample: green=30, yellow=3, red=30, change_intervals=3+3

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

# Test ranges: green and red from 20 to 40 seconds, yellow fixed around 3, change intervals as sums of yellows
for green in range(28, 33):  # around 30
    for yellow in range(2, 5):  # around 3
        for red in range(28, 33):  # around 30
            cycle = green + yellow + red
            # change intervals sum: yellow at end of green + yellow at end of red; here simplified as 3+3 fixed
            # or try change_intervals = 2*yellow for variation
            change_intervals = 2 * yellow
            # Reduce ratio to simplest form
            numerator = change_intervals
            denominator = cycle
            g = gcd(numerator, denominator)
            numerator //= g
            denominator //= g
            ratio_str = f"{numerator}/{denominator}" if denominator != 1 else f"{numerator}"
            print(f"green={green}, yellow={yellow}, red={red}, change_intervals={change_intervals}, cycle={cycle}, ratio={ratio_str}")

# Output the given answer from the problem for clarity
green, yellow, red = 30, 3, 30
change_intervals = 3 + 3
cycle = green + yellow + red
g = gcd(change_intervals, cycle)
numerator = change_intervals // g
denominator = cycle // g
answer = numerator/denominator
print(f"Given problem cycle: {cycle}, change_intervals: {change_intervals}, ratio (simplified): {numerator}/{denominator} â‰ˆ {answer}")
```
